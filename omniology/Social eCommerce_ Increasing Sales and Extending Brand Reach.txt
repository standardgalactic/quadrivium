Want to make money online? Then ignore social media at your own risk. 
Social media is vital if you want your business to thrive, and though you 
can’t control the conversations, you can influence them. This book will 
teach you how.
If mismanaged, social media can create more noise than signal. It can be 
a time and energy suck—for you and your audience. Or worse still, it can 
become an echo chamber for negative PR.
If done well, guerrilla social media marketing can help you persuade, 
command attention, establish dialogue, differentiate yourself, capture new 
markets, and outmaneuver the competition—all on a shoestring budget. 
Whether you’re selling digital goods and services, physical goods, or local 
services, this book has the answers.
■
■Strategize and optimize your social presence in ways you didn’t 
know were possible
■
■Drive more clicks and sales with better-performing Facebook ads
■
■Develop remarkable content with viral potential
■
■Manage your online reputation, instead of letting it manage you
■
■Integrate social media into your SEO strategy, and vice versa
■
■Leverage online influencers to promote your brand, and 
become an influencer yourself

planned event drove massive traffic and significantly boosted my audience.
I consider myself a serial entrepreneur. I’ve built many companies over the last decade,
three of which I have sold, and currently am CEO of ShoeMoney Media Group and The
PAR Program, Inc. In January of 2013, I wrote my own book titled Nothing’s Changed
But My Change—The ShoeMoney Story, which has sold hundreds of thousands of copies
to date. But what I am probably most known for is my ShoeMoney.com blog, which
reaches millions of people per month.
But in the beginning, I admit to you that I was very ignorant of social media, which is
really ironic, since it has become such a pivotal part of my brand building and ecom‐
merce strategy. When I started working with Stephan, he already had a thriving search
engine optimization (SEO) business. This was the 2000s, when SEO was still in its early
phases. My brand was in need of a refresh. Stephan suggested an idea that I still consider
innovative. He proposed having a contest to design my new business card. In turn, the
contest would be sponsored by his client, Overnight Prints. The winning designer would
win a lifetime supply of business cards, but more importantly, exposure on a highly read
blog.
We launched the contest, and it immediately took off like a rocket. I had a solid following
at the time, so between those readers, interest from followers of Overnight Prints, and
various designers who had heard about the contest through social media, hundreds of
designs flooded in.
xix

Social media played a pivotal role in the promotion of the contest and in designers asking
for votes from their networks, friends, and family. The contest was structured such that
designs with enough votes went on to become finalists, and from there I would pick the
winner.
One of my crowning achievements as an online entrepreneur was when I was named
“The Most Influential Person on the Internet” by Fast Company Magazine in 2010. It
was based on online voting from 1.63 million individuals. More on that in Fast Com‐
pany.
However, I didn’t become an overnight success. Many years of hard work got me to the
position where I could influence so many people online. Social media may not be directly
relatable to the bottom line, but make no mistake, social media drives business value as
a vehicle for influence. Nowadays, it is an essential ingredient to building a brand. Not
only did Overnight Prints go from nowhere to position two for the keyword “business
cards” in Google and a boost in business, but the positive exposure they received from
the contest cannot be easily quantified in terms of sales or conversions. Instead, it is a
priceless strategy move that has the possibility of taking a business into the future. Doing
one specific action for search engine optimization or social media marketing will not
bring success. But with a creative strategy over time, you will find profit. Especially when
you find ways to do it with minimal overhead. In the contest, Overnight Prints only had
to provide business cards to the winner, a deal that for a printing company, was a minimal
cost.
Soon after the partnership and contest, I signed up with ad.ly, a social media company
that partners big businesses with high-profile social media users. I had already garnered
100,000 Twitter followers, so I started receiving offers from very large brands, includ‐
ing Kmart, Walmart, and Universal Studios. I couldn’t believe these companies were
offering me thousands of dollars per tweet, but the value must have been there for them
or they wouldn’t have done it.
It was only once I launched my own ecommerce products that I truly understood the
value that social media brings to ecommerce—when done right. What I love most about
this book is the authors not only peel back the curtain into their methodology, but also
give you a step-by-step plan and strategy to ensure social media success for your com‐
pany.

Foreword

Preface
We’ve taught a lot of people how to be more successful on the Web. The definitions of
“the Web” and “success” have changed a lot over the years, but many of the low-level
principles and theories remain the same. We dreamed up this book as a way to com‐
municate those concepts to our friends, colleagues, and clients (current and future).
Our goal was to create the definitive guide to selling things on social media. In support
of that, we agreed to take a radical, personalized approach.
One strategy does not fit all businesses. If you’re trying to establish a successful social
media presence for your local restaurant, you’re going to use different tactics than Coca-
Cola uses for its worldwide branding efforts. Or if you’re really good at restaurant mar‐
keting but now want to get into selling ebooks or custom guitars, you’ll find that a lot
of your “guaranteed” tactics no longer work in a different context. Some of them even
seem to make things worse for you. We understand that perfectly!
In order for a strategy to be effective, it must have three components: intention, context,
and tactics. Most books on this subject assume the intention, give a broad context (“Sell
ALL the things!”), and concentrate on good tactics. Sun Tzu said in The Art of War that
tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat; this applies equally in war and ecom‐
merce. There are a lot of tactics in this book, but they are presented with a context in
mind. The idea is to form or modify a marketing strategy that includes (or concentrates
on, depending on your situation) social media. We accomplish this by being outcome-
focused instead of activity-focused. Instead of checking off activities from a list, you
work toward objectives that lead to a goal, such as “Increase event ticket sales by 25%
from social media sources.” If you accomplish the goal early, then there’s no need to
continue with the to-do list. Instead, you can focus on a new goal.
The Web is constantly evolving to be more dynamic. Lately, that means being more
social—that is, having more interactive elements and offering more ways to share and
connect with other people. As a result, old ecommerce tactics must similarly evolve if
you expect your online business to survive in the social era. Traditionally, if you were
in the ecommerce business, you bought pay-per-click (CPC, or cost per click) or pay-
xxi

per-view (CPM, or cost per mille) ads on a big advertising network like Google Ad‐
Words, DoubleClick, or some other advertising network. Then you’d optimize your site
for search engine traffic (SEO) so that you can get more visitors for free over time. These
tactics are still valid and important, but over time they have gotten more expensive,
more complex, and, in some cases, less effective, and they don’t represent a compre‐
hensive strategy.
When you market your online business through social media, you reach people at a
time and place when they aren’t expecting it. You’re selling in context. Your customers
have their guard down. They’re not looking for something to buy right now, they’re
enjoying what their friends, family, and colleagues are doing. That’s precisely why social
ecommerce is so effective, but it’s also why you need to be wise in how you go about it.
It’s easy to take a few shortcuts. Then you run the risk of being seen as a ruthless, self-
interested marketer who only cares about sales. If this is how you’re perceived, you’ll at
best have wasted your time, and at worst you’ll have destroyed your reputation.
Social media represents a much more intimate connection between businesses (or
brands) and customers. When you follow a brand page on Facebook, you may be the
first to know about a new product, or get a special discount, or connect to other people
who like this brand and share stories or advice. Before social media, this kind of inter‐
action was impossible on anything other than a hyperlocal scale, and rarely happened
outside of conferences, conventions, and international launch events for big companies.
So it’s big, it’s important, it’s powerful…and it’s cheap! That is, if you have some time to
spend building your social media presence. Even if you have to pay someone to do it
for you, it’s probably still less expensive than traditional advertising. There are still old-
school CPC and CPM advertising behemoths out there that demand a five-figure min‐
imum upfront investment with no guarantee of conversion rate or sales numbers. Such
anxiety! You’ve no idea if that will be successful for you. With a good social media
strategy, you can reach a lot of people, but more importantly you can more easily reach
people who are more likely to either buy or help spread the word, and you don’t need
to write a check at the start. Or even at the finish, though there really isn’t a finish,
because—as you will learn in this book—social media is a long-term strategy that re‐
quires vigilance and maintenance. It isn’t hard work (it can even be fun!), and it can be
outsourced to qualified professionals, firms, or even other people at your company.
After all, in this day and age, everyone is familiar with at least one social media network
from a personal perspective.
Social Media Defined
When you think of “social media,” what comes to mind? Facebook? Discussion forums?
There are a lot of sites that describe themselves as a social network or social media site,
and some attempt to use cute marketing terms to describe themselves as something
beyond that. This is the definition of social media that we are using in this book:
xxii 
| 
Preface

Any site or online service that, as an integral part of its functionality, allows and encour‐
ages social interaction such as commenting, voting, discussion, and sharing/bookmark‐
ing.
With that in mind, you may find that social media is a broader topic than you realized.
By our definition, YouTube, Yelp, Craigslist, and StumbleUpon are social media. That
doesn’t mean that you can use the same tactics across all social media sites and get the
same results. Each site or network has its own rules of engagement, barriers to entry,
and level of commitment required for users to achieve results.
Social Media Myths
There are plenty of rumors about social media that sabotage people’s marketing efforts
before they even begin. Before you write off social media as ineffective or a silly fad,
check your assumptions against this list:
Most people still make purchasing decisions through offline word-of-mouth.
Actually, this is true, but that doesn’t mean that social media isn’t a part of the
conversation. One of the problems with calculating social media’s return on invest‐
ment (ROI) is that something further down the chain of communication gets the
credit for the sale. People hear about something online—usually through social
media—and then go and discuss it with family and friends offline. Social media
starts the conversation that leads to the sale.
My product isn’t exciting enough to get new customers on Facebook or Twitter.
Something must make your product successful, right? There must be something
extraordinary about what you’re selling; otherwise, no one would buy it. The com‐
petition would have obliterated you before you even got off the ground. Your brand
must be remarkable before it can be successfully shared online. It doesn’t have to
be the best, or the most unique; there just has to be something about it worth talking
about. Most of the people who have failed in social media marketing skip the “re‐
markable” step. They want to sell their product, so they set up an ad campaign on
Facebook, it doesn’t work, and they give up. What they should be doing instead is
asking what makes their product remarkable, then focusing on spreading the word
about these unique qualities through an ad campaign. Social eCommerce will show
you how to do that.
Social media is for teenagers and geeks.
If I put up a social media page for my company, our customers will think we aren’t
serious. It’s almost certain that all of your customers are on some kind of social
network—Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google+. How would interacting
with them and sharing things with them on these sites reduce your credibility? In
2013, according to the Pew Research Center, some 73% of online adults were using
a social networking site of some kind, and that percentage increases each year. Look
at the businesses running the biggest social networks. Do you think that Google
Preface 
| 
xxiii

isn’t a serious company? A more valid concern would be appearing to be out of
touch with modern technology because you aren’t on social media.
If I put up a Facebook page or Twitter account, Internet trolls will attack me. Upset
customers will completely destroy us with untrue public comments.
This is why it is important to be present, to control the conversation from the very
beginning. When you have an established social media presence, you have your
finger on the pulse. Getting into social media will not enable people to say anything
that they can’t already. Anyone can get on Twitter and flame you, whether you have
a presence there or not. If you don’t have a Facebook page for your business, some‐
one else can create one and cause plenty of damage. Isn’t it better to be in control
of your presence on social networks, rather than let other people lead the conver‐
sation about your company and products?
All right, so Facebook is huge. Twitter is huge. So were Friendster and MySpace. I’d
rather wait until the next big thing starts, and get in on it early.
Getting in early is overrated. Getting in today is what is most important for you and
your customers. Yes, it’s possible that something will come along and eclipse Face‐
book, Twitter, and other major sites. However, the industry has learned from the
failures of its predecessors, and there is a lot more money and corporate structure
behind today’s social networks. The fact of the matter is that today’s big sites are,
well, big today. You can capitalize on them today. Why would you wait to make
more money when you can do it now with no penalty?
To do this right, I have to outsource it.
It depends on your skill set and the amount of time you have to dedicate to social
media, but there is no good reason why you can’t cover at least the basics in-house.
If you have several employees, they can all help in some way, under the guidance
of a good social media policy. This work requires knowledge (this book!), time, and
dedication. If your company is large, consider hiring an expert to help you create
your initial strategy, and then your internal team can take over once the strategy is
in place. Outsourcing is certainly an option, but it’s not a requirement by any means.
I don’t have time for social media.
After you’ve established your social media presence (which does require some up‐
front time and effort), it takes only a small amount of time to maintain it. Once the
framework is in place, and you have a content plan, you just have to ensure you’re
posting new content, replying to customers, and being sociable. A tweet here, a
Facebook post there, a blog post about your new product features to link from all
of your social media sites. If you don’t even have a few minutes a day to spare, then
this is something that an employee could easily do, or you can outsource it to a
qualified professional.

Preface

I’ve already set up a Facebook page for my business, so I’m “done.”
Your social media efforts are “done” like your kitchen is “clean.” If it’s ever true, it
certainly doesn’t stay that way for long. Your website is never “done”; it should always
be evolving to meet current needs and support current methods and technologies.
Likewise, your social media presence is a continuous process of engagement, im‐
provement, and growth.
I attended a seminar that told me all the secret tricks for social media, so I’ve got this
handled.
Perhaps so…or perhaps not. Some or all of that advice may have been good, but
again we say that tactics are not the whole solution. You might have heard or seen
surefire tactics that work for businesses completely unrelated to yours, or for com‐
panies that have a vastly higher budget and dedicated staff, or are in an entirely
different market. Context is everything; we’ve gone to a lot of effort in this book to
keep you in the context that applies to you. Has anyone ever given you “secret tricks”
for parenting, weight loss, or financial investment? Did those isolated tactics solve
all of your problems? Finally, be aware that even the “secret” tricks and tactics for
social media that work today will not, most likely, work tomorrow. Lots of “tricks”
intended to game the system on Facebook get squashed when Facebook tweaks its
algorithm regarding what gets visibility.
The Three Categories of eCommerce
Social media and ecommerce are both broad categories that span many industries. The
typical approach is to concentrate on individual tactics and give broad advice that isn’t
specific to any market, industry, or strategy. We’ve decided to take it in a different di‐
rection. Wherever possible, we have provided specific advice that applies directly to
your situation.
Basically, there are three categories for all ecommerce business:
• You’re selling something locally, like a sole-proprietor shop, law office, or restaurant.
• You’re selling something physical or digital that requires some kind of fulfillment,
with wide distribution.
• You’re selling something one-off, like an event, convention, or course.
In the first two categories, you need a long-term community to have real success. How‐
ever, there are a lot of things that you do only once, like a coaching course, seminar,
class, concert, or holiday event. In these instances, you don’t necessarily need a long-
term community, you just need to establish your authority in the field.
If you put all businesses into one of these categories, you can easily form a successful
strategy composed of tactics that will actually work. However, at the core, there are
Preface 
| 
xxv

certain things that you’re going to do on all of the social networks in which you partic‐
ipate. If you decide to create a YouTube video, the same principles apply to creating and
promoting the video no matter who you are or what you’re selling. There are certain
best and worst practices that apply to Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Pinterest as well.
What you actually post there is what’s different among the three main categories, but
how you establish your professional presence is more or less universal. Accordingly,
Social eCommerce starts out by explaining all of the major social networks, what they’re
good for, and the basic rules of engagement. You’re then directed to Chapter 3, Chap‐
ter 4, or Chapter 5 to help you form a strategy specific to your industry.
Living Up to Your Sales Potential
A lot of businesses try to succeed without social media. It’s easier to pay for advertising
and traditional marketing and leave it at that. There is a ceiling to this practice, though,
and it is lowering as time goes on. With enough money, you will max out on those efforts;
you’ll reach a point where CPC and CPM ads cannot go any further. Your leads potential
will not be able to go any further without social media. We’ve seen this happen with a
lot of our clients over the years. In order to scale, they need innovative and creative ways
to reach new markets, and we help them do that through social media.
Over the past several years, social media has taken over the Web’s traffic and attention.
YouTube is now the second most popular search engine. Facebook has more than 1
billion users. This is not just for geeks and teenagers; whomever your customers or
prospects are, you can reach them through social media.
It is not expensive to experiment with social media marketing. Advertising on social
media—Facebook, mostly—does require a small amount of money at first, but it isn’t
much of a risk.
Beyond the Ads: Social Media’s Unique Opportunities
Social media enables you to reach customers in a better context than other forms of
online communication. Facebook ads, for instance, represent an “impulse buy” oppor‐
tunity; your customer didn’t go to Facebook to buy something, but while he’s there, he
might buy your product or service. It’s a lot like the checkout aisle at the grocery store
—it’s stuff you didn’t plan on buying, but very well might. Social media marketing
catches your customers off guard when they’re not looking for information or anything
to buy.
Most businesses, whether they are involved in ecommerce or not, have their own web‐
sites and social media accounts on LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter to pro‐
mote their organization. Having accounts and posting messages to them is not a strategy,
though, and if you don’t have a strategy, you could do more harm than good.

Preface

Still Not Convinced?
If you’re in the ecommerce business, go take a look at your competitors’ social media
presence. Whatever they are doing is probably making them money. On a large enough
scale, your industry’s sales are capped and zero-sum, so every dollar that doesn’t go to
you goes to a competitor.
If you’re not in the ecommerce business, your competitors may have no social media
presence. For instance, if you’re starting a plumbing business, your competitors might
have a website but no Facebook page or Twitter account. This is an open field for you
because you’ll have 100% of the social media front. Someone who needs a plumber and
goes to the Web to find one is going to find you and be able to identify with and connect
with you more easily. You aren’t just a phone number and a mailing address in the
industrial district; you’re now a real person on Facebook who interacts with customers
and seems accountable for good service.
Maybe you’ve already tried and failed at social media marketing. Perhaps you’ve set up
some accounts, posted some messages, and gotten zero response from anyone. Then
you let the accounts go dormant, or don’t use them often enough to reap any significant
benefit. A business that posts only the occasional comment about a new product on its
Facebook page, or the occasional tweet about its services, isn’t likely to generate the
desired amount of momentum or interest, particularly if each of these updates has to
do with selling something.
Although it can be rather slow when you’re just getting started, the process of gaining
fans and likes and increased group members can and will inevitably build momentum
if you regularly offer interesting content. For example, using Facebook to post funny,
controversial, or interesting content that triggers comments and replies from your fans
or gets them to share and repost your content will in turn attract people from outside
your circle of fans, which can increase your number of fans and promote your message
even further.
Many businesses’ social media pages go stale because their owners think every post
should be exclusively related to the individual business or about its services and prod‐
ucts. However, it’s strongly advised to tie interesting quotes, pictures, and other types
of content into aspects that are more loosely related to the business in either a humorous
or serious way. This will generate more attention than a simple product update. Most
people don’t really want to read product marketing material; they just want content that
is interesting. You can tie your products into that, but there’s a careful balance between
serving your purposes and satisfying the interests and curiosities of your fans and fol‐
lowers. We’ll explain this in more detail throughout the book.
There are a lot of business owners who avoid social media to prevent the potential waste
of time. Although it’s true that there are people who spend far too much time on social
media sites recreationally, if you instead use them in a systematic way with a goal in
Preface 
| 
xxvii

mind, you can get considerable benefit from the time you spend. If you’re overwhelmed
by the vast social media landscape, then just concentrate on the three most relevant
social networks; we explain which ones are best for you in Chapter 1.
Last, if you’re relying on traditional “organic” search traffic or search advertising to drive
your sales, then you’re going to have to get into social media sooner or later. Search
engines are paying much more attention to social signals as a sign of authority, trust,
and quality. If you don’t have a social media presence, you’re going to become less and
less relevant in search results in the future.
Let’s Get Started
It’s important to understand the social media basics. By the time you’re done with
Chapter 1, you will have a basic social media strategy, an excellent understanding of
relevant social networks, and some ideas for what to post and how often to post it. Let’s
get to it!

Preface

CHAPTER 1
The Social Media Landscape
It’s impossible to list every social network that exists. New ones are popping up all the
time. Some of them fail quickly and disappear, while others fail slowly and linger for
years. The sites that are on top right now were at one time niche networks that spent a
lot of time in the second tier before overtaking their rivals. Within the span of only a
few years, the mighty have fallen and even mightier have risen to take their place. Social
media is a volatile industry.
This chapter is intended to categorize social networks not based on size, but on their
value to you as someone who is selling something online. The smaller and emerging
social networks are almost certainly a waste of your time and money—from a business
perspective, anyway. From a personal perspective, feel free to explore the Web and sign
up for whatever interests you. Making money off of social media participation is a com‐
pletely different game.
Tier 1 Social Networks
If you have limited resources, then don’t concern yourself with smaller social networks;
just concentrate on the sites that are actually going to make money for you. The three
sites explained in the following subsections are the most important now and in the near
future, though each of them is good for something different. If you can branch out to
all of them, great; if not, then pick the one that will have the most benefit to you and
begin to map out your strategy. If you aren’t sure which site to concentrate on, the next
few chapters will help you sort that out.
Twitter
Twitter is a microblogging site that asks participants: “What are you doing right now?”
Indeed, most of the communication on Twitter is of the “what I’m doing right now”
variety. That is to say, it’s pretty mundane, and the 140-character limit forces some
1

interesting language shortcuts. However, Twitter’s tagline is only a suggestion, not a
rule. As you participate more on Twitter, you’ll discover that the most successful and
popular users have a strategy for releasing small but interesting bits of information.
Microblogging is the practice of making frequent, short, unedited, unrefined message
posts. This is not limited to Twitter—you could easily do the same thing on Facebook,
Google+, LinkedIn, and Instagram—but it is the most popular and profitable platform
dedicated to this task. Twitter users refer to these posts as tweets.
Typical tweets tend not to question reality or pontificate on lofty topics such as ethics,
religion, or politics, nor do they dare ponder the ironies of the universe. Twitter mi‐
crobloggers merely write something quick (140 characters or fewer) to explain what
they’re doing. You should explore Twitter for an hour or two and find active users, just
to see how they use the site. You can see someone’s whole day play out for you, one
sentence at a time.
When you mention someone in a tweet who has a Twitter account, the protocol is to
include his or her username with an @ in front. For example, you might send out an
update like “Checking out Twitter at the suggestion of @sspencer.” (And if I’m follow‐
ing you on Twitter, I’ll see that you mentioned me; I can also search for my username
and see everyone who’s mentioned me recently.) If you want to talk about a certain topic
in which other people might be interested, you can put a # symbol before it. This is
called a hashtag, and it turns a word or amalgamated short phrase into a topic that can
easily become its own community. For instance, if you are attending the SXSW confer‐
ence and are microblogging about your experiences there, you would include #sxsw
somewhere in your tweet so that other people who are interested in that topic can more
easily find tweets relating to it. Twitter offers documentation that covers all of its features;
we won’t duplicate that effort here.
Twitter starts with sending out updates, but it doesn’t end there. You can also use it to
engage in conversations with other Twitter users, almost as if using an instant messenger
client. Granted, some of it is idle banter, but fascinating discussions can take place on
Twitter in this way.
For instance, what does that person do when he sees your tweet mentioning him? It’s
not unusual for him to respond to your tweet by posting his own tweet publicly as a
reply. If you are following him, then he could alternatively send a response privately
by direct message, but Twitter users rarely do that.
Many businesspeople use Twitter to share links to interesting web pages with their
friends or colleagues, to meet or keep in touch with industry contacts, or to promote
blog posts. A significant number also use Twitter to engage in dialogue with customers/
prospects. This isn’t something you can jump into and figure out quickly, though; it
takes knowledge and skill to use Twitter effectively.

Chapter 1: The Social Media Landscape

Even if you don’t intend to use Twitter much for marketing, you should still establish a
Twitter account so that you can track conversations that mention your brand. The No‐
tifications tab in Twitter shows you all of the tweets that include your username, but
you should make an effort to look up related hashtags as well.
Twitter “espionage” is one of the easiest ways to gain insight into your target market, to
see what the individuals it comprises are talking about, and what they’re sharing with
their peers. You can use Twitter’s search functions to look up what people are saying
about you, your company, your products, and your competition. You can also see what
your customers’ other interests are on Twitter—information that can help you to really
fine-tune your marketing campaign.
Twitter’s website is not the only way to interact with the service. There are several other
options: instant message services, text messages, web browser extensions, and stand‐
alone Twitter clients. You can also set up an RSS feed that will deliver relevant tweets to
other, non-Twitter-specific tools. Two Twitter management tools that we recommend
are Hootsuite and Tweetdeck.
Aside from marketing and sales, Twitter is great for networking at industry events such
as conferences and trade shows. By following that conference’s hashtag (and related
hashtags), you can see what other conference-goers are up to, and learn about parties
and various other related events that aren’t on the official schedule.
Like many online services, Twitter can also become a distraction and a time-sink if you
actively follow the tweets of a large number of Twitter users. So exercise caution when
you start using the Follow feature to subscribe to folks’ Twitter streams.
Related to Twitter is Vine. With Vine, you create short, looping videos that you can post
directly to your Twitter feed. Any serious Twitter strategy should consider including
Vine videos in some way. Nordstrom partnered with top 100 Vine user Zach King to
create a series of sponsored Vines that featured department stores and closets. The Vines
were then featured on Zach King’s Vine feed, Nordstrom’s Vine feed, and hosted on
Vine sharing websites across the Internet to achieve a sizeable amount of views.
Facebook
Odds are very good that you already have a personal Facebook account. There are more
than 1 billion Facebook accounts. That’s a seventh of the world’s entire population!
At first it may seem strange to try to use Facebook to sell anything. Maybe you’ve already
tried and failed miserably, probably by posting some kind of ad to your personal Face‐
book timeline. If that’s what you did, whether you realize it or not, you’ve spammed
your friends, family, and colleagues. It’s extremely poor form to do this.
In sociology there are concepts of “place.” Your first place is your home; your second
place is your office (assuming you work outside of your home). However, one of the
Tier 1 Social Networks

essential ingredients in both a healthy community and a healthy social life is the “third
place.” That’s the social environment outside of your home where you gather with other
people for things non-work-related. There is a decent explanation of it on Wikipedia.
The Web has digital third places because today’s society is inherently more mobile and
transient. In that, Facebook is the clear frontrunner in terms of number of active mem‐
bers, ability to share, ability to connect, and accessibility to targeted advertising. That
last point is what makes Facebook a top-tier social network as a sales and marketing
tool.
Facebook enables you to share just about anything, from raw information (such as your
age, birthdate, or relationship status) to messages of varying length, to photos and vid‐
eos. Virtually every other major app, service, or site connects to Facebook in some way
so that you can share what you are doing in those apps (such as what song you are
listening to in your music player, or what movie you just paid to stream, or what item
you just bought from a store). Many sites and apps outsource their login procedure to
Facebook, requiring you to have a Facebook account just to sign up.
For business use, the first thing you do to branch out from personal Facebook behavior
is to create a page for your business. Make it professional and friendly. Explain your
business—not in cold, boring marketing terms, but in more social and interesting ways.
Think of your “elevator pitch.” What do you tell people about your business when you
have to communicate it in less than 30 seconds? Your Facebook page should be more
like your elevator pitches than your press releases.
Secondly, you have promotion options available to you through Facebook Ads. You can
either promote your page (get more likes) or promote a certain post that you’ve made.
We have a whole chapter dedicated to ad design later in the book. For now, just start
with the Facebook page and think about the kind of content that you can post there.
And post you must! Every day you should post something that is interesting and share‐
able. Don’t start just yet; for right now, just think about the subjects you can post about,
who will write the posts (you or someone who works with/for you), who will monitor
the site for replies and other feedback, and the best time of day to publish your posts.
This is just an initial plan; some of this will need to change later on once you’ve got a
page, content, and ads up and running.
Also think about how much you want to spend on a daily basis. Facebook Ads is designed
to enable daily spending limits, so determine the budget you want to dedicate to pro‐
moting your page accordingly. You may need only $5 or $10 per day, though it may take
some ramp-up time to build a community around your brand.
LinkedIn
You probably think of LinkedIn for professional networking, but this social network’s
potential goes well beyond that. The company has nearly two dozen products aimed at
4 
| 
Chapter 1: The Social Media Landscape

everything from recruiting to advertising. It even has its own conference. Not that net‐
working with other professionals and potential clients isn’t important; it’s just that
LinkedIn can deliver so much more, provided you have the budget and the right product,
service, or event to sell.
LinkedIn was developed in 2003, and has been growing rapidly since then. It is a perfect
place for professionals around the globe to search for jobs, employees, joint venture
partners, and compatible business partners.
Small-business owners like us need help and support. We need contacts, connections,
groups, and networks that help us get further than we would on our own. People in our
networks can provide information, advice, support, and help. Sometimes, we can make
connections that can double or triple our business.
The best results come when you know exactly what your objectives are, and you are
presenting to exactly the right audience. You can achieve this by designing targeted
messages delivered to targeted groups of people. In the past, this was a costly exercise
with tons of research, trial and error, and wasted money. With LinkedIn, this process is
fast, easy, and cheap.
LinkedIn is best for these kinds of businesses:
• Those that are building a community
• Those that are searching for sales, connections, joint venture (JV) partners, and
investors
• Those that want traffic to their blog, website, or social media profiles
• Those that are searching for jobs/employees
• Those that are promoting a product/service/event
Your LinkedIn profile is an integral part of your marketing. The power lies in your ability
to easily connect with like-minded business professionals. If someone views your pro‐
file, and your only connections are your mother and your husband, that person may get
the impression that you’re not very well connected. Aim for a solid group of relevant
contacts, all linked to you and your business. No profile is complete without a recom‐
mendation or two, so encourage your clients and customers to write recommendations
for you, and provide valuable recommendations for others when asked.
You should also set up a page for your company (this is different than your personal
LinkedIn profile). To do this, you must first have at least a few connections, and your
personal profile must be complete. Company pages offer public information about your
business, and function much the same as Facebook pages. You can use your company
page to post company status updates, advertise jobs, interact with employees, and pro‐
mote valuable articles or resources on your website.

To make the most of LinkedIn, use all of the tools and features that are relevant to your
industry to your advantage. Use the LinkedIn search feature to find people and groups
in your industry, and potential customers. Search for your biggest competitors, or a
similar business in your market. Take a close look at what they are doing well, and where
they could improve.
LinkedIn is particularly good for advertising B2B (business-to-business) products,
services, and events. If you have a line of kids’ toys, a series of novels, or music festival
tickets to sell, this is probably going to cost you a lot of money and get you nowhere.
People go to LinkedIn for professional reasons, so you should speak to their professional
lives with everything you do there. Be wary of the cost of LinkedIn ads, though. We’ve
seen it cost two to four times as much as a Facebook ad campaign with a similar reach.
If you have a big budget and a national or international appeal, and your product is
delivered digitally (software, IT solutions, change management consultations), then
LinkedIn ads are worth experimenting with. The most successful advertising on Link‐
edIn involves creating an ad that sends traffic to a targeted landing page to collect opt-
in leads. You’ve got to provide good, relevant content here, such as a short video or a
really good short article.
One thing LinkedIn is very good for is finding people to fill difficult-to-find job open‐
ings. You can do this through the LinkedIn Jobs service, or through clever digging on
your own. If you’re in search of a job, LinkedIn is also a great place to look for one,
especially if you’ve expanded your professional network to the point that you can find
a first- or second-degree contact at the company you want to work for. Then you’re just
two emails or phone calls away from a personal connection who can get you an interview.
LinkedIn recommends that you connect only with people whom you actually know. In
general, this is a good idea for your personal account on any social media site, but
LinkedIn intentionally straddles the boundary between personal and professional.
There are people who flagrantly disregard this recommendation; they are called Link‐
edIn Open Networkers (LIONs). LIONs will connect with just about anyone reflexively,
just to build their network. If you connect to one or two of these people, you can greatly
expand the reach of your job postings. You can find a list of the most popular open
networkers on TopLinked.com.
You can push the boundaries of LinkedIn’s connection recommendation without going
over the top. It will help increase your company’s, brand’s, or individual professional
exposure with LinkedIn by searching for relevant companies and people in your field,
then connecting with them. When you contact them, include a personal note with your
request; explain how you met, describe where you know them from, or mention your
reasons for connecting with them.
Unless you pay for a monthly Premium subscription, LinkedIn allows you to send
InMail (in-network messaging) only to people with whom you’re already connected.
6 
| 
Chapter 1: The Social Media Landscape

That means if you want to contact a particular engineer for a job opening you have, you
can’t contact her directly unless you pay for LinkedIn Premium on a subscription basis.
The best way around this is to search other social media sites for her name and contact
her there. You can prevent this from happening to you by adding your email address to
your LinkedIn profile headline. Or, just spring for Premium, keeping in mind that this
gets you only five free InMail responses per month.
There is a decent amount of community participation on LinkedIn. You can post a
question to LinkedIn Answers that serves your own purposes, and get some great re‐
sponses. For instance, you might find people to hire this way instead of posting a job
listing. Your question can be posed as a thinly veiled job advert, or you can subtly market
your services and products by asking people what their preferred solution in your in‐
dustry is, or what technologies in your field they are interested in playing with. Always
add value to the community with the anticipated answers.
If you really want to go the extra mile, get a URL specifically for your LinkedIn profile,
and redirect it there. This can be easier to remember than your LinkedIn profile URL,
and is useful for business cards, your website, and email signature.
Tier 2 Social Networks
We define a “tier 2” social network in terms not of traffic or reach, but of how easily you
can make money by participating. Certainly, a site with a ton of traffic is going to lead
to some kind of success, but how much will it cost you to achieve that (in terms of time
and money)? A second-tier site may have tremendous value for certain industries and
businesses, and little to no value for others.
Sites can move from tier 2 to 1 pretty easily over a relatively short amount of time. No
site starts out in the first tier.
Google+
If any social network ever started out with a superior advantage, it was Google+. With
industry examples to follow, the support of one of the world’s smartest technology
companies, and an almost unlimited pool of resources from which to draw, Google+
was launched with high expectations.
Despite all that, it is really a “distant third” in terms of the top social networks. It hasn’t
been around for nearly as long as Facebook or Twitter, but it has a significant mem‐
bership that includes many celebrities and politicians. Star Trek actor William Shatner,
for instance, has an enormous Google+ following—so much so that he’s pushed the
limits of the service. Barack Obama had a campaign presence on Google+, and even did
a “hangout” (video chat) that drew a huge audience.
Tier 2 Social Networks

Google+ is a direct competitor of Facebook, and both companies have taken this battle
very seriously.
If you have a Google profile, then you have a Google+ account, even if you never post
anything to it. One of the benefits of having a Google+ page is authorship credit for all
articles, videos, and blog posts that Google has in its index that it can positively identify
as having been written by you. Google offers step-by-step instructions on how to claim
authorship. However, Google may have thrown in the towel with the departure of Vic
Gundotra, previous head of Google+.
YouTube
You probably don’t think of YouTube as a social network, but sharing, rating, and com‐
menting on videos is certainly a social activity. You probably also didn’t think of YouTube
as a search engine, but in terms of the overall volume of search queries, it’s second only
to Google.
YouTube is an excellent “supplemental network” for a campaign focused on a more
monetizeable social media site. Unless you’re selling a video, show, movie, or song,
YouTube may not make sense as the social network to concentrate on. Certainly though,
use YouTube as a way to enhance your main marketing efforts.
There’s nothing that you can’t make a video for. It may not be obvious at first, but if you
think about the industry, the product, and your customers, you can come up with some
ideas for good videos. Like everything else, you want to create compelling content that
reinforces the message of your brand.
By the nature of its social networking capabilities—which show the most viewed videos,
favorites, channels, likes/dislikes, comments, and video replies—YouTube is a far more
effective venue for posting videos than your corporate website, if you want your videos
to spread virally. Therefore, videos should be on YouTube as well as embedded on your
company website.
It’s all about the content, though. If your video content is mediocre, it doesn’t matter
how much you optimize it; it won’t become popular. Nor should it. Mediocre content
doesn’t deserve the rankings or the attention.
It’s not enough to post a great video; you also must know how to take advantage of the
social nature of YouTube. As with all other social networks, you need to build up friends
and subscribers on YouTube so you can leverage them to increase your video’s reach.
Don’t get too caught up in achieving a certain number of views, a certain number of
links to the video, or a certain ranking in the YouTube search results. What matters is
the impact the video has on the bottom line. Quick and easy videos to make are how-
to or FAQs; these not only offer customers additional information but can impact your
conversion rates as well.

Case Study: Will It Blend? Yes It Will!
One of the most well-known viral video campaigns by an online merchant is Blendtec’s
“Will It Blend?” This series of videos showed various household objects being run
through a Blendtec blender, including marbles, rake handles, light bulbs, golf clubs,
and iPads.
How did the campaign come about? Blendtec’s founder/CEO Tom Dickson likes to run
nonstandard things through its blenders to test out their strength, according to George
Wright, Blendtec’s former marketing director. After watching Dickson test a blender by
jamming a 2” × 2” piece of wood in it, Wright had the idea to post those demonstrations
of “extreme blending” online.
Dickson and Wright went to work creating the videos in the fall of 2006, starting with
five “Don’t Try This at Home Blending” videos. They built a companion microsite to go
with it—WillItBlend.com—and sent an email to all employees to spread the word about
the videos and the site.
They then emailed their customer base and asked for suggestions on things to blend.
Not only did emails pour in, so did calls from the media. The campaign was covered by
the Today Show, iVillage Live, Newsweek, Playboy, and the New York Times.
Blendtec had a surprisingly low budget. The company did have an on-staff video pro‐
ducer and webmaster, so development of the first five videos ran just $50 to $100, in‐
cluding buying the domain name, a couple of rakes, some marbles, and few other sup‐
plies. It was proof positive that viral video marketing can be done on a shoestring budget.
Wright advises companies wishing to get into YouTube marketing to focus on something
fun, but don’t try to force it. It really should be something worth watching.
Wright’s second piece of advice is to clearly demonstrate the product. For Blendtec, it
was initially about branding, but after the brand awareness has been established, there
has to be a need and a catalyst to compel viewers to solve the problem. A consumer
watching a blender chop up a rake handle would likely conclude that this blender would
do a pretty good job at blending ice as well.
As a result of the videos, Blendtec saw a dramatic increase in sales of both consumer
and commercial blenders. The “Will It Blend?” campaign targeted the home market,
and web sales were more than four times greater than the previous top-selling month.
All other channels have seen big increases as well.
Pinterest
According to Experian Hitwise, as of the publication of this book, Pinterest is the third
most popular social network in terms of traffic.
Tier 2 Social Networks

You’re likely already dabbling in using Pinterest to drive traffic to your ecommerce site.
Perhaps you have the basics down: adding “Pin it” buttons to your product pages, and
creating neatly organized boards for your customers and potential customers to browse
through. What you may be missing is an overall strategy for how Pinterest can not only
increase your traffic and engagement, but generate sales as well.
As with all social networks, engagement comes first. There is no valid path to quick and
easy sales, especially on Pinterest. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t ways to capitalize
on Pinterest’s highly loyal user base of more than 70 million people (as of July 2013).
Unlike other social networks, Pinterest is primarily product-based. For this reason, it
has surpassed Facebook and Twitter in terms of generating referrals to product-based
ecommerce sites. According to Adam Audette of Rimm-Kaufman Group, Pinterest
converts 22% more than Facebook does. Additionally, Pinterest users spend 60% more
than Facebook users do. And unlike Facebook and Twitter posts, pinned images tend
to have a long lifecycle. Whereas tweets and Facebook posts may generate a lot of dis‐
cussion and interaction when first posted, pinned images may resurface with much
fanfare, weeks or even months later.
The virality of a pin on Facebook should also not be underestimated. Once a user au‐
thorizes Facebook integration, his pins can be automatically published to his Facebook
timeline. This integration with Facebook greatly increases the viral effect of pinning.
You can also connect your Pinterest account to Twitter so that your new pins are cross-
posted along with the Twitter hashtags that you’re targeting (though Pinterest treats
hashtags like normal words, so if you’re not cross-posting or encouraging others to tweet
your pins, don’t bother with the hashtags on Pinterest).
Many ecommerce businesses are also using Pinterest as a way to do cost-effective, low-
risk market research. By pinning a product (in some cases, even before it’s launched),
business owners can gauge interest levels in the product, and even ask for feedback or
votes.
As shown in “Case Study: Will It Blend? Yes It Will!” on page 9, increased interest in
your products will ultimately lead to increased sales.
Food photos do very well on Pinterest, especially for cookbooks and restaurants, and
to appeal to people with specific dietary preferences or limitations.
If you’re selling some kind of service, Pinterest is a much more difficult site on which
to capitalize. Unless you can think of some interesting and unique ways to represent
your business with graphics, the time spent curating photos on Pinterest should prob‐
ably be redirected to sites that can more effectively engage with potential subscribers.

Tumblr
Tumblr is one of those social networks that, although not as inherently useful for ecom‐
merce as some others, can be tremendously useful for certain types of ecommerce busi‐
nesses. It certainly has a lot of reach and a high level of engagement:
• There are more than 100 million Tumblr blogs.
• Almost half of Tumblr users are between the ages of 18 and 34.
• The average user stays on Tumblr for 14 minutes each visit; the average Facebook
user spends only 12.5 minutes.
A Tumblr blog can be set up in a few minutes, but there is no option to self-host, which
makes customization much trickier. Altering themes, widgets, and plug-ins often means
heavy code editing, making major changes unfeasible. However, there are commercial
Tier 2 Social Networks

options that enable businesses to easily customize Tumblr for ecommerce, such as
Shopify and BlkDot.
Figure 1-2 is an example of an ecommerce site done entirely on Tumblr.
Figure 1-2. A Tumblr-based ecommerce site
Once you’ve decided to use Tumblr for your ecommerce business, it’s not hard to get
the hang of using it. Regardless of whether you plan to actually sell on Tumblr or simply
use it as another method of marketing your business, here are some fundamental tips:
Set up your Tumblr blog right the first time.
The process of setting up a Tumblog is extremely simple. However, once created, it
can be difficult to delete. Of key importance at this stage is choosing a name that
accurately represents your business or brand. You’ll likely want to immediately
redirect your Tumblr blog to a custom domain. So, for example, rather than having
them access your blog by going to http://socialecommercebook.tumblr.com, you’ll
send your visitors directly to http://socialecommercebook.com.
12

Chapter 1: The Social Media Landscape

Post good, Tumblr-friendly content.
Once the basics of your blog are set up, you can start posting. You can post an image,
video, link, or quote. If you don’t want to have to log into your Tumblr dashboard
to post content, you can install and use a Tumblr app (such as the Tumblr book‐
marklet) that allows you to post and share content from any sites you’re visiting.
When you post something, make sure you use tags. This will enable other Tumblr
users to search for and find your posts using tag-based keywords. Lastly, post con‐
tent that speaks to your customers, whether it’s inspirational images, quotes, or
some other evocative content that will generate discussion. The most successful
brands on Tumblr post images of all kinds, not just photos of their own products.
Connect with other Tumblr users.
As with any social network, connecting with and following others is the key to
success on Tumblr. Start by searching for posts related to your products or business,
and like or reply to them. If there’s something you particularly like, you can re‐
blog a post, which essentially reposts it to your own feed with attribution given to
the original poster. You can also track down people who are influential in your niche
and follow them, ensuring you stay connected with what’s going on in your industry.
Use Disqus to enable commenting.
Part of what makes Tumblr so simple to use is that it doesn’t include any extra
features. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t add whatever you need; one thing you
should definitely add to your blog is a user comment function. One of the best ways
you can expand your reach as an ecommerce business and increase engagement on
your Tumblr blog is to actively encourage commenting. Although commenting isn’t
native to Tumblr, it’s easy to implement via Disqus. Once Disqus is installed, com‐
menting will be automatically enabled. In the absence of comments (there are many
large ecommerce Tumblr blogs that don’t have commenting enabled), you’ll simply
see “notes,” which is a list of all the people who have “liked” or reblogged your posts.
Although there’s much that can be said about effectively using Tumblr for your ecom‐
merce business, the essential first step is deciding whether Tumblr is right for you. For
businesses with access to high-quality, inspirational imagery, and the ability to post
engaging, humorous, or pithy commentary, Tumblr can be an excellent addition to a
solid marketing strategy.
Tier 3 Social Networks
Tier 3 is reserved for sites that are popular and interesting, but not particularly profitable
for most people. With the right monetization strategy, a third-tier site can easily make
the leap to a second- or top-tier social network.

reddit
reddit (yes, it’s a lowercase r) is a social link aggregation and discussion site, organized
into topical communities that are self-organized and independently moderated. There
are millions of visitors each day, and reddit has hosted Ask Me Anything interviews
from many celebrities and a few politicians, including Barack Obama.
So it’s got a lot of traffic, a lot of users, and a lot of discussion. Sounds like a great place
to be if you have something to sell, right? Not necessarily. You must be a member of
reddit in order to advertise there. It isn’t difficult to create an account, but the targeting
is not very good because there is little capacity for users to provide revealing demo‐
graphic data about themselves. In general, ad results seem to be less than stellar for any
product or service that doesn’t specifically appeal to self-described “geeks,” and redditors
are generally hostile toward self-promotion of any kind. If you try to guerrilla market
by posting links to your site or Facebook page or anything that looks remotely promo‐
tional, redditors will slap you down very, very hard.
If you have high-quality photos of some action shots of your products or related topics,
you might host them on imgur (see “imgur” on page 14) and post links to appropriate
photo-oriented subreddits (such as /r/pics or /r/earthporn). They must be valid photos
in their own right, not just marketing materials. Even if you’re successful, it will be
difficult or impossible to convert that attention into sales because reddit and imgur don’t
provide an easy way to link to your site without it being called out as spam.
The only consistent, reliable, and ethical strategy for marketing on reddit that we’re
aware of is giving away free products or samples on /r/freebies. Offer a certain number
of free giveaway items or samples, and hope that your product appeals to some of the
communities on reddit. If you’re successful, you might focus some reddit ads on the
subreddits that find the freebies most appealing.
In general, reddit is a site you should be aware of and familiar with. If you want to try
to participate there, you must give yourself some time to learn the site and the reddi‐
quette before attempting to contribute any material related to your business.
Regardless of how you choose to participate, one thing you probably do not want to do
is reveal your real name and contact information. If you become disfavored on reddit
at some point in the future, this information can be used to terrorize and threaten you
in person, over the phone, and certainly over the Internet. Women are particularly
vulnerable to cyberbullying on reddit, and should avoid revealing their name and gender
when participating there. Doxxing, revealing another redditor’s real-life identity, is
against reddiquette and hopefully will never happen to you.
imgur
imgur (yes, it’s all lowercase, like reddit) is a social photo-sharing site that offers com‐
munity voting and commenting on pictures. It was originally created by a redditor who
14 
| 
Chapter 1: The Social Media Landscape

was fed up with spammy, limited, and slow free photo-sharing sites. For most of its
existence, imgur has been closely associated with reddit, but it has reached the point
where it offers much of reddit’s core functionality in terms of voting and commenting.
If you intend to have both a reddit and an imgur account, and you want to use imgur
for photo hosting and sharing outside of reddit, then you should register different user‐
names on both sites. If you use the same username (or if you use the same username
on reddit that you do on any other social network), then you risk revealing your identity
and contact information.
imgur has few rules; you can post pretty much anything there privately, but if you share
something publicly that is illegal or copyrighted by someone else, it can be reported and
taken down.
While imgur is an interesting photo-sharing site with a lot of traffic, its content is mostly
temporary and ephemeral, whereas Pinterest is about curating collections of high-
quality images over time, and Instagram is much more personal and stylized. It could
be a good social network if you’re planning to focus on viral photo content. Memes
(pictures combined with words, in the style of Meme Generator and quick meme, and
which we’ll cover in more detail later in this book), however, are best left to meme-
generation sites.
Quora
Quora is a place to ask questions, and hopefully get responses from experts in the Quora
community. It doesn’t offer much of a direct advertising benefit, but you can do a lot of
inexpensive research here. If you’re trying to figure out what the most important ques‐
tions and issues are for your as-yet-unreached prospects, Quora is an excellent place to
start.
The community is pretty big, and includes a lot of tech celebrities. If your question
doesn’t gain much traction on its own merit, you can pay a fee to try to get an expert to
offer some comments.
It may also raise your professional profile to provide answers on Quora. You can make
limited use of your Quora byline to mention your business or product; if your answers
are highly ranked, everyone who reads that question will see your byline and your
insightful response.
Instagram
While Pinterest focuses on collections of curated pictures uploaded and modified
through a desktop computer, Instagram primarily relies on mobile devices with inte‐
grated cameras. That means that it tends to include more candid, less curated photos.
Instagram has built-in photo filters, and restricts the picture size to a prescribed square
size; you might find this entertaining or constricting, depending on your attitude toward
Tier 3 Social Networks

photography and how you share it socially. Instagram is also a bit more one-directional
than Pinterest; it’s much easier to share other people’s pins than it is to pass around
someone’s Instagram posts.
Visual content has begun to dominate the Web. More and more people prefer visual
content such as videos, images, and infographics to replace, or to break up, a wall of text
—and for good reason. You can potentially communicate a lot more information in a
shorter amount of time with one good picture than with a typical text-only company
blog post. Instagram makes it incredibly easy for other users to share that graphical
content, and thus increase your brand and product visibility online.
Once you have an account set up, here are some ideas to get you successfully started on
converting visitors and leads with Instagram:
Showcase new products.
Providing visitors, leads, and customers with “sneak peeks” of your upcoming hot
new products only on Instagram will give a sense of exclusivity (and who doesn’t
like to feel like a VIP?). If you announce on your other social media sites like Face‐
book and Twitter that you have a special new “sneak peek” announcement on In‐
stagram, your Followers number is sure to increase.
Showcase current products.
Not only can Instagram enable you to show everyone how to use your product and
showcase its features and benefits, but if you have some creative uses for your
products, it’s ideal for sharing those as well. Keep an eye on your other social media
sites to learn how customers are using your products, and share their ideas—and
make sure you give those customers a shout-out on Instagram. That’s a great first
step to creating a brand loyalist!
Give behind-the-scenes shots.
To take pictures of one’s company in action is to build trust among visitors, leads,
and customers. Take snapshots of your employees having fun at work, packing and

—Instagram allows you to engage people like never before.
These are just a few ideas for using Instagram to help build your business. No matter
what images or themes you create on the site, however, be sure that you provide context
for the images and include #hashtags to help categorize them as you’re posting.
Figure 1-3 shows how Converse creates brand loyalty with creative images on Instagram.
Niche Social Networks
In a few other chapters, we explain niche social networks and how to best use them.
However, there may be niche social networks that we’ve never heard of, or that apply to
your specific industry, product, or field. By all means, look for them!

Chapter 1: The Social Media Landscape

Figure 1-3. Converse’s Instagram page combines colorful pictures of shoes with art and

For instance, if you are selling products or services for pets, there is Dogster and Catster.
If you’re selling books, there is Goodreads, LibraryThing, RedRoom, and Shelfari. Are
you selling products that appeal to artists? Then deviantART is the social network for
you.
If you don’t know of any niche social networks for your industry, ask some of your
colleagues or friendly competitors where they’re spending their time online.
If there aren’t any niche social networks in the modern sense—sites like Facebook, for
instance (which used to be a niche social network for college students)—then there are
probably forums and/or groups on larger sites. For instance, LinkedIn has many groups
that people can join, each with its own discussions and events.
Summary
While you’ve probably heard of most of the social networks in this chapter, hopefully
you learned something new about each in terms of how it can be useful to your business.
You probably also learned about a few lesser or niche social networks that could be
useful to your overall social media strategy. There are a few more that we’ll discuss in
other chapters, and some of the ones that we mentioned only quickly here will be ex‐
plained later in the proper context.
In essence, this is Act One: we’ve introduced you to the characters. In the next chapter,
we’ll frame the “problem” and how you might think about solving it.

CHAPTER 2
Basic Social Media Strategy
If you’re struggling to make sales on social media, it’s not the channel that is to blame,
but the strategy you’ve developed (or haven’t developed). To convert prospects on Face‐
book, Twitter, LinkedIn, or any other social network, you need compelling content
delivered systematically. Be interesting. Be remarkable.
From there, you need to give prospects a reason to convert—and an opportunity to
engage with you further. This is how you can align your sales with your social media
efforts.
The approach to using social media is different from other types of marketing. Without
the right planning, you can find yourself quickly getting frustrated. This chapter helps
you form a valid, basic strategy for the most important social networks.
We’ll also help you to establish goals. Without those, you’ve got nothing solid to work
toward. You might think that your only goal is to reach as many people as you can to
raise awareness about what you’re offering. However, just planning on getting the word
out and attracting the maximum number of followers with a platform such as Facebook
won’t necessarily guarantee increased growth and revenue. Selecting one site blindly
and dumping money into it is a bad idea, but so is trying to spread equally blind efforts
across multiple sites. There are numerous social networks, and it’s impossible to incor‐
porate all of them into your plans. Even if you could, it would be a waste of time and
money, since many of them won’t advance your goals.
Too many marketers tragically underestimate the work involved with getting the best
results from using social media. A quality social media marketing plan will improve
your ability to effectively manage the campaign and provide a way for you to measure
your resulting progress. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a good foundation for a
social media marketing plan.
19

Understand Who You Are and Why You Do It
In order to form a successful, actionable social media sales and marketing strategy, you
must understand your business from a customer’s perspective. That might seem silly to
you at first—after all, you already have products and customers. Obviously whatever
you’re doing is working, right?
It’s hard to argue with success. On the other hand, it’s also hard to design a highly targeted
marketing campaign without truly understanding what makes your company, your
brand, and your product, service, or event unique. Traditional marketing isn’t really
targeted. An ad in a newspaper reaches newspaper readers; the publisher probably has
a vague idea of subscriber demographics, but it isn’t possible to display the ad only to
readers who fit the right criteria. The same is true with billboards, radio ads, and so on;
the best you can do is generalize the audience and your customer base and look for a
good match.
Even online advertising in CPC or CPM ads on search engines, blogs, and news sites is
broadly targeted because it’s tough—from a legal and technical standpoint—to collect
much data on readers or visitors.
Social media is totally different. Since everyone who signs up on a social network gives
myriad details about themselves, each site automatically starts out with the ability to do
specific ad targeting. Even if someone puts in only her age and gender, those two data
points are a huge advantage in targeted advertising, assuming you know who you’re
selling to. As each member interacts with other members and participates in discussions
and clicks voting buttons, joins groups, or excludes herself from certain parts of the site,
she (perhaps unwittingly) offers a treasure trove of behavioral and personal preference
data to social networks. Over time, this data is collected and organized in such a way
that every participant can be specifically targeted according to her lifestyle and prefer‐
ences. This enables you to do extremely fine-grained ad targeting. On a social network
like Facebook that has a population measured in a double-digit percentage of the planet’s
population, even the most fine-grained targeting can reach thousands of prequalified
sales leads.
The catch is, if you don’t understand your product/service/event’s fine-grained demo‐
graphics, then you won’t know whom to target. Worse, you won’t know how to appeal
to that audience even if you do reach it. Therefore, a superior social media sales and
marketing strategy starts with knowing your company, your brand, and whatever you
are selling really well. If you’re already at this point, then go ahead and skip to the next
section.
So how do you find out these valuable hidden details? Well, you should probably start
with your own company and employees, and perhaps your customers as well; just ask
them their opinions and take some notes. Consider getting on the phone with and
talking to some current customers. Develop a set of questions designed to elicit both
20 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

specific responses as well as freeform feedback. Beyond that, though, the answer is: use
social media!
In order to leverage social media to give you better insights for ad targeting, you must
first determine what the most important questions are in your industry. What big prob‐
lems are there? What problems do you solve that your competitors don’t? What are your
customers’ (and more importantly, prospects) chief concerns?
Whatever the questions are, make note of them, and ask them on social media. Some
good sites for asking questions and getting good user participation are:
• Twitter (only if you have enough followers to get decent responses)
• Yahoo Answers
• Quora
• reddit (the askreddit subreddit, usually)
If you’re well established on other social networks, go ahead and ask there, too.
The answers that you receive, and the demographics of the people who respond, are
useful in a variety of ways:
• Ad targeting
• FAQ content on your website
• Social media posts
• Quotes or bullet points for traditional marketing materials
Set and Meet Goals
You cannot improve what you don’t measure. If you have an existing social media pres‐
ence and want to improve its effectiveness, then you must measure your current base‐
line, and then think of some realistic goals. Here are some ideas (replace the numbers
with some that are realistic for your business and industry):
• Get to 1,000 Facebook likes
• Gain 15 new Twitter followers per day
• Increase social media sales leads by 10%
• Have 20 customers interact with you publicly through social media
• Solve 10 customer complaints posted on Twitter
• Get an invitation to speak at a conference
Set and Meet Goals 
| 
21

• Get mentioned in two press articles or posts on popular blogs
It’s important that your goal is realistic. If you are in a niche industry and expect to gain
10,000 Facebook likes, you’re probably going to fail. When you are just starting out in
social media, set easy, measurable goals for yourself until you gain more experience.
Know your limits before you push them.
If you’re starting out with nothing in terms of social media presence, then your initial
goals should be a bit different. First, aim to identify the social networks that are relevant
to you. Then join them and customize them. Once you’re established, then set some
initial targets for how many likes or followers or the level of engagement you want to
achieve. Again, start with something easily and cheaply achieved, then move upward
from there.
When you meet your goal, immediately plan a new one based on your current success.
If you set a goal of 50 Facebook likes within one month and end up reaching it within
a week, then try for 200 before the month is up.
You can also choose goals that conform to a budget. For instance, if you are spending
$10 per day on Facebook ads and getting about 100 new likes per day, try doubling that
money and see if you can double your likes. If not, scale back. Find the sweet spot. Or
if your budget is low, concentrate on tactics that will help you meet your engagement
or sales goal without buying more ads.
Have a Scalability Plan
It’s nice to dream about “good problems to have,” such as a level of success that you
cannot keep up with. Regardless of how realistic you believe your chances are for out-
of-control success in ecommerce, the only way to prevent those dreams from turning
into nightmares is to have at least a basic plan for how you can scale up to meet demand.
By “nightmares,” we mean that one of your products or marketing efforts becomes viral
overnight and you go from fulfilling 10 orders per day to having your web store crash
due to load, your email inbox fill up with more than a thousand orders and presales
questions, and angry comments about your poor customer service on Twitter.
There are three “good problems to have” scenarios to plan for: unexpected big orders,
a sudden long-term increase in sales, and seasonal or holiday increases.
A Sudden Big Order
Let’s say you have a part-time business buying small-time wholesale boxes of electronics
parts and assembling specialized computing devices. There are a lot of companies that
do this with system-on-board devices like the Raspberry Pi. But then all of a sudden an
industrial railroad consulting company wants to buy 500 of your devices to integrate
into railroad car safety monitoring equipment. Your website says that orders usually
22 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

ship within three days of payment, and you have a flat-rate shipping fee that barely
covers the cost of shipping in the continental U.S.—and 20 of the orders need to be
shipped to Alaska at double the cost, which erases all profit from those orders. There’s
no way you can fulfill this order on your own, according to the terms you’ve specified.
Even a basic scalability plan would have prevented the stress of dealing with this mess.
Your Viral Efforts Accidentally Worked
Welcome to the Internet! Your viral product video has just hit the front page of reddit
and has been tweeted, shared, and blogged about more times than you can keep track
of, and you’re not even done with your first cup of coffee. The cute, custom-made kids’
dolls you make full-time in your retirement are suddenly in demand. You can only make
one per week at best, but there is now a backlog of 300 orders, and more are coming in
every minute. There are actually so many orders that you cannot calculate how far into
the future it would take to fulfill even half of them.
This scenario isn’t complete fiction; it’s based on a real story that happened to Child’s
Own, a small business that made dolls from children’s drawings. As shown in
Figure 2-1, the owner actually asked people to stop sharing her site on social media
because she had no hope of keeping up with demand: http://www.childsown.com/
2012/02/07/oy/.
It’s So Popular That No One Goes There Anymore
It’s great to have a local business that has so many customers that there’s a line out the
door, but be careful that you don’t develop a reputation for being so busy that customers
decide it isn’t worth the hassle. Extremely popular, exclusive, upscale New York City
restaurants can turn people away without batting an eyelash, but you can’t.
For local businesses, scalability plans should involve:
• Extending store hours
• Temporary increase in staff
• Temporary expansion (into the parking lot, the stockroom or loading dock, a nearby
empty storefront, or temporary space in a mall kiosk or seasonal storefront)
• Permanent expansion in the form of a second or third location
This shouldn’t be too much different than your ordinary scalability planning for sea‐
sonal rushes.
Have a Scalability Plan

Prevention and Planning
The first thing you should do is ensure that you aren’t making claims that you cannot
back up. Specify in your terms of service, in your ads, and on the ordering page that
orders over a certain amount will take longer to ship.
Check your shipping policies and your shipping price calculation algorithms to make
sure that you’re accounting correctly for the areas and countries that you serve. There
are several parts of the U.S. that are not serviced by certain FedEx, UPS, and U.S. mail
services such as overnight, Saturday delivery, or ground shipping. Don’t allow an order
to complete if it has an invalid shipping service selected.
Limit your inventory quantity so that orders cannot be completed beyond a certain
threshold. If you choose this path, you should definitely provide a simple “notify me”
24 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

opt-in email form so that you can try to regain this sale when you are prepared to fulfill
more orders.
If you need to assemble a physical good, create simple instructions (in the form of a
manual, video, or presentation) for assembling, testing, packing, and shipping a prod‐
uct. This will enable you to quickly train a temporary employee.
Ask family and friends if and when they might be available to help with a sudden swell
in orders, and figure out how much you can pay for their help. Beyond that, you should
also contact some local temporary staffing agencies to see what they may be able to
provide in terms of short-term, short-notice labor.
Prepare an ad that you can post to local newspapers, ad services, and job listing services.
If you ever need to use it, you’ll have good ad copy ready to paste into a form.
Ensure that your website is hosted on a server that can handle increased load, or can
scale dynamically with load. If you are on a cheap hosting plan that doesn’t allow for
heavy traffic, contact your service provider to figure out how you can upgrade your
hosting service on short notice. It may turn out that you will have to change your hosting
plan or switch to a more agile hosting provider in order to get proper scalability. Defi‐
nitely make sure that you aren’t going to be charged high fees for going over a certain
bandwidth threshold. If you’re not particularly technical and are having difficulty un‐
derstanding what we’re talking about in this paragraph, you should enlist the help of a
competent system administrator or web developer.
Define Your Presence
The first thing you must do on every social media site is define a username or namespace
for your company. This is often part of the URL, such as on Tumblr where your username
becomes a subdomain—for example, http://socialecommercebook.tumblr.com. Or
sometimes it’s a directory off of the main URL, such as on Facebook: http://www.face
book.com/socialecommercebook.
Not all social networks have this feature. LinkedIn profile URLs, for instance, do contain
your name, but with a bunch of “alphabet soup” as well. If you are working with a social
network that does this, then you may find some utility in buying a domain name (they’re
cheap—$15 a year or so, depending on how far into the future you reserve them).
You can also redirect certain directories on your corporate site to specific social net‐
works. For instance, if you wanted to do a cheap (essentially free, if you have full control
over your corporate website) vanity URL to go to your LinkedIn profile, you could
redirect this to it: http://www.<example.com>/linkedin/ (where <example.com> is your
site).
If you are serious about increasing your fans/friends/followers, you can get a specialized
domain name that specifically encourages liking or following. For example, FBjen.com.
Define Your Presence

Watch out for trademark violations, though. Not only is the word Facebook a corporate
trademark, but FB is as well. This may not be a problem depending on where you live
and the details of your own trademarks. If you don’t have an intellectual property at‐
torney available to check this out for you, then avoid anything with questionable legality.
White Hat Versus Black Hat
In the online world, there are tactics that are considered ethical, or white hat, and tactics
that are considered unethical, or black hat. If you aren’t sure, or if a particular technique
is transitioning from one to the other, it could be considered grey hat. You absolutely
want to stay away from black hat tactics. They are unethical for a reason, and the admins
and stewards of social networks will punish you harshly and in many cases permanently
for attempting to use them.
Black Hat Examples
Read the terms of service for the social network you’re participating in. The dos and
don’ts are pretty clearly laid out there—or at least, the general sense of “good and evil”
is explained.
If there is any question as to whether a particular tactic is white hat or black hat, just
ask yourself this: “Does this misrepresent the amount and depth of actual sharing that
is taking place?” If it does, then don’t do it. Here are some specific examples of known
black hat techniques:
Buying friends, fans, and followers.
Facebook has already cracked down on this by deleting fake accounts and removing
fraudulent likes and fans. Not only is this a waste of money due to your bought
friends being deleted, but it’s also pretty embarrassing to get caught doing this.
Twitter doesn’t have such strict rules, so it’s much more common to find people
buying followers on Twitter, or using bots to follow other people with the hope that
they’ll be followed back. Just because Twitter allows it doesn’t mean you should do
it; imagine how embarrassed you’d be if your friends, family, coworkers, employees,
and customers found out that your followers number were falsely inflated.
Buying Amazon or Yelp reviews.
This became a famous and successful black hat tactic a while ago, and several busi‐
nesses sprang up to capitalize on it. However, in late 2012 Amazon cracked down
on the fake review industry, removing fraudulent accounts and deleting fake re‐
views. A number of new features have been implemented to combat fake reviews,
including review ratings, verified purchase tagging, and a quick link to a reviewer’s
history. Yelp recently found and eliminated fake reviews on a large scale as well.
The FTC cracked down on 19 companies creating fake reviews in September 2013
for total fines amounting to $350,000. Among the companies were Swam Media
26 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

Group (a gentleman’s club franchise) and US Coachways, Inc. (a bus charter com‐
pany). Again: you will be caught, you will be embarrassed, you will look petty and
desperate, and you will wish you hadn’t done this.
Fraudulent Google AdSense clicks.
If you display Google AdSense ad units anywhere on any of your sites, and you click
on them to gain revenue, you will feel the wrath of Google. That doesn’t mean mere
suspension of your AdSense account; it means complete suspension or deletion of
your entire Google profile. You could permanently lose access to Google Drive,
Gmail, Picasa, and Google+.
Buying (or selling) links on your web page or social media pages.
No one would notice if you bought or sold just one link. However, that’s not how
link buying/selling typically works. A black hat SEO company will want to buy links
on as many sites as possible. This is easily picked up by spam-catching algorithms
of the search engines. If you buy or sell links for SEO purposes, you’ll pay the price.
Editing Wikipedia articles.
You are traceable on Wikipedia. All it takes is one suspicious editor to look into the
revision history of a Wikipedia page to get your account banned and your page
deleted. This also applies to editing other articles to mention your product, brand,
or company. There are a lot of ways you can be caught, such as through your IP
address. Don’t be concerned with trying to hide your identity or origin—just don’t
edit Wikipedia for marketing or self-promotion purposes.
White Hat Examples
It’s impossible to define every white hat technique, since anything that is not specifically
unethical is almost always perfectly acceptable. If you’re encouraging people to share
and participate, you aren’t breaking any stated or implied rules; this is how social net‐
works are supposed to work.
Having been intimately involved in the social networking space for many years now,
we’ve heard more than a few misconceptions related to using social media for business.
Here are some things that people think are bad practices, but actually aren’t:
Asking for Facebook likes or Yelp reviews.
How else would you jumpstart your product or company page, other than by asking
your personal friends, family members, and colleagues to follow your page? It’s not
a good idea to repeatedly spam for likes or follows, but not because it’s unethical—
it’s just annoying.
Buying Facebook ads that increase your likes.
Of course it isn’t against Facebook’s policies to pay it for ads that promote your page!
We have a whole chapter dedicated to that practice in this book.
White Hat Versus Black Hat

Outsourcing social media posting/management.
You don’t have to be the person who posts to any of your social media sites—even
your own personal pages. While many social networks have a Terms of Service
clause that bars you from registering under someone else’s identity, there are no
rules against having someone else post, comment, or reply for you. Having said
that, the most authentic, passionate, and consistent voice you’ll find for your busi‐
ness is your own. If you do decide to outsource your social media, be sure you’re
available to field expert-level questions, and that whoever’s monitoring and man‐
aging your social media profiles has a clear understanding of your business, in‐
cluding your goals, values, and the “personality” of your brand.
Social media monitoring.
Many businesses make a point of monitoring what social media users are saying
about their brand or products. Some people feel that this is privacy infringement,
though social networks do not have rules against it. Although this is an area where
businesses need to tread carefully, paying attention to conversations in your in‐
dustry can build deeper connections with both current and potential customers.
Although most Internet users know that businesses are listening to what they have
to say online, a majority believe that brands should respond only to online com‐
ments made directly to them. Being aware of what people are saying about your
brand and products is a critical (and totally legit) part of a marketing strategy, but
be careful about how you use that information—not because it’s against any laws
or site terms, but because it makes your followers and customers more comfortable.
How Black Hat Tactics Hurt You
Having too few fans of your business seems a bit like having a social gathering with too
few guests. As the desire for social proof grows, so too can the desire to buy Facebook
fans or Amazon reviews. That purchase will cost you a lot more than you’re anticipating.
If you are wrestling with this idea, think about a friend who is looking for a meaningful
relationship. How effective would it be to purchase escort services to find a date? OK,
it would certainly be one of the easiest, fastest ideas, and perhaps in the short term it
may appear as if our single friend sure knows a lot of women who are interested in him
personally. But hiring services to give the appearance of popularity most likely will not
lead to any kind of long-term relationship. The same is true with Facebook.
Relationships cultivated on Facebook are the true value indicator; they are what make
it worth your time and money. In fact, buying fans removes one of the great functions
of Facebook: its natural filter. If you are strategic about your efforts, your fans will join
you because they are interested in your business. They are qualified leads, not anony‐
mous and nonparticipatory numbers. In fact, a 2010 study by Chadwick Martin Bailey
and iModerate Research Technologies revealed that over 50% of Facebook fans were
28 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

more likely to buy and recommend products and services that they had engaged with
on Facebook.
If you try to demonstrate your social proof by buying fans, you are clouding your ability
to read what your customers actually want. When you send out a fan-only promotion
and a certain percentage respond, your statistics will be skewed because of your inflated
fan base. That’s just the beginning of troubles you could encounter with purchasing
fans.
You are not the only one who notices the sudden increase in likes or followers. Having
fans who are not interacting with your business page can negatively affect your visibility.
Facebook’s algorithm determines what information will make it into News Feeds, and
the affinity score is part of that equation. The affinity score is based on the number of
interactions you have with your fans. As fans interact with your page by commenting
or sharing information, your affinity score is positively impacted. The more fans you
have engaging with your page and content, the greater your chances are to appear in
future News Feeds. If you decide to buy Facebook fans, they will most likely not be
interacting with you, and therefore will reduce your affinity score. In an effort to boost
your social proof, you could actually make your updates and links disappear from the
News Feeds of your true fans.
For people who are looking for quick results, legitimate paid traffic can be the perfect
social proof boost. If you have not done so, consider a Facebook ad campaign. By cre‐
ating an extremely targeted ad campaign on Facebook, you can attract the kind of fans
who will gain value from your business.
Shy away from short-term strategies. Remember that your social media plan is not a
sprint, it’s a marathon. There are valid white hat techniques for getting a quick boost,
but buying fans isn’t worth the time, the money, or the buyer’s remorse.
Integrate Social Media into a Larger Campaign
You probably already have some kind of marketing program that is funded and working,
whether or not it includes online resources. So how do you add social media to that?
What do you do about budgeting and resource distribution? The details of this situation
can be overwhelming, so start simple: focus on an upcoming holiday and create a cam‐
paign that offers a holiday special. This is a paradigm that you’re already familiar with
as a consumer and an entrepreneur, and the fundamentals are the same as with other
marketing methods, so you can safely gain a lot of experience in creating ads and cam‐
paigns and measuring success.
Integrate Social Media into a Larger Campaign 
| 
29

Before jumping into any campaign or spending any money on ads,
be sure to read Chapter 6 so that you have a firm understanding of
how to create and monitor ads on social media.
Holiday sales can apply to any industry, product, and service. Even if you are selling
tickets to an event, you can sell advance tickets as part of a holiday promotion. Here are
some general tips and guidelines for using a social media holiday campaign as a way to
begin integrating social media into an existing marketing effort:
Design a promotion, contest, or offer.
Choose something easy and fun for your promotion. If this is memorable and re‐
markable, then you’re far more likely to gain traction on Facebook. If you’re having
difficulty coming up with an idea, then aim for something simple, such as a “like
this video” post, a news update, a behind-the-scenes photo album, or a sneak peek
of a new product.
Create a custom landing page on Facebook.
Facebook should almost always be the core of your social media marketing strategy.
Beyond your corporate page (and possibly also product pages), you can create a
custom Facebook landing page for this holiday campaign. Not only does this in‐
crease conversions for people who are using Facebook, it also adds another layer of
metrics (through Facebook’s page visitor stats) beyond what is provided by the
advertiser—even if that advertiser is Facebook.
Use tracking links for all Facebook posts, ads, and promotions.
This data is going to come in handy later. It may be worth the time and expense to
set up a Bit.ly link to both shorten the URL and track the traffic generated by your
post (there are many other sites that will just shorten the URL, if that’s all you’re
after). This is especially important when sales/conversions are your goal.
Post a related photo/video on your Facebook page with a one-sentence description.
Create a photo to promote your contest/offer and post it to your company’s Face‐
book page. A screenshot of a video works wonderfully because the “play button”
icon in its center encourages people to click the photo and engage with your post.
In terms of the text content, keep it short and simple. If you have more to say, add
it in a comment below the post. Shorter is better on social media. Short, choppy
sentences work best.
Use the “Boost post” feature for simpler, easier post promotions, such as targeting more
of your fans.
This ensures that your fans get to see your post in a crowded and active activity
stream. That means that they’re more likely to like, comment, and share. Only a
single digit percentage of fans see your posts without paid promotion. Because this
30 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

is a special promotion (not an everyday post) and you’re looking for a sales boost,
pull out all the stops.
Create a Promoted Post.
In the Ads Manager on Facebook, you can create a Promoted Post to promote this
post in a different way. Use clever targeting to ensure a strong message-to-market
match. You can promote this to fans only, but you can also set up a targeted dem‐
ographic if this post will appeal to people outside your current group of fans.
Continue to post once or twice per day.
Regular posts increase engagement and will boost traffic before the holidays. Out
of ideas? Try these: helpful hints, tips, recipes, photos, videos, family traditions,
questions, and surveys. Have fun with your posts, reply to everyone who comments
or shares, and hit the Like button on their comments. Delete/ban/block anyone
who harasses you, and encourage your existing fans with thoughtful replies and
comments.
When your holiday campaign is complete, you’ll have engagement data to examine and
costs to analyze. Determine what was most effective, and use that to rethink your overall
marketing strategy inclusive of social media.
Make Your Website More Social
There are lots of ways to make your site more social. First, you must consider what sort
of site it is and what makes sense in terms of engagement. Then you must consider the
three types of social interaction: following/liking, sharing, and commenting.
Like/Follow Buttons
Traditional corporate websites don’t usually offer much interaction for visitors—per‐
haps some kind of opt-in or lead qualification form, but beyond that there is rarely
anything interactive. More social-savvy companies will add some social media interac‐
tion buttons that enable you to like or follow the corporate page or account. It’s always
a good idea to have a Facebook Like button and a Twitter Follow button, assuming
you’ve got well-curated accounts on each. If you are sufficiently invested in a niche social
network, and it has a good button that follows this paradigm, then it usually makes sense
to add that to your site as well.
However, when you’re adding social media buttons to a corporate site, be careful that
you don’t go overboard. Too many buttons leads to clutter in the site design, and can
discourage interaction. Good social media buttons are obvious as to what site they
represent, and are easy to interact with. These should also be social networks that you’re
actively participating on; you don’t want to lead your customers and prospects to a social
network that has no content on it.

Share Buttons
And then there are share buttons, which automate the process of posting a link to a
visitor’s personal social media page, or to a social news or discussion site. In general,
share buttons are of very little value for corporate content. If the content is not inter‐
esting, then don’t offer to share it. Certainly don’t offer to share it in an automated and
generic way as part of your site navigation.
There is usually a wide array of options for share buttons and widgets. Some social
networks have an option for a link that you can use with or without your own graphics;
some set the baseline a little higher than that, and offer buttons that have a small icon
that represents the social network’s logo. Then there are larger buttons, and buttons
with dynamic content such as the number of shares or comments that this page has
received.
Show the buttons with numbers only if you have, or reasonably expect to quickly have,
a significant number of shares. If your buttons show that you have zero shares, then
you’re going to look like a loser.
If you have a blog or some other content-heavy site, share buttons and small widgets
may make more sense than on a static corporate site. However, most visitors have their
own preferred methods of submitting links to social news and discussion sites, so if you
add too many social media share buttons, visitors are unlikely to use most of them and
the buttons will just clutter up your navigation.
Content sites are also a good use case for the small widgets that show the number of
shares this page has received. If you’re promoting your site decently, the number
shouldn’t ever be at zero, so there’s not much risk of looking weak. New visitors who
find your content through social media or social news sites are late to the party, so they’ll
see a ton of social proof when they arrive at your content. That may well encourage them
to like/follow/friend you and become a regular visitor.
Liking something on Facebook or following a site or company on Twitter isn’t just a way
for customers and prospects to stay up to date; it’s also a kind of vote. They’re telling
their friends and colleagues that they publicly acknowledge their admiration for your
company, brand, product, or content.
Sometimes it’s just silly to include a particular social media button, such as when you
have a Pin It button on a page with no real graphics to pin. If there’s something that
people want to share photos of, put the button there. However, the content on the page
with the Pin It button must be worthy of being pinned. On the other hand, putting up
a link to your Pinterest boards can help you get more followers on Pinterest, even on
pages where you don’t have any graphics. A classy way to add pinning functionality is
with a “Pin It” hover button that appears only when a cursor is placed over the image.
This is easily accomplished on your WordPress blog with the Pinterest Pin It Button for
Images plug-in.

Figure 2-2. An example of a good social media widget
In our opinion, the worst of the worst are the widgets (defined in the next section) that
act as collections of share buttons for a large number of social networks. When you
mouse over one of these widgets, it automatically pulls out into a larger area of the
screen, which covers up your content or navigation and in general annoys the heck out
of your visitors. We recommend that you never use these kinds of add-ons for your site.
Widgets
A widget is more than just a graphical link to a social network; it actually provides a
window into what’s there. In terms of engagement, widgets are sort of a combination of
the like/follow and share paradigms. So, again, make sure that you have a decent presence
on any site for which you’re using a widget.
Good widgets are dynamic and interactive, and show some content from the site to
which they lead. The Pinterest widget shows thumbnails from your board, for instance
(the first image you submit to a board is the default thumbnail, but you may want to
change this manually if you have a better idea for a thumbnail image later). There are
many kinds of widgets that can show avatars of your fans, comments from your pages,
and other related content. Figure 2-2 shows an interesting, engaging, and unobtrusive
Facebook widget that can be easily integrated into a blog or website.
Make Your Website More Social

This figure shows a good use of a widget. It displays both a high number of likes, and it
shows mini-avatars of other people on Facebook who have liked this page. It shows both
social proof and relevancy.
Cross-Posting
Cross-posting is submitting content to one online location and then having that service
automatically distribute it to all other social network accounts belonging to the user.
The benefit of this is obvious: your post reaches a larger number of viewers. A service
such as Hootsuite will manage and measure your engagement with social networks. It
can schedule messages and tweets, track brand mentions, and analyze social media
traffic. Note, however, that while cross-posting can save time, posts that you publish
using third-party applications (particularly with Facebook) can get less visibility than
those you manually post to Facebook.
Adding Comments
If you don’t want to direct all feedback and user interaction to social media, you can
integrate a third-party comment system into your website. Most content management
systems have plug-ins or extensions that add this functionality seamlessly. If possible,
that’s probably the option you should take, so long as your webmaster, sysadmin, and
web designer agree.
There are also third-party comment solutions that are easily implemented on a per-page
or sitewide basis. Two that we confidently recommend are:
Bazaar Voice
Offers various feedback tracking systems, including an Amazon-like review system
that you can integrate into your ecommerce site
Disqus
A full-featured open source comment system that can be integrated easily into any
site
Again, solutions like these don’t always make sense for corporate websites. For ecom‐
merce and content sites, however, they are a must-have.
Another option is to integrate Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ comments into your site.
Every comment posted through one of these plug-ins will show up on the social network
that is hosting it. A lot of people aren’t comfortable with this, so unless you have a
thriving social media community around your business or brand already in place, it’s
probably not going to help you to directly integrate a social media–based comment
system.

Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

Customize Your Channel
Regardless of which social media sites you participate in and how you are using them,
you must customize your pages on those sites and make them distinctive. Use your logo,
your colors, your graphics, your fonts—customize everything. Make your social media
pages look like they are natural extensions of your official website.
Here are some examples of well-customized pages: 
• https://twitter.com/sspencer
• https://www.facebook.com/TheJimmyHarding/
• http://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm/
• http://universalhorrorfilms.tumblr.com/
• http://www.youtube.com/user/GibsonGuitarCorp/
Some social sites allow more customization than others. Whatever sites you’re partici‐
pating on, you should push customization to the limits. Also, this is something you
should have a professional designer do, if you have the budget or staff for it. It’s not
enough to just look different; it also has to look professional.
Listen to the Conversation, Then Join In
Upon entering the social media realm, your first instinct may be to announce your
amazing, finely crafted, heartfelt marketing messages to the entire universe. Or maybe
you did that before you bought this book, and are now digging yourself out of an ava‐
lanche of failure. In any case, this is a bad tactic.
Social media is about conversation, connection, and sharing. Sharing, mind you, is a
two (or more)-sided relationship. If you’re blasting out your marketing messages, that’s
pretty one-sided, and it’s not what people are on social media to consume. There are
some exceptions to this—such as extremely famous celebrities who might post messages
about their new album or television show—but they already have a very large captive
audience that is used to listening without interacting. Even then, the audience is inter‐
acting with one another, so there is still a discussion taking place. You aren’t a celebrity
with a huge following, though, so your audience sees you as an equal, and expects more
interactive social media behavior from you.
So how do you turn your marketing instincts into worthwhile social media habits? By
participating in the conversation, by providing shareable material, and by connecting
with people who are interested in topics that are related to your industry. Don’t dive in
right now, though—this chapter is about creating a strategy. The execution of specific
tactics comes later.
Customize Your Channel 
| 
35

Start with the connection part. Make a list of all of the famous people in your industry,
past and present. Thought leaders, CEOs, inventors, and competitors are all good ex‐
amples. Ask yourself how the people on your list would use the social networks that
you’ve targeted, or take a look and see if they have accounts on those sites. The people
who are following your list of industry leaders are the same people who are likely to
follow you. Your participation strategy should be:
1. Observe the state of the conversation as it is now.
2. Begin participating in the conversation.
3. Build a community.
4. Start working your marketing into your normal social media routine.
You don’t need an audience; you need a community. The easiest way to build a com‐
munity around your brand is to create a dialogue with your customers.
Like a party with no attendees, a social media page with posts that don’t have comments
from followers is creepy and embarrassing. Nobody wants to be the sole commenter.
You could comment on your own posts (perhaps from your personal account), but that
might also look silly. Consider getting some friends to post a few comments on posts
that you make early in your page’s history so that newcomers will see a little bit of social
proof and find an easier way into the conversation.
Customer Outreach
Communication on social media should always be two-way. Ideally, you should get a
lot more back than you give out; for each post you make, there should be many com‐
ments, shares/retweets, and likes. It may take some time to build up your community
if you are just now starting from scratch, but once you get rolling it should be a fun and
interesting dialogue.
It’s easy to focus just on what you post and how it is received, especially if you’re a data
wonk. You can pore over the metrics and try to improve your engagement constantly,
and never spend one moment considering what people are actually saying when they
are interacting with your company’s social media pages. That is a big mistake.
Social media is the perfect platform for customer outreach—getting feedback from cus‐
tomers, answering questions from prospects, and connecting with bloggers and influ‐
encers with the hope that they’ll be interested in your stuff and help promote it to their
followers.
This is pretty easy to do if you’re on only one or two social networks. Once you get to
three, though, it can become much more difficult to manage. That’s why there are tools
for social media monitoring. There are a lot of sites and programs that do this, though
36 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

most of them are specific to Twitter, or cover only the big social networks. Here are
some examples that we think are worth your consideration: 
• TalkWalker
• social mention
• Trackur
• Twillow
These can also be great resources for keyword research when you are looking for ideas
for new posts and blog content. For influencer outreach consider Pitchbox, a toolset
that works with the online influencers who can boost your search rankings if they link
to you.
Twitter and Snapchat as Customer Service Tools
You can take the conversation to the next level by using social media as a customer
service tool. Whenever someone complains about your brand, company, or product on
social media, reply positively and publicly so that potential customers see that you’re
concerned about solving customer problems.
Some companies are apprehensive about having social media play a role in their cus‐
tomer service strategy. They’re afraid that if a complaint is aired publicly, it could damage
an otherwise excellent reputation. However, when managed professionally, negative
comments have a tremendous positive impact on your public reputation.
Twitter, in particular, is excellent for identifying and resolving issues quickly while
showing that you are respectful of your customer feedback and active in maintaining
customer satisfaction. If you do happen to receive a negative tweet, be sure that you:
• Respond quickly.
• Be sincere, honest, and transparent.
• Provide solutions to the complaint.
• Provide a personal email address (not a generic “customer service department”
email).
• Don’t take it personally.
Another great customer service tool is Snapchat (a mobile app for Android and iOS that
enables you to take a photo with your tablet or phone, and share it with a select number
of people on a temporary basis). None of the photos are stored unless the sender chooses
to save them; Snapchat photos are intended to be ephemeral and candid.
Twitter and Snapchat as Customer Service Tools

37

So how do you use this app for customer service? If a customer receives a product that
is damaged, defective, or otherwise “not as advertised,” Snapchat is a much more reliable
and speedy way to directly see a picture of the problem.
Social Media for the Socially Challenged
Social media comes easily and naturally to extroverted people. Introverted people and
perfectionists, however, can have a difficult time coming up with things to say. Being
social is difficult for some people, even online where there is some degree of anonymity.
That doesn’t mean that successful social media marketing is only for the highly social.
Regardless of social ability, you must have a strong interest in whatever you are selling,
and you have to want to sell it. If you don’t have that kind of passion for your product,
you can’t expect to inspire it in others.
Don’t write content with your friends in mind. Instead, write for an audience of people
who are interested in the topic you’re covering. The quicker you get out of your circle
of friends and family—the people who care about you, not your art or business—and
into the land of interested prospects, the better. Get to the people who are interested in
this topic. Speak to the people who care about what you want to say. Join groups for
people who are interested in what you’re doing.
Does it have to be you who posts to your social media pages? Are you the only person
who can post? Perhaps your spouse, employee, marketing manager—someone you
know and trust who is better suited to the task—can do it for you, with some guidance.
You can also outsource the work to a good social media marketing firm. You’ll still have
to be involved on some level, but you won’t have to worry about the content of daily
posts. Just provide previous blog posts, videos, press releases, your product planning
calendar, branding guidelines, and overall marketing strategy to your social media firm,
and it can mine that for content.
If you’re the only person who can reasonably post to social media, plan out your posts
ahead of time so that you don’t have to deal with writer’s block on a daily basis; see “30
Days of Conversation Starters” on page 39 and modify it for your industry. You can even
sit down and create several days of posts and schedule them ahead of time, assuming
you are posting to a site that allows this (most do).
Get Ideas for New Content
You’ve probably got a bunch of ideas for social media content right off the bat. Eventually,
though, it gets tougher to think of new things. Here are some common fallback topics
for social media posts:
• Requests for feedback or opinion about products or events
38 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

• Free giveaways
• Fun images of your product
• Famous quotes relevant to your business
If you’re truly out of ideas after considering this list, then head to Yahoo Answers,
LinkedIn, and/or Quora and ask some questions relevant to your industry.
In the absence of new content, you can keep the conversation going by retweeting pos‐
itive tweets from followers and tweeting friendly replies to negative feedback. Using
mentions (@ on Facebook or Twitter, and + on Google+), you can reach a lot of people
quickly.
You can also search for good articles, photos, and videos that you already know are
somewhat popular. If there’s a tie-in to your business or industry, that’s even better!
reddit is an excellent source for quality content links, as are all of the major social book‐
marking and social news sites (Popurls, Flipboard, Delicious, StumbleUpon—pick one
you like and start looking for good links).
30 Days of Conversation Starters
Here’s a content plan that we sometimes use as a template for clients. The idea is to script
out the first month’s worth of content with the intention of jumpstarting a new com‐
munity and forming good social media habits to keep you going:
1. Share a photo behind the scenes at your business, factory, or office.
2. Link to timely news story that could impact your fans.
3. Ask your fans for questions that haven’t been answered.
4. As the saying goes, “Leaders are readers.” Ask your fans what they are reading.
5. Post a frequently asked question that you receive, and answer it.
6. Post a how-to video that solves a problem for your target audience.
7. Take a snapshot of your favorite “working remotely” place, and ask your fans where
they enjoy working when not in an office.
8. Share a cool quote (on a picture) that will be of value to your fans. Ask them to click
Like if they agree.
9. Ask, “What are your biggest issues, concerns, problems with __?” (insert something
related to your business).
10. Ask your fans to fill in the blank for a question like, “The goal I would most like to
achieve is __.”
11. Announce a deal that is available only to this specific social network, three days in
advance, and ask followers to watch for details.
Get Ideas for New Content

12. Ask whether your fans love or hate something timely and controversial in your
market.
13. Ask, “Considering our services (or product)?” and then add a testimonial from a
recent happy customer. Also, post a quick reminder about tomorrow’s deal.
14. Launch your site-specific sale or deal, and give it a short deadline. Promote one of
your products at a discount.
15. Share a blog post or status update posted by one of your faithful fans.
16. Ask a non-business-related question that almost anyone could answer—for exam‐
ple, “I need a terrific brownie recipe. Any suggestions?”
17. Have people describe, in a few words, their dream __ (the word in the blank depends
on your market).
18. Give two choices for your fans, such as: “Work from home or an office?”
19. Ask, “Who is the best __?” Fill in the blank with a word that connects to your market.
For instance: “Who is your best kind of client?” Or you could ask for a recommen‐
dation: “Who is the best expert for SEO?”
20. Ask, “What makes a business/service/restaurant [whatever applies to your compa‐
ny] successful?”
21. Ask, “When buying __ [a word connected to your market], what means the most
to you? What do you care about?”
22. Post “Click Like if you love __!” (Choose a word connected to your business.)
23. Ask for help. Post a question related to your business or something fun that your
audience could answer; for example, “I need help getting good examples of Face‐
book ads for a local business. Has anyone spotted one lately? If so, what made it
great? What stood out?”
24. Ask, “Do you think this is true?” Then post a quote. For example: “Do you think
this is true? ‘Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.’
— Winston Churchill.”
25. Ask, “What are your favorite __?” (insert: podcasts, magazines, YouTube videos,
fan pages, etc.).
26. Ask, “What do you think about __? Love it or hate it?” (Choose any topic related
to your industry.)
27. Offer a hot tip that will be extremely valuable to your fans. If one of your fans
recommended it, tag and publicly thank that person.
28. Ask, “Who wins: _ or _?” (Example: “Who wins: GPS or your sense of direction?”)
29. Post “Have you checked us out on __?” (Insert other social media platform with
link.) For example: “Have you checked us out on Pinterest [add link to Pinterest
address]?” or “Are you following us on Twitter [add link to Twitter address]?”

30. Ask a question that relates to a recent, popular blog post, then link to the blog post
in the first comment.
Content Marketing
If you’re writing blog posts or articles on a content site or a corporate blog, then you’ve
got a different set of variables to consider. Writing Twitter posts is one thing; writing
500- to 1,000-word blog posts is another. Again, this doesn’t have to be you doing the
writing. Blog posts and even magazine articles are easily outsourced to ghostwriters,
though good writers are typically not cheap. Mediocre writers abound in communities
like Odesk and textbroker, so be discerning. You need an outstanding writer to create
outstanding content.
Your goal should always be “to be linked to from everywhere.” You want your blog posts
to be popular so that a lot of people will visit your site, become aware of your company
and what it offers, and hopefully choose to follow you on social networks.
The key to writing great blog posts that have viral appeal is to write for the people who
obsessively link to things. That means writing for teenage alpha-geeks who have little
patience for literary fluff, viciously attack anything that looks like a sales ploy, and prefer
short and easily quoted material. Make your blog post easily scannable by breaking up
the paragraphs appropriately, and using lists whenever possible. In fact, if you can, make
everything a list. It’s long been a trick of tabloid publishing—even before the Web—to
put a number and a superlative in the headline to attract readers who are glancing at
the cover only for a few seconds. The word amazing is particularly good for headlines,
but overusing it will look ridiculous, so save it for when you really need it. The Moz blog
published the results of a fascinating study done by Conductor that measured how well
headlines resonate with readers. Of the sample, 36% preferred headlines with a number,
which is staggering next to the only 21% who chose the reader addressing style (“You
Need to See “) and 17% who chose how-to headlines.
Examples of engaging link bait headlines are:
• Top 6 Weirdest Things About Dog Food
• The 3 Incredible Things Bears Do That You Should Too
• 5 Things Your Spouse Is Hiding from You
• 12 Most Amazing Photos Ever Taken of Hamburgers
Brian Clark on content marketing blog Copyblogger published statistics that 8 out of
10 people will read a headline, but only 2 out of 10 will read the article. This is how
important headlines are. Some sites that really get that and are great for inspiration
are Huffington Post, Upworthy, Buzzfeed, and Viralnova. In real life, say you are waiting
Content Marketing 
| 
41

in the checkout line at a grocery store and you see an issue of Cosmopolitan. The head‐
lines are consistently juicy and exciting, and make you want to open the magazine right
there in line. These are the type of headlines you should strive for. Additionally, David
Snyder of content marketing firm CopyPress is quick to state on his blog that “content
drives traffic,” pointing to the same publications to watch such as Huffington Post,
Vice, and CBSi, where publishers are looking to diversify revenue streams by constantly
tweaking those headlines and lead-in photos, looking for the perfect hook. Look not
just at the headlines and images of the hook, but their positioning on-page, and how
sharing elements are baked into the landing page content to encourage further promo‐
tion.
Pack your article with quotable phrases and interesting but small graphics. If you have
the skills and time, infographics are a good addition to an article. Or, if you’re really
talented with graphics (or have access to someone who is), a large infographic can be
link bait all on its own.
If you need some specific examples of good viral posts, look at the front page of reddit
and Techmeme. The articles linked to on these sites are what is popular on the Internet
today. These are social news sites; they curate newsworthy stories through community
voting and discussion.
In terms of submitting links to social news sites, there aren’t usually solid rules against
it. However, if you’re seen as a self-promoter, you will be exposed and downvoted. In
some cases you may be blacklisted; community moderators determine what is and is
not allowed to be posted, so you are at their mercy in terms of what is right and wrong.
It’s perfectly all right—and encouraged!—to post links to your blog on your social net‐
work accounts, though. If you’ve built up a decent-sized community, someone therein
will submit your blog post to social news sites all on his own.
Create Apps
Social media apps are important because they have different functions. A Contest app
allows you to collect names and emails so that you can do email marketing. Then there
are other apps that connect social platforms. For instance, Twitter and YouTube will
show up on your Facebook page. It’s not that apps aren’t good, it’s that you need to
advertise in order to get your content shown—so you’d run ads to your app, not your
page.
The drawback with many apps is that they aren’t mobile friendly. Contestdomina‐
tion.com is a Facebook app that does provide a separate link to promote to mobile users.
Facebook offers the most prominent and technologically capable application platform,
but many other social networks have some kind of API that can be used to create an
app or extension. There is usually good documentation on social network app platforms
42 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

and APIs, and tutorials and examples as well, but if you’re serious about a highly pro‐
fessional online appearance, then this isn’t something you should do yourself unless you
have a strong background in software development. Even then, it’s still better to give
this task to someone who is already familiar with the platform you’re publishing on.
Some popular app development firms are: 
• App Development
• SocialCubix
• ConvoSpark
• ideavate
• AES Connect
• ShortStack
You can also try your luck on Elance or oDesk.
If you’re targeting Facebook, you’re probably better off going directly to Facebook’s
Preferred Marketing Developer (PMD) program. This is a community of top app de‐
velopers with social media marketing experience.
Real-Life Q&A: Facebook Apps
Q: How much does it usually cost to outsource app development (a range of figures)?
A: The numbers can be all over the map. Facebook app costs can range from as little as
$60 to as high as $50,000 depending on your idea and what you want the app to do.
To answer this question in more detail, we need to take a look at what is involved in
developing, marketing, and maintaining a Facebook app. While there are a variety of
models used to price application outsourcing services, the most prevalent model in‐
volves the following components:
• A fixed monthly charge for application support
• A fixed monthly charge for a baseline number of application enhancement hours
(typically included as part of the fixed fee for application support), with authorized
incremental hours charged on a time and materials basis
• A framework for pricing significant development work on a project-by-project
basis on a fixed fee, capped time and materials, or straight time and materials basis
Some developers want to be paid by the hour, and some prefer to be paid per project.
The more accurately you can describe the project to the developer, the more accurately
he can estimate the price.

For example, Bahndr, by Blue Label Labs, is a $30,000 social game built from scratch
with completely custom graphics; it could have cost double that had the project been
given to a larger shop.
On top of this, you can expect to spend $8,000–$30,000 on QA testing, depending on
the app. The more changes you need to make, the more you will need to spend for your
programmers to get rid of any bugs and improve usability.
Beyond development, there are costs associated with getting your app into relevant
online stores and marketplaces:
• Launching the app: $99 on the App Store, $25 to register on Google Play
• Infrastructure, servers, and other backend support: $100–$200/month
• Social media integration: $500–$1,500
• In-app purchasing: $1,000–$4,000
• Game Center: $1,000
• Marketing: $1,000–$3,000 on initial marketing campaigns

Calculate ROI
Anyone who invests funds into social media advertising must know how to correctly
measure the social media return on investment that she earns and if needed, alter her
strategy to increase the resulting figure.
44 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

Plan to start with a small amount of money so that you can form a safe baseline. For
example, advertising with Facebook will allow you to decide how much money you want
to spend on advertising per day. If you’re just starting out, having a daily limit that’s
relatively low (around $10) is a good idea.
Calculating ROI is fairly easy if you’re trying to directly sell a product or service because
all that’s needed is for you to calculate how much money you earn each day through
your advertisement. For example, if you’ve sold two $90 items on a certain day, and you
needed to spend $10 to do so, you’ve gained an $80 profit. Therefore, for every $10 you
spend, you make $80. This will probably scale linearly up to a certain point; we recom‐
mend you double a successful ad investment, and continue to do so until you reach the
point of diminishing returns. Then scale back to the sweet spot.
When It’s More Difficult to Work Out ROI
If your actual goal is to acquire more fans or followers (building your community)
instead of directly making product or service sales, calculating your ROI can be more
tricky because your return on investment is more long term than short term.
What this means is that if you manage to gain 1,000 followers after investing $35 on
advertising, your earnings will amount to zero in the beginning. However, if you develop
actual relationships with your followers, in the months ahead your number of followers
could increase as friends of your followers start following you as well, and a good amount
of these followers could begin purchasing your products.
If you’re trying to increase your number of followers, you still need to keep an eye on
the activities happening on your chosen social media site. For example, if you’re adver‐
tising on Facebook, and your daily advertising investment is $10, and there’s only a
handful of visitors liking your page, your ROI is probably pretty low. If that happens,
you’ll have to rethink your approach. If, however, your $10 gets you several hundred
likes, you could be on to something; keep these fans engaged and interested, and your
ROI could end up being reasonably high.
Making Social Media Advertising Work for Your Business
Be prepared to put forth a lot of hard work to make your advertising efforts successful.
It’s pointless to get fans if you don’t plan to give them anything in return. Simply posting
affiliate product links, however, is a sure-fire way to quickly lose followers.
Once your page has Likes, be sure to keep your audience engaged! Post images, chal‐
lenging questions, and interesting comments, and be an eager participant in conversa‐
tions. Click Like on your fans’ pages and comments, too! If you can successfully build
solid relationships with your fans, your ROI will most likely be high.

Real-Life Q&A: Metrics and ROI
Q: There are so many tools for measuring demographics and other metrics. You’ve
mentioned a few so far in this book. Some of them cost a lot of money, but seem like
they might be useful. What tools should I really be using, with so many to choose from?
A: Start with the free stuff. Maybe that’s all you’ll ever need, and maybe you’ll hit a
limitation at some point and need to switch to a commercial alternative. Facebook and
YouTube have free metrics built into their services. Use those to their full extent. Google
Analytics is both free and effective, and can be implemented on a number of different
websites. You can nab a ton of great information from this tool that most other web
analytics packages provide only at a price.
Q: Is there any basic analytics advice you can give someone who makes a lot of mistakes?
I’m, uh, asking for my friend.
A: The problem with measuring social media success, and why it’s often so difficult for
business owners and marketers, is that we look at it in social media terms rather than
in business terms. One of the top mistakes that businesses make is focusing on indirect
successes like how many followers, fans, and shares they have, when really they need to
be looking at the same old metrics that they use in traditional marketing: revenue, cost,
and sales volume.
Q: All right, I’ve set up some analytics, and I’m now flooded with data. What should I
look for among all these charts and percentages?
A: There are some metrics that marketers and business owners tend to pick up on and
know that they have to measure, like the number of visitors you’re getting from social
media and customer conversions. But there are other metrics that you should be looking
at too:
• Lead conversions (both hard and soft conversions)
• Cost per lead
• Cost per click
• Cost per inbound link
• Cost per site visit
Q: What is segmenting social media leads?
A: Segmenting your leads is basically taking the leads you have and separating them into
groups. Segmentation allows for more exact and effective targeting, and enables you to
send unique messages. For instance, you can segment by social behavior, geography, and
website interactions.
Q: Do I need to segment social media leads?
46 
| 
Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

A: Yes! If you want to run an effective online marketing campaign, and if you want to
be able to accurately go about measuring your social media ROI, then you need to
segment those leads. Segmenting your leads allows you to know not only what their
motivators and problems are, but also what sort of content you need to produce and
post to social media in order to move them along the sales cycle and increase conver‐
sions.
Don’t Break the Rules
How do you make sure that, as a business, you’re generating meaningful engagement
with your customers? That in the conversation, your business is coming across as social
media savvy? There are three social media rules that businesses often violate.
Think Before You Share
The Internet never forgets. Social media may feel casual, intimate, and temporary, but
your posts, comments, hashtags, likes, and images can be indexed, cached, and accessed
forever. Deleting something makes it only slightly less easy to find.
Approach social media content like any other aspect of your business communications:
professionally, and with a plan. Engage appropriately with your customers. If someone
writes an angry rant about your product on your Facebook page, it’s an opportunity to
demonstrate to other potential customers the value your business places on customer
service. Social media is not the place to respond with an angry insult.
Don’t Flood the Feed
A common complaint about businesses on social media is their tendency to flood the
feed. This means mass postings, updates, or tweets that overwhelm a user’s feed, and
lead very quickly to unfollowing, removing, or blocking your posts. Updating regularly
is important to keep people engaged, but putting 10 posts about sales, new products, or
other news up at once is a fast way to turn them off.
Attribute, Attribute, Attribute
While a lot of people are happy to share their work, and Creative Commons licensing
is more and more widespread, this doesn’t mean it’s OK to use people’s work without
attribution—especially if you’re a business. Nothing will anger people faster than using
their words, images, or other creative work without asking permission or properly at‐
tributing the work.
This is a big problem on Pinterest, for example, and the site has created an “attribution
statement” for specific websites, such as Etsy and Flickr, to try to address it. It’s good
Don’t Break the Rules

business practice to show that you understand the importance of this, and give the
creators credit where appropriate.
Summary
By this point you’re probably champing at the bit. Whatever mysteries you harbored
about social media marketing have just been fed with fresh clues, and you’re ready to
start taking action right now. You’ve scribbled down some ballpark figures for goals and
spending, and you’ve got some great ideas for Facebook posts and how you’re going to
customize your Twitter account.
Hang on, though—remember what we said about tactics without strategy? While blindly
applying some of the cool tricks we’ve talked about in this chapter will probably give
you some kind of improvement over your current condition, you are in danger of hitting
a wall of failure and frustration after your initial efforts fail to meet your expectations.
That’s why we’ve designed the following three chapters to funnel your efforts into pro‐
ductive strategies that will help your business. It’s extremely important to use the right
tool for the job. It’s also important to be patient and roll out a social media marketing
plan from a place of calm, educated determination.
Continue on to Chapter 3 if your business is selling physical goods through a website.
If you are selling a service or something that doesn’t have to be shipped or delivered in
person, then head directly to Chapter 4.
If you have a local storefront or restaurant, Chapter 5 was written specifically for you.

Chapter 2: Basic Social Media Strategy

CHAPTER 3
Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods
In the beginning of this book, we said that a successful strategy has three components:
intention, context, and tactics. This is why we have separated the sale of physical goods
—things that have to be stocked, pulled, packed, shipped, and warrantied—from the
sale of other sorts of things. There is a much higher barrier to entry for a physical sale
compared with other categories. A click on a link can put an item and a quantity into a
shopping cart, but the customer has to type in a lot of extra information to complete
the sale. When you put it into the proper perspective, it’s easy to see why a “physical
goods” ecommerce business wouldn’t want to use tactics designed for local businesses
or service providers.
A strong, competent social media presence will give you a competitive advantage that
separates you from your competitors. This is especially important in industries that sell
goods with long life cycles, such as tools and appliances. We’ve spoken to people at
marketing conferences who have very expensive, high-margin, niche-market, highly
reliable products that they sell to customers on a 10-year sales cycle. Losing one cus‐
tomer is a significant problem for the whole company. Those are extreme cases, but the
sentiment applies across the physical goods market segment: you’ve got to have the right
alignment of intention, context, and tactics to complete the sale.
Physical Goods That Do Well on Social Media
No matter what you’re selling, a good social media presence will help you in some way
—direct sales, customer service, or brand awareness. In our combined experience,
though, companies in or closely related to the following industries see a much more
significant sales increase through social media:
• Merchandise linked to bands, TV shows, movies, celebrities, and other pop culture/
entertainment categories
• Tickets to events
49

• Limited-edition items
• Auction sites (local, traditional auctions are more like local events or services, and
require a different strategy)
• Supplies featured in videos/training programs
• Children’s items
• Specific problem solvers that can’t be found in stores easily
• Specialist equipment
• Pet supplies: food, treats, beds, toys
• Craft supplies: plans, materials, kits, training
• DVD sets: personal development, unique or difficult-to-find items
Basically, anything that someone can’t easily go out to a store nearby and pick up locally,
or something that has to be highly customized, is going to do well with a good social
media strategy.
Let’s restate that for emphasis:
Hard-to-find and/or hard-to-get items, both of which get lots of search traffic and mo‐
tivated consumer interest on the Internet, represent major business opportunities in
ecommerce. Companies that focus on the hard-to-find and hard-to-get will have an easy
time increasing sales through social media marketing.
The Right Intent
Being successful on social media means engaging people with interesting content. You
must start with this mindset; if you don’t, you’ll default to “sales mode,” and be ignored
by the people you’re spending time and money to reach. Social media is where people
go to hang out and have fun with their friends. That makes it a bad environment for
selling stuff; everyone is focused on the content (the messages, photos, and links to
interesting things), not the sales pitches. Sales pitches are not usually shareable or in‐
teresting to people who just want to have a good time, unless your pitch is so over-the-
top that people enjoy making fun of it (think Billy Mays and the ShamWow Guy). So
the focus here is developing shareable content while reducing the salesy-sounding stuff.
Here are some guidelines for staying in the right frame of mind:
Bigger isn’t better.
You don’t need tons of fans to make sales. Social media engagement is definitely a
“quality over quantity” situation. Overlook the vanity metrics: likes, fans, friends,
and followers. Instead, focus on the actions that drive sales.
50

Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

Incorporate ratings and reviews on your sales pages.
Make them prominent. This is an excellent way to get simple, introductory en‐
gagement.
Reward people for referrals and recommendations.
Figure out why your current customers recommend you, and start using this in‐
formation to assist with your sales follow-ups.
Ask for the testimonial ASAP.
Get that review while the positive experience is still fresh in the customer’s mind—
not months later.
Engage.
Look for a problem you can solve and a question you can answer, and send a rele‐
vant, helpful response.
Listen.
Look for buying signals: questions, concerns, and complaints.
Be authentic.
Show the real you with photos of yourself, your staff, and your office. Show that
you’re a real business by posting videos of your office or warehouse.
Your site is your home.
Facebook “storefronts” are generally not successful; people prefer to purchase on
your website. When people view your content, they view it in their News Feed; they
rarely go back to your storefront.
Converting Leads into Customers
Hopefully you didn’t expect to just sign up on Facebook, post a few marketing messages,
and kick back to watch the orders pour in. If so, if our advice up to this point hasn’t sunk
in then now’s the time to sober up.
You have to do more than post stuff to social media. That serves a purpose and it is
important, but it’s not the whole plan. To turn more friends and fans into customers,
you’ve got to create plenty of content to support the sales process. That means how-to
guides, videos, case studies of success stories, newsletters, updates, niche landing pages,
in-person events, conference attendance coverage and reports, blog posts, and podcasts.
This is called education-based marketing.
One of the mistakes that businesses make when entering the social network realm is
that they overfocus on indirect successes like how many followers, fans, and shares they
have. Beware! The same criteria apply in the social network marketing world as in the
traditional marketing, brick-and-mortar world: revenue, cost, and sales volume. Social
media is often looked at as being different and special when compared to traditional

marketing, but the basic theory and most of the intention behind the practice are actually
quite similar. Think about how you’ve successfully taken “cold” leads and turned them
into “warm” leads in the past, through other channels. Identify the key triggers and steps
you took to convert them, then think about how you can transfer that to social media.
Here are some basic tips:
Build an email list.
Pay once; promote forever for free. Since someone’s already bought from you once,
that makes that person an excellent target for your new products, events, advice,
and feedback. Practically every successful ecommerce business does this.
Make it easy for people to purchase.
PayPal and other checkout services will help get you more sales because your cus‐
tomers will already have an account set up. All they have to do is sign in and complete
the sale. You also won’t have the added security concerns with handling and po‐
tentially storing credit card data and personal information.
Link directly to the item’s sales page whenever possible.
Sometimes the best landing page is the product page, assuming it has good navi‐
gation and is easy to perform a low-effort sale for your visitors.
Provide incentives.
Offer discounts for customers who write reviews (on social media, Yelp, or your
product page), or for people who like/friend/follow your page. Be careful not to
cross the ethical line of requesting that people write positive reviews.
Forming a Superior Strategy
Now that you’ve established proper context and intention for the sale of physical goods
on social media, it’s time to commit to a plan. Use this list as a framework for your
strategy:
Prepare your landing pages_. Don’t start marketing until your sales infrastructure is
ready. Make sure all of your ducks are in a row on your online store.
Set goals and checkpoints.
How many sales and/or referrals is it reasonable to expect from your social media
work? This is a hard question to answer accurately. Try to choose a conservative
estimate so that you aren’t discouraged with sluggish results. Some markets can be
slow to reach, and will take more effort over a longer period of time.
Make a content plan.
We published a good content plan in Chapter 2 that you can easily adapt for your
market. You must have some kind of plan for how things are going to play out. For
instance, it does no good to offer an amazing deal if you just set up your Facebook
52 
| 
Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

page 10 minutes ago. You need an audience first, and then you need some engage‐
ment, and then you can push it over the edge with a special offer.
Establish a presence.
Identify the social networks that you’re prepared to maintain a presence on and set
up your pages there. Make sure it’s fully customized and has a good account name
that represents you properly.
Build a “starter” audience.
Advertise and promote your social media pages to build an audience. Only you can
determine how much is a good minimum target. It may be 500 Twitter followers,
or 1,000 Facebook likes. This is just the beginning—what you jumpstart your social
media marketing effort with. This number is not the endgame goal. You should
have some good starter content to post as well; this might be a good time to release
some of your supporting material—the how-to guides and other ancillary market‐
ing materials that you will offer on a permanent or long-term basis.
Execute your content plan.
Start posting on the schedule that you’ve laid out for yourself. Your content plan
might allow for a minimal audience at first, so you don’t necessarily have to wait
until you have your target “starter” audience in order to start posting.
Increase engagement.
Now that you’re up and running, the stats and feedback should have some hints as
to what kind of content is and is not working. Streamline your efforts, adjust your
content plan, and advertise and promote to gain maximum engagement (not max‐
imum likes/fans—you only want good leads at this point).
Site-Specific Tactics
Now that you have a plan, you must identify tactics to help you achieve it. We’ve already
covered the basics in the previous chapter, but now we’re going to get more specific for
your industry segment.
When it comes to selling physical goods, there are few social media boundaries. Which
networks will give you the most return for your time and money is more about the kind
of things you are selling. LinkedIn, for instance, is probably going to be a total loser for
you if you’re selling custom poker chips. If you’re selling a revolutionary new kind of
office chair, however, it might yield some results.
Facebook
Facebook should be your go-to social network for advertising physical goods. The ads
are usually inexpensive, the audience is gigantic and diverse, you can easily target a
specific market, and it’s easy to announce promotions.
Site-Specific Tactics

53

Some products are sold through a long-term sales process, and others are impulse buys.
Figure out which one your product is—this may be different online than it is in a physical
storefront—and modify your strategy to account for it. If it’s over the impulse buy
threshold (if visitors have to research or think about it, or invest a lot of cash), then
you’re better off getting an opt-in to build your list and reconnect with them later.
Simple, inexpensive, no-brainer purchases are within the impulse buy limits and can
be sold directly very effectively. If you’re selling many different products, it will take
some work to determine the threshold for your customers. If it’s over the threshold,
then direct your Facebook ad to an opt-in landing page that starts the sales process with
a good initial message and a quick and simple name and email collection form; if it’s
under the threshold, then it’s an impulse buy, and you should direct the click to the
ecommerce product page for that item.
Regardless of which path you take, don’t change your tracking code or analytics. You
still want to know how people are finding you and what they’re doing while they’re on
your site.
Twitter
Twitter is useful for customer service and brand/product awareness, but it isn’t much
of an advertising platform. If you have a decent number of followers, Twitter is great
for announcing sales, new products, deals (if you want to track Twitter referrals, make
a special “Twitter only” deal), coupons, and specials. For selling physical goods, Twitter
is a secondary network. It’s worth participating, but the benefits are indirect.
YouTube
YouTube does offer advertising, and it is worth your while to do a preliminary ad cam‐
paign through sponsored videos and in-video ads. It’s going to be more expensive than
Facebook, but you definitely want to keep YouTube in mind as an advertising platform
once things get rolling.
Nothing you post on Twitter will ever go viral and make thousands of sales for you. A
good video, however, can do exactly that.
YouTube was practically made for product demos. It’s almost impossible to talk about
the benefit of YouTube without slipping into “case study” mode, which we’ve already
done with Blendtec earlier in this book. There are hundreds of great examples out there,
but one that comes immediately to mind for the subject of physical goods ecommerce
direct sales is Pro Guitar Shop. The store’s frontman, Andy, posts videos that expertly
demonstrate guitars, effects pedals, and amps. Occasionally he’ll also post a video show‐
ing how to play famous classic rock songs, featuring equipment that Pro Guitar Shop
sells. The store also advertises its contests and giveaways in its YouTube videos to drive
traffic back to the store site. The contests are, of course, opt-ins for the weekly email
54 
| 
Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

newsletter. It’s a brilliantly planned and executed marketing operation. As of the pub‐
lication of this book, Pro Guitar Shop had more than 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.
This is how one privately owned storefront in Oregon can compete with huge national
chains like Guitar Center and Sam Ash. In many instances these stores sell the same
equipment at the same prices, and have the same manufacturer-sponsored sales at the
same times. All other things being equal, social media engagement and good content
can end up being the deciding factor for someone with cash to spend.
Instagram
Instagram is hugely popular, and it would be foolish to ignore it. On the other hand, it’s
difficult for some businesses to figure out how to use it effectively. It can be great way
to get some buzz going around your brand. The catch is—as with any marketing effort
—that you need to figure out why you’re using it, determine what theme or message
you’re hoping to convey with your content, and then continually engage with other
Instagram users.
Unlike other social networking sites, Instagram doesn’t offer a separate type of account
for business. It’s also not web-based; it’s an app for smartphones and tablets. You can
only sign up for an account on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device.
Ford Motor Company has a great Instagram page, shown in Figure 3-1.
If you’ve determined that Instagram is useful to you and you are committed to making
it a part of your overall strategy, the first step is to establish an account and get the app
onto your devices.
Next, connect your account to your other ecommerce social media profiles, like Twitter
and Facebook. Connecting your social media accounts will allow you to easily find
others to follow on Instagram. It will also allow for easy cross-network sharing of your
photos.
Unlike some other social networks, you can and should start posting content right away,
but don’t neglect community building. You ultimately need followers on Instagram in
order to succeed there, but people aren’t going to follow an account with no pictures.
So what’s a good amount of starter content? Perhaps 5 to 10 good, shareable images—
or more, if you’ve got a lot of material to work with. Your instinct is probably to post
photos of your products, and that’s fine; it’s a good idea. Just don’t get locked into think‐
ing that this is the only kind of photo that you can or should share. Change things up,
keep things fresh, and constantly ask yourself what images speak to your brand’s per‐
sonality. Here are a few ideas for types of photos you could post:
Site-Specific Tactics

55

Action shots.
Don’t just post perfectly lit “studio shots” of your products. Show people using them
effectively. Show people having fun using them. These should be candid photos,
not composed ones—or at least, they should appear as though they are candid.
Behind-the-scenes photos.
Show some of the personality behind your brand. Introduce fans to your staff and
to your family, or snap photos of “a day in the life of Sue’s Shoes’ CEO.” You can
even create a special hashtag to highlight the production of your products, from
factory to floor—for instance, #MakingSuesShoes.
Contests.
Contests are a great way to connect with customers and to spread the word about
your products. Solicit photos from your customers, and give them a contest-specific
hashtag to use. For instance, for Sue’s Shoes you can ask participants to post a picture
of their favorite shoes with the hashtag #WinSuesShoes. Better yet, have them post
a picture of their favorite pair of Sue’s Shoes.

Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

Something crazy.
This is not for everyone, but if your brand supports it, try posting something bizarre
yet related to your products. It just may attract the attention of people who have
previously ignored your images.
There are three good ways to find people to connect with:
Use Instagram’s “Find and Invite Friends” feature.
If you didn’t already do this when you went through the registration process, simply
open the Instagram app, click on the gear icon at the top right of your profile, and
select “Find and Invite Friends.”
Search for users and hashtags on Instagram.
Look for people and hashtags who are related to your industry. There may be other
businesses you can follow that are related to your industry but aren’t direct com‐
petitors.
Comment on other people’s pictures.
This gets your name out there in front of a lot of other people who can potentially
follow you. Commenting on photos is far more effective than simply clicking Like.
If nothing else, definitely comment on photos that mention your brand.
You may also want to set up a dedicated page on your ecommerce site for Instagram
photos. Not all of your customers (or potential customers) are going to be on Instagram;
why should they miss out on the fun? Create a separate page on your site just for your
Instagram photos. There are a few third-party sites that allow you to easily do this. The
ones we’re aware of are: 
• Websta
• Followgram
• IconoSquare
Hashtags are extremely important on Instagram. They enable your image to be indexed
on each tag’s page, which makes it easy for people to search for and find your images.
For example, if your ecommerce business (Sue’s Shoes) sells designer shoes, you may
want to use hashtags like #designershoes, #shoes, and #suesshoes. You can also use
hashtags that describe specific products or product lines.
A word of warning: use popular hashtags sparingly. While they do receive lots of
searches and uses, this also means your image won’t stay at the top of the list for long.
#shoes, for instance, is too popular to get much exposure from, as you can see in
Figure 3-2.
Site-Specific Tactics 
| 
57

Figure 3-2. Searching for hashtags
Instead, use less popular, more specific hashtags so that you can have more than a few
seconds in the spotlight. Also, when you first start out—and periodically thereafter—
check to see what hashtags others are using for photos that are similar to yours, and try
them out.
Instagram allows you to add a brief description called a caption beside your photos. Use
captions to add a bit of personality to your photos, emphasize your message, or add
alternate perspectives to your images.
You can also tag photos of your favorite followers and they can do the same for you. To
do this, tap a spot on a photo and select a user’s name.
Be sure to let your other social media followers and contacts know that you’re on In‐
stagram so that they can begin following you. Even users without a smartphone or tablet
can view and follow your photos by accessing your web profile or the dedicated Insta‐
gram page on your website.
Pinterest
Much of what we’ve said about Instagram applies to Pinterest. Social photo-sharing
strategy doesn’t change much among different sites. Pinterest has a few fundamental
differences from Instagram, though: it’s a real website (not reliant on mobile devices),
you can pin videos as well as photos, you can put prices on images (which will add them
58 
| 
Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

to the Gifts section), hashtags aren’t very useful, and boards make it much easier to
organize photos by subject.
Pinterest is widely known as a source of recipes. So if you’ve got a food-related business,
photos of the recipe, the process of making it, and the finished product are all excellent
Pinterest content. Pinterest also does well with apparel retailers; you can pin several
different views of an article of clothing, show it on different models with different colors
and sizes, or perhaps show a celebrity wearing it.
If you can, include text on the actual image; it will increase the photo’s chances of being
shared. Also include prices with all of your product images. According to ecommerce
software and service provider Shopify, pins with prices get 36% more likes than those
without. Unlike social networks like Facebook or Twitter, which are focused much more
on social interaction than products, you don’t need to be worried about scaring people
off by including prices on Pinterest. In fact, including a dollar sign with your pin will
make it appear in the Gifts section of the site (see Figure 3-3).
Figure 3-3. The Gifts section of Pinterest
Site-Specific Tactics

Pinterest may be product-based, but it is completely fueled by user interaction. Show
some appreciation for your loyal and active pinners by making sure you follow them,
repinning their content, and engaging with them by commenting on their pins. You can
even create a repin board specifically for posting their pins.
Don’t count on your ecommerce site visitors having a Pin It bookmarklet or browser
plug-in. Although avid users will likely have one of these, many users will not. To ac‐
commodate them, include a Pin It button where appropriate on your site so that your
photos are easy to share, but don’t overdo it. You can also use the Button and Widget
Builder to install board widgets on your site to enable you to invite people to follow
your pins or use the cool mouseover widget that shows the Pinterest logo when you
hover your mouse over a picture (Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-4. Pinterest Button and Widget Builder
Don’t just pin products; pin other types of images as well, such as quotes, memes, and
creative images that your audience would find interesting. Think outside the box and
ask yourself what images or quotes your followers would enjoy that would also be con‐
sistent with your brand. 3-5 and 3-6 show some examples of such content.

Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

Figure 3-5. An example of a pinnable ad graphic that doesn’t directly advertise a
product
Include good keywords in your image description. This will increase the chances of
someone finding your pin, both through Pinterest’s internal search and through external
search engines. Hashtags are not effective on Pinterest, and won’t increase a keyword’s
searchability. However, if you include hashtags in your description, and you link your
Pinterest account to your Twitter account, the hashtags will transfer to Twitter posts.
On Pinterest, however, a hashtag is not distinguishable from a normal word or phrase
in the description.

lowing without being too “salesy”
Also put a call to action in your description. It’s OK to admit that you’re a retailer on
Pinterest, so go ahead and include a good call to action in your pin’s description (see
Figure 3-7). Use phrases like “Click image to buy,” or “Visit our site for more info.” Links
in descriptions don’t work, but interested users can copy and paste the URL.

Figure 3-7. An example of a good call to action that shows the product in a creative

Leverage other social networks to increase Pinterest followers; promote your pins to
your Facebook fans and Twitter followers. A great way to do this is to hold a “pin it to
win it” contest, and promoting it via other social networks.
Case Study: Pinterest versus Facebook
In early 2012, online fashion and jewelry retailer Boticca compared how Pinterest fared
against Facebook in terms of engagement levels, conversions, and sales on its primary
website.
Based on a sample of 50,000 Facebook users and 50,000 Pinterest users, Boticca found
that Pinterest users are typically not as engaged as Facebook users, and don’t convert as
well. However, overall:
• Pinterest users spend more than twice as much as Facebook users ($180 average
spend compared to $85 spend).
• Pinterest influenced 10% of Boticca’s overall transactions, compared to 7% from
Facebook.
• Pinterest helped Boticca acquire 86% more new users, as compared to 57% from
Facebook.
As with all social networks, the more active you are on Pinterest, the greater the benefits
to your business. And when used properly, Pinterest holds ever-increasing potential for
ecommerce businesses to increase engagement, visibility, and sales.

Tumblr
The multimedia-rich nature of the platform makes Tumblr an obvious choice for busi‐
nesses with high-quality photos or videos that need some traction. If you’re not able to
get high-quality photos of your products, then Tumblr probably isn’t for you.
Tumblr is also largely about curating content (collecting and sorting through images
and videos on a particular theme), and presenting and commenting on the most valuable
pieces. Content curation certainly can involve sharing your own content, but it also
means sharing excellent content by others. Only interested in posting photos of your
product? Then Tumblr may not work as well for you as you’d hope.
To this point, one of the industries that is using Tumblr most effectively is the fashion
industry. This probably comes as no surprise, given the highly graphic nature of the
industry. In fact, the very first ecommerce business to jump on the Tumblr wagon
was Of a Kind, a company that commissions limited-run pieces and promotes them
until they’re sold out. (See Figure 3-8.)
Figure 3-8. Of a Kind has a great Tumblr-based store
Claire Mazure, one of the company’s founders, said at the time of its launch, “We’re
bringing our product to a place where our customers are already sharing things they
love. I think Tumblr lends itself really well to the distribution of visual content. There’s
a rabid fashion following on Tumblr. And it targets early adopters.”

Case Study: Purveying Curiously Awesome Products
Vat19.com bills itself as a “purveyor of curiously awesome products.” We have to admit
that in researching for this case study, we were struck by just how awesome a lot of those
products really are (see Figure 3-9).
Figure 3-9. A sampling of Vat19.com’s “curiously awesome products”
The site’s owner, Jamie Salvatori, didn’t jump right into social media:
I was slow to believe in social media. Frankly, I’m not a huge fan of it from a personal
perspective. I remember staring at the status update box on Twitter and wondering to
myself, “What the hell do I have to say that would be of any interest to anybody?” It was
very intimidating, so I didn’t bother.
Essentially, it wasn’t until I started seeing Facebook URLs on TV commercials that I
thought it was necessary for my business. I didn’t think it would drive sales and I wasn’t
sure how we would use it. I thought that we wouldn’t have much to say other than to
announce new products or videos, which I thought would be redundant to our website.
Despite being experienced in ecommerce, Jamie admits that there were some early flaws
in his social media marketing plan:
Site-Specific Tactics 
| 
65

The two biggest mistakes were being so late to the party, and thinking that direct re‐
sponse advertising would work on social media.
We were one of the first to try Facebook Ads. We did it all wrong. We tried to get people
to leave Facebook, come to our website, and buy something. It was a nightmare. It just
doesn’t work that way.
In my experience, we could only use social ads to drive people to become fans of our
page. But even that wasn’t cost-effective because the value of a “purchased” fan appears
to be quite low. We track the conversions from every imaginable source. Social platforms
have the lowest conversion rates and the lowest number of conversions. It just doesn’t
drive new sales in the way that the search engines drive sales.
That being said, there is other value in social networks for businesses. The beauty of
the social network is to leverage a person’s existing personal connections to promote
your company. So, while you can create opportunities for existing customers to intro‐
duce your brand to their network of friends, I don’t think it always works well for the
company to be the one to make that initial introduction.
Essentially, we see Facebook as the ultimate platform for running a fan club for your
business. We assume that the people who have liked us on Facebook are superfans and
we try to give them the tools to promote us to their friends. We try to provide more
personal, behind-the-scenes engagement on social media.
No matter how you start out, your social media strategy has to evolve. Here’s how Jamie
stays current:
I read a few technology blogs to keep track of the bleeding edge. I also watch where my
friends are engaged. It isn’t that difficult to find out “what’s hot” if you keep your eyes
open.
Our strategy has evolved from at first trying to use it as a direct sales channel to treating
it more as a fan club platform. Once you view it in that light, it gives you a lot of great
ideas for what to post.
Additionally, social media has become an ad hoc customer support mechanism. How‐
ever, that’s simply a function of it being easier for a customer to fire off a tweet to @Vat19
than to load up our website, find the customer support form, and fill it out. There is
also some marketing advantage in other users seeing how quickly we handle the situa‐
tion.
Lastly, we asked Jamie to estimate how much it would cost to try to get these kinds of
results without social media (using traditional advertising, marketing, and customer
support methods):
All advertising works. It’s just a matter of effectiveness. I don’t think that social media
is an effective method for achieving direct sales. Or perhaps it’s simply difficult to
measure because the cycle can be complicated. Seriously, where did that order originate?
That’s a very difficult problem to solve as it could be a combination of many sources.
Again, I see social media as a fairly personalized medium, which is why I think that
businesses should view their connections as superfans. These are your best customers.
They are the ones who buy from you on a consistent basis. Your goal is to keep them
happy, keep them engaged, and keep them talking about you to their friends. This may
happen via their network or it may happen via word of mouth.
66

Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

I think it would be impossible to create a social “fan club” without social networks. They
provide a lot of value, but it can be easy to overstate its effectiveness. Basically, don’t put
all your eggs in one basket. Stay engaged with social networks, but don’t lose sight of
your goal as a business: sell stuff. Amassing fans is not the end goal. You can’t pay the
bank with likes. Rather, use it as a barometer. If you’re getting more fans, you’re probably
doing a lot of other things correctly in your business.
It would be criminal to mention Vat19’s social strategy without also mentioning its
YouTube channel. Its introduction video hits all the high notes: “Our killer philosophy
is to present killer products with killer photography, killer video, and killer descriptions.”
The channel has just under 700,000 subscribers, and they have over 440 million views
across all their videos. The company’s success comes from its remarkability. It of course
shows advertisements featuring a product, but adds an extra flashy and shareable ele‐
ment to each. For instance, the video for its product “The Beardo”, shown in
Figure 3-10, features funny graphics.
Figure 3-10. Vat19’s “Beardo” hat
The Vat19 YouTube channel has also created quite the reputation with its product music
videos. The videos use over-the-top flashiness paired with a mock-serious attitude that
perfectly fits the products being sold. The result is a super-shareable, hilarious promo‐
tional video. Figure 3-11 shows a screenshot from a music video the company made to
promote its 26-pound gummy bear.

Real-Life Q&A: Expanding Your Reach
Q: I built up a decent audience with ads and on-site promotion, and I am sticking to my
content plan, but very few people are interacting with me. I’ve got 500 likes on Facebook,
but no one is commenting on my posts. Where am I going wrong?
A: The number of likes or friends doesn’t represent your actual reach. Posting something
on Facebook puts it only on a small fraction of those 500 News Feeds. If there is some
initial engagement, the reach expands to a larger percentage. Those first few likes and
comments determine whether more people are exposed to your content.
That’s pretty frustrating, isn’t it? It’s a catch-22.
You may not be posting content that is interesting enough. It may not be engage-worthy.
Ask questions that people will want to answer. Let them speak out about something. If
you’re selling cellphone accessories, post a photo of an old rolodex and ask people what
they did to stay in touch with friends before they had a cellphone. If you’re selling beauty
products, ask your fans what makeup items they carry with them at all times.
68

Chapter 3: Marketing Strategy: Physical Goods

Always include an eye-catching image. They’ll be seeing your post in their newsfeed and
you need to catch their attention and pique their interest. Another way you can increase
engagement is to ask folks to play fun games like “Name a city in California that doesn’t
have an i in it.” Theme your posts, like Hangman Wednesday. Those are the types of
posts that are engaging and will get comments.
You may not have done anything wrong in setting up the ad. The problem may lie in
your headline, image, ad copy, or call-to-action. You should get in the habit of split-
testing your ads to discover the best performing variants.
Content must be more than just interesting. Many people are content to sit back and
read interesting content, but unless it inspires engagement, they aren’t going to interact
with you.
Q: I tried to make Google+ work for me by cross-posting all of my Facebook posts, and
then by writing posts with unique content, but there’s just no interaction. I’m in 11 circles
after months of posting. My girlfriend, somehow, is in more than 1,000 circles, and all
she does is post pictures of puppies and romantic movie quotes. Is that the secret—
puppies?
A: Maybe. Google+ interaction is heavily skewed in favor of picture posts and other
things that people can admire at a glance and click +1 on. There’s a good opportunity
to reuse content that you post to Instagram here. You can also host all of your pictures
in Picasa (the picture app built into Google+) and pin them or link out to them elsewhere
(as opposed to hosting them on Flickr or Facebook).
Maybe pictures of puppies aren’t such a bad idea. Borrow someone’s puppy and pose it
with your product. Make LOLcat memes about your brand.
Or you could have your girlfriend run your Google+ campaign for you. Clearly she has
some natural talent!
Summary
As an ecommerce entrepreneur selling physical things on the Web, you should now
have a realistic impression of how social media can benefit you. Social media is not a
miracle cure for anything, but it is a necessary component of a business that is at or near
the top of its potential.
You now also know what will and won’t work in terms of content posted to social media.
If you’ve already begun a social media marketing effort and are reading this book to get
some tips on how to achieve more success, we’re certain you’ve run into at least one
forehead-slapping moment in this chapter. It’s not too late to reform your social media
strategy.
The next two chapters deal with selling digital goods and services, and marketing a local
storefront. There is some overlap in content among these three chapters, but there are

many key differences in how a strategy is formed and refined, and some of the tactics
are dramatically different. Read on if you’re curious, but try not to let the wrong wisdom
influence what you’ve learned in this chapter. It makes more sense to go directly to

CHAPTER 4
Marketing Strategy:
Digital Goods and Services
If you just read Chapter 3, there probably isn’t going to be much in this chapter that is
useful to you. In fact, some of the information here could be harmful, if applied, because
it is geared toward a completely different market than the advice in Chapter 3. If your
ecommerce business is not selling digital goods and services (such as webinars, ebooks,
software licenses, online media streaming, etc.), then skip this chapter and head to
Chapter 6 to get a comprehensive education on ad design and testing.
In the beginning of this book, we said that a successful strategy has three components:
intention, context, and tactics. This is why we have separated the sale of digital goods
and services—things that are delivered and consumed digitally—from the sale of other
sorts of things. There is a low barrier to entry for this kind of sale compared with other
categories. This is where impulse buys thrive, and viral marketing can bring a tidal wave
of sales.
The key to successful ecommerce sales is driving prospects to opt in, partake in free
samples, and make impulse purchases. You can use these separately or combine them.
We’ll get into the details for both of these approaches in this chapter.
Let’s start with Figure 4-1, which shows a sales funnel as a visualization and planning
guide for your business.
Leads come into the top of the funnel through advertising and marketing channels such
as Facebook ads, Google ads, SEO, radio ads, billboards, etc. At the top of the funnel is
a lead magnet. This has to be an irresistible offer, basically an ethical bribe. In exchange
for someone’s name and email, you’re offering this great piece of information. It can be
a report, video, or downloadable tool—ideally something that is consumed in 5–10
minutes maximum. If it is longer than that, the person will feel obligated to wait until
she has time to consume the whole thing, which can slow the sales process.
71

sonal transformation assistance for geeks
Next in the funnel is the tripwire. A tripwire is a low-cost physical or virtual product
that is offered to clients. It can be a book that is free (other than shipping and handling),
or an online lesson or webinar for a low amount of money. As an example, say you sell
guitar lessons. A great tripwire would be a low-cost lesson on how to play the F chord,
since it is difficult for learners. Once people are pleased with the result they got from
the tripwire, they are more likely to buy the core product. Frank Kern calls this “results
in advance.” This “trains” people to get used to spending money with you. Essentially,
you are creating a list of buyers. Consider making your tripwire a physical product that
you ship. Nobody wants to go all the way to the post office to return an item just to get
a few dollars back.
Automation is so important in this step. Although this is the lowest amount of profit,
this step is critical in warming up a list of buyers for your core product and for profit
maximizers. But you don’t want to waste talent on the low tiers of profit, you want to
use it on the narrower end of the funnel. This is where automation comes in. If your
tripwire is something like a webinar, using automated emails or texts as reminders can
dramatically increase the show rate for webinars (which is usually less than half of the
sign-up rate).
The core product is the next thing in the funnel. This could be a $97 ebook, a $200
video-based course, or something else in that higher price range.
72 
| 
Chapter 4: Marketing Strategy: Digital Goods and Services

Profit maximizers are at the small end of the funnel. They could be a live event, a group
coaching program, or a yearlong mastermind program. If you don’t sell profit maxi‐
mizers, only your core product, you’re leaving on the table easily half the amount of
money that you could potentially make.
Change one-on-one consulting into a group coaching model. This means moving from
addressing individuals by one person at a time through your product, to addressing an
entire group simultaneously. Because you are addressing all of your clients at once, this
is the most fiscally smart and time wise option. It allows you to achieve scale.
Digital Goods and Services That Do Well on Social Media
No matter what you’re selling, a good social media presence will help you in some way
—direct sales, customer service, or brand awareness. In our combined experience,
though, companies in these industries see a much more significant sales increase
through social media:
• Books (links to Amazon/Audible; this is a grey area in terms of strategy because
you probably aren’t doing the fulfillment yourself)
• “Daily deals” sites, such as Groupon, AppSumo, LivingSocial, and Restaurant.com
• Apps—for mobile, Facebook, or browsers
• Bands and music promotion
• Games
• Software
• Video services (such as music lessons)
• Online coaching
• Webinars
The Right Intent
Being successful on social media means engaging people with interesting content. You
must start with this mindset; if you don’t, you’ll default to “sales mode,” and be ignored
by the people you’re spending time and money to reach. Social media is where people
go to hang out and have fun with their friends. That makes it a bad environment for
selling stuff—everyone is focused on the content, not the sales pitches—so work with
that instead of against it. Here are some guidelines for staying in the right frame of mind:
Digital Goods and Services That Do Well on Social Media

Bigger isn’t better.
You don’t need tons of fans to make sales. Social media engagement is definitely a
“quality over quantity” situation. Overlook the vanity metrics: likes, fans, friends,
and followers. Instead, focus on the actions that drive sales.
Incorporate ratings and reviews on your sales pages.
Make them prominent. This is an excellent way to get simple, introductory en‐
gagement.
Reward people for referrals and recommendations.
Figure out why your current customers recommend you, and start using this in‐
formation to assist with your sales follow-ups.
Engage.
Look for a problem you can solve and a question you can answer, and send a rele‐
vant, helpful response.
Listen.
Look for buying signals: questions, concerns, and complaints.
Be authentic.
Show the real you with photos of yourself, your staff, and your office. Show that
you’re a real business by posting videos of your office or studio.
Hopefully, you didn’t expect to just sign up on Facebook, post a few marketing messages,
and kick back to watch the orders pour in. If so, if our advice up to this point hasn’t sunk
in then now’s the time to sober up.
You have to do more than post messages on social media. That serves a purpose and it
is important, but it’s not the whole plan. To turn more friends and fans into customers,
you’ve got to create plenty of content to support the sales process. That means product
tutorials and demos, case studies of success stories, newsletters, updates, niche landing
pages, in-person events, conference attendance coverage and reports, blog posts, and
podcasts—in other words, education-based marketing.
Since “digital fulfillment” goods are pretty much exclusively marketed online, you
should already be familiar with the fundamentals of online sales and marketing. Think
of Facebook as an extension of your other online advertising efforts, to a certain extent.
Beyond that, social media is more about awareness and promotion. If you have a new
product and want to get maximum exposure for it, a contest or giveaway on social media
will work marvelously—better and more cheaply than any traditional AdSense or Dou‐
bleClick campaign.
You should have an idea of whether your products are “impulse buy” material or not.
If they are inexpensive and either very cool or very necessary, then they’re impulse buys.
If that’s the case, before you start your social media campaign, you must streamline your
sales process to make it as effortless as possible. If you can complete the sale in one click
74 
| 
Chapter 4: Marketing Strategy: Digital Goods and Services

(via PayPal or Google Wallet or Amazon Payments), then do it. Every extra step in the
sales process loses sales for you.
If you’re not in the “impulse buy” category, then you need to give away free stuff. Ex‐
cerpts, free trials, free videos (if there is a series you’re selling), and limited-use licenses
are all examples. This helps establish the quality of the paid products. Use that free trial
to show how “worth it” the rest of the product is.
If you have multiple products, you can heavily promote one of them for free and use it
to advertise the others. There are many different tactics for this, depending on your
industry.
Last but not least is freemium—free for most functionality, but costs for the really good
stuff. Words With Friends, for instance, is free to play, but to remove the ads and get the
extra “pay to win” features, players have to pay. Since the game is connected through
the app stores of the platforms it’s on, it’s a low-barrier sale that is quick and easy to
complete. It’s a perfect example of freemium in action.
If you are above the impulse buy threshold, fall back to the opt-in. You can combine
this with the free-stuff approach by offering the free stuff only after a very simple opt-
in form. Just a name and an email address and one more click to the free stuff. A great
example here is ArtistWorks (shown in Figure 4-2), which offers interactive video les‐
sons for a variety of musical instruments. Each product page shows the pricing plans
up front, with an introductory video and a quick opt-in form to access some free lessons.
The real value isn’t so much the lessons as it is the video interaction and feedback from
the teacher, so there’s quite a lot of free content on the site after the opt-in, while the
true value of the paid service is made quite clear. The first opt-in email ArtistWorks
sends comes from the VP of Marketing’s own email address, and he encourages you to
reply to him directly with the answer to the prompt: “I would love to know WHY you
want to improve your playing NOW.” If you reply, he responds. Not only is this a friendly
interaction with the company, but it also gives the company direct feedback on how to
improve future marketing efforts. The entire operation is brilliantly combined with
giveaways and other promotions through magazine ads and social media posts.
James Schramko is also a genius at using the free stuff approach to draw more attention
to his paid services. He has many different products that all complement one another.
In his podcasts for one of those products, he’ll casually mention the others without
explaining them so that you’re forced to look them up on your own. Curiosity is a
fantastic way to drive traffic.
Forming a Superior Strategy
Now that you’ve established proper context and intention for the sale of digital products
and services on social media, it’s time to commit to a plan. Use this list as a framework
for your strategy:
Forming a Superior Strategy 
| 
75

Figure 4-2. ArtistWorks is a great example of free stuff plus opt-in—perfect for social
media campaigns
Define your sales funnel.
That includes your lead magnets, tripwires, core product, and profit maximizers.
Prepare your landing pages.
Don’t start marketing until your sales infrastructure is ready. Make sure all of your
ducks are in a row on your online store. Remember to calibrate your landing pages
to do either a low-friction impulse buy or an opt-in with free stuff. Optimize your
landing pages for maximum conversion. LeadPages is a great service that can make
high-converting landing pages for acquiring opt-ins and registrations for newslet‐
ters, Google Hangouts, webinars, and all sorts of other cool stuff you might be
offering. One thing that sets LeadPages apart is its unique “lead box” feature. Ba‐
sically it’s a sign-up button with instant access. There are no name or email form
fields to fill out until you click the button, then a pop-up/overlay appears with a
small form to fill out. This increases signup by changing the landing page from a
“taking” page (a demand for data from the prospect) to a “giving” page. Visitors are
promised information, resources, and answers. Once they click the button and get
the pop-up asking for their name and email, they are already mentally committed.
Set goals and checkpoints.
How many sales and/or referrals is it reasonable to expect from your social media
work? This is a hard question to answer accurately. Try to choose a conservative
estimate so that you aren’t discouraged with sluggish results. Some markets can be
slow to reach, and will take more effort over a longer period of time. It might be
76 
| 
Chapter 4: Marketing Strategy: Digital Goods and Services

more useful to set a goal to get more social media traffic to your landing pages; the
conversion work happens outside of social media.
Make a content plan.
We published a good content plan in Chapter 2 that you can easily adapt for your
market. You must have some kind of plan for how things are going to play out. For
instance, it does no good to offer an amazing deal if you just set up your Facebook
page 10 minutes ago. You need an audience first, and then you need some engage‐
ment, and then you can push it over the edge with a special offer or giveaway.
Establish a presence.
Identify the social networks that you’re prepared to maintain a presence on, and set
up your pages there. Make sure each page is fully customized and has a good account
name that represents you properly.
Build a “starter” audience.
Advertise and promote your social media pages to build an audience. Only you can
determine how much is a good minimum target. It may be 500 Twitter followers,
or 1,000 Facebook likes. This is just the beginning—what you jumpstart your social
media marketing effort with. This number is not the endgame goal. You should
have some good starter content to post as well; this might be a good time to release
some of your supporting material—the how-to guides and other ancillary market‐
ing materials that you will offer on a permanent or long-term basis—or begin pro‐
moting your free stuff.
Execute your content plan.
Start posting on the schedule that you’ve laid out for yourself. Your content plan
might allow for a minimal audience at first, so you don’t necessarily have to wait
until you have your target “starter” audience in order to start posting.
Increase engagement.
Now that you’re up and running, the stats and feedback should have some hints as
to what kind of content is and is not working. Streamline your efforts, adjust your
content plan, and advertise and promote to gain maximum engagement (not max‐
imum likes/fans—you only want good leads at this point).
Site-Specific Tactics
Now that you have a plan, you must identify tactics to help you achieve it. We’ve already
covered the basics in Chapter 2, but now we’re going to get more specific for your
industry segment.
When it comes to selling digital goods and services, you want to put effort only into the
networks that are going to give you the highest level of engagement. Niche networks
are probably not going to help you achieve your goals, though there may be some
Site-Specific Tactics

exceptions in outside cases. For the most part, you’re going to want to stick to the big
social networks.
Facebook
Facebook works really well for impulse buy products (low-cost, high-need). It’s also a
good way to advertise specials and deals. You can maximize the effectiveness of a “deal”
announcement on Facebook by clearly showing the benefit, discount, and urgency of
the deal. For instance, a webinar service that is usually $150 per month is available today
only for $75 for a lifetime membership.
Bands and musicians can do well on Facebook through promo clips on YouTube, pre‐
release tracks, contests, ticket sales, events as concerts, and show announcements
through highly targeted local advertising.
Pinterest
Pinterest has quickly become essential for business owners, because it is great for posting
wares, developing a brand, and establishing a following. Pinterest isn’t necessarily the
place for deals, but it still touts impressive stats. According to a 2012 study done by
BloomReach, Pinterest converted to sales 22% more than Facebook did. Also, Pinterest
traffic spent 60% more than Facebook traffic did. Keep those numbers in mind.
Twitter
Twitter is useful for customer service, brand/product awareness, and deal announce‐
ments, but only if you have a decent number of followers. It’s more time-consuming to
build a Twitter following than it is a Facebook following, but you have a much greater
opportunity to reach a lot of people with impulse buy deals. Twitter is ephemeral; it’s
here one minute, gone the next. People who see a limited-time–deal announcement on
Twitter may be more inclined to jump on it right now than any other social network.
MySpace
Whoa, MySpace?! Blast from the past, eh? Yes, MySpace still exists, and is either on its
comeback tour or playing for “pass the hat” tips at rundown clubs. No way to tell where
it’s going at this point. However, the only thing MySpace has consistently been good at
is promoting music, and Justin Timberlake’s guidance behind this network may even‐
tually make it the Web’s social hub for new music. If you are serious about promoting
your band or album, MySpace is worth a look. It doesn’t take much effort to establish a
basic presence by setting up a page and uploading the songs that you’re willing to give
away for free on a promotional basis. The same rules apply here as everywhere else: post
interesting things (not just promotional material), and engage with people constantly.
(See Figure 4-3.)

network
YouTube
How-to videos are great for tutorials for software and games. If you’re selling a video
series or an album, it might make sense to put your freebie content on YouTube and
heavily promote it there rather than on your main site. First of all, you’ll save on band‐
width, which could otherwise be a substantial cost if your video goes viral. Secondly,
you’ll be able to leverage YouTube’s social features—such as commenting, favoriting,
liking, subscribing—boosting these engagement metrics will help your YouTube search
rankings.
Music and concert videos for bands are also great YouTube material.

Case Study: Group Coaching, Systematized
Best-selling author Robert Allen teamed up with business expert Ted Miller III to create
“The Fortune in You,” an online coaching system for aspiring authors. Miller describes
the situation:
Robert Allen, my partner, is 65 now. He’s been known in the industry since the 80s. But
the way he stays relevant is through social media. He’s an author and has six New York
Times bestsellers. He loves printed books. But he used this early stage of social media
to recognize that people wanted that digital capability. Did you know that Robert Allen,
through his partnership of licensing agreement of Ethan Wilson’s company, had sold 1
million ebooks before Amazon sold a single one? It just shows you how we’re utilizing
social media to keep our finger on the pulse of capitalism and how to stay advanced.
Because he stayed on the cutting edge, he eventually sold over $100 million of his train‐
ing materials and coaching through that licensing agreement.That’s the most important
thing: not responding, but anticipating where the marketplace is going, simply by look‐
ing at the past, the current trajectory, and the future pace. That’s what social media is
to us; the ability to anticipate where the market wants to be at and how to best serve it.
Allen and Miller realized that people responded far better when they weren’t being sold
at. Instead, The Fortune in You chose to immediately prove to potential clients why it
was a worthwhile investment. The two started doing a revolutionary strategy: giving the
public their best stuff even before the sale. They found that the prospect becomes more
responsive to higher ticket sales. Miller elaborates:

Chapter 4: Marketing Strategy: Digital Goods and Services

We looked at how can we better use technology throughout our entire sales cycle. One
of the things that I use is “Stop selling, start adding value first,” meaning in a new
relationship, the one we have with our prospects, someone has to go first. That’s the
way it is in every relationship. In a love relationship, someone had to say “I love you”
first. If you’re looking to be an expert, you’ll have that credibility. You’ll have way more
commerce because you cared enough to give first. The way I give first is through edu‐
cation. How can you do so in a way that they are dying to hear more of what you have
to offer? I found that if you educate them on the topics that you have to discuss, they’ll
be exponentially more likely to want to hear what you have to offer and learn more than
hear you sell them anything. So I use education as a way to go through my sales cycle.
You may be trying to automate your sales cycle to improve the conversions. Think of
not trying to do the next thing to make them spend money. You may be thinking to
yourself, I want them to get from this circle to this circle. Maybe you should stop thinking
like that, [and change] to How can I add value? so it will be logical for them to take the
next step on their own. I’ll give it to you right up front. You don’t hold the best you have
to offer until later. They’re learning; you’re constantly giving them tremendous value.
And what’s really strategic is, you can educate them in a way that it is logical for them
to do business with you. Maybe they are a chiropractor, and this chiropractor’s office
does not just heal you biomechanically and provide structural correction; maybe they
also offer emotional technique. Maybe they also help you with toxicity. What they’ll do
is they’ll educate the prospective client. These are the reasons you’d want to adjust your
body. But then they’d also say “but if you just get it adjusted, you’ll never address the
emotion that triggers the need for adjustment. You’d get adjusted for the rest of your
life and not ever address the emotional problems manifesting themselves as pain.” That’s
a very classy way of educating someone. But they’d do it in a way that they want to go
to that chiropractor instead of any chiropractor in town.
I’ve got a book in the works called Webinars That Sell. Before we started selling these
manuscripts, we went online and said, “Hey, we want to you to have access to this before
the rest of the world gets it because you’re following us online or you’re in our database
or engaging with us in some way on social media.” We say, “We’ll get you the book; all
you have to do is pay for shipping and handling.” And that’s our quid pro quo for giving
us their name and email address. Now they’ve opted in, we deliver them that book, and
they listen. We say, “Hey, I bet you’d love to talk to the author of this book. Well, we do
these trainings that are online and interactive, compared to our live events that have a
thousand people in the room and you’re lucky if you ever get your question answered.
Here, we’ll do it online so you don’t have to travel; [it’s] convenience from the comfort
of home or office chair; it’s a small group so you can keep it interactive and ask questions,
and the author will guide you through that process.” So we do a couple hundred bucks
for that training. Think of all the automation we have in there. We don’t throw a human
being in the mix until they’ve spent money. If they choose that $4.95 to get our books,
once they’ve spent money with us or done one of our webinars, we’ve got human beings
engaging with them. We’re able to use our best talent with our clients, not our prospects.
Automation empowered us to keep our best talent on our greatest impact areas. Take
the best talent you have and put them on the single most important initiative you have
in your company and watch your company grow exponentially. And take the mundane
stuff they are doing and automate it. That’s the power of technology today.

Real-Life Q&A
Q: I’m getting a lot of traffic, but no conversions.
A: I haven’t seen your landing page, but I’m betting it’s got some kind of problem. Have
you tested it on mobile devices and multiple desktop browsers? How’s the load time?
Beyond the obvious technical stuff, you’re going to have to look at your web visitor stats
to see if there are more clues. A high bounce rate, for instance, can suggest a number of
things (slow load time, poor design, content that’s not interesting enough).
If you’re sure that your server and content are in top shape, then look next to your sales
process. It’s got to be a one-click, low-impact buy. Simplify and shorten this process any
way you can. If it’s longer than one click, then make your landing page into an opt-in
page with as few fields as possible. Lots of opt-in fields will chase people away. We suggest
a name and email address only, and possibly a password if you’re creating a personalized
on-site account for each visitor.
Q: I have a five-part product strategy that involves an entry-level ebook, a physical
product, a video course, a seminar that I do at certain conferences, and personal coach‐
ing. I’m not getting how to incorporate social media into this complex (and profitable!)
process.
A: Well, start with a Facebook page. Get Twitter going as well; follow people you want
to get the word out to and start interacting with them. Facebook and Twitter should
always form the foundation of a bare bones social framework. Once you’re in motion,
start promoting your ebook through social media. Choose days to give it away for free.
Make the first video in your video course free on certain days, and make sure everyone
knows how much it would have cost otherwise. Offer some of your clients a free personal
coaching engagement, with the condition that you be allowed to film parts of it for a
promotional YouTube video. Start a free monthly podcast where you talk about client
successes with your product. Do product demos on YouTube. Get product endorsements
from clients; take photos of them with your product and put them on Instagram, or
create a Pinterest board for client successes.
Q: I’m a self-published fiction author with an ebook. What can I do through social media
to increase sales?
A: This is a tough one because fiction is, and has always been, very expensive and/or
time-consuming to promote, and the results are never guaranteed. If there were a perfect
formula for this, every major book publisher would be using it to make everything a
bestseller. Instead, only a tiny percentage of fiction books go beyond their advance.
We’ve actually dedicated an entire chapter to this subject later in the book. Here’s some
quick advice before you skip ahead to it, though. First, don’t openly promote your novel;
people don’t seem to respond well to that. Instead, talk about the themes indirectly. For
instance, let’s say the movie The Matrix never existed, and you just wrote it as a science
fiction novel. Put up a web page that shows the synopsis, the first chapter, any art that
82 
| 
Chapter 4: Marketing Strategy: Digital Goods and Services

is associated with it, and links to all of the major sites that sell it (e.g., Amazon, Barnes
& Noble, or Kobo). Create a Facebook page for the book and a Twitter account for you
as an author, and link out to your book page prominently there. Get some good Facebook
ads going on a budget of $10–$20 per day to gain more page likes. Every day on your
Facebook page, you would offer a paragraph or so on the nature of reality, Turing test
theories, artificial intelligence, Buddhist philosophy as it relates to the plot, computer
hacking, the semantics of hacker handles, news stories that deal with any of these sub‐
jects, and so on. On Twitter, you would post questions to your followers about these
same subjects. You’d follow actors from science fiction shows and engage with them.
You’d try to find people who talk a lot about science fiction and have a lot of followers,
and try to get them to notice you (refer to Chapter 13 for more information on influencer
outreach).
Summary
We hope this chapter has helped you to think holistically about social media. Of all the
reader segments we wrote this book for, yours is the one that probably has the most
experience in online marketing. That’s a blessing and a curse; you’re familiar with the
game, but you have probably been playing at least some part of it in an inefficient way
until now, and it’s going to be tough to change some of the initiatives that are already
in motion and modify habits that you didn’t know were bad.
At this point, you might want to stop and reflect on what you’re doing, why you’re doing
it, and what you should change in order to achieve your goals. Don’t make any big
changes just yet—start with small but important adjustments.
In our experience, defining an effective sales funnel can be an epiphany for struggling
digital entrepreneurs. Even those who are aware of it aren’t always optimizing all stages
in the funnel for maximum effect. This might be a good place to start if you’re rede‐
signing your online marketing strategy.
Chapter 6, which covers social media advertising, should be your next stop. Chapter 5
is customized solely for entrepreneurs who have a local storefront.
You can also head over to the Social eCommerce site for more Q&A and to post your
own burning questions! You’ll have access to exclusive offers, discounts, and coupon
codes on various social media tools and services.

CHAPTER 5
Local Services and Storefronts
If your ecommerce business is not selling something to a local market (such as a club,
restaurant, storefront, kiosk, or local service), then you should probably skip this chapter
and head to Chapter 6 to get a comprehensive education on ad design and testing.
Having said that, there’s a lot of interesting content in this chapter regardless of what
industry you’re in.
In the beginning of this book, we said that a successful strategy has three components:
intention, context, and tactics. This is why we have separated local services and store‐
fronts from the sale of things exclusively to remote customers. Online stores have a
potential customer base of billions of people, but you are limited to the people in your
city or region. That means you’re going to have to work much harder at customer service,
atmosphere, and a sense of safety. To actually go out to a specific location requires a
higher level of trust. To come back after the first visit requires a high level of satisfaction.
More than ever, ratings count for local businesses. A single negative online review or
rating can cost you thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Recurring business is extremely
important, and your online presence must match the experience you provide in person.
If your site looks cheap, that sends a message about what it’s like to be at your store or
restaurant. You must be consistent in appearance and message.
The Right Intent
Being successful on social media means engaging people and posting interesting con‐
tent. You must start with this mindset; if you don’t, you’ll default to “sales mode,” and
be ignored by the people you’re spending time and money to reach. Social media is
where people go to hang out and have fun with their friends. If you have the sort of
business that also has this atmosphere, by all means show that with your photos, videos,
and other content. If you’re running a storefront, make it look like this is a place where
85

people’s friends would go. Get them engaged, and make them a part of your public
business culture. Here are some guidelines for staying in the right frame of mind:
Bigger isn’t better.
You don’t need tons of fans to get customers, and it’s probably not realistic to aim
for tens of thousands of fans or followers if you live in a small metropolitan area.
Social media engagement is definitely a “quality over quantity” situation. Overlook
the vanity metrics: likes, fans, friends, and followers. Instead, focus on trust and
quality of atmosphere.
Incorporate ratings and reviews on your sales pages.
Make them prominent. This is an excellent way to get simple, introductory en‐
gagement. Positive reviews build trust very quickly. You’re going to have to monitor
the reviews constantly, though. One negative review can cost you many customers.
Reward people for referrals and recommendations.
Figure out why your current customers recommend you, and start using this in‐
formation to assist with your sales follow-ups.
Engage.
Look for a problem you can solve and a question you can answer, and send a rele‐
vant, helpful response.
Listen.
Look for buying signals: questions, concerns, and complaints.
Be authentic.
Show the real you with photos of yourself, your staff, your customers (with their
permission), and your store.
Hopefully, you didn’t expect to just sign up on Facebook, post a few marketing messages,
and kick back to watch customers flock to your store. If so, if our advice up to this point
hasn’t sunk in then now’s the time to sober up.
You have to do more than post messages on social media. That serves a purpose and it
is important, but it’s not the whole plan. To turn more friends and fans into customers,
you’ve got to create plenty of content to show that you’re trustworthy and friendly. That
means product tutorials and demos, case studies of success stories, newsletters, updates,
niche landing pages, in-person events, blog posts, and podcasts. Essentially, we are talk‐
ing about educated-based marketing again.
So far, most of what we’ve said shouldn’t be a new concept to you; these are the funda‐
mentals of local business marketing. Twenty years ago, you would have used this same
marketing theory to create print ads, local TV and radio commercials, mailers, and
sponsorships. Very little of that kind of traditional marketing is cost-effective anymore,
especially when compared to a solid online presence. To most people who grew up in
the Internet era, if you don’t have a website or a well-curated Facebook page, then you
86 
| 
Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

don’t exist or your business is probably shady and unprofessional, or at least old-
fashioned and uncool. Even if you’re running a retirement home and trying to appeal
to older people who aren’t as Internet-savvy as their kids or grandkids, a good online
presence is still the most important positive thing you can do for your business. Someone
in the decision-making process is going to go to the Web to look you up, and if she finds
nothing, there is no way that she will trust you.
Beyond establishing trust and atmosphere, social media is about awareness and pro‐
motion. If you have a new product, menu item, or service and want to get maximum
exposure for it, a contest or giveaway on social media will work marvelously—better
and more cheaply than any traditional media campaign.
Is there something you can promote at a discount or for free? A good tactic along these
lines is to offer a discount for your slowest business day of the week, or a coupon to help
sell a certain product that you want to turn over. If you have something you can’t seem
to get rid of, give it away as part of a contest.
Forming a Superior Strategy
Now that you’ve established proper context and intention for promoting your storefront
or service on social media, it’s time to commit to a plan. Use this list as a framework for
your strategy:
Prepare your website.
The central piece in your marketing strategy should be your website, and it should
look good and provide all of the information that potential customers are looking
for. You can set up some social media pages right away, but don’t start marketing
until your website is ready.
Set goals and checkpoints.
How many sales, new customers, and/or referrals is it reasonable to expect from
your social media work? This is a hard question to answer accurately. Try to choose
a conservative estimate so that you aren’t discouraged with sluggish results.
Make a content plan.
We published a good content plan in Chapter 2 that you can easily adapt for your
business. You must have some kind of plan for how things are going to play out.
For instance, it does no good to offer an amazing deal if you just set up your Face‐
book page 10 minutes ago. You need an audience first, and then you need some
engagement, and then you can push it over the edge with a special offer or giveaway.
Establish a presence.
Identify the social networks that you’re prepared to maintain a presence on, and set
up your pages there. Make sure each page is fully customized and has a good account
name that represents you properly.
Forming a Superior Strategy 
| 
87

Build a “starter” audience.
Advertise and promote your social media pages to build an audience. Only you can
determine how much is a good minimum target. It may be 500 Twitter followers,
or 1,000 Facebook likes. This is just the beginning—what you jumpstart your social
media marketing effort with. This number is not the endgame goal. You should
have some good starter content to post as well; this might be a good time to release
some of your supporting material—the how-to guides and other ancillary market‐
ing materials that you will offer on a permanent or long-term basis—or begin pro‐
moting your coupons and discounts.
Execute your content plan.
Start posting on the schedule that you’ve laid out for yourself. Your content plan
might allow for a minimal audience at first, so you don’t necessarily have to wait
until you have your target “starter” audience in order to start posting.
Increase engagement.
Now that you’re up and running, the stats and feedback should have some hints as
to what kind of content is and is not working. Streamline your efforts, adjust your
content plan, and advertise and promote to gain maximum engagement (not max‐
imum likes/fans—you only want good leads at this point).
Provide incentives.
Offer some check-in deals on Foursquare, Facebook, Twitter, and/or Google+. For
instance, you can offer $5 off the purchase price for those who check in at the given
location. You can also offer discounts for reviews (on social media, Yelp, or your
product page).
Site-Specific Tactics
Now that you have a plan, you must identify tactics to help you achieve it. We’ve already
covered the basics in Chapter 2, but now we’re going to get more specific for your
industry segment.
When it comes to promoting local stores and services, you want to put effort only into
the networks that are going to give you the highest level of engagement. Niche networks
can help here, if they are specific to your industry (food blogs for your restaurant, for
instance) or are specific to your geographic area. For the most part, though, you’re going
to want to stick to the big social networks.
Your content, no matter what it is or where you post it, needs to stand out from the
crowd. No matter what kind of business you have, show positive personality and make
your location look like a nice, safe place to go. Have fun and build loyalty. Find ways to
get people to come back. Create a frequent-customer program, such as a stampcard or
punchcard, or set up a perks program for people who have spent a certain amount or
ordered a certain number of things. Then, on your site or on a social media page, feature
88 
| 
Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

the most prestigious members in that program for the month. Offer recommendations
for frequent/loyal customers. Reward people for loyalty. Make people feel like they’re a
part of something; inspire a neighborhood feeling. Make your business feel like some‐
thing unique, like a specialty boutique for celebrities, and not a sterile big box chain-
store experience.
Facebook
Aside from setting up your page and engaging with fans, you can do quite a lot of
effective advertising through Facebook Ads if you patiently work through the details of
targeting and ad design. We’ve dedicated an entire chapter to this subject later in this
book, but the basics are:
• Very specific targeting
• An absolutely killer image
• A specific headline
• A price in the ad text
Google+
Signing up in Google+ will give you local search visibility. This isn’t a should, this is a
must. Your first stop will be Google My Business, the central portal for updating your
business information across Google search, Google Maps, and Google+.
YouTube
If you’re promoting a restaurant, create a seasonal menu and do a video of it, or do a
cooking segment with the chef in which he shows how to prepare one of your signature
dishes.
If you’re promoting a storefront, do a slideshow video with photos of your store, staff,
and happy customers.
Any TV commercial that you would have made for traditional television can work on
YouTube. Kitschy, stylized, silly TV commercial-like videos may have some viral po‐
tential as well. If you can make a funny video that isn’t offensive or negative and in some
way involves your store or restaurant, go for it!
Pinterest and Instagram
Pinterest is widely known as a repository of recipes, so if you’re promoting a restaurant,
consider putting up some of your recipes here with photos of the process and the per‐
Site-Specific Tactics 
| 
89

fectly presented dish at the end. If you have a willing and photogenic chef, you might
even offer a weekly cooking demonstration that involves a limited-time menu item.
Anything that you would have put into a YouTube slideshow should go on whichever
photo sharing site you’re participating in.
Post promotional photos of people who have won your contests or defeated your chal‐
lenges (restaurant eating challenges, for example). Instagram is great for taking photos
throughout the day of happy customers at your location. You can do a “mystery customer
of the day” promotion where you take someone’s photo and if she sees it on Instagram,
she gets a $50 gift card.
Work photos of a mascot or logo into your photos. CreditDonkey created the info‐
graphic in Figure 5-1, and slyly incorporated its own mascot, the donkey, in the back‐
ground.

Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

Craigslist
Craigslist is a free “want ad” site for major metropolitan areas. If you have a store with
irregular, unpredictable, and sometimes rare stock (for instance, a pawn shop, vintage
clothing store, used car dealership, or specialty food market), Craigslist is a great free
method of posting ads for individual items. Just make sure you post in the right category,
and update your ad on a regular basis until it sells—and then remove it.
Foursquare
Foursquare is a mobile app that enables users to broadcast where they are and find out
who else is there. It isn’t the same big deal that it used to be, mostly because other social
networks started offering check-in functions. However, it’s still pretty popular as a way
of connecting with the people who are wherever you’re shopping or hanging out.
Offer check-in deals on Foursquare, such as $5 off an entrée or a free dessert, or 10%
off any item under $100. Each check-in is a low-level personal recommendation to
someone’s friends, and puts your store on the map for those who didn’t know it existed.
Local Blogging
Blogs qualify as social media insofar as they are interactive with readers and offer readers
the ability to comment and rate or vote. Many cities and regions have local blogs that
have usurped the position of the now-dead or dying local daily newspaper. If you have
an interesting story to share about your business or your life, see if you can arrange an
interview with a local blogger.
If the blog sells ads, buy one and see how it goes. It might get you some new business,
and it might be a complete waste of money, so don’t commit too much to it right away.
If you have the time and enthusiasm for it—or if someone you know, or someone who
works for you, does—then start your own local blog. Write about local events and people,
and put up ads for your business.
Yelp
Yelp is a site that enables people to rate and review local businesses, and it can have a
huge impact if you are reviewed well or poorly there. If you maintain a storefront,
encourage positive reviews by posting a “People Love Us on Yelp” sticker on your store‐
front window, having a sign near the register asking people to post a Yelp review, and
asking customers personally to go to Yelp and post positive feedback.
Go to Yelp and register your business there. Put up a photo and contact information,
and then watch that page like a hawk. If anyone posts a negative review (anything under
4 stars), reply to him publicly in a sympathetic manner (don’t get angry!), and if possible,
Site-Specific Tactics 
| 
91

contact him directly off-site through email or by phone. Do everything you can to get
him to be your ally, even if it seems like he’s in the wrong for complaining.
Do not ignore filtered reviews. The review filter is Yelp’s way of trying to weed out the
spam, but it is notoriously overzealous, and mostly just isolates very negative and very
positive reviews, and any review that mentions a competitor. Serious Yelp users know
that the filtered reviews are often where the good stuff is. At the very least, it is typically
a repository of honest negative reviews. If anything, you should pay more attention to
the filtered reviews than the normal ones. Smart Yelp users know not to trust glowing
5-star reviews from reviewers with few friends and few other reviews.
This isn’t related to Yelp specifically, but if you’re in a business that sees frequent abuse
or fraud, consider turning the tables on your customers by participating in a customer
review program. If you encounter a scammer or abusive person, report it. The mobile
car-hiring app Uber, for instance, offers customers the chance to rate their drivers, and
the drivers also rate the riders. If you’re a 2-star passenger, you might not be able to find
a driver who wants to bother with you. This is proprietary technology for Uber, but it
isn’t difficult to use standard rating applications internally in your business to rate and
review customers. This would be especially helpful in businesses that buy or trade things,
such as pawn shops or antique stores.
Twitter
Twitter is useful for customer service, brand/product awareness, and deal announce‐
ments, but only if you have a decent number of followers. It’s more time-consuming to
build a Twitter following than it is a Facebook following, but you have a much greater
opportunity to reach a lot of people with impulse-buy deals. Twitter is ephemeral; it’s
here one minute, gone the next. People who see a limited-time deal announcement on
Twitter may be more inclined to jump on it right now than any other social network.
Verifying Driving Directions
What a disaster it would be if your potential customers couldn’t get to your location
because their GPS or mapping app doesn’t know how to guide people to the correct
building! There are many ways automated directions can go wrong:
Closed roads/temporary construction.
Most navigation apps are not aware of road construction. For very large road con‐
struction projects, the entire street may be diverted for a few hours, or a few days.
The detours may change depending on which half of the street is being worked on.
There may be vehicle restrictions for rough patches of road. It’s your responsibility
to make sure that your customers are informed of road construction and blockages
near your storefront.
92 
| 
Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

New road not yet on the map.
Most GPS owners probably don’t realize that their device has hardcoded maps that
have to be manually updated for an extra cost. It’s not like Google Maps; a GPS is
not a service, it is a device. Updating the maps costs extra and isn’t done automat‐
ically. Some taxi drivers purposefully use old GPSes with very old maps so that they
can run up their fare by searching for the right street.
New building not yet on the map.
If your building was constructed within the past five years, it’s not going to show
up on a lot of GPSes; it may not even show up in Google Maps.
“Trap streets” that don’t exist.
Since the early days of professional cartography, mapmakers have been adding tiny
falsehoods to their work so that anyone who copies it will be easily identified. This
is to protect against copyright infringement, but it has the added side effect of
misleading people who follow maps literally. Sometimes a street will be purposefully
misnamed, and sometimes (especially on the edge of a settled area where streets
come to a dead end) they will appear to connect even though they don’t.
Similar road names.
Adjacent cities or counties can have different rules that cause street names and
numbers to change after a certain intersection. There can be a huge difference be‐
tween “Main Street S” and “Main Street N.” Do not be ambiguous on important
parts of your address. If it’s an American address, it helps to specify the four-digit
postal zip code extension.
Incomplete road names (not including Street or Avenue).
To add to the previous point, while Main St. N and Main St. S may have identical
street numbers, they won’t have the same zip code. However, Raeford Road and
Raeford Court can be in the same zip code and have the same numbered addresses.
So if you don’t specify the St., Rd., or Ct., it can throw people off. The moral of the
story is: print the full address and don’t leave anything out.
Every map service has a correction procedure. As previously mentioned, though, if GPS
owners never update their maps, they won’t get the corrections. If you know that some
customers have been led astray in the past, make sure you print a notice about erroneous
GPS directions prominently on your site, and provide directions yourself. Encourage
customers to call if they get lost, and make sure you know the area well enough that you
can guide them to your location.
Sometimes the directions are technically accurate, but nonpractical. For instance, a
newer road may have been constructed that cuts the route in half, or avoids a rough
unmaintained road, but is not on the map. Correcting inconvenient routes can involve
several actions, such as adding a road, adding a building, and altering the route. While
Verifying Driving Directions

this may seem like a hassle, keep in mind that you are losing money every time someone
can’t find your location. How much money will you lose from a single customer?
Google Maps
Google provides a Report Errors feature in the Directions view in Google Maps, as
Figure 5-2 shows.

Click that link in the lower left, below the step-by-step directions, and you can submit
corrections and other feedback about the directions.
Mapquest, Yahoo, Bing, and Garmin GPS Devices
Mapquest, Yahoo, Bing, and Garmin GPS devices get their maps through Navteq, which
has a Map Reporter correction page: https://mapreporter.navteq.com.
If the misdirection came from a Garmin device or app, you can alternatively report it
through the Garmin site, if you know the model number of the device (https://

Case Study: The Celebrity Next Door
Celebrity chef Robert Irvine is famous for his food, his personality, and his high level of
engagement with fans. It’s the perfect recipe for a social media strategy. His Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina, restaurant, Robert Irvine’s Eat!, competes with about 200 other
restaurants on an island with a lot of tourism and a small local population. It’s tough
competition, especially when Chef Irvine is on the road doing shows and other events
about 300 days per year. Robert Irvine’s Nosh restaurant is eight miles away on the
mainland, in Bluffton, South Carolina, and appeals to the same demographic.
Chef Irvine entrusts the everyday operation of these two signature restaurants to exec‐
utive chef Lee Lucier, who has also participated in popular Food Network television
shows with Irvine. In addition to running both restaurants according to Chef Irvine’s
famously high standards, Chef Lucier also participates in the social media strategy that
helps them stay successful:
We’re on a very small island, but there are so many ways to advertise here, and they cost
a ton, but there is little return for restaurants. The best way we’ve found to give people
value is to do in-house specials and features, and tell people about them on social media.
That gives people a lot of value. We’ve done tie-ins with other businesses to get some
exposure, and Facebook ads of all kinds, and that’s been working for us, so we keep
going with it. Financially, social media ads offer a much better return than print. TV is
great if you’re in the right market. Here on Hilton Head Island, we’re in a vacation
market, so television is not as effective as it would be in bigger local markets.
Robert Irvine’s Eat! launched before Robert Irvine’s Nosh. By the time the second res‐
taurant was open for business, according to Chef Lucier, the social media strategy was
already solidified:
We followed what we were already doing. We track things pretty closely—what the
responses are, the analytics of certain campaigns and how they’re doing. Both restau‐
rants go hand-in-hand since success for one means success for the other. The demo‐
graphics and customer base are the same, so we can combine the marketing efforts.
These places are within eight miles of each other. However, when we do a Restaurant:
Impossible show, we often encounter situations where people think that they can do the
same thing for every location. Many people make this mistake—they use the same
marketing for each location, and they fail because the customers can be different in each
market. Take Phoenix and Sedona, for instance. They’re both in Arizona, and not too
far from each other, but they have a completely different clientèle. You can’t use the
same tactics for the same restaurant in both locations.

Even if you have a celebrity chef’s name attached to a restaurant, there is no guarantee
of success. All of the same things that make Robert Irvine’s restaurants successful will
apply to any chef’s restaurant if he’s willing to work for it, says Chef Lucier:
On Tuesday nights we do all our tapas at half price. This is incredibly popular, and guests
love it; they make reservations months in advance. The cost of that discount comes out
of our advertising budget. It covers a huge portion of our weekly bills—and on a Tuesday
night, which is usually a bad night in the industry.
The websites for both restaurants have three, small, unobtrusive but easily seen buttons
for Twitter, Facebook, and Yelp (see Figure 5-3). The Yelp link is different for each, but
because they’re in the same market, they share a Facebook and Twitter page (under the
Robert Irvine’s Eat! name):
• https://www.facebook.com/RobertIrvinesEat
• https://twitter.com/RobertIrvineEat
• http://chefirvineseat.com/about-eat/
Figure 5-3. Excellent social media integration on his site
There is also integration with Google Maps for directions, and a Facebook social plug-
in showing recent posts and people who like the page. On the Event Calendar page, there
is seamless integration with Google Calendar; click on any event listing, and it can easily
be added to your calendar in your Google profile.
Despite his passion for his brand and his dedication to quality, there are occasional
negative reviews on Yelp. Chef Lucier prefers not to respond to them:
96 
| 
Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

Responding to reviews is something you either do or don’t do. We like to think that
people are qualified enough to comment on their own experience, so I think it’s a failed
tactic to try to change reviews after the fact. It’s intrusive. We keep track of bad reviews
and talk to our staff about them, but we’ve recently implemented a system to try to avoid
them before they happen. We get instant analytics on about 65% of our tables through
a special feedback tool that we’re using. And that is available to me no matter where I
am. I could be out on my boat, and still be able to see what guests are saying while they’re
in the restaurant. We’d much rather correct a situation in real time. If someone com‐
plains while in the restaurant, our in-house system allows us to address that immedi‐
ately. Someone in the back of the house is always watching for complaints, and addresses
them so that people don’t have to leave the restaurant with a negative experience.
Social media can be the prize or death of your restaurant. When bad reviews happen,
you need to attack the problems that people are talking about, and get those situations
corrected. So many people spend money based on what they see on social media, so
you have to be aware of it and limit mistakes.
Despite his busy television and tour schedule, the man at the top doesn’t lose touch with
what’s happening on the ground—or on the Web. According to Chef Lucier:
Robert makes decisions on all paths that we take. He has a full-time social media director
on staff, but Chef is the one who posts messages to Twitter, and he makes all decisions
as to what goes into his restaurants. Robert responds to everyone who tweets him. Not
many people take his kind of interest in their fans, whether it’s at his restaurant going
around to every single table to make sure everyone’s having a good experience, or on
one of his shows, or even out on the street. He wants everyone to have a great time, so
he chose partners for social media who share that passion for quality and a superior
brand.
Chef Irvine’s marketing and PR representative, Dan McLean, handles the analytics side
of the restaurants’ online presence, and notes:
It’s all about engagement, and the numbers we look at have to do with quality, not
quantity. If 100,000 people follow us but only two of them are talking about us, then
there is little value in the other 99,998. You want to get the right people to the page.
People enjoy engaging with Robert, and the rest of the team helps build on that expe‐
rience. We always take it a step further than the surface metrics to see who’s talking
about what, and we use that information to help make a lot of decisions.
Case Study: Destination Marketing with Flair
GoVisitCostaRica, an ecotravel advising site, delegates its social media to a third party,
and that third party is its tiny imaginary tree frog mascot named Javi the Frog. The site,
created by Costa Rica enthusiast Todd Sarouhan, began using the avatar frog a few years
ago, and the success has been notable.
“Javi is famous in Costa Rica; hotels love it when we take pictures with him there, because
they know people will look,” says Javier Navajas, content editor and social media strate‐
gist for the site.

It’s almost like people think that they are talking to an actual tree frog. People will go on
the Facebook page and post, “Hey, Javi! I’m looking for recommendations,” or “Thanks,
Javi!” And if you check out the GoVisitCostaRica web page, it certainly seems like he’s
real. On the About page, Javi is listed in the Bio page right alongside the owners (see
Figure 5-4). If that isn’t enough information about him, you can check out the “About
Javi the Frog” page on the website, which describes the entire past they created for him:
“I was born in the rainforest of Gandoca-Manzanillo National Wildlife Refuge, where
I grew up with my mom, dad, and 24 brothers and sisters.” There is then a series of
pictures of Javi visiting hotels and doing dozens of recommended activities, from
ziplining to boogie boarding (Figure 5-5). Javi often takes advantage of the popular
Instagram and Twitter tradition #selfieSunday, where users post pictures of themselves.
Figure 5-4. Javi’s bio
Figure 5-5. Javi boogie boarding
“The customers love it because it proves that we’ve been there; we aren’t just going off
of a review or a picture. We’ve been to the hotel, and here’s a recent photo of it,” Todd
adds. Because GoVisitCostaRica does not need to worry about selling its own product,
it simply connects travelers to destinations, meaning Javi the Frog does not need to
constantly be selling. Instead, he is free to answer questions, create authentic dialogue,
and make his own recommendations. Through this type of direct interaction with both
98 
| 
Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

hotel owners and clients (virtually), Javi has been branded as a trustworthy, eco-friendly,
and approachable guide to travel.
According to Todd, “The red-eyed tree frog has always been one of the symbols of Costa
Rican wildlife. I actually asked Javier if I could use his name even before he worked for
me…I remember calling him up and asking, ‘Hey, is it all right if I use your name?’”
Now Javier is the voice of the tree frog that bears his name over Twitter, Pinterest,
Facebook, and Google+.
GoVisitCostaRica also has TV commercials advertising local sweepstakes for hotel stays
on a Costa Rican government channel. “The sweepstakes run every few months, and
since it is a government channel, everyone sees it,” Todd explains.
The result of GoVisitCostaRica’s efforts and advertisement is just over 27,000 Facebook
likes and a featured spot on Pinterest’s home page; Javi and Todd have created an ex‐
cellent forum for questions, recommendations, and interaction.
Mobile Marketing
Mobile advertising is critically important to local businesses because people often use
their mobile devices to find local goods, services, and events. The key points to consider
are:
• Your site must be mobile-friendly.
• If possible, create a mobile app for your customers.
• You must be able to be found on mobile mapping apps.
• You must have a presence on Foursquare, and on popular local deals sites like
Groupon and Restaurant.com.
• If you are advertising on Facebook, you must create mobile-specific ads (these ads
will show up only in mobile app feeds).
If you find yourself dragging your feet when it comes to building a mobile commerce
strategy, here are a few interesting statistics for you:
• According to comScore, four out of five smartphone users in the U.S. access retail
content on their mobile device.
• According to Prosper Mobile Insights, 25% of consumers shop online only on
mobile.
• Compuware claims that 40% of users would go to a competitor’s site after a bad
mobile experience, and 57% wouldn’t recommend a company with a poorly de‐
signed mobile site.

• Consumers spent six times more in December 2012 using retailer’s apps than they
did in 2011, according to Flurry.
In case it’s not clear: mobile is a big deal for local markets. Next we’ll cover three areas
of concentration that will ensure maximum mobile conversion.
Optimize Your Website
Your site should be designed to be responsive; it must adapt to users who are viewing
it from a big screen desktop monitor view, to a smaller laptop display, to a tablet, to a
mobile phone screen. No matter how a customer accesses your site, he should be able
to easily access and view all of your content. See Figures 5-6 and 5-7 for examples of
sites that fail and succeed, respectively, at responsiveness.
Figure 5-6. An example of a site that does not cater to mobile users; this site would be
much better off if it were mobile optimized
100 
| 
Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

Figure 5-7. A good example of responsive design on a mobile device
There are three different ways to serve users a mobile website experience. The first is to
have a mobile-specific website on a subdomain. For this, you’ll want to set up bidirec‐
tional links to the two sites (the desktop site and the mobile site). On the desktop site,
you’ll want to have a rel="alternate" tag that points back to the mobile site. On the
mobile site, you’ll want to link back to the desktop by having a rel="canonical" tag.
This will aggregate the PageRank and collapse the two together on search engines. It is
essentially a redirect. Google is able to keep this straight due to the bidirectional redi‐
rects.
Another is dynamic serving, where the HTML varies according to user agent. For this,
you’ll need to use the “vary” HTTP header that alerts Googlebot to the fact that you are
varying the HTML based on the user agent.
The third kind is a responsive design where the HTML is the same but the CSS renders
the page differently depending on screen size or user agent. This is the approach Google
recommends.
Web design is best left to the experts; in itself, it is the subject of entire books, so we’re
not going to go into detail on the finer points of what makes a good mobile site and how
to accomplish it. Hopefully you’re working with a design firm that can test your site for
mobile friendliness, or you have an in-house web designer who can develop a mobile
Mobile Marketing

101

site, or you’re using a modern content management system (CMS) that can detect and
adjust for tablets and smartphones.
Of course, you can test out your site yourself just by visiting it with your phone or tablet,
or by using developer tools such as the mobile device testing features built into Google
Chrome. Is your site usable on your device? Do you have to zoom in and tab carefully,
or does the site adjust to the screen? If there is a mobile version, does it offer all of the
required functionality to complete a sale? If you’re not satisfied with the responsiveness
of your site on a mobile device, enlist the help of an experienced web designer who can
develop a good mobile version.
Mobile Retail Apps
Another way to offer a mobile-friendly experience for customers is to create a mobile
app. We can’t ignore the fact that this can be extremely expensive and/or time-
consuming, and it may not be appropriate for every market and budget. Also, mobile
apps are not suitable replacements for mobile-friendly websites. If you have a limited
budget to spend on web design or development, put all of that money into your website,
not a mobile app.
If you do have developers or the budget to develop an app, then aim to produce some‐
thing elegant, robust, useful, and multiplatform (Android, iOS, Windows RT). Here are
some potential ideas for app functionality for local businesses:
• A catalogue app with a wish list feature
• A touch-to-pay system
• Barcode scanners
• Store location finder (if you have multiple locations)
• Coupons and promotions
Integrated Product Reviews
According to eMarketer, 36% of smartphone owners use their mobile devices to read
product reviews. Why not make it easier for them (and help guide them to positive
reviews) by incorporating reviews into your mobile-friendly site or app?
If you don’t have the resources to incorporate reviews from other sites, at a minimum
you should offer personal testimonials from past customers. There are also inexpensive
review solutions that can be added without heavy-duty customization, such as Bazaar‐
Voice, Power Reviews, Testimonial Director, and the WP Customer Reviews plug-in
for WordPress.

Chapter 5: Local Services and Storefronts

Mobile Advertising
In Bizreport’s 2012 Mobile Advertising Survey, 64% of respondents who had smart‐
phones made a purchase after viewing a mobile ad. You can easily take advantage of
that with Facebook mobile ads. Most Facebook users, after all, access the service through
a mobile device. There are three options to choose from, all of which appear in users’
News Feeds: page post engagement, clicks to website, and app installs (for retailers who
have an app).
You can also promote tweets and Twitter accounts. Twitter ads, which are not really ads
in the traditional sense, can be targeted by keywords, interests, or similar accounts.
There are several advertising networks specializing in mobile marketing that you may
want to consider: 
• AdMob by Google
• Millennial Media
• MdotM
• InMobi
Real-Life Q&A: Think Locally
Q: I’ve got a Facebook page and a Twitter account going, and I’m excited to build an
audience. How much should I spend on ads?
A: That’s a complicated question, and we’re going to address it as best we can in the next
chapter. There’s a ton of experimentation and testing that has to happen before you can
start thinking about an ad budget. If you’ve already got some ads going, then our basic
suggestion is to start at $10 or $15 per day and see how that goes. If it’s successful, try
doubling it for a day and see what happens.
Q: My competitors have a huge, well-designed online presence, and here I am starting
from scratch. How can I possibly keep up?
A: Compete! Surely you have some advantage over your competitors; otherwise, you
wouldn’t be in business. Follow the advice in this chapter, make your social media pages
look clean and professional, and move forward. Post, engage, and persevere.
Q: I have a local costume and makeup shop that is doing very well. Should I expand into
online sales? How would I even do that?
A: You can certainly give it a shot. Keep in mind, though, that a large part of the reason
why you may be doing well locally is that you’re selling something that your customers
want to be there in person for. On the Web, you’re competing against hundreds or
thousands of businesses that are selling most of the same things, and they’ve probably
Mobile Marketing 
| 
103

managed to do it at a lower price. If you feel you can compete in that space—if your
costumes are so good that you can compete on quality alone—then it’s worth exploring
an expansion to ecommerce. This is a big task that involves payment processing (your
existing credit card processor will probably work), web design (you’ll probably have to
hire that out), web hosting, and product fulfillment (you’ll probably need at least one
new employee to help with that). That’s a bit beyond the scope of this book. However,
if you’re already set on all of those aspects of ecommerce, just follow the directions in
Chapter 4, and keep your online marketing strategy separate from your local strategy.
Summary
Local businesses and storefronts are usually the least Internet-savvy and least prepared
to adopt a social media marketing strategy. That’s why we swung for the fences on the
case studies: we wanted to show how two different businesses, both in highly competitive
tourist spots, used social media to distinguish themselves from hundreds of high-quality
competitors. Even with celebrity status or deep relationships with tourism boards, you
can’t rely on foot traffic and word of mouth to put enough “butts in seats” or “heads in
beds” in competitive markets. In this era of smartphones and cars with built-in voice
navigation, people are doing a lot of research online before choosing an establishment.
This is exponentially more important if you hope to attract tourist traffic. Giving cash
kickbacks to the hotel concierges (where they still exist) for referrals isn’t going to cut
it anymore—not in the digital age.
You must project a digital beacon that guides people to your location from a variety of
online sources. We hope we’ve given you a treasure trove of options to consider to help
broadcast and amplify your signal.
You can also head over to the Social eCommerce site for more Q&A and to post your
own burning questions! You’ll have access to exclusive offers, discounts, and coupon
codes on various social media tools and services.

CHAPTER 6
Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook
You can send traffic from Facebook ads, pages, or posts to anywhere. To make that
redirection profitable, though, you need a well-defined strategy. There must be a rea‐
sonable expectation of what’s going to happen to that traffic once it reaches its destina‐
tion. Hopefully, by this point in the book, you’ve got that worked out, and now you’re
looking for ways to amplify your efforts. Facebook ads are an excellent way to do that,
but you must proceed with caution. Take a slow and steady approach to this, and don’t
lose sight of your core metrics. It’s very easy to waste hundreds of dollars by getting lost
in the wrong numbers. Proceed with caution: do not jump into the deep end without a
proper flotation device.
Start with a low budget—anywhere between $5 and $15 per day, depending on your
overall marketing budget—and use your initial results to prove the effectiveness and
value of your ads before making a big investment. If it doesn’t work at $50, it’s not going
to work at $500, so don’t scale it up until you’ve found the right formula.
Once you have a set purpose, know what your objectives are. No matter what you’re
doing, you’re going to want more fans or followers, but what kind? Location-based,
interest-based, or relationship-based? Perhaps you just want to encourage current fans
to buy something—converting from fans to customers. Or you need to test a new offer
or program by sending traffic to your site to test a demographic, price, product, or
conversion tactic (ad, layout, design, options). Or you need more opt-ins in the form
of viewers, listeners, or subscribers. When you’re designing ads, it’s too easy to make
the wrong choices, so, again, knowing what your objectives are will save you time, cash,
and disappointment.
This chapter is about Facebook ads. At this time, no other major social networks offer
direct advertising. Although Twitter offers sponsored posts and accounts, it offers no
direct advertising opportunities.
105

Campaign Types
On Facebook, an ad must belong to a campaign. In some situations, you are better off
driving engagement; in others, you need more fans in order to hit the sweet spot; and
in still others, you need to drive traffic off-site to a landing page or sales site.
In the broader sense (not just on Facebook, but in advertising in general), a campaign
represents a marketing effort. There is a plan, a budget, an execution, and a measure‐
ment of results. The following subsections describe some potential campaign models
for you to consider.
Traditional Sales
In this model, you put up an ad on Facebook to drive traffic to a landing page on your
website. This is no different than advertising on any other online platform. Depending
on what you’re selling and where you’re trying to sell it, this may be an excellent option
for you.
Branding
Traditional branding involves associating a certain message with your brand, rather
than selling a product. Branding, as a standalone function, is typically the province of
very large corporations. As a standalone effort, it is often an expensive proposition for
smaller businesses and doesn’t usually provide an ROI (return on investment). However,
when combined with traditional direct response marketing, branding is a smart and
savvy way to increase your presence and to communicate your unique values, charac‐
teristics, and attributes to your customers and prospects.
In the branding campaign model, you put up ads that drive traffic back to your Facebook
page. You could also drive traffic to a Twitter account, or to any other page on a social
network (for instance, if you’re promoting a band and focusing on MySpace, you would
drive traffic there). Although nothing is sold in branding, you should always build the
groundwork for a value proposition (such as offering a coupon, an educational piece,
or a valuable newsletter) to get your audience to take the first step in the buying process.
On Facebook—more so than most other online advertising platforms—branding is es‐
sential. You can offer the best features, the highest quality, or the lowest price on any
product or service, but if your brand isn’t trustworthy, many of your prospects simply
won’t bite. Even if you’re trying to drive sales above all else, you should still reserve some
effort for branding. This should always be a part of your campaign.
It’s important to make sure that you are strategically implementing the fundamentals
into your ad campaigns. Defining what sets your business apart from the crowd is
foundational to your marketing plans. As you are advertising a specific product, service,
or event, it is increasingly important to show potential customers why someone should
106 
| 
Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

pick you over your competition. Just think of branding as telling everyone what is dif‐
ferent and valuable about you—a unique value proposition.
Think about something as simple as a hamburger. Different restaurants that sell ham‐
burgers define themselves in specific ways: McDonald’s defines its offering by volume,
touting that billions of hamburgers have been sold; Burger King offers a fire-grilled
burger; and the trendy West Coast chain In-N-Out Burger offers a simple menu, but
also a (well-known) secret menu. While each restaurant has a similar product, its
branding is dramatically different. This marketing concept has been around for ages,
but it has never been more important than in our online age. The sea of competition is
fierce, and solid branding is often the difference between future success and failure.
Here are some popular examples of other brands and companies defining themselves
against the market:
• Pandora Internet Radio: Play only the music you love
• eBay: Shop victoriously
• Starbucks VIA: Never be without good coffee
• Zappos: Free shipping, free returns
• Hyundai: 100,000-mile warranty
• The Four-Hour Work Week: Escape the 9–5, and join the new rich (Tim Ferriss)
• FedEx: When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight
What makes your product, service, or event different from the rest? Why should cus‐
tomers pick you over another similar competitor? If you haven’t answered these ques‐
tions or given the answers any thought, your business might be due for a little soul
searching.
Traditionally, companies have distinguished themselves by price, availability (or lack
thereof), location, expertise, quality, value, customer service, and product guarantees,
to name a few. Today, many new online businesses attempt to establish themselves by
offering extremely low prices, but this isn’t always possible and doesn’t always work.
Sometimes, it’s a path to bankruptcy. As a business owner, you may not need to compete
heavily on price if you can clearly show what makes you different. Understanding why
your customers buy your product will help you to understand exactly what benefit you
are providing. If you understand what benefit you are providing, you are one step closer
to finding your brand identity.
Another way to understand your brand identity is to ask: what pain is my product or
service alleviating? In the preceding list of brands and companies defining themselves
against the market, every tagline addresses (and alleviates) an ideal customer’s pain.
Tim Ferriss’s message of “Escape the 9–5, and join the new rich,” touches on the pain

that book-buying people feel going to a job they don’t like. Pandora offers Internet radio
that aims to “play only the music you love,” saving listeners the agony of bad music.
Whatever your findings are, they represent your brand, and should be the focus of your
ads.
Special Events and Holidays
Holiday ad campaigns are a great way to get started with Facebook advertising. The
audience is receptive, and people have money to spend on things that they don’t ordi‐
narily buy. At other times during the year, people are not actively looking to buy some‐
thing, so many ads attempt to catch buyers off guard. However, during the holiday
season and amid the excitement of holiday sales, people often search for gift ideas, so
good-quality ads are much more effective and profitable.
When people are in the holiday spirit, let your ads match their feeling. You can add a
little holiday bling to your ad or incorporate the holiday tone into your ad copy. People
are busy preparing for the holidays, going to parties, and generally preparing for a little
break. So get into the mindset of your target audience and figure out what they would
be interested in doing/buying this year.
Selling a “better you” in the new year
The new year is famous for being the time when gym memberships and diet commit‐
ments skyrocket. It’s a time when people tend to reflect on where they are and how they
can improve. Appeal to your audience’s desire to look better, feel better, or become
smarter, richer, and more efficient this year. Think about this as you are picking your
image and writing ads. Before the end of the year is generally a good time to focus on
building up your email list. By January, advertising a “better you"–type product is the
logical next step.
A whole new round of testing
During the winter holiday season, the things that don’t usually work might magically
start working. The holiday shopping season presents an unusual, highly profitable
special-case situation in terms of ad design, marketing campaigns, and even Facebook
ad approvals. Content that was consistently rejected in the past, like multilevel market‐
ing (MLM) and network marketing opportunities, could suddenly start working. We
have also seen a lot of positive results from straight CPM campaigns (directing Facebook
ad traffic directly to your website landing page rather than your Facebook page), so it
could be worth a try to see if it pays off for your business.
The rules of this game are always changing, and this applies even more so to holiday
campaigns.

Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

Matching the reason to the season
Ad campaigns can be created to match any season or holiday celebrated or observed by
your target audience. We are surrounded by pitches that use the change of season or
holiday to sell a product or a service. Springtime? Buy spring-cleaning services! Fourth
of July? Time for a new grill! Take advantage of the established patterns and expectations
of your audience, and adjust your message accordingly. You may not have spring-
cleaning services to sell in April, but perhaps you have a service or product that offers
your prospective customer a fresh new start. Perhaps you have no grill to sell in July,
but your product can promise some type of independence, or its use and application
can evoke some feeling of summertime fun. f600.431
Market Research
Now you need to know what keywords and key phrases you should target. You know
your audience, you know your brand, you know your product, and now you need to
know the exact terms that apply to it. This will help you with identifying the most
popular interests for your target audience. Knowing which keywords are the most pop‐
ular will also come in handy when you are writing copy for your business description,
ad copy, and so forth. To do your keyword research, you’re going to start with search
engines.
Let’s say that you’ve got a stationery store. Think about the products that you’re targeting,
and then go to Google and Facebook Graph Search and look for the subjects related to
that term. Try to think about the subject broadly and come up with as many terms and
short phrases as you can. For instance, if you sell supplies to make party invitations, you
might search for:
• Party invitations
• Mother’s day cards
• Wedding invitations
• Wedding stationery
• Cards for party invitations
• RSVP cards
• Card designs
• Custom stationery
Basically, you’re taking the fundamental words associated with this product, which are
stationery and cards, and attaching related terms to them that will help you figure out
how to market them effectively. It doesn’t do much good to advertise Christmas cards
in July, for instance. Take advantage of holiday seasons, traditional habits, and regional
cultures.

In addition to search engines, you can also use the ad systems built into Facebook. You’ll
have to go through the process of setting up your advertising account first; then, create
an ad and use the keyword tools to see what the range of audiences and prices is for
each of your terms.
Beyond these elementary resources, there are some other keyword research tools out
there that you can use for Facebook ads: 
• Google AdWords Keyword Planner
• Google Trends (Figure 6-1)
Figure 6-1. Google Trends
Beyond keyword research is audience research. You want to know who is using these
keywords to find things to buy. To learn that, you have to look at publicly available
analytics for sites that rank highly for the keywords you’re targeting.
If you have an established website with a decent amount of traffic, just look at your own
stats. You can also look at competitors’ stats and demographics through these tools: 
• Quantcast (see Figure 6-2)

these tools:

Any website associated with your target keywords (the sites that turned up when you
were using Google to search for your keywords) can offer valuable insight into the
demography of your customer base.
The more you understand your market, the more effective you’ll be. The more specific
you can be, the better off you are.
Targeting
Target exclusively. In other words, if you’ve got multiple ads in one campaign and you
intend to target them to different demographics, make sure there is little or no overlap.
Otherwise, you’re just showing the same ads to the same people and paying twice for
them.
Along these lines, one big mistake people make is to create too many campaigns with
similar targeting. They’ll create a whole campaign aimed at women age 30–45 in the
U.S. who like yoga, and another campaign for women 30–50 in the U.S. who like Oprah
Winfrey, and then put the same ads in both campaigns. There’s a lot of crossover there,
and that shows double (or triple, or more) ads. Not only is this costing you a fortune,
112 
| 
Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

it’s also reducing your click-through rate (CTR), which increases the cost of your ad and
annoys the people viewing it.
At the very least, use different ads in campaigns that have some overlap.
Creating Audiences for Facebook Ads
We’ve established that the more focused your campaigns are, the better. Every member
of your audience who doesn’t find your product or service enticing is a waste of your
time and money. One way to improve focus is by targeting an ad. Another way to do it
is to define the audience, and then assign that audience to a campaign—working back‐
ward, essentially. This is especially useful when you have an opt-in email list from which
to work.
The Facebook Ads Power Editor has an Audiences section that lets you create an audi‐
ence based on a number of selective criteria such as interests and demographics, and a
Custom Audience built on an external list. Custom audiences can be created from lists
of email addresses or phone numbers. Facebook user IDs are not an acceptable datapoint
to create a custom audience on unless you have each user’s permission to advertise them.
One thing you’ll definitely want to start with is a Fans Only audience. Facebook used
to have this as a default audience option, but at the time of this book’s publication, the
only option available is “Fans and Friends of Fans.” Frankly, this is a horrible option that
will almost certainly not benefit you. Your fans are definitely interested; their friends
are probably not. To create an audience of your fans, click Create Audience, and then
select Saved Target Group. In the configuration window that appears, type your page
name into the “Target users who are connected to” field, and save this as “Fans Only.”
You can create other audiences in a similar way by using different options. You can even
create an audience that targets the pages of your competitors.
To create a custom audience, first make sure that you have your opt-in list in a text file
with one entry per line. You may have to export it from your mailing list software, if it’s
an email address list. Then go to the Power Editor in Facebook Ads, and click Create
Audience, then select Custom Audience. Select the option that corresponds to the type
of information that is in your list, and give it an appropriate name.
If you can, definitely take advantage of the Custom Audience feature. The results are
impressive, with ads generating CTRs of 4% in a landscape where 0.04% is considered
the norm. However, one major issue business owners should know of before using
Custom Audiences is that you have to read, fully understand, and agree to its terms and
conditions. While Facebook has come under fire for issues about privacy, it requires
businesses to inform their subscribers about using their information for purposes like
Custom Audiences.
Targeting 
| 
113

Once you have your Custom Audience based on your email list, you can have Facebook
create a Lookalike Audience of users who have similar tastes, interests, and demo‐
graphics to your email list. That list will probably be huge (as in millions of users), so
cross-section that list further with additional filtering criteria.
A more recent feature of Facebook’s that is quite valuable in understanding your target
market in Facebook is Audience Insights. Found within the Ads Manager, it allows you
to drill down into specific target audiences (who are not already fans) and examine those
segments’ demographic and behavioral data. Definitely check that feature out.
Unpublished Post Ads for Facebook
When certain published posts that appear on your page are irrelevant to the fans you’ve
targeted, you risk losing your audience. To work around this, you can promote dark
posts, also known as unpublished posts, to a subset of your target audience. In a sense,
it’s filtering the already filtered audience.
These unpublished post ads may come in the form of a status update, a photo, a video,
or a link share. The “dark” post will not appear on your brand’s page but rather on a
targeted customer’s News Feed. For example, if your restaurant has a new organic vegan
menu, you could promote it to a receptive audience by sending a post to vegan and
vegetarian fans.
The results will be better engagement, a retained customer base, improved branding,
and perhaps even increased fans from niche markets.
In addition to delivering relevant content, unpublished posts also allow you to perform
A/B testing of ads: you can create two different campaigns and determine which one
works best for which market.
Budgeting
Don’t pour a lot of money into social media advertising right away. Start slow, start low,
observe results, and then ramp it up once you’re profitable. Once you get going, it’s
worth it to take a risk on increasing your budget. You can raise it by a certain amount
—say, $50—and see if your KPIs (key performance indicators) scale linearly with it. It
might be easier, though, to double your ad spend and see if that results in a doubling of
your profit. If it does, then double it again and again until you find the point of dimin‐
ishing returns, and then scale it back to the sweet spot.
The tricky part here is that things can change quickly, and you probably won’t know
why. Something can work one day and flop the next. It’s impossible to predict what will
happen with ads, so you must be quickly reactive; keep an eye on the graphs and reports.
If your clicks or impressions go down and/or the bids go up, then pause the campaign.
Your CTR should be high (0.03% or higher) from the first day onward. If you’re above
114 
| 
Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

that and profitable, then you’re OK. If you’re below that, pause the campaign and start
a new one with new ads.
The Basics of Ad Design
A great social media ad follows this formula:
Great offer + interesting image + compelling headline.
This is a simple formula, but its individual pieces are going to take some effort to achieve.
If you have successful campaigns in other mediums, then you can start by using the
same text and graphics on Facebook. Beyond that, the following tips will help you create
great ads.
Give a Reason for Clicking Like
If you are trying to increase fans and engagement with your ads, then a great offer should
involve something unique for social media participants. Provide an incentive for viewers
to click Like and become part of your community. For instance, Tim Ferriss, author of
The 4-Hour Body, offers a fan-only chapter.
Think of some “Facebook exclusive” promotions you could offer. Also think of an‐
nouncements that you could submit to your Facebook fans first. What are the incentives
that your ideal customer would appreciate?
Godiva does a nice job of offering a “rewards” chocolate club that you can join for free
from its Facebook landing page. Free chocolate is definitely a nice incentive! Godiva
collects email addresses and complete contact information when viewers opt in to the
Reward Club.
In the past, on Facebook, good strategy included getting many likes
for your business in order to build your audience and your reach. The
people who liked your page were the people most likely to see your
posts in their News Feeds. Although this is still a very good strategy,
at the time of this book’s writing, the organic reach of business page
posts has significantly decreased. We suspect, though we cannot de‐
finitively say, that this is the reason Facebook has added the new
feature Boost Post (formerly Promote) as a way of encouraging
business-page owners to advertise their posts.
Interesting Photos
This is hard to qualify. If you’re using models, make sure they look like they’re having
fun. If you’re using product photos, make sure they’re high quality and that they make
The Basics of Ad Design 
| 
115

the product look amazing. On a more basic level, an interesting photo has bright and
vivid colors that differ from the Facebook color scheme (blue and silver).
Great Headlines
Profitable headlines sum up the message you wish to communicate. The normal rules
of copywriting are: headline, ad copy, ad image. On Facebook, however, the order of
importance is: image, headline, ad copy. The image must be relevant to the ad and the
destination, and also draw attention. This is to break through the clutter of all the other
images on Facebook. When writing headlines for Facebook ads, be sure to make them
short and punchy—questions work great. For example: 
“Love Science?” “Need More Clients?” “Love Tony Robbins?”
Next, you need ad copy to go with the headline. It is important that the ad copy be a call
to action. In the following examples, the headlines from the previous example are fol‐
lowed by ad copy that demands a call to action. For example: 
“Love Science? Then LIKE this page” “Need More Clients? Get Frank Kern’s Free Book”
“Love Tony Robbins? Click here to get 4 hours of FREE training”
If you’re all out of ideas, try asking these questions:
• Who is your customer?
• What is his current pain?
• How can you solve it?
Focus on the benefit and outcome for your customer, and try to make your headline
show that with as few words as possible. You can also try focusing just on relieving the
pain.
Humor is also a good bet; it gets attention and catches people off guard, lightens the
mood, and helps you connect.
Here are some common headlines you can use as a template for your own pages:
• Discover the Secret to…
• How to…
• 3 Tips That Help You…

Images That Sell
There are a lot of old articles that talk about how your Facebook ads need to have a
photo that involves cleavage in order to be successful. Whether or not this is true, it
certainly is no longer valid for many markets. You might get more clicks, but you’re not
necessarily going to get more conversions—unless it is a good fit and relevant to the ad.
Women feature everywhere in advertising: in men’s magazines, women’s magazines, tool
ads, makeup ads, and virtually anything else that could reasonably involve a model.
Women are selling everything. Therefore, it’s wise to at least test ads with pretty women,
as long as you own the images. If you’re going to try this, then concentrate on an ideal
image of a close-up of a pretty girl’s face looking directly at the camera and smiling—
but don’t do a three-quarters shot that shows cleavage, unless the image is relevant to
the headline and ad copy. Use a green background, and put your logo in the corner. This
composition will work with just about any product or service on the market.
Another image that sells well? One with eyes that are staring or appearing to look straight
at you. And, expanding on this model, a good seller is also a picture of your product
with a model’s eyes looking at or toward the product. Have an attention-grabbing image
and a call-to-action button like “Click here” or “Click here to get this XYZ.” Images for
ads can have a maximum of 20% text. Finally, the best images are almost always custom
built. Begin with your basic image and add the elements as needed. In Figure 6-5, most
of these elements have been added, such as the eyes looking at the user and the call-to-
action button.
Figure 6-5. An effective Facebook ad
Understanding the Metrics
Facebook has a number of metrics that can tell you how a post or an ad is performing.
On your page, there are two measurements that show how many people have viewed
each of your posts: one for organic reach, and one for paid reach. The latter is only for
boosted posts. At this time, we don’t recommend using the Boost Post option because
it costs a lot and its targeting options aren’t as good. Facebook has recently made some
Understanding the Metrics 
| 
117

changes adding some targeting options to Boost Post that may make testing it a more
feasible option in the near future. Instead, promote an individual post with an ad inside
your Ads Manager.
In the Ads Manager, there is much more data on the performance of each ad and cam‐
paign, as you can see in Figure 6-6.
Figure 6-6. Ad metrics in Facebook Ads Manager
Each column in the Advertising Performance screen has a tool tip that explains exactly
what it represents. Some of these aren’t going to be important to your campaign, but
that depends entirely on what you’re advertising and how the ad is targeted. However,
CTR and Actions are applicable to all ads; that’s the basic measure of how many people
interacted with your ad. The average CTR for Facebook Ads is 0.02%, but a well-
performing ad is anything above 0.09%. The rest of the numbers in this view need to be
individually interpreted; only you can define success for your business.
Multivariate Testing
There are only three main variables in an ad: the image, the text, and the targeting (the
audience). How do you know that you’ve got any of them right, let alone the perfect
combination? The answer is multivariate testing.
Multivariate testing is a more advanced version of A/B testing (also known as split
testing). In the latter, you are merely testing between two single changes—for instance,
testing an ad by using different graphics, but the same text and targeting. If you run two
ads that are identical except for one change, you’re doing an A/B test between the two.
Multivariate testing is advanced A/B testing. Once you find the best graphic, you then
vary the text until you improve results. The idea is to come up with the perfect ad—one
that gets as many clicks or conversions as can be reasonably expected, given your re‐
sources and audience.
This can make the difference between success and failure. The most famous instance
of the power of multivariate testing is from Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
Obama’s director of analytics, Dan Siroker, tested a variety of options for graphics, vid‐
eos, colors, and text for the Obama campaign website. He discovered that the options
that the campaign staff liked the most were, in some cases, the least effective in terms
118 
| 
Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

of actual conversions. Due to his multivariate testing success, Siroker’s testing resulted
in a 40% increase in conversion rate, which in turn raised an estimated $60 million more
for the campaign. He’s now the CEO of Optimizely, which makes software that supports
the multivariate testing process.
The key to successful multivariate testing (or split testing, for that matter) is simply to
get in the habit of doing it constantly. Don’t just go with your gut most of the time. The
best performing ad copy, images, landing pages, and so forth may be counterintuitive.
You won’t know unless you test it.
Testing Headlines with Bit.ly
You can use a tracking link through a service such as Bit.ly to test out each headline in
isolation. This will enable you to find the best headline without spending any money
on ads.
First, you’re going to need something to link to. You can try to use your landing page,
but that might be too spammy for your Twitter followers. It might be more appropriate
to write a blog post on whatever subject applies to the headlines you’re testing. It doesn’t
have to be long; 500 words would work pretty well.
Next, go to Bit.ly and set up tracking links to that page or blog post. You’ll need as many
links as you have headlines to test.
Then go to Twitter and post your headline as a tweet, and link to the blog post using
the corresponding Bit.ly link. You can use Hootsuite to post each tweet at a reasonable
interval, and then check back at Bit.ly in a few days to see which one got the most
attention. And that’s your ad headline!
Good Landing Page Design
A good landing page is vital for our sales efforts. We want to have a landing page to send
our traffic to. In direct response marketing, we want to give our prospect only one option
on our landing page—inaction will result in a default choice. A Subscribe button will
not be accompanied by a Don’t Subscribe button. That is why we use a landing page
instead of a home page. If a prospect is given more than one choice, she will usually
make no choice. For instance, if I want to sell something, then the only option on my
landing page is to Buy. Similarly, if I want my prospect to sign up for my newsletter or
get a coupon code, it is the only option on my landing page. See these Facebook exam‐
ples, or, outside Facebook ads, check out http://ndstuff.com/joeball-3/ or http://
ndstuff.com/helmet/.
Interestingly, the plain and unbranded direct response landing page (the one without
the background image of football players and fans) got a 22% higher opt-in rate. We
split-tested using Visual Website Optimizer, though Optimizely would have worked
Testing Headlines with Bit.ly 
| 
119

equally well. Time after time, the unbranded landing pages convert higher. Why is this
important? You have already spent money on advertising to get potential customers to
your page in order to get more sales or subscribers. Spending no additional advertising
dollars, you convert your page visitors to subscribers.
Remove Clutter and Improve Navigation
Again, it must be immediately obvious what a visitor should do on your landing page.
Make your call to action clear. Specify exactly how you want the viewer to interact with
your page. Just focus on one action—for example, clicking Like, buying something, or
subscribing.
The Approval Process
Once you’ve created an ad, it will be submitted for approval. Someone in Facebook’s
vast organization will look at your ad and determine if it meets the company’s terms of
service. This is an unpredictable process that can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 3
days. There are no discernible triggers that make the process take longer.
If you are wondering what’s going on, go in and create one more ad in the campaign
and submit it to see what happens. Link this test ad to a blog post or something totally
harmless and completely different from the first ad. Facebook may have put you into a
holding pattern to review further.
Facebook changes the rules all the time, so you may want to read the terms of service
and make sure that you are in full compliance. For instance, if your ad leads to an off-
site landing page, you must have a privacy policy on that site. There must also be a
Contact Us or About Us link clearly visible. Facebook wants to know that you’re a le‐
gitimate, trustworthy business.
Real-Life Q&A
Q: I see ads in my Facebook sidebar, but I also get larger ads in my News Feed (it usually
says Suggested Post at the top and then says Sponsored below it). Are the News Feed
ads different somehow? Is one more expensive than the other? What’s the difference?
A: There are three different placements for ads: Mobile News Feed, Desktop News Feed,
and Right Column of Facebook. The key distinction is that Right Column ads do not
show up on mobile devices; therefore, you lose 50% of your prospects. According to
Facebook, as reported by SocialMediaToday, 48% of daily active users and 49% of ad
revenue come from mobile. However, we’ve been involved in campaigns where 60% of
our daily active users and our ad revenue came from users on mobile devices.

Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

News Feed ads are in your prospective customer’s News Feed. In general, they are more
social and more effective than the other ad placements. Plus, you can populate the News
Feed with great images—it is much easier to grab attention in a News Feed. The reason
you see Suggested Post on some of the posts in your News Feed is because the owner of
the advertisement has targeted you—either you have an interest in the subject matter
and/or you fit its target demographic. The reason you see Sponsored at the bottom of
an ad just means that it is a paid advertisement. And, no, one is not more expensive than
the other.
Q: I am split-testing (A/B) my ads by showing more than one ad to the exact same
audience. Some of the ads get thousands of views and some get almost none, within the
same campaign. One is showing to 15,000 people and one is showing to 156 people,
with the exact same audience selected. Am I doing something wrong?
A: This is because as soon as one ad gets a click, Facebook floods that ad with impressions,
and the other ads are ignored. The best way to handle this is to pause all other ads in
the campaign, and let the first one run for a day or so. Then pause the first ad and
reactivate all the others until one of them pulls ahead. Repeat this process until you have
at least three ads with decent CTRs. Then pause everything and let those three run
simultaneously. You’ll find that all three will get equal impressions, and you can run a
proper split test.
Q: What’s the longest you’ve had to wait to see if an ad was approved or not? Typically,
it’s a few hours until approval for me, but two ads have been in review for more than 12
hours now. These ads send traffic to my website, which I’ve never done before; I always
used my Facebook business page as my landing page. Could that have anything to do
with it?
A: Three days is the longest I’ve ever waited, but that was a rare case. It is possible that
your landing page is holding things up. You might want to check to see if your page
conforms to Facebook’s guidelines. If the Facebook Ads rep who reviewed your ad saw
anything questionable there, he might have placed you in a “holding pattern” for a
supervisor to review.
Q: I just saw a huge tower ad in Facebook today. I’ve never seen that before. It looks like
a Google AdSense tower ad. Is this something new?
A: These big banner ads are a form of malware and are not hosted through Facebook.
If you see these, your operating system or browser has been infected with adware. You
should run a virus scan and/or clear all cookies from your browser right away.
Q: I’d like to use President Obama’s image in my ad. Can I do that?
A: No. Don’t even try it. Never use anyone’s image, name, or likeness in an ad without
that person’s written consent.
Q: I have ads that lead to an opt-in tab on my Facebook page. They’re getting me about
12 new opt-ins and 30 likes per week. Or at least they were. Then I changed the content
and layout of the opt-in page, and opt-ins dropped to two per week. Bad idea, right? So
The Approval Process 
| 
121

I changed it back to the original format, but it’s stayed at two per week even though I’m
still getting the same number of new likes. What could be wrong?
A: Potentially a lot of things. Are you targeting the same people? Are there more than
200,000 people in your target group? What is the reach of your campaign? Has most of
your target group already seen your ad at least three times? Can you set up two landing
pages for opt-in content, and split-test them? Have you tried setting up a new campaign
with new images, headlines, and ad copy, but with the same landing page? Conversion
is a complex process with many factors. It’s important to dissect as much as possible to
understand what is going wrong. New campaigns can cure many ills. On the other hand,
maybe the whole thing was a coincidence, and you’ve already reached all of the people
who are willing to participate in your target audience.
Q: What’s a good Facebook Ads CTR?
A: It depends on your market. Some demographics have CTRs hovering around 0.4%,
while others are lucky to get above average (0.02%). If you have good competition, it’s
going to be tough. In untapped markets, Facebook ads have a great CTR. Personally, we
wouldn’t run an ad with a click-through-rate below 0.9%—we find that the ads are no
longer profitable when CTRs fall below 0.9%.
Q: How long should it take before I see more impressions from a new campaign? I haven’t
had any impressions at all, and I’m wondering why.
A: If you’re not getting any impressions, you will need to either increase your spend or
check your targeting. Maybe you are bidding too low to be clickable. After a certain
amount of time, if the impressions aren’t coming, it’s time to test some new ads.
Q: What is bidding for a Facebook campaign, and why would I want to do this?
A: There are two ways you can bid on traffic in a Facebook campaign. One is CPM (cost
per mille—your ad gets shown 1,000 times) where you pay for impressions, and the
other is CPC (cost per click) where you pay per click, or each time someone clicks on
your ad. You can also let Facebook automatically bid for you, or you can manually bid
CPM or CPC. Facebook gives you a suggested range and you just put in an amount that
is the maximum you are willing to pay for the click. According to Facebook, the sug‐
gested bid range is there to help you pick a maximum bid so your ad will be successful.
It’s based on how many other advertisers are competing to show their ad to the same
audience as you are. You don’t have to pick a bid in this range, but you can use it to help
you pick a bid that will result in a decent-sized amount of impressions and clicks. Ac‐
cording to Facebook, you will never pay more for an impression or click than necessary,
so entering your true maximum is the best way to make sure you don’t miss out on
impressions and clicks you could have received. That being said, we always bid manually,
because that is how we find our ROI in advertising. However, when you’re doing a
“LIKE” campaign (a campaign for “Like Us” clicks only), this is automatically set up as
optimized CPM by Facebook.

Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

Q: How do I get my ads to show to more people? For example, I have one ad with a reach
of only 635, but the ad targets 155,000 people. My bid is 45 cents, and the actual cost is
30 cents, so I’m already above the bid I need. What can I do to get the ad to show to
more of the 155,000?
A: What type of ad are you running? It’s generally harder to get impressions on a socially
recommended ad (so a page post ad or page ad that includes stories about their friends
liking it); if you have it socially recommended, try removing that and see if you get more
impressions.
Try this: start a new campaign with an identical ad. Facebook Ads doesn’t show an ad
to all 155,000 users at once. Your targeted users have to log into Facebook to view the
ad. So it will take time to reach all users. You can try raising your bid even higher for a
few days; that might get you more impression share. Put it at $1.25 and let it run on a
$30 per day budget. A higher bid, even beyond the actual cost, can increase impressions
by quite a bit. Facebook Ads wants to see how high of a CTR your ad is going to get, so
it will deliver a high amount of impressions until it has an estimate. If your ad doesn’t
get a high CTR, Facebook drops your impressions in favor of an ad that does. The higher
the CTR of an ad, the more Facebook makes per impression.
Q: I launched an ad, and the low-end bid recommendation was $1.95, but I went ahead
and bid $1.00 anyway. Two days later, when I check its stats, it says the bid recommen‐
dation is $0.35–$0.83. What’s going on?
A: This can change drastically from moment to moment. Facebook is guessing the CTR
of your ads and weighing it against the average ad CTR. This is no different from other
popular ad systems on other networks. It starts at the average CTR in the marketplace,
then gives a CPC estimate and uses that to establish a ballpark CPM. The CPC price
adjusts as your ad history gathers more data. No data (on a new ad) means an almost
certainly inaccurate estimate, so plan on running the ad for a day or so, then adjusting
your bid at regular intervals.
Q: Of the clicks that you get from an ad, how many will actually make a purchase? My
ad goes to an external site and so far I have 62 clicks from a campaign reach of 21,000.
Of those 62 clicks, statistically, how many would actually make a purchase? Is there a
formula that would determine this? I’ll know if anyone purchased in a day or two, but
I’m curious to know the numbers that are involved.
A: You’ll know this only from testing. It’s different for every product, market, service,
and offer. It depends on how much your product costs and how much you spend on
your ads. Spend a few bucks, and then pause and assess the results. It’s impossible to
give accurate figures for CTR and purchases unless you compare against someone in
the same vertical.
Expect to see lower CTR and purchases from Facebook than from a search engine ad
campaign. When people surf Facebook, they are not intending to buy something, even
if they click on your ad. Mostly they want to see what is new with their friends.
The Approval Process 
| 
123

If someone searches for a term related to your product or service on Google or Bing,
then she has intent and is more likely to click on the ad and then purchase the product.
So rather than focus on expected purchase rate, just focus on return on investment. As
long as you have a positive ROI, keep running your ads and landing page, and ramp up
your spending while continuously testing variations to attempt to improve CTR and
purchases. If you have a negative ROI, make changes quickly or abandon the campaign
and move on to another product or media venue.
Q: I see some industries/services really just having a hard time targeting enough people
to make their ad campaigns both scalable and profitable for lead generation. If you had
to pick the top five industries/services for being able to leverage Facebook Ads with a
positive ROI, what would they be?
A: All markets can benefit from having a solid Facebook presence, even ones you
wouldn’t expect. Search engines are giving more weight than ever to social cues. Having
said that, the best markets for Facebook ads are: entertainment, gossip/tabloids, em‐
ployment, fitness, health, travel, personal and household services, self-improvement,
ecommerce for physical goods, webinars, and live events.
With today’s advanced targeting and the gigantic Facebook user base, any vertical has
potential to benefit from Facebook Ads. Any product or service that can be marketed
via traditional media can be marketed via Facebook.
Q: What is the range of people I should try to target? The first ad I made a long time
ago initially focused on 3,000 people, but someone recently told me that I should shoot
for 200,000. Is that true?
A: It depends on your target audience. Is this a local business, nationwide, worldwide?
Ideally you should find 200,000 people to target. This keeps Facebook sending enough
impressions for a while, so your ad stays alive longer without going beyond your targeted
audience. However, if you are a local business with a very specific niche demographic,
then don’t try to go beyond that targeted audience, and compensate for that limitation
by refreshing your ads more often.
Q: How often should I increase my bid before Facebook starts displaying my ads? I
started low, $0.25, and increase $0.05 every half hour. Is that the way to go, or should I
do something different?
A: Bidding can be tricky because it changes based on day, time, niche, demographic,
location, account age, and other factors. Some people have a policy to start low (which
you’ve done) and increase the bid until you get a decent number of impressions. In our
businesses, we start high. We normally double the low end of the suggested range. We
never pay that much, but it helps to ensure that our ads get shown quickly.
Q: I’ve reached 15,000 views and have gotten 28 clicks. Are those statistics good or not?
It’s been a while since I’ve created an ad and I’m not sure what’s good and what isn’t. My
CTR is 0.077%.

Chapter 6: Designing and Testing Ads on Facebook

A: If your CTR is above 0.020%, then you are above the stated average. That doesn’t
mean that this is as good as it gets or that you should be satisfied. As we’ve mentioned
before, in our businesses, we pull any ad that has a CTR below 0.09%—it just doesn’t
produce enough of a return. Certainly, keep an eye on your CTR and start creating new
ads with different (but similar) photos. Test a few ads at a time, with the goal of getting
a higher CTR and conversion rate. Try different photos first, then different headlines.
Q: Today I was following a Google Shopping link to an ecommerce site. I didn’t click on
anything in the page, not even a Like button. Now I’m on Facebook and the company’s
ad for the exact product I clicked on is following me around Facebook. How am I being
targeted from Google to the company website to Facebook? It’s not just a company ad;
it’s the exact product I looked at.
A: This is called retargeting, and it can have a huge positive impact. Google definitely
does retargeting on Facebook. You just have to put a Google AdWords retargeting cookie
on your Facebook landing page; then your ads can follow those people around the Web.
This is excellent for product launches and affiliate offers. It helps create social proof—
many images of your product increase your authority and credibility. This helps to
ensure that customers buy from you instead of your competitors.
Summary
Our goal in this chapter was to help you determine your advertising objectives and
design the appropriate campaign to achieve them. At the very least, any do-it-yourselfer
can begin a Like campaign to build an audience for her business and design some ads
with the necessary elements to start a basic advertising campaign. You should now be
conversant with campaign types, market research, targeting, budgeting, the basics of ad
design, the metrics of how your Facebook ad or post is performing, and multivariate
testing. You should be able to spot good landing page design (and why it’s essential),
and know what to expect in the Facebook ad approval process.
We also hope, by the end of this chapter, that any other questions you had have now
been answered and any misconceptions cleared by the lengthy Q&A provided.
Head over to the Social eCommerce site for more Q&A and to post your own burning
questions! You’ll also have access to exclusive offers, discounts, and coupon codes on

CHAPTER 7
Guerrilla Marketing
Guerrilla marketing means using low-cost, unexpected, and/or unorthodox promo‐
tional strategies to market a product or service. Guerrilla marketing isn’t usually some‐
thing you can pay for, so it typically substitutes an ad budget for an investment of time,
energy, and creativity. It requires a high level of engagement, excitement, and innova‐
tion.
This may be your best shot at success in ecommerce through social media if you’re not
prepared to invest a ton of money and a ton of risk. There’s an ethical line, though, and
you don’t want to cross it. Creating a bizarre ad that attracts a lot of clicks is one thing,
but creating a knowingly misleading ad in order to trick people into buying from you
is never a good idea.
You have to be careful here, because it’s easy to upset people and cross the line into black
hat territory. If you stay on the straight and narrow, it’s boring; if you go too far off the
road, it’s offensive.
The main concept to remember here is: be original and creative and address the trends,
but don’t use things for unintended purposes. Don’t exploit any bugs or loopholes, and
don’t game the system. If you do, you’ll be discovered and punished eventually, and that
can erase all of the gains you’ve made—maybe more. With that in mind, let’s take a look
at some unique, niche tactics that you can add to your marketing strategy.
Honor Competitor Coupons
The majority of people who like a brand on Facebook clicked the button only to receive
special offers and discounts. Rather than just offering your fans coupons or deals, why
not advertise that you’ll honor any of your competitor’s coupons as well? That way you
can piggyback on your competitors’ ads.
127

This is a great way not only to increase your sales, but also to increase customer loyalty
and keep an eye on your competition.
Offer Giveaways, Prizes, and Challenges
Because you’re saving some money with low-cost, innovative social media campaigns,
invest some of your marketing budget into giving away products for free. Free stuff can
attract a ton of attention.
Set aside a certain number of products to give away in social media campaigns. This is
a fantastic way to generate some buzz around your brand, and to gain new followers
and fans.
You don’t have to give away your own products. In fact, giving away something that is
somewhat expensive and heavily in demand or hard to find may be a much more cost-
effective method of attracting both opt-ins and sales traffic. For instance, if you are an
orthodontist, you might purchase five of the latest Apple iPads and offer to give one
away to the first five people who come in for a free consultation and end up getting
braces. Or you could give away the latest, hottest gaming entertainment system to the
1,000th customer on Black Friday. Just make sure that you either already physically have
what you’re promising to give away, or specify that you’re giving away only a voucher
that enables the reward to be purchased by the winning customer.
If you’re an author promoting a new book, you could offer a prize (a signed copy of your
new book, a private in-home reading, or an invitation to an event; if you aren’t quite
famous enough for those things, you could buy a signed copy of a famous author’s book
and offer to give that away instead) to the first person to defeat you at Words With
Friends or Scrabble.
Local businesses can set up scavenger hunts, either in your store, or out in the local
community (with the final clue being in your store somewhere).
There are many interesting and creative possibilities for challenges and giveaways. All
you have to do is identify your goal or target, think of a fun challenge or valuable prize,
and develop a compelling process to connect them. If your ideas are good, you won’t
have to do more than a basic level of promotion in order for them to go viral. Be careful,
though, that the people you are attracting with your giveaway or challenge are part of
your target demographics.
Be Controversial
Writing a controversial blog post related to your industry can do wonders for driving
traffic to your site and getting attention on social media. For instance, if you run an
ecommerce site that sells nursery accessories, try writing a post on “why you should let
128 
| 
Chapter 7: Guerrilla Marketing

your baby cry it out,” or some other controversial topic. Just be careful not to alienate
your readers.
Use Facebook Offers to Generate Leads
Offers are shown directly in the News Feeds of those you target, just as ads are. This
means optimal placement within Facebook, not to mention that Facebook sends an
actual email (not just a notification) to those who click on the offer. However, when
someone claims an offer, it can’t go to an external page. That’s the difference between
an offer and an ad. Because it is limited in scope, you can’t take it to a landing page.
Post an Infographic
An infographic that shows interesting statistics and facts can attract a lot of attention,
if well designed and properly promoted. Many bloggers like to do infographic round‐
ups periodically, or center entire blog posts around meaningful demographics in their
niche. To see some examples, go to Google Images and search for “infographic.” You
can spend an entire afternoon engrossed in clever representations of interesting data
points.
If you don’t have access to original data or statistics, grab data from reliable sources on
the Web and have a designer create a graphical representation of them.
Airbnb wanted to release a data intense economic impact study highlighting the positive
effects on local economies when would-be travelers choose to stay at someone’s apart‐
ment or home versus a hotel room to time as a counterargument to claims made in New
York City that tax revenue was being deprived of the city due to occupancy loopholes.
Partnering with CopyPress, Airbnb developed out an HTML interactive infographic to
not only express the information in a visual manner, but used it as an opportunity to
expand into deep sections of the website it wished to rank for. Following the creation
of the digital asset, Airbnb’s PR team and CopyPress’s native ads team were able to
perform outreach and place advertisements on a variety of publications such as
Time.com and Washington Post, highlighting one of the key attributes of interactive
infographics (they’re difficult for another publisher to steal!). The result was both a
moral victory for Airbnb users in NYC as well as the SEO team of Airbnb; the stunt
netted over 130 higher quality links.
Create a LinkedIn Group
Creating a LinkedIn group for your niche or industry is a great way to get known in
your field without overtly advertising yourself or your business.
Use Facebook Offers to Generate Leads 
| 
129

Keep in mind your LinkedIn group should be centered on an industry or topic, not on
your business. So if you’re in the online marketing field, you could create a group for
Online Marketing Professionals,” but not Jim’s Online Marketing Service.
Creating a LinkedIn group not only drives traffic to your website, it also establishes you
as a leader in your industry, and is fantastic for making new connections and generating
leads for your business.
Create Awards Programs
Creating an industry-specific awards program can be another inexpensive way to get
other business owners to spread the word about your business.
Here’s how it typically works: design an awards program where entrants encourage their
customers, newsletter subscribers, and social media followers to vote for them. The
contestant with the most number of votes wins. Along with a small cash prize, winners
(and often nominees) are given badges they can put on their sites to recognize their
achievement.
For a relatively small cost, you’ve just gained new social media followers, buzz for your
brand, and inbound links from all the badges you’ve awarded.
If you don’t have the resources to set up your own awards program, you might be able
to connect with an existing program that can help you bring in new customers
(Figure 7-1).
Cross-Promote with Complementary Businesses
Social media is the perfect platform for working together with complementary busi‐
nesses in your industry. For instance, if you sell culinary tools, you might cross-promote
with a grocery store or a cookbook author. By cross-promoting one another’s blog posts,
tweets, pins, and Facebook posts, you can generate buzz in a totally nonthreatening,
non-self-promoting way.
Use Photography with Branding
If you’re into photography, get serious about photo-sharing sites—Pinterest, in partic‐
ular. Make sure all of your photos have watermarks with your URL or brand name.
Include prices in the description of your product photos so that they’re included in the
Gifts section. Where appropriate, you can also put text on the image, but take care not
to be too spammy. See Figure 7-2 for an example.

such as American Express Membership Rewards

Figure 7-2. A good photo of a hot brand-name item can showcase a brand, a model, a
reseller, a fan club, or all of the above
Arrange Meetups for SEO, Networking, and Marketing
Meetup is a great way to network if you live in a decent size metropolitan area and are
somewhat extroverted.
Start a meetup group related to your industry and promote it. Host interesting events
and be sure to hand out your business cards to attendees. Completely fill out your
Meetup profile, include a link to your site on it, and make it public. 
Make and Post Memes
Take a look at the most popular memes on quickmeme and memebase, and think of
ways you can use them to fit your branding messages. Make memes and post them to
your social media accounts.
132 
| 
Chapter 7: Guerrilla Marketing

The possible exception is Facebook, where meme content is less likely to be seen than
it used to be. You can still generate great traffic from meme-type content, just less than
before the recent updates. Travel membership club Worldventures took advantage of
the popular meme template Philosoraptor to make its own travel-related meme, and
then posted it to its blog (Figure 7-3).
Figure 7-3. Memes are great, highly shareable, humorous ways to communicate a mes‐
sage about your brand, store, or product. Be careful not to violate copyrights, though!
Leverage Viral Videos
If viral videos were easy to do, everyone would have one. This is just something you’re
going to have to experiment with on your own, if you’re able. One tip we can offer is
that humorous videos work very well. Even if you’re a local business, it can work for
you. You could do a spoof or parody—even if it is only tangentially related to your
business. This can generate a lot of traffic. It’s not so much product related, though it
can involve products. You’re just trying to generate attention and incoming links.
Figure 7-4 shows Dollar Shave Club’s excellent take on creating a viral video that is still
centered on its product.
Leverage Viral Videos

133

Figure 7-4. Dollar Shave Club capitalized on a very successful commercial by also shar‐
ing it on YouTube
If the news media reports on your topic, make your own video about it in response or
as a commentary on the news item.
Unboxing videos—videos that show a product being unpackaged, assembled, and used
for the first time—are typically very popular. Do you have products you could use for
an unboxing video?
Get onto Wikipedia
A Wikipedia entry for your company or organization lends credibility to your brand
and gets a Wikipedia link onto the first page of Google search results for your company.
Unfortunately, it’s against the rules to write an entry for yourself (conflict of interest),
and the Wikipedia editors have an uncanny ability to detect rule breakers.
You might be tempted to work around the rules by creating a new Wikipedia account
on a network that is not associated with your business—for example, your home com‐
puter, a coffee shop, or a friend’s house—and then, over time, becoming a trusted con‐
tributor by making virtuous edits and correcting typos. This, too, is dangerous and not
recommended.
134 
| 
Chapter 7: Guerrilla Marketing

The first step is to make sure your organization is notable. In other words, worthy of a
mention in an encyclopedia. You’ll need feature articles about you in mainstream media,
not just passing mentions or soundbytes.
Next, you’ll need to befriend a Wikipedian who will create the article for you. Make sure
the article is sufficiently cited. Wikipedia relies on verifiable facts in the form of studies,
papers, and news reports. If you cannot cite anything, then your article is likely to be
deleted.
Case Study: Giving Pays Off
Kurt Shuster is cofounder and CEO of Noomii.com, a directory of life coaches and
business coaches. In 2011, Kurt’s marketing team had been trying for a few months to
hit the gas on their content marketing plan. They had tried blogging and a few contests,
but such is the case sometimes, the payoff was yet to come. Kurt then hired co-author
Stephan Spencer to assist them with SEO and buzz marketing.
Figure 7-5. Noomii’s advent calendar from 2011, 2012, and 2013
Under Stephan’s guidance, Noomii started thinking differently about building buzz and
links. In their brainstorming, they thought it would be beneficial to focus on the up‐
coming holiday season, and a fun new idea came just a day before December 1st. The
team sensed that this one might be the big idea they were looking for, and the whole
team decided to work through the night. By morning, the site was ready to go. Noomii’s
Advent Calendar was a WordPress-based microsite that Noomii put up annually for the
Christmas season starting in 2011. Unlike most Advent calendars where you get some‐
Get onto Wikipedia 
| 
135

thing each day, Noomii’s Advent calendar instead prompted you to give something every
day. Users would put in their email address, and Noomii would send a daily idea for a
random act of kindness for users to do. Or you could simply go to the website to check.
The design was quite simple, just a basic WordPress homepage with icons for each day
of Advent. Users then click on the icon to view the post, that then tells them about the
day’s activity.
Figure 7-6. Noomii saw growth in equity-passing links and valuable social shares
with each passing year
For promotion, Noomii asked Stephan to engage a power user on social media to share
it. That power user got a lot of traction for Noomii for particular on StumbleUpon—
over 15,000 stumbles. And of course, Noomii mentioned it in their newsletter and social
channels; but, a lot of social spread happened organically because of its shareability.
136 
| 
Chapter 7: Guerrilla Marketing

Noomii encouraged the liking and sharing in the email by featuring a like and share
Facebook and Twitter widget at the bottom of the email, and partnered up with a few
“acts of kindness” groups on the Internet that shared it with their fanbase. Their first
year Advent calendar saw around 700 subscribers. The second year, the number of
subscribers was around 2,000, and in 2013, it was around 9,000. Noomii saw a large
increase in site views and subscriptions over these three years. Noomii has significant
reason to believe this content marketing initiative has a significant role in its SEO suc‐
cess. They moved the yearly Advent calendar to a stable, permanent URL now, instead
of a new URL each year, which will further help with SEO, since the previous years’ link
authority will pass to the current calendar.
Real-Life Q&A: I Love It When a Plan Comes Together
Q: I’ve made some advice animal memes related to my business. Should I post them to
reddit?
A: No. Everyone will know that they are marketing material, you’ll be downvoted and
ridiculed, and your reddit account may be banned for spamming. Don’t try to game
reddit in any way. If you want to post something there related to your business, make it
a news story on a reputable news media site. The possible exception is if you have a
genuinely funny or intriguing viral video. Think along the lines of “Will It Blend?” Are
your videos that interesting? If not, then don’t try to post them.
In general it’s a better strategy to get lots of fans, friends, and followers on social media,
and then post your video there and let other people submit it to reddit.
Q: Can’t I just make anonymous edits to my Wikipedia article? They can’t track me,
right?
A: Wikipedia logs IP addresses of users who are not logged in. If your new article or edit
traces back to an IP block associated with your company, you will be found out. It’s not
worth the risk.
Q: My company already has an article on Wikipedia. If I want to make changes, but I
don’t want to break Wikipedia’s Conflict of Interest rules, what other options do I have?
A: Post a note to the “Talk” page for your article explaining the situation: who you are,
what you need changed, and why (back up your facts with sources). Factual inaccuracies
are easily addressed this way. Other changes/additions may prove much harder. If you
aren’t getting any response/action after a month or two, post a note about your needs
on the Conflict of Interest notice board in Wikipedia.

Summary
Posting ordinary content and appealing to traditional demographics isn’t the only way
to reach people. When you start getting into creating and posting viral content, you’re
wandering into the realm of guerrilla marketing, whether you realize it or not. There’s
a lot of opportunity here, and it’s usually inexpensive, but there is also the potential to
cross the line and get yourself in trouble—with a customer, a competitor, a major service
provider, or even a national government.
So be careful. Research the boundaries before you push them. Successful marketing
always involves a certain level of unorthodox thinking and a high amount of creative
thinking. Just be careful that you don’t throw it all away in your pursuit of success.

CHAPTER 8
Professional Presence and Damage Control
This chapter is about reputation management—the art of looking good online. In the
pre–social media era, all you needed to do was worry about search engine results based
on a relatively small number of sites. Now, though, there are many social media sites
that offer upset customers or competitors the ability to post negative reviews or rants,
as Figure 8-1 points out.
Figure 8-1. A clever meme that illustrates the point of this chapter
So let’s be proactive. First, we’ll identify all of the user-controlled social networks that
play a major part in online reputation. Then we’ll explain how to enhance your strategy
139

to include responding to negative feedback in a positive way before it can drive people
away from your business.
Throughout this chapter, keep one fundamental principle in mind: reputation man‐
agement is not just about avoiding looking evil; it’s about being good and doing the right
thing always, not just when people are looking.
Finding Problems
If you’re starting from scratch, you’ve got to survey the virtual landscape and identify
your biggest reputation problems. You could run around to every site that you can think
of and search for names associated with your business, product, and brand, but that
would take a lot of time and you can’t necessarily guess which sites are going to have
the most damaging content.
Instead, use Soovle, illustrated in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2. Soovle can show you popular search queries from multiple sites on one
screen
We’ve mentioned this site in previous chapters as a keyword research tool, but it’s also
useful for finding negative content. Using Soovle for reputation management is a two-
step process: first you must try to identify any popular keywords that have a negative
slant by seeing whether those show up as keyword suggestions. Soovle is convenient as
a one-stop shop for checking Google Suggest, Yahoo Search Assist, YouTube Suggest,
and more. Second, look at what is ranking for those keywords as well as just your brand
keywords by themselves. You’ll want to displace the damaging results with good ones
—or at least innocuous ones.
140 
| 
Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

When you’re searching, you’re going to have to get creative with your queries. You can’t
just search for your brand name and sort through the pile of results. What sorts of
complaints have your customers called or emailed about? What would you say about
your brand if you were an upset customer? Think about those subjects, and the questions
and statements that they evoke, and use those as search terms. For instance, if your
brand were Acme and you sold anti-roadrunner products:
• Acme anvils suck
• Acme ripoff
• Acme scam
• Acme products don’t stop roadrunners
• Are Acme products worth it
• Do acme traps actually work
Put yourself in the angry customer’s shoes. Ask the questions that he would ask; make
the statements that he would make.
Perhaps you won’t find anything. If so, that’s good! But you’ll want to check back on a
regular basis—say, once every quarter—to make sure nothing new has come up.
Another recommendation is to set up ongoing monitoring for the terms readers use to
search for negative sentiment about your company. A simple option for this is to set
up Google Alerts with daily emails for those terms.
Case Study: Celebrity Damage Control
Few companies are willing to admit their failures; it was difficult to find a good case
study for this chapter. Instead of the usual story of zero-to-hero, we’ve decided to draw
attention to something you’ve probably already taken notice of: celebrity reputation
management.
Remember Pee-Wee Herman, lesser known as the actor Paul Reubens? Well, the Internet
does. His mugshot and an article on TheSmokingGun (which specializes in celebrity
arrests) are still in the Google top 10 results for arrests in 1991 and 2002 (see
Figure 8-3). These events were so long ago and there have been so many other potentially
newsworthy events since then that you’d figure it shouldn’t be a problem for Reubens
to force the old and embarrassing ones off of the first page—that is, if he were taking
his reputation management seriously.
Finding Problems 
| 
141

Figure 8-3. Miss Yvonne would not approve of Pee-Wee’s mugshot being in the #3
slot in Google
By contrast, search for Charlie Sheen (Figure 8-4). Not only was he named in one of the
most high-profile prostitution cases of all time, but he also famously had a public melt‐
down in 2011 when he was fired from his hit television show and made a series of bizarre
statements on talk shows and social media. For a while, it seemed that it couldn’t get
worse for Charlie Sheen in terms of reputation. Search for him today, though, and you’ll
see that he has a vast, well-curated social media presence, and in the Google search
results it’s nothing but good news, even from the celebrity gossip sites that attacked him
during his scandals. Again, enter online reputation management firms. It’s possible
(though, of course, not proved) that Charlie Sheen’s reputation was cleaned up by a
celebrity (or online) reputation management company. The basic theory behind much
of the cleanup is to put out lots of online good content to nullify the bad.

Quixtar was the ecommerce arm of Amway, a household goods multilevel marketing
(MLM) company. While Amway enjoys a decent web reputation despite being an MLM
(Figure 8-5), Quixtar was horrible (Figure 8-6). Eventually Quixtar was rebranded as
Amway Global, though the core business remains largely the same. Even today, some
time after Quixtar was reorganized into a more trusted brand, it still has a bad reputation
on the Web.

Separating Business from Personal
If you haven’t done so already, siphon off all of your business-related content to social
media accounts that are dedicated to your business. Don’t use your personal accounts
144 
| 
Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

to host business content, and don’t spam your friends with business stuff. Basically, use
social media like your customers use it—for friendly and useful interaction, not for
dictating a marketing message.
This is especially important on Facebook and Twitter. The only people who should be
your friends on your personal page are those you’d invite to your home for dinner.
Maintain an arm’s-length distance from everyone else.
Even if you don’t post crazy photos or political messages, it’s not a good idea to use even
the most benign personal social network accounts to market your products. You don’t
have control over who tags you in photos or videos, and your friends and family certainly
are not going to ensure that they are in line with your marketing strategy before they
post comments on content associated with you. Just the same, make sure your party
photos are private, and lock down your private account so that it doesn’t sabotage your
business effort.
Never let an employee of your company keep the company’s social media account logins
a secret. You must set up the accounts for your company yourself, with your email
address, and provide the login only to trusted employees. All employees should sign an
NDA (nondisclosure agreement) that prevents them from speaking for your company
publicly without express written permission. When an employee who has access to any
of your social media accounts leaves the company, change the password immediately
to ensure that she is not able to continue participating.
Or, you can consider an application like Hootsuite (the enterprise version) that allows
site owners to assign permissions to social media team members or contractors without
having to give away the official logins for the accounts. It also makes it easy to revoke
access to social media accounts quickly—should that become necessary.
Maintaining Consistency
Whenever possible, use the same username and account details across all of your social
media sites. If there is any inconsistency there, you’ll look suspicious. Also, the more
certain data is repeated, the more it is trusted in search engines.
At this point in history, most of the vanity URLs and usernames are taken. Hopefully
your brand name is unique enough to be available across all sites and top-level domains,
though. You can check quickly across dozens of social networks by using NameChk
(shown in Figure 8-7).
Maintaining Consistency 
| 
145

Figure 8-7. NameChk can help you search for potential user account names, which usu‐
ally are part of the URL on social networks
Being Deleted or Delisted
One of the worst things that can happen to your online business is to get blackballed
from search engines or social media sites. It’s not the end of the world, though; there is
hope if this happens to you.
Facebook
You can have a great Facebook page humming along, getting you all kinds of sales, and
then suddenly your page has been removed or your account has been disabled, and all
you’ve got as an explanation is a vague form letter.
There may not appear to be rhyme or reason to Facebook’s decision to suspend your
business account, but you must have been pushing into some gray areas, even if it may
have been inadvertent. Facebook changes its policies frequently, so something that was
146 
| 
Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

acceptable in the past may no longer be so. It’s important to keep up with Facebook’s
current Terms of Service. Generally you’ll get a warning that you’re not complying with
the Terms of Service. Then if you keep up with the bad behaviors, you’ll likely get your
account suspended.
There are two types of suspensions: you can get your ads account suspended, or your
entire Facebook user account. Probably you’ll get your ads account suspended. If that
happens, you’ll want to respond to Facebook with an explanation and request for rein‐
statement. The notice of suspension will include a link (“If you think you received this
in error…”) and from there you can fill out a form to get help and to contest Facebook’s
decision.
Google
Being blacklisted from search engines is even worse. Unlike Facebook, Google rarely
makes mistakes in this area. So if you’ve been banned from Google, the first thing you
need to do is clean up the dodgy black hat things you did (buying links is a popular
black-hat tactic that will get you penalized, for instance), document the whole cleanup
process, and go to Google with a mea culpa, detailing what you did wrong and what
you did to clean up the mess. You do this through a “reconsideration request” that you
file in Google Webmaster Tools. This is only for when you’ve been manually penalized.
If you have an algorithmic penalty, you still have to clean up the mess, then you have to
wait for an algorithmic update.
LinkedIn: Your Online Business Card
As mentioned earlier in this book, LinkedIn is a great place to show your job history
and make business connections. It’s also a great place to get a new job, or to find a new
employee.
When you’re managing your reputation online, it’s more important than ever to be
proactive. Your customers are talking about you. If you’re not part of that conversation,
you can’t help direct it.
While it’s impossible to control what people say about you, it’s a lot easier to get on the
front foot and be proactive about the kind of information you want people to find about
you.
You should, of course, complete your personal profile on LinkedIn, populating it with
a good professional photograph, accurate professional information, and contact details.
LinkedIn is an online résumé, with tons of extra benefits, so include your relevant past
positions, awards, honors, clubs, associations, and so on.
Aside from your personal profile, you should also register and complete a profile for
your company. This is a great way to ensure that all of the good stuff that people link to
LinkedIn: Your Online Business Card

or say about your company or brand gets mentioned in proper context. When you’re
working on that content, remember to use relevant keywords and key phrases in your
profile, and include plenty of links to your website, products, training programs, and
other social media pages.
To increase your credibility on LinkedIn, answer questions in relevant industry groups,
and in LinkedIn Answers. Be as helpful as possible. The more helpful your contributions
are, the more valuable and trusted you become in your industry. You can enhance this
effect by using SlideShare presentations to showcase your work, recent findings, and
market updates. Don’t overpromote, though. When you are helpful, people will actively
seek out your services. If you have more time to post and manage content, then look
into starting your own industry-, market-, or niche-themed group. As your company
profile user, post news stories about your products, and keep the feed active with pos‐
itive, relevant information. The spam threshold is a little lower on LinkedIn company
profiles; this is where people go to learn more about your company, so it’s perfectly
relevant to show them as much information as you want to share.
Review Sites: The Harsh World of Direct Feedback
Seemingly everyone has a blog. Consequently, there could be countless potential sources
for negative or inaccurate reviews. Oftentimes there is no easy way to contact the blogger
—or even find out who he is.
While negative content on personal blogs is important, it’s not the only thing to worry
about. With the rise of social media, you also need to monitor key social media sites
and respond quickly to anything negative that appears.
There are a few specialty social networks that focus solely on rating and reviewing busi‐
nesses and products. The major players are explained in the following subsections.
Yelp
Yelp is mostly useful for local businesses, and by default, it detects your geographic area
and limits search results to that region. If you are just starting out, or if you have no
Yelp reviews at all, it’s a good idea to establish a business presence on the site. Sign up,
put in all of the relevant information about your company, and encourage satisfied
customers to post reviews.
If you get a negative review, you can post a comment that explains the context. However,
it’s a better idea to try to contact that upset customer directly so that you can resolve the
issue privately. If it works out to her satisfaction, then it’s all right to ask her to amend
the review. If she refuses to change the review, then explain on Yelp how you tried to
help resolve the issue.
148 
| 
Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

You can also actively encourage your customers to go to Yelp and post positive reviews.
There is nothing unethical about this.
Glassdoor
Glassdoor is a site where employees and job interviewees rate and review companies. If
your company has poor ratings on Glassdoor, it’s going to be a major HR problem for
you; you will have a difficult time attracting top talent, especially if you are trying to
bring in people from other areas.
You can encourage current employees to write reviews on Glassdoor, if you feel that
they are happy working there and you have the sort of work environment where em‐
ployees can come to you with honest concerns.
If you have a high employee turnover rate, you can expect negative reviews on Glassdoor.
The site allows you to sign up for an account and respond to reviews and comments.
This might help you put certain reviews into the correct context for future employees.
Google (Search and Places)
The content that makes up good old-fashioned search engine result pages (SERPs) is
still an important concern. If you have a negative review showing in the first 10 results
on Google, it could cost you a lot of money. If the site it’s on is an independent blog, you
can try to contact the blogger to resolve the issue or sway his opinion. If it’s one of the
other sites mentioned in this section, then follow the guidance therein.
One thing you can do to push results off of the first page is to get positive or neutral
content to outrank the negative. If you’ve got a negative review in the seventh result slot
on Google, you will need to boost the ranking of four listings that are ranked below the
detractor to be ranked above the detractor, or you can create some new, SEO-friendly
content and promote it to try to get it to outrank the detractor. One way to do this is to
have public pages on as many high-traffic, high-authority social networks as you can,
all with good unique content. Link to them from your corporate site, your blog, all social
media sites you have a presence on, and all sites that you have control over to give them
some authority with Google.
You can monitor how many of the listings on page one in Google are positive or negative
(or not relevant to you) by using BrandYourself (Figure 8-8).
Review Sites: The Harsh World of Direct Feedback

149

Figure 8-8. BrandYourself helps you keep track of top Google search results
Google attempts to connect all of its services whenever possible, and Google MyBusiness
is an excellent example. It combines your Google+ profile, your Google Maps business
information, and your location on Google Maps. If you do a normal Google search for,
for instance, Costco, you’ll see "X Google Reviews” in the search result listings (where
X is the number of reviews). Click on that reviews link, and you’ll be able to read people’s
reviews of local Costco stores in your current geographic area. You’ll also see the map
with an address and directions, relevant photos, and contact information.
As with all of the other review sites in this section, keep an eye on these reviews and try
to contact anyone who writes a negative review so that you can try to address her con‐
cerns.
Wikipedia has a lot of influence on Google results. If you have a page on Wikipedia and
it is mostly positive (at least in its initial summary), it is practically guaranteed to be
near the top of the Google search results. If you do not have a Wikipedia page for your
company, and you want to push some negative results out of the top 10, establishing a
page with positive content is a great way to do that. However, you can’t create the page
yourself; neither can your employees. If you try, the Wikipedia editors will notice and
delete the page, and you’ll potentially have yet more negative content to deal with if
someone exposes your Wikipedia promotional efforts.
150 
| 
Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

If you’re serious about a Wikipedia page, you need to seed the field a little by giving the
editors something to use to establish encyclopedia notability. News stories are the best
and most effective way to do this. Try to do some interviews and send out good press
releases to potentially interested media outlets. News stories like these also have an
influence on the top search results all on their own.
Having social media accounts that are reasonably active and popular is also a great way
to push negative content out of the top 10 search results. Twitter, Facebook, and You‐
Tube, in particular, are highly trusted by Google, so if you have active, well-curated
accounts on these services, you have a good chance of occupying some of the top 10
results with links directly to your company’s social media pages.
If you’re plagued by negative search terms in Google Suggest (the suggested search terms
that Google drops down from the search bar while you are typing), you can try to push
them out by providing links to search queries that are more positive. But be warned:
This is a black hat tactic and you will run afoul of Google’s guidelines. If you spam the
world with Google search query links, Google will punish you. Some folks publish or
provide these links, via social media. Google Suggest results are based on search query
volume, so the more queries there are for positive terms, the less often the negative
terms will appear.
Restaurant.com
This is like a combination of Yelp and Groupon, except it’s specific to restaurants. You
can get a ton of new people in the door by participating here, but keep an eye on the
reviews and address any negative ones as they come in. If you’re on this site, you’ve
already got a business relationship with Restaurant.com, so you already have an account
and a line of communication with your customers.
Reviews should be easy to address on Restaurant.com because the site verifies that the
reviewers have actually eaten at your restaurant, so there is less of a chance of a false
review. It also connects a real person to the site account, so there is some accountability,
and it will be easier to contact the upset customer and find a way to make amends.
Ripoff Report
Hopefully you’ll never have to deal with Ripoff Report. It is a site dedicated entirely to
negative reviews, all of which are written by anonymous site visitors. Unfortunately—
for reasons unknown—Google gives it a high amount of trust and ranks its review pages
very highly. If you have a negative review on Ripoff Report, it’s almost certainly going
to be in the first page of search results.
There is no editorial oversight on Ripoff Report. Anyone can post anything. A com‐
petitor of yours can post a dozen scathing reviews of your business; those reviews will
be published and Ripoff Report will not remove them.
Review Sites: The Harsh World of Direct Feedback 
| 
151

For a large fee, Ripoff Report will offer to bring in an arbitrator to analyze the truth‐
fulness of each claim in the review. If any are found to be false, they are redacted from
the review text, though the rest of the review will stay published.
You can also go to court and sue to have the review removed, or sue the person who
posted it, if you can determine who it is.
It’s free to post a rebuttal to any review on Ripoff Report, and that may be all you need
to do. Even the Ripoff Report owners admit that it’s not the complaint that hurts you,
it’s how you show that you’ve attempted to resolve it.
Another influential site of this same nature is Pissed Consumer.
Angie’s List
This is one of the most powerful user-driven review sites on the Web. Like Yelp, it is
mostly useful for rating and reviewing local businesses such as trades, services, physical
stores, and restaurants. People trust it because it doesn’t accept advertising from anyone
—it is entirely monetized through subscriptions. That seems kind of backward in this
day and age, doesn’t it? Yet Angie’s List is alive and well, and maintains a reputation as
an unwavering source of customer honesty.
If you find yourself on the business end of a negative review on Angie’s List, there is a
documented complaint resolution process you can go through. According to site staff,
there are only three ways to remove a review posted to Angie’s List:
• The member who posted the feedback asks to have it removed.
• The complaint resolution process results in customer satisfaction.
• The review is shown to be fraudulently posted.
So if you get a negative review there, the only valid course of action is to address the
issue with the customer who wrote it. This is the best policy anyway. You really don’t
want to fight a PR war on the Internet.
If you take Angie’s List seriously and get good ratings there, the site will allow you to
post discounts for members. This can be a great promotion for loyal customers, and
can help bring new people in the door; they already know they can trust you, based on
your Angie’s List ratings.
Amazon
If you list your products on Amazon, and you get a negative review on your product
page, you can contact the reviewer through the site and attempt to resolve it. Once you’ve
done that, you can post your findings as a comment on the review, and click No next to
“Was this review helpful?” at the bottom of the review.
152 
| 
Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

If you’re dealing with negative ratings or reviews on your seller account, Amazon has a
more sophisticated process. If you are unable to resolve the issue with a buyer, you can
contact Amazon and dispute the factual validity of the review. Amazon will not remove
reviews unless they are posted under false pretenses, are for the wrong product or seller,
or contain provably untrue information.
Taking Advantage of a Competitor’s Blunder
Let’s say that you’ve taken this chapter’s lessons to heart and have an excellent online
reputation. You monitor, you manage, you accentuate the positive, you avoid scandals
and blunders—everything’s perfect. Then one day you notice that one of your compet‐
itors has said something that you immediately recognize as a serious blunder. What do
you do?
You take advantage of it. It sounds like a cutthroat Machiavellian maneuver (and it kind
of is), but there is a lot of opportunity here not just to help your competitor make himself
look bad, but to make your own company look better. You can do that by immediately
and publicly speaking out against your competitor’s gaffe.
There are plenty of examples of this to choose from. Examine any heated political cam‐
paign, for instance, and you’ll find an almost daily gaffe-and-rebuke game being played
between the politicians running for public office.
In the business world, consider the case of the Barilla Group, an Italian pasta manu‐
facturer. In September 2013, Barilla’s chairman said in a radio interview that his com‐
pany’s core values were in opposition to homosexuality. He further elaborated on his
position with relatively mild but still quite offensive remarks about gay people, gay
marriage, and adoption of children by gay families. In rapid reply, Barilla’s competi‐
tors Buitoni and Bertolli immediately began campaigns to embrace those offended by
the Barilla chairman’s antigay statements. At a time when politicians, celebrities, and
political groups were calling for a boycott of Barilla pasta, two other pasta manufacturers
were enabled to gain influence with their disenfranchised customers.
A similar situation unfolded in March 2011, when a video surfaced of Bob Parson, CEO
of web hosting company GoDaddy, kneeling with an illegally killed elephant, which he
claimed to have hunted and killed himself. Animal rights group PETA started a cam‐
paign urging customers to close their GoDaddy accounts. Additionally, Namecheap, a
web hosting competitor, ran a special offering to donate $1 to the nonprofit Save the
Elephants for every account opened with it after the Parson video went public. The
response was overwhelming; the end donation totaled around $20,400. This is another
instance of a company gaining an edge by both facilitating good press for itself and
pointing out competitors’ flaws.

Real-Life Q&A
Q: My ads are doing pretty well—or at least I thought they were. Over the past few days,
I’ve gotten some really nasty comments about the ads people are seeing on Facebook.
It’s embarrassing, and exactly the kind of thing I was afraid was going to happen. Do I
just delete them, or what?
A: First of all, let’s make one thing clear: this is not about you. People who post hateful
comments are usually angry at Facebook for interrupting their Facebook experience
with an ad. They don’t seem to understand that Facebook chooses where and how often
to display ads.
You can respond politely and explain how Facebook makes money. You can ignore or
delete the post. If you love inflaming the situation, and controversy is your thing, then
absolutely follow your instinct and argue with the haters. Personally, we don’t have time
or interest in this. However, it can be a useful tactic because the more comments you
have on the post, the better—Facebook will see your post as being very popular, and
relevant, and will show it more often.
Let’s assume that you want to be civil, though, because your question implies that. You
can mitigate the problem by choosing different options for your ads. When advertising
and promoting your content, select Current Fans Only instead of Friends of Fans. This
way, only the people who already know your product or company will be able to com‐
ment. Sometimes Facebook will automatically promote your content to Current Fans
and Friends of Fans. You have the option to delete the Friends of Fans ad units inside
your Ads Manager.
Q: I understand where you’re coming from regarding keeping my business and personal
accounts separate. I’m concerned, though, that I’m not going to look real enough to my
clients. It’ll just look like a corporate façade with no one behind it. Shouldn’t I do some‐
thing to show that this is me?
A: Having a corporate social media presence is about relevance, not about showing or
hiding things. Your clients don’t need to see photos of your dog, or whatever else is on
your personal Facebook page. They don’t need to know which politicians you voted for
—that’s an easy way to lose clients!—or which football team you support. Bring people
together instead of forcing them apart. Get people interested in your products, services,
or events, not your personal life.
Corporate doesn’t have to be boring. Show us your personality—your company culture
is a big part of who you are. Give customers insight into how things run at your HQ.
Show them the backstage pass type of experience: your office coffee machine getting a
good workout, a new delivery of iMacs, a photo of a new or long-term employee, an
introduction to Bob in the warehouse, and so on.

Chapter 8: Professional Presence and Damage Control

Q: Someone left me an anonymous negative review on a review site, and then deleted
his account. There is absolutely no way to contact him to resolve the issue, and the review
site won’t remove it. What are my options?
A: Virtually no review site will remove a negative review just because you asked it to. If
it did, who would trust its reviews? However, most sites that post user reviews will
correct, redact, or remove content that contains factual errors or lies. There may even
be a legal obligation to do this, in some jurisdictions. You can’t just point your finger
and call someone a liar, though; you must provide a good reason for the site to go back
to the reviewer to ask for more details. So dispute every fact in the review and ask for
proof of the claims. Ask to see a copy of the receipt, or provide a tracking report from
the shipping company that shows the product was delivered—ask for proof and provide
proof. Since the reviewer deleted his account, he probably cannot be contacted to vali‐
date his claims, and you may be able to have the review deleted on these grounds. Am‐
azon, for instance, has in the past removed negative reviews if the reviewer deletes his
account or fails to respond to inquiries from a seller.
Make sure you do this under the pretense of good customer service. You want to resolve
the issue with the customer, not just nuke every bad review you find. Even if your true
focus is removing that review, keep in mind that if you are successful and the customer
is still upset, he’ll just go somewhere else and post his review plus a follow-up that paints
you as a vindictive and predatory business. When it comes to online reviews, if you fight
fire with fire, everybody gets burned.
Summary
In Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Holly Golightly said that there are certain shades of limelight
that wreck a girl’s complexion. The same concept applies to online entrepreneurs. The
Internet never forgets, but it’s also obsessed with popularity and novelty. We hope that
you never have to fix an online reputation problem, but even the best people with the
noblest of intentions sometimes find themselves on the receiving end of an undeservedly
negative comment, review, or rating.
You can’t stop people from publishing things on the Internet. Sometimes you can get
service providers to remove or modify something, but ultimately you have no control
over what other people do. While we have given you many tactics in this chapter to
establish and maintain vigilance, we want to remind you that being aware of your rep‐
utation is only half of the equation. The other half is responding in a positive, peaceful,
and professional manner. A lot of people will excuse a negative review if they see that
you’ve personally and publicly attempted to address it. We all know that life isn’t perfect
and no commercial interaction is always going to work out as planned, but we want to
know that if something goes wrong, we as customers are not left out in the cold, and
you as the business owner are going to do something to show that our professional
relationship is more important than the details of a single sale.

CHAPTER 9
Keeping Up with Changes
How do you stay up to date in a field that changes every day? That’s the challenge of this
business, and it can easily be a full-time job. In fact, you might need to make it someone’s
full-time job now that you’ve seen the dollar value of social media. Or if you don’t have
the resources to hire someone, there are a few good reputable firms that you can out‐
source it to.
Even the authors of this book, whose fulltime jobs are keeping up with trends and finding
new ways to be successful in online marketing, don’t stay on the cutting edge. Why?
Because it isn’t always relevant. Much of what passes for “cutting edge” in social media
is hypothetical or a rumor, so while it is a good idea to stay informed of what may be
coming soon, it’s probably a bad idea to try to take advantage of it before it’s actually an
advantage.
Once you find something that works, don’t sit back and let it run in the background. It’s
dangerous to assume it’s going to continue delivering the same results. This may be
possible with appliances, some kinds of machinery, and computer software, but it
doesn’t typically apply to social media marketing. You’ve got to keep your eye on the
ball.
What that in mind, this chapter explains several ways to keep up with changes in the
social media landscape.
Hire the Experts
If you’re a marketer or business owner working solo, employing the aid of a social media
agency could be a great idea. In addition to taking over your initial efforts, a social media
agency can help you refine your process in the future.
There are a lot of so-called experts in this field. Unfortunately, there are no regulations
that restrict claims of professionalism to only those who are truly qualified, so it’s critical
157

to do a few key things before making a final decision about a social media marketing
firm or professional.
Ask the Hard Questions
Experience is the first thing to consider. Look for a specialist or company that’s been
operating for a while, one with a reputation for helping clients attain a satisfactory degree
of success. If they can’t provide examples that show the results they can deliver, then
find someone who can.
Take into consideration your type of business, and ask specifically how this expert can
help your company. If he can’t offer you a straightforward answer and you aren’t con‐
fident he can do the job right, don’t hire him.
Take a Look at the Agency’s Social Media Pages and Business Sites
The way a social media agency promotes its business can help demonstrate what it’ll be
able to do for you. Visit its site and take a good look around, and do the same with its
social media pages. If its social media links aren’t prominently displayed, then some‐
thing’s wrong.
You can’t fake many years of dedicated participation on social media, so take a look at
a potential vendor’s public social media history and see how far back it goes and how
it’s progressed over time. Pinterest can be assembled to look full, organized, and well
groomed in a matter of days. But a site with a time element like Twitter cannot be so
quickly built. These are the true tests of a company’s experience, commitment, and value.
There will, of course, be various differences in the methods each company will use to
promote different businesses, but you can determine the quality of what it will deliver
by its own presence in the social media world.
Determine What the Agency Is Planning for Your Business in the Long
Term
As already mentioned, social media marketing isn’t a system you can simply put on
autopilot and expect it to work indefinitely without maintenance. It’s an ongoing process
just like any other type of successful advertising. You need to collaborate with your
chosen social media agency in order to plan the best course of action for your business,
as well as how it will continue in the long term. When this is done correctly, your
company should be able to see measurable results in the form of a growing, loyal client
or customer base that stays up to date with your organization’s activities and progress.

Chapter 9: Keeping Up with Changes

Ask Trick Questions
By this point in the book, you know enough about social media to understand the major
dos and don’ts. So take some of the “don’ts” and make questions out of them:
• How much will it cost me to buy 10,000 Facebook fans?
• How can I set up my social media to work on autopilot—set and forget?
• How many fans do I need to start seeing sales?
• How long will it take me to get to x number of fans?
• We want to grow our fan base as quickly as possible. Can you help us?
There should never be concrete answers to any of these questions. The correct response
should instead be: “Why?” Why do you need more fans? The social media professional
you’re interviewing should ask you what the overall goal is. Do you want more cus‐
tomers, sales, website visitors, exposure, or something else?
Almost everyone who has read this book should reply: “Yes, we want more sales, visitors,
and exposure.” That being the case, the solution is not to “get more fans.” Rather, it is to
“get more of the right kind of fans.” Targeting is the key to conversion on Facebook. Fifty
thousand names on a Facebook page are useless to you if they never comment, click,
watch, listen, read, ask, or buy from you.
A reputable agency will work with you to identify your objectives first, then design a
campaign that will deliver qualified, targeted leads to your page.
Ask About Cost
Once you know more about what your goals are and how they can be accomplished,
start asking questions about cost, but be prepared for a little bit of sticker shock here.
A reputable social media marketing company should cost anywhere between $1,000
and $5,000 per month, depending on what services it is providing and what your stated
goals are.
It can be difficult to calculate the total cost of service, and some vendors may be reluctant
to give you a realistic figure up front. It may be useful for you to set a reasonable budget
that you can spend each month, and use that as a retainer. Ask what that retainer will
get you on a monthly basis.
Keep in mind that a good social media marketer cannot make amazing guarantees,
especially for a fixed cost. If someone offers you a certain number of followers or fans
for a set price, she’s almost certainly going to use bots and other unethical, unsustainable
means to reach that number as cheaply as possible.

Follow the Thought Leaders
The best way to find out what’s new in the industry is to pay attention to the people
whose job or hobby it is to follow the latest rumors and development initiatives. Let’s
start with the authors of this book:
• Stephan Spencer, Science of SEO blog
• Jimmy Harding
• Jennifer Sheahan
Here are some other reasonably well-established people who are worth listening to:
• Gary Vaynerchuk
• Neil Patel, Quicksprout blog
• Charlene Li
• Chris Brogan
• Mari Smith
• Amy Porterfield
• Marty Weintraub
• Heidi Cohen
• Jeff Bullas
• Taki Moore
• Stephen Renton
• Rob Woods
• Jeremy Schoemaker
• James Schramko
Follow Industry Blogs
The aforementioned experts usually contribute to a large number of social media sites
and blogs. Beyond these few, there are many more industry professionals worth reading.
You’ll probably find them on one of these blogs: 
• Mashable
• readwrite
• GetElastic
• copyblogger

• CopyPressed
• social triggers
• Duct Tape Marketing
• Socialmouths

• ViralBlog
• TheSalesLion
• pushingsocial
• Marketing Tech Blog
• likeable media blog
• wayvs
• AllFacebook
• Marketing Land
We have a longer list of resources available from the book’s website.
Attend Relevant Conferences
What do the authors of this book and all of the people covered in the previous list have
in common? They attend industry conferences and conventions like these:
• Content Marketing World
• South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive
• New Media Expo
• SMX Social Media
• BlogHer
• Social Media Marketing World
• Social Media Week
• Social Media World Forum
• Inbound Marketing Summit
• BlogWell
Attend Relevant Conferences 
| 
161

• Social Fresh Conference
• Northern Voice
• Wordcamp
eCommerce conferences also sometimes have bootcamps or tracks dedicated to social
media. Here are some of our favorites:
• Shop.org Annual Summit
• IRCE Focus
• eTail West
• NRF Annual Convention & Expo
• Online Retailer (Australia)
• eCommerce Expo (Australia)
Conferences and conventions are exciting places filled with ideas, discussions, and a
whole lot of people just like you. Some of them are expensive, though. Whether they’re
worth it or not depends on how far away they are (travel expenses and time), and the
number of people who will attend. Sometimes you can spend $10,000 on a conference
and have it pay off in multiples from the resulting sales or deals. Aside from that, you
can’t assign a monetary value to the knowledge and industry contacts you’ll gain by
attending one of these shows. Hopefully you’ll also have a good time!
If you have a bit more money to spend, and find a convention that is applicable to your
industry, you can advertise there by buying a booth or a sponsorship.
Before you go, update your business cards to include your social media info, then print
up a lot of them. If you’re setting up a booth, you’ll need to provide some kind of takeaway
material or promotional item for attendees as well. That’s a topic for another book,
though.
Join Professional Associations
Another good way to stay up to date is to join professional associations or groups that
deal with social media, ecommerce, and online marketing, such as the Word of Mouth
Marketing Association (WOMMA), Social Media Club, or Shop.org.
It might help to join associations that are related to your business as well if they address
online marketing or social media.

Chapter 9: Keeping Up with Changes

Don’t React; Respond
There is a balance to staying current with social media: don’t let the flavor of the day
determine your social media strategy, but do stay in touch with the possible future of
the industry. The key idea here is not to fall in love with an emerging trend. Don’t acquire
shiny object syndrome and try to stay ahead of the game by investing in every upcoming
fad. Perhaps if you have a large marketing budget and a strong corporate tradition of
taking risks, this might be an interesting strategy to adopt, but if that doesn’t describe
you, then avoid the hype, and stick to what’s working and what fits into your system.
We advise our clients to wait about six months for a new site, technology, or idea to
become mainstream. By all means, stay aware of the hype, speculation, and hypothesis
of what may or may not happen. Observe it, let it catch on a little (or die quickly), and
then test it and see if it can make money for you. If something new is making huge waves
in the social media world, it may be worth experimenting with right away, but err on
the side of caution—or rather, profitability.
At some point, situations that require your time and money become zero-sum. Don’t
try to be everywhere at the same time. Don’t spread your efforts over many social media
platforms unless you have the staff to give each one the proper attention. It’s like in‐
vestments; don’t spend $5 across 10 mutual funds, put it all into 1 or 2 that you’ve
researched.
It isn’t all about money. Social media sites always start out free so that they can gain
widespread adoption. The business model part comes later when there are tens of mil‐
lions of active participants. You don’t want junk followers, and in order to get anywhere
on a new social network, you have to actively solicit connections. If the site does end
up becoming popular, you’ll have to do a lot of work to clean up your friends list. Don’t
waste your time; be slow, steady, and wise.
Remarket and Retarget
Sometimes your results can change without warning, and for no apparent reason. Social
media sites don’t always announce the changes that end up affecting you. For instance,
if you’ve found the CPC sweet spot for a certain Facebook ad or campaign, and then
your results suddenly take a nosedive, it may be because a wealthy competitor gobbled
up all of the top ad spots. This works two ways; CPC can go up or down depending on
the market. You could end up overpaying for your ads in the absence of previously
strong competition.
If you get priced out of your market on a high-traffic social media site, then retarget the
ad for a lower-priced audience—you’ll still have plenty of clicks.
Don’t React; Respond

Maybe you didn’t get priced out. Maybe people got bored with your ad. Think about
how you feel when you’ve seen the same television commercial or heard the same radio
ad a dozen times.
If you’re at the top end of the bid, you may just end up paying more per click without
any results.
Case Study: Always Evolving
Sharon Pearson is a dynamic leader at The Coaching Institute (TCI) in Australia, where
she’s at the forefront of all things social media. We work with her team to promote their
regular coaching seminars, in-person training events, and online workshops. By using
a variety of engaging images, eye-catching headlines, and strong calls to action, we’ve
been able to make Facebook a key traffic generator and high source of conversions for
TCI. Here’s how it happened: In late 2010, an Australia-based training academy that
runs accredited, in-person and online coaching courses identified the need to stay ahead
of the crowd, and continue to find new customers for their training programs. They
noticed their Google AdWords traffic had maxed out, and they were targeting all of their
main keywords with an active SEO campaign.
In order to grow their business, they needed a steady flow of new customers entering
their sales funnel. To find those new customers, they’d have to find a fresh lead source.
Could Facebook be the answer?
They decided to start with a personalized Facebook page, filling it with related content
to encourage their current customers, clients, and students to interact with them on the
social network. This was a success with over 1,000 of their existing customers “Liking”
the page in the first few weeks.
The next step was to design a Facebook ad campaign. They took advantage of Facebook’s
targeting features and targeted potential students by age, gender, and location. For this
company, being able to target their ideal students using keywords in the Likes & Interests
section of Facebook was particularly effective.
They conducted a survey of their existing students and discovered a large number of
them have worked as teachers or nurses. Using this information, they were able to iden‐
tify keywords that are related to things their students enjoy, and careers they have chosen.
With that in hand, the company was able to reach their ideal target audience at a fraction
of the cost of Google AdWords.
The campaigns have been running for several years now and require constant review.
Keeping on top of the changes inside Facebook and remaining relevant to their target
audience is essential to maintaining the effectiveness of each campaign. This means new
images, new headlines, and ad copy changes on a regular basis.
Because of their commitment to keeping up with changes, the results have been fantastic.
The company director told us: “These ads have more than paid for themselves. They’ve
164 
| 
Chapter 9: Keeping Up with Changes

helped us reach new customers that we could never have reached any other way.” They’ve
acquired students from all over Australia using Facebook Ads, and continue to have
success by continually refining and adjusting their process.
Real-Life Q&A: Change You Can Believe In
Q: Everything was going fine; I had some good ads in a successful Facebook campaign,
and then suddenly I hit a wall. Clicks dropped, I stopped getting impressions, and now
sales have dropped. What could be the problem?
A: This is one of the most common questions we hear, and it’s a lot like asking, “How
long is a piece of string?” A lot of things could be the problem. Maybe you got priced
out of your market all of a sudden, or maybe your audience is tired of your ad, or perhaps
your CTR was too low so Facebook decided to stop showing your ad. Maybe your ads
had a red border that made them stand out, right up until everyone else saw your success
and copied you. Maybe your target audience has seen your ads so many times that it
just ignores them.
Who knows? Whatever the reason, you need to start over. The good news is, it’s much
easier now because you know that the results are possible, and you know that you have
achieved them in the past. You’ll want to show all new ads to all new people to bring life
back into your advertising.
Begin a new campaign. Create brand-new ads with new images and headlines. Go back
to your initial market research and see what likes/interests you might be able to target
with your new campaign.
It’s important to make sure that all of your pages and links actually work. Sometimes a
server goes down or a redirect fails. Sometimes Facebook changes its code or policies
and things stop working. So, you’ll want to check that you are advertising according to
its current Terms of Service.
Next, check your campaign bidding strategy and make sure you’re not priced far above
or below the suggested bid. If you’ve been outbid to the point where your ads are not
relevant, then you can try to wait it out and see if the higher-priced competitors go away
after a few days. But if not, try increasing your maximum bid until you begin seeing a
steady flow of impressions.
Q: All right, so I’m going to one of the conferences you mentioned. I’m guessing I don’t
just show up and soak in new knowledge. What do I do at these things?
A: Prepare before attending a conference. Know exactly what your outcomes are going
to be, so when it’s over, you can know that it was worthwhile. Identify your key objectives
before you attend the conference. Are you going in order to learn something in partic‐
ular, meet key players in your market, find new customers for your business, or just to
have a good time?
Remarket and Retarget

For a lot of people, a conference is a huge investment. You’re taking time away from
your business and family. You’re forking over huge sums of cash for the event, hotel,
food, drinks, flights, transportation, and more.
Most conferences are composed of a show floor with vendor booths, and various con‐
ference rooms where talks, keynote speeches, and presentations are given. The booths
and hallways outside the conference rooms are great opportunities for networking.
That’s where you see what is new in your market, discover what your competitors are
doing, and interact with potential clients and vendors. Some conventions are so large
that you can’t expect to cover the whole convention floor in a single day.
Each convention day starts off with a keynote speech, and then every available room is
filled with speakers and presenters. You also can’t expect to attend every presentation.
It’s important to choose the sessions that will help you reach your objectives. You’ll just
have to get a schedule and figure out which talks are going to be most valuable to you.
Then, arrive early, have your notepad/iPad ready to go, and take great notes along the
way. Stick around after the presentation, and you might be able to get some time with
the speaker and get more in-depth or personalized information.
Some conferences offer paid seminars that are much more in depth. The authors of this
book regularly teach seminars like this. Depending on the content, the size of the venue,
and the expected audience, seminars can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to
more than $10,000 per person. Usually you can expect A-list material delivered by the
industry’s foremost experts, but research the speaker before writing a check.
Q: I’ve found a good social media marketing company, but it’s expensive. I’ve got to
make a business case for this. What do I say?
A: Well, what’s your time worth? How much do you make an hour, when you break
down your salary and work hours? Is that time best spent on social media marketing,
or on other things? This isn’t meant to be a rhetorical question; perhaps it really isn’t
worth the money. Some firms prefer to have fewer, higher-profit clients so that they can
spend more personal time and deliver better service. That’s not a bad thing, but it might
interfere with your budget and marketing goals. If you can hire a skilled social media
person for less than half your hourly rate, you probably should.
If you’re the CMO, then you should be able to make the case to the CEO that it’s worth
it to outsource this work. If you’re the webmaster, IT manager, or UI developer, it may
not be possible to make the financial case right now, but you may want to make a more
practical case that your job involves mission-critical systems that need proper mainte‐
nance and attention that you can’t focus on while you’re messing with Twitter posts.
Summary
One of Stephen Covey’s most famous and valuable tenets is a quote from noted British
economic historian Arnold Toynbee: “Nothing fails like success.” Indeed, a successful

outcome is often misleading in terms of what is required to maintain it at that level.
Very frequently, the same process will not lead to the same result without at least some
adjustments to the details.
Once you’ve read this book and put our advice into action, the journey isn’t over. Social
media is constantly changing the rules and enhancing services and features, and social
networks are rising and falling like the unstable markets of an emerging economy. As
we wrote this book, Facebook and Twitter were the slowly fading kings, and Google+
and LinkedIn were expanding aggressively. But if we’d written it just a few years ago,
we’d have been talking about MySpace, Friendster, and Second Life; we’d be poking fun
at the decline of the once-mighty America Online. Believe it or not, a lot of companies
put a huge amount of money into advertising on some of those networks, and at the
height of their popularity, they probably got a decent return for their investment.
Ironically, those sites and services failed for the same reasons that successful online
marketing plans fail: they were unable or unwilling to adapt to an Internet culture that
changes in slow but powerful swells. Like a declining suburb in the American Rust Belt,
the exodus from one social network to another starts with one friend. Then it spreads
to a family, then one digital neighborhood, and then third-party companies stop up‐
dating apps, and there are huge layoffs, the founding CEO is sacked, and the trendy San
Francisco home office is vacated for more affordable rental space in an unhip town with
no corporate taxes.
In the Hemingway novel The Sun Also Rises, Bill Gorton asks Mike Campbell how he
went bankrupt, and Mike replies: “Two ways. Gradually and then suddenly.” That’s also
how a successful social media marketing campaign fails. Hopefully we’ve convinced you
to keep the “gradually” part from ever happening, thus preventing the sudden collapse
at the end.

CHAPTER 10
Book Promotion
These days, a book can be a physical or digital good—or both. While many of the same
rules from both of these ecommerce categories apply to selling books, there is enough
book- and author-specific information that the subject warrants its own chapter.
Traditional book promotion tactics still apply in the modern era, for the most part. We
are social media experts, though, so we’ll go into detail only on the aspects that apply
to that medium. We’ll cover how to get your book out there into the big, wide world
without spamming everyone and ruining your chances of promoting anything to your
friends, family, or followers ever again.
Fiction Versus Nonfiction
Most of the advice you can find on the Web about book promotion has to do with
nonfiction books. Compared to fiction, nonfiction is enormously easier to promote,
since it deals with a specific subject. All you need to do is get the attention of people
who are interested in that subject. The demography and geography are not difficult to
figure out, if you don’t know them beforehand.
Fiction is very difficult to promote because it typically appeals to a wide audience, and
there are a lot of fiction authors competing for the attention of a few influential fiction
reviewers. You may need to narrow down your audience to a single demographic that
appears to be easy to target. This is difficult to do. Even traditional publishers fail to
promote good fiction books most of the time.
People also seem more skeptical of self-published fiction than nonfiction, so there is a
bigger initial barrier to overcome. Unless you have a massive marketing budget (more
than $20,000), the quality of your writing and/or the appeal of your subject matter has
to be good enough to drive sales with social media alone.
169

Pricing is also different between fiction and nonfiction. A 99-cent ebook novel is prob‐
ably going to sell exponentially better than if it were priced at $3.99 because many fiction
readers consume a lot of novels and can’t afford to keep their hobby going for $3.99 per
book. There are also promotional services that only advertise 99-cent ebooks—nothing
more expensive. That price point is a huge portion of the fiction market. Nonfiction,
on the other hand, is by definition a kind of reference and an educational tool, so it has
more long-term value and serves a purpose other than pure entertainment, meaning
you can typically charge more. Don’t base your pricing on famous novelists or celebrity
biographies in hardcover format; these are unrealistic for you. Instead, look at other
authors who are in your genre or related genres and price your book competitively.
Never assume that you are competing purely on quality of content.
One genre that rarely sells well is autobiographies and memoirs. Autobiographies and
memoirs are often fun and therapeutic to write, but publishing them and attempting to
promote them for profit is probably going to be a waste of time and money. Unless
you’re already famous, or you have a truly extraordinary tale to tell (e.g., you’re the sole
survivor of a major disaster; you were Richard Nixon’s private secretary; you’re the
former CEO of IBM; you are the child of famous parents; you worked on the Apollo
program at NASA), a stranger isn’t going to be compelled to buy your book.
Sometimes you can openly promote nonfiction books. For instance, if you’re selling a
book on desert gardening, you can more or less be open about the book’s content and
offer snippets from it, provide related tips, and post links to related subjects. There’s a
ton of inherently shareable, interesting social media content there.
Fiction, on the other hand, can’t usually be openly promoted without some backlash
and a lot of failure. People don’t seem to respond well to “buy my cool story” posts, even
if you have a really good pitch. Instead, talk about the themes indirectly. For instance,
let’s return to a scenario from Chapter 4 and say the movie The Matrix never existed,
and you just wrote it as a science fiction novel. Put up a web page that shows the synopsis,
the first chapter, any art that is associated with it, and links to all of the major sites that
sell it (e.g., Amazon, bn.com, or Kobo). Create a Facebook page for the book and a
Twitter account for you as an author, and link out to your book page prominently there.
Get some good Facebook ads going on a budget of $10–$20 per day to gain more page
likes. You might also put some money into promoting your Twitter page and some of
your tweets. Every day on your Facebook page you would offer a paragraph or so on
the nature of reality, Turing test theories, artificial intelligence, Buddhist philosophy as
it relates to the plot, computer hacking, the semantics of hacker handles, Kung Fu ar‐
ticles, news stories that deal with any of these subjects, and so on. On Twitter, you would
post questions to your followers about these same subjects. You’d follow actors from
science fiction shows and engage with them. You’d try to find people who talk a lot about
science fiction and have a lot of followers, and try to get them to notice you (refer to
Chapter 13 for more information on that).

Chapter 10: Book Promotion

Know Your Audience Really, Really Well
You probably did some of this research up front before you wrote your book, but social
media marketing requires more specific details and data. Who exactly is it that is going
to buy your book? Who are the people who currently love your book? Who reads books
that are similar to yours? Find out exactly who they are. Are they men? Are they women?
Are they in the U.S.? Are they worldwide? Do they speak English? Do they speak other
languages? Are they young or old? What other things do they like to do? Are they
married or single? Do they like outdoor activities or watching TV? What kind of doc‐
umentaries do they like? These are the kinds of things that you need to know. Grab a
piece of paper and start writing down everything that you know about your target au‐
dience.
Write down everything you can about the vast majority of your readers. If you don’t
know anything about your readers at all (which may be the case for most fiction books),
it might pay to do some surveys or research. Or, you can ask your audience directly.
Simply ask on your website (as a pop-up), on your blog, and within your social media
streams, “What’s your biggest question about x?” where x is the topic or niche that you
occupy. A tool that can help you is the Ask database. A dialogue gets started, and your
credibility is established as an expert for answering the tough stuff.
Look to your blog comments for answers. Who are the people who comment the most?
Who are the people who reply on Twitter? Have a look at those people, and then start
looking for more people like them. You want to take some time to create great posts and
content. Plan out what you’re going to post and which days you are going to post it.
Search for relevant Facebook pages and Twitter profiles. You can also look up websites
and blogs that are related to your market, your topic, the genre, and the kind of author
you are.
You can also search for relevant blogs and podcasts on these web research sites: 
• Quantcast
• Alexa
• Compete
The data from these sites will give you a demographic profile of the sites you’re con‐
sidering. For example, if you went to Oprah.com, you would see the demographic profile
of all of Oprah’s audience. You can do that for relevant topics.
Also look for other books in your genre on social media. Are they on the four big
networks? If you can find pages and sites for the most popular books in your genre,
then you can see what’s working. That’s where successful authors are putting the most
effort.
Know Your Audience Really, Really Well 
| 
171

You can also search forums. Forums for all sorts of topics are all over the Internet. There
are author-based forums (such as WritersNet), book-lover forums—forums for every‐
thing. If you are writing a history book, there are history buff forums. So find some
forums and join them, then become an active member. Don’t go in there just to spam
your stuff. Go in and participate; be a part of the community. Read and look at the
questions that people are asking. Can you answer them? If you can, that gives you a
bunch of great stuff to use and publish on your social media sites.
Take a look at the people who are posting reviews for books in your genre on Amazon.
Look at who is commenting on those reviews, and what they are saying.
Search for your topic or authors in your genre on YouTube, and click on the Statistics
button next to the view counter (it’s the little graphic of the bar chart). If public stats are
enabled, you can see who is watching those videos.
Plan Accordingly
In the lead-up to your book launch, you’re going to be stressed. You’re going to be
pressured. You’re going to forget things. You’re going to sit down at your computer to
write some tweets or blog posts, and blast it all out like verbal diarrhea. That is the worst
thing you can do. Instead, plan your posts so that they strategically leak tiny bits of
information along the way. That’s what builds this demand for your book and your posts.
Your audience will want to hear what you have to say when you create great posts and
content. That comes from planning.
Also remember that you’re building a long-term audience. This is going to give you the
biggest payoff. A long-term audience for an author is priceless because when you have
people who like your stuff—if you’ve already written one great book—then they want
to follow it. They want to see what you’re going to do next. When your next book comes
out, they are ready and eager to buy it.
You never know; a good blog can even become a book! Many writers have taken this
route over the past decade, such as the authors of I Can Has Cheezburger? A LOLcat
Collekshun (Gotham), Barack Obama Is Your New Bicycle: 366 Ways He Really Cares
(Gotham), and Stuff White People Like: The Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of
Millions (Random House).
Don’t feel pressured into reacting out of anxiety. Don’t say, “Oh my God. My book is
going to launch in a week. What do I do now?” If that is the case, there are a lot of
strategies in this chapter that will still work in that timeframe and beyond.
Certainly, it is better to have more time. If you are planning to launch your book in the
next 6 to 12 months, there are a lot of things that you can do now to make sure that your
payoff is huge.

Chapter 10: Book Promotion

The Big Players
We’ve said more than once in this book “quality over quantity” when it comes to social
media. To execute on that, you have to narrow down your social networks to those that
are most effective for book promotion. The top four big-name sites for authors are:
• Twitter
• Facebook
• Pinterest
• YouTube
Of course, if you like a social media site that isn’t listed here, then feel free to use that.
The core strategies for the sites we talk about in this chapter should be just as relevant
to other social networks.
No matter which social media sites you’re on, you should customize them to the fullest
extent possible. You can include contact information or book selling information in the
design, either as part of the background graphic, or as text somewhere else on the page.
Use your book cover, interior art, your author photo, and a theme or font that is relevant
to the book. For example:
• https://www.facebook.com/artofseo
• http://www.twitter.com/sspencer
Twitter
For some reason, Twitter seems like a great medium for spam, but mindless self-
promotion never works there or anywhere else. Also, make sure that you don’t log into
Twitter only when you want to tweet things about yourself, your book, or your book
launch. Go to Twitter with the idea of sitting back and listening. Watch and read what
others are posting.
Search for other authors and readers based on interest, keywords, topics, and names.
Find and follow people who have interesting things to say on your topic, about being
an author or about being a book lover. You might want to follow up to a few hundred
people per day, depending on your topic. You can follow people automatically based on
keywords and interests. By doing this, you will add a variety of cool people to your
stream who you may not have found otherwise. You will be able to hear their conver‐
sations and see what they’re tweeting about. You’re going to get involved.
Begin by reading and following; sit back and just get the feel of Twitter. When you start
posting, mix up your tweets so not everything is promotional. Endeavor to add value
The Big Players 
|

in every tweet. If you’re at a loss for words, then describe something positive that’s going
on around you or in the world.
Include an auto-tweet option in the free chapter or PDF version of your book. When
readers click that button, a tweet is created that might say something like: “I’m reading
Social eCommerce by @sspencer et al. Get the 1st chapter free here:” and include a link.
You can also post pictures. Personal pictures are fantastic on Twitter.
Retweet the tweets of other relevant, ideal people in your market. Follow the market
leaders in your genre; retweet their stuff, comment on it, and reply to it. When people
tweet at (@) you, reply to them.
It’s so powerful when people interact with one another on Twitter. That’s the way to use
Twitter successfully, not just pumping out your links one after another. Get involved in
a conversation. Share other authors’ books freely. This is such good karma. If another
author is trying to promote her book and you like it (if you’ve read it), and it’s related
to yours or interesting to you, then share it. Retweet it and get it out to your followers,
too. That author will be glad that you’re helping her. You can comment to her and tell
her how much you enjoyed her book. You want to engage with your audience. Reply,
comment, and retweet often—that’s the whole idea behind Twitter.
Use hashtags to your advantage. If you have free book promotion days through your
publisher or Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), you can tweet things like #BookGiveaway,
#freeKindleBook, or #free to help get it out there so that new people will find it.
There are a lot of people who love free Kindle books; they will jump on every oppor‐
tunity. Make sure that you include a clickable link for them to download your book, and
ask them to leave a review. You can also communicate with and follow Kindle addresses
such as Digital Book Today and Kindle Ebooks; search for other relevant Twitter ac‐
counts on your own, and engage and reply.
Free ebooks and giveaways are great for publicity, but your publisher may not want to
participate, or even allow you to do this (via digital restrictions on ebook files). However,
publishers usually allow authors to give away a free sample chapter, either as a standalone
item or as something that can be published as an article on another site. O’Reilly Media
has discount days for many of its authors, where books on certain topics or subjects are
discounted. O’Reilly also hosts webinars taught by its authors and discounts are offered
on that author’s book during the webinar. No matter what’s available to you in terms of
sample or promotional content, you can and absolutely should link it from Twitter.
Facebook
First, activate subscriptions on your personal profile. This allows other people to follow
you without being a personal friend of yours. When you post something that is public,
they will see it in their News Feed. However, consider what you’re posting on your
174 
| 
Chapter 10: Book Promotion

personal profile. Understand that it’s going out to fans and other followers who may not
know you personally. If you publish any personally identifiable information, people can
find you using that. Be careful and thoughtful about what you post on Facebook. In fact,
it’s best to have a professional public profile that represents you as an author, and a
private personal page.
Regardless of your situation with your personal Facebook page, you should create an
author and/or book page to help optimize for search. Author pages should be titled with
your book-credited name and perhaps “author” as well, such as “Author Stephan Spenc‐
er.” People can easily find that when they search for authors on Facebook. That page can
be all about your book-related stuff.
Some authors like to have a book page just for the title of their book, especially if they’re
creating a book series. This is a fantastic way to generate interest when people are
searching in Google or Facebook for your book title. Check out the Facebook page for
The Art of SEO as an example.
Facebook landing pages are really effective. To take full advantage of them, create custom
tabs and images for each book on your author page; this makes it much more interactive.
When people click on that thumbnail image, they are taken directly to a page where
they can read reviews, see your pitch, or go straight to your Amazon listing.
Create a basic content plan. If you have trouble following it, then schedule future posts
for your profile and Facebook pages. By posting automatically, you don’t have to re‐
member to do it every day.
You definitely want to include some teaser photos of your work in progress. These are
very popular. You can post a photo of your desk, your coffee mug, or the view outside
your window when you’re writing. Where is your computer? What is your inspiration?
What is it that drives you? What are you working on today? Some authors will post
pictures of their notebook or notes that they’ve written. They post pictures of things
outside that have given them inspiration for their work. All of that is really important
and should definitely be included in your Facebook updates.
You can also thank reviewers publicly each week and provide a link to the review on
Amazon. So if Lucy posts a lovely review on your Amazon page, you can say, “I received
this lovely review from Lucy in Oxford. Thanks so much, Lucy.” Tag her in the post, and
link to her Amazon review so that people can click and buy or download your book for
free.
As with Twitter, you must avoid spammy self-promotion. Become a fan of other authors
and contribute to their pages. Like their photos, videos, and comments. Comment as
your author page. Now that you’ve created your own Facebook author page, you can
comment as “Stephan Spencer, Author” on these other pages as long as your comment
is not spammy or asking people to like your page. Your comment should add value to
The Big Players

the post or photo. If you have free download days, share them and don’t forget to ask
for reviews.
Include a reason why people should click your link and download your book right now.
Don’t just say, “Here is my book,” with the link. That’s not going to get anyone inspired
to action. You can add a quote from the book. You can add a question or topic from the
book. It should be something that piques readers’ interest or asks them a question. Then
you can say, “Today is our free download day” or “Don’t forget that tomorrow is our
free download day.” Bookbub is a popular site that notifies users of limited-time free
book deals, and could be worth looking into.
Make a video trailer for your book. That’s a really powerful way to help spread the
message. A video trailer can help generate a lot of traffic if you publish it directly to
Facebook. If you publish on YouTube, that’s fine, too; there’s more information about
that in the next section.
Spend some money to promote this post and extend your reach, particularly if you have
free downloads to announce. You can also create specific Facebook ads to announce a
free download day. You can say, “For today only: a free ebook download. Click here to
go to Amazon for the free download.”
Inside your Ads Manager, you can make a page post engagement ad, target your ideal
audience, and promote your post directly from your ads account. Now instead of just
a percentage of your fans seeing it, you can extend the reach to include friends of fans,
for example. Use smart targeting to find people interested in your topic or style of
writing. Consider targeting pages of popular authors as well.
You can also use page post engagement ads to promote your author or book page. It’s
an effective way to build your fan base over time. Spending as little as $10 per day is
enough to grow a steady, targeted fan base when you are a new author.
Facebook photo contests are a great way to promote your book after it’s available. Ask
readers to take creative photos and upload them to the contest app. Fans can then vote
on their favorite photo to win a prize. However, be sure you use an approved Facebook
app to run a contest on your page.
There are tons of pages of interest on Facebook that you can try to leverage. Search for
them based on your topics and keywords. For instance, there is Amazon Kindle, Authors
on the Cheap, Free Ebook Deal, Free Kindle Books, iAuthor, Kindle Korner, Kindle Tips
and Tricks, and Reading Kindle, to name a few of the more popular ones. They are cool,
interactive, vibrant pages that you can get involved in. Like them, get involved, and
comment.

YouTube
Begin by searching YouTube for other authors and book trailers. Then make a video (or
several) that works along the same lines, create a YouTube account in your name (as the
author), and upload them.
There are lots of things you can make a video about (these topics apply generically to
Pinterest as well): the topic of your book, your inspiration, your writing process, what
you like to do in terms of writing, progress updates, book delivery, finding it in the store,
book signings, people buying the book, cases of books, the book on a bookshelf, cus‐
tomers holding the book, or alternative book cover designs. You can explain some lit‐
erary aspect of the book, or read an excerpt aloud with some related art—the cover,
internal graphics, or promotional art. If you’re looking for some high-end author video
inspiration, check out these videos: 
• My Formerly Hot Life
• Kamikaze
When you post your video, make sure you put a link to your site, landing page, or
Amazon URL so that people can just click and buy your book directly from the video’s
About tab.
Whatever you create on YouTube, share it on your blog by embedding the YouTube
code. You can also upload the same videos directly to Facebook for extended reach, but
don’t embed the YouTube code in Facebook; if you do, it will just come up with a tiny
picture that can’t be expanded.
YouTube isn’t the most powerful way for authors to reach potential readers, but it def‐
initely helps get to people who may not have known about you from your blog, Face‐
book, Twitter, or Pinterest accounts. Facebook is very personal; Twitter is like a news‐
feed; Pinterest is more visual; and YouTube is visual and audio. Hitting all four gives
you a well-rounded approach.
Pinterest
Unless you’re publishing a children’s book or a graphic novel, you probably wouldn’t
immediately think of Pinterest as a place to promote your work. If it’s just words, what
could you possibly show with graphics?
Photos don’t have to be biographical—that is, they don’t have to show the actual content
of your book—they can also be topical. Pinterest boards are more effective as a subtle
form of marketing rather than as a tool for direct sales. Some of the best boards are
composed of the topics related to or in the vicinity of a specific subject.
Pinterest doesn’t do file hosting, so you’re going to have to upload your graphics to
another site. Facebook is an excellent choice; hopefully you’ve already created an author
The Big Players 
| 
177

and/or book page there and have already uploaded some graphics. So with Pinterest,
take all of your photos from your Facebook author or book page, and pin them. Create
a board or two to explain why these photos are relevant to your work.
Some photos can satisfy readers’ curiosity about the author. For instance, take some
photos of the desk and the office where you wrote your novel. Maybe you wrote an
entire chapter while drinking margaritas at Captain Tony’s Saloon in Key West, in the
same dark corner of the bar where Ernest Hemingway used to hang out. Pin the photos!
If you have a particularly creative book cover, you can post a “making of” series of photos
that shows how it was designed. This could include early sketches, photographs, models,
or you or your graphic artist hard at work on the cover design.
If you’re writing historical fiction, post photos and drawings from the era you’re writing
about. If it’s a pre-photography period, perhaps you have some pictures of artifacts from
that era that you can show.
And, of course, somewhere on your board, include links to your site without being
annoying (a link to “Learn more,” “Read the story behind this,” etc.).
If you’re out of ideas, browse Pinterest’s “Film, Music and Books” category. Look for
authors or book titles that are in your genre. Search for free ebook promotions; see what
other authors are doing.
You can also repin relevant posts and pictures from the authors of the boards that you’ve
followed. If you find something that you like or that you want to share with your audi‐
ence or people who are following you, you can repin it.
Create an author profile and board for each book or each character that you have in
your book.
Also consider creating an open board for projects that you’re working on where you
allow others to collaborate by pinning pictures of a location, an item, costumes, or period
clothing. It becomes an interactive experience for your readers.
Literary Social Media
The big players aside, there are a few social networks that specialize in books, readers,
and authors. Now that you have your baseline social media presence in place on the
four major sites, you should shift your focus to niche social media.
Pixel of Ink
Pixel of Ink is similar to Kindle Nation Daily, which we’ve already mentioned. If you
have the budget to advertise there, definitely do it. A lot of author traffic comes from
these two sites.

Chapter 10: Book Promotion

SmashWords, KDP, CreateSpace, and ACX
A number of ebook publishing platforms for self-published authors exist, including
SmashWords, Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), CreateSpace, and Audible Creation Ex‐
change (ACX). These are not social media in the traditional sense, but they do have a
social component to the way they match books with readers. SmashWords, “the world’s
largest distributor of indie ebooks,” can be the only way you publish, or it can be one of
many different publishing platforms. As far as publishing platforms are concerned,
Kindle Direct Publishing is for self-publishing ebooks; CreateSpace is for self-
publishing print titles printed on demand; and Audible Creation Exchange (ACX) is for
self-publishing audiobooks. Each ebook publisher has a different level of reach, so you
may have to go with, for instance, both Kindle Direct Publishing and SmashWords, but
this depends on your publishing agreement. If you sign up for KDP Select, you agree
to make Kindle Direct Publishing the only ebook distributor for an autorenewing period
of 90 days.
If you don’t opt in to KDP Select, or you wait beyond your 90-day exclusivity agreement,
you can publish for free on SmashWords and then write to KDP and inform it that there
is a lower price available elsewhere. Doing this may reduce the Kindle price to match
SmashWords—even if it’s free.
Amazon AuthorCentral
Amazon AuthorCentral is a service in Amazon for authors whose books are provided
on the site. AuthorCentral allows authors to create a central page about them hosted
within Amazon—basically a central hub for all of their published works. Sign-up is free,
and allows authors to claim the titles that they wrote in Amazon’s catalog, and then
displays those titles in every format they are available on Amazon. Although it is not a
social network in the general sense, it does allow authors to post a biography, along with
video and pictures (great for movie or book trailers) and link their other social media
and blog accounts via RSS feed so that it pulls together all of the author’s latest tweets
and posts. Amazon customers can sign up to be alerted via email when new books from
the author are released, which helps boost awareness of their latest publication date and
then, hopefully, sales.
Goodreads
Goodreads is a social network for book lovers. The same basic Facebook friend/fan/like
paradigm exists here, with some book-centric modifications.
You can set up an author page and “claim” your books listed there. Goodreads has an
intricate recommendation system that uses your ratings of other books to determine
what you might like to read in the future. This is second only to Amazon in terms of
Literary Social Media 
| 
179

sites where you want people to post reviews. One positive review on Goodreads can
attract a large number of potential readers.
Goodreads also offers book giveaways. You specify the number of books you have avail‐
able to send out, where you are willing to ship, and what the timeframe for the giveaway
is. There is no limit to the number of giveaways you can do. It may make sense, de‐
pending on how much it costs to do book fulfillment, to run multiple consecutive give‐
aways until you feel you’ve reached the outer limits of your market.
There is also a somewhat rudimentary ad system built into Goodreads. It offers decent
targeting options, but it’s easy to overtarget and get very few views while suffering a very
high CPC.
Another cool thing about Goodreads is the review widget. You can paste a bit of Java‐
Script into your blog and it will show your Goodreads reviews, and link to your book
page there.
LibraryThing
LibraryThing is like Goodreads, but there is more reader interaction. There are forums
where readers can talk about books, and authors can interact directly with readers.
However, you don’t want to be a drive-by author and just dump your marketing message
into the forum and leave. Instead, post an interesting article and then stick around for
the discussion. Or join in the discussions in other threads, and become an active par‐
ticipant of the site. Rate and review the books you’ve read, talk to other authors, share
stories with one another.
LibraryThing also offers giveways in the same way that Goodreads does, except it also
has an ebook option.
Shelfari
Shelfari is Amazon’s barebones social network for book recommendations. It is like a
stripped-down version of LibraryThing. It’s still worth claiming your book as the author
and filling in as many details and trivia points as you can. Then rate and review other
books and see if you can become part of the network of recommendations.
Get Reviews
Professional book reviews are hard to come by nowadays because few periodicals are
willing to pay for them. The handful of major newspapers and magazines that do still
publish them tend to publish reviews of the same already famous books.
The good news is, there are more book reviewers than ever, and many of them are just
as skilled and educated—if not more—than the professionals they’ve replaced. You just
have to know how to get in touch with them.
180 
| 
Chapter 10: Book Promotion

Amazon and other online booksellers may not be social networks in the typical sense,
but the review system and the community of reviewers that exists on Amazon is defi‐
nitely a form of social media.
Amazon Top Reviewers
Amazon publishes a list of its most prolific and highly rated reviewers. If a reviewer has
contact information in his profile, there’s nothing stopping you from contacting him to
ask for a review. This is a delicate situation, though, because the top reviewers get these
requests frequently and are picky about what they will accept. Many of them do not
provide contact information for this reason. A large number of them don’t even review
books.
Don’t concentrate on the top 20 reviewers; they’re too swamped with review requests
as it is. Instead, take a look deeper into the Top 1,000 Reviewers list, and try to find
people who write about your specific genre.
Another approach you can take is to look at the Amazon pages of the books and authors
you’re competing with (or are at least in the same genre), and contact the most highly
rated reviewers who have posted reviews there. You already know that they are interested
in books in this genre, so you’ll have a much easier time getting their attention.
The Amazon Vine Program
This is an Amazon program that matches up prerelease books with experienced re‐
viewers from the aforementioned top reviewers list. Books entered in this program are
reviewed prior to their release so that on launch day, each participating book’s product
page already has a number of in-depth and meaningful reviews. The reviewers (some‐
times called “Viners”) are hand-selected by Amazon employees; they’re all top-rated,
prolific review writers.
Getting a book into this program from the author or publisher side is difficult, even if
you’re published through a big publishing house. If you’re self-published, there does
not seem to be a way into Amazon Vine. If you’re a traditionally published author, ask
your editor if she can have your book included in the program.
Other Reviews
Amazon is the clear market leader in online book sales, accounting for about a third of
all bookselling revenue. If you’ve only got the time to concentrate on one site, this is it.
If you have more resources to spend, there is also Barnes and Noble, AbeBooks, Books-
a-Million, Kobo, and the Apple iBooks Store.

Ask Nicely and Publicly
And of course there is the general public. Every review counts, so don’t be afraid to ask
for them. Have a “Share this book” page on your website where you display a brief
personal message about how grateful you are when people help you spread the word
about your book. Have buttons for your key social networks right there ready to go, and
ask people to “Share this.”
Other Tips and Tricks
Still got more marketing juice left? Try these options.
Prime Lending Library and KDP Select
If you publish an ebook through Kindle Direct Publishing, you have the option to join
the KDP Select program, which gets you into the Prime Lending Library and assigns
you five promotional giveaway days. As mentioned in “SmashWords, KDP, CreateSpace,
and ACX” on page 179, KDP Select requires digital exclusivity for 90 days, and will
autorenew every 90 days (with five more promotional giveaway days) unless you specif‐
ically opt out.
Many people use all of the five days consecutively to try to reach the top of the Kindle
charts for free books. However, you’re perpetually competing against a huge array of
public domain books, and everyone else who is running promotional days or who offers
an ebook for free forever as a promotional trick for some other product or service.
Instead, it could be a better strategy to stagger your five free promo days, perhaps one
per week or one every other week. By doing this, you will be able to leverage social media
more effectively. You can announce, “It’s free again. Come quickly. This is our last free
day.” Then you can promote ads and tweets on that day with a link to the download.
Speak at an Industry Conference
As mentioned earlier in this book, there are many industry conventions and conferences
that you can attend to learn more about social media and ecommerce.
If you’re going to attend one of these conferences, make sure you have business cards
printed with your book’s ISBN and a friendly URL (one that is easy to remember and
type into a browser), or perhaps a QR code. Hand them out to people as you meet them;
it’s a pretty standard business networking practice. Except now instead of contacting
you later to talk about a business deal, they might buy your book instead.
The more prestigious among us don’t just attend; we’re on the speaking schedule. Having
a nonfiction book establishes you as an expert on the subject you wrote about. Even if
you’re self-published, authors still carry a lot of prestige. If you’re at a conference and
think to yourself, “I could totally do one of these presentations or keynotes,” then make
182

Chapter 10: Book Promotion

it your mission to meet the conference organizers while you’re there, and let them know
you’re a published author who would like to speak at next year’s conference.
If you’re proactively seeking speaking engagements, check out conference websites to
see if there is a pitch form, and be mindful of the deadline (it’s usually quite a long time
before the conference opens). Make sure you have a speaker kit of your past engagements
ready to send to interested conference organizers. Speaker kits are invaluable for es‐
tablishing credibility and outlining qualifications. Think about adding sample topic
ideas, past engagements, and even speaker scores and reviews. Figure 10-1 shows mine;
you can download the full thing at my website.

fessional speaker and proposes several potential presentations
Show Off Your Writing Portfolio
If you have a significant body of work spread out across multiple publications and events,
then you should establish an online portfolio. This makes it easier to find and review
all of your work without doing a lot of searching. Some sites we like for writer and
speaker portfolios are:

Case Study: The Mighty Force of an Established Community
Chris Hurn of Mercantile Capital Corporation saw a great opportunity not just to write
a book on a subject he’s passionate about, but also to make money from it directly and
indirectly. A good book that explained this process would help create demand for fi‐
nancing, which would turn the book into a lead-generating tool for his property fi‐
nancing business. As an added bonus, this would enhance Chris’s credentials as an in‐
dustry expert, and attract media attention for interviews, speeches, and article quotes.
Social media was part of Chris’s go-to-market book promotion strategy from the very
beginning—even before the beginning. Chris planned ahead, and already had an im‐
pressive community built by the time The Entrepreneur’s Secret to Creating Wealth: How
the Smartest Business Owners Build Their Fortunes was ready to launch. His company
had accumulated more than 3,600 Facebook likes/fans, 15,000 Twitter followers, 1,800
YouTube subscribers, 165 Google+ connections, and 150 LinkedIn followers. Addi‐
tionally, Chris’s personal accounts on these sites had substantial reach. Combined, he
had an audience of more than 43,000 potential readers.
Though there was a lot of traditional book promotion, Chris made sure that social media
was involved wherever possible. When he or his staff posted a promotional video to
YouTube, he made sure that a direct message was sent to his YouTube subscribers.
All of the book endorsements that Chris received were turned into social media posts.
Many were posted before the book’s launch date, and led to a landing page that allowed
people to preorder. The rest of the endorsements were posted regularly after the book
was released as part of an ongoing social media campaign. Chris started with endorse‐
ments that were general, and saved the more detailed endorsements for later when he
needed to raise the stakes for people who’d been thinking about buying the book for a
while, but weren’t yet convinced.
Every time someone posted a review on Amazon, it was mentioned, excerpted, and
linked to from all of the social media sites that Chris was using.
To push it over the top, one of Chris’s staff members emailed some friends and associates
who had large followings on Twitter, and asked them to mention the book. They even
developed a book promotion kit to provide influencers and reviewers with content that
could easily be posted to social networks, such as facts about the book, current en‐
dorsements, graphics, articles, and interview questions.
Chris also included literary social media, creating accounts and pages on Shelfari,
Goodreads, and RedRoom.

So with all of that effort, did it work? Was it worth the time, money, and energy? When
we wrote this case study, The Entrepreneur’s Secret to Creating Wealth: How the Smartest
Business Owners Build Their Fortunes had been on the market only a few months. Ac‐
cording to Chris:
We’ve seen results from the very beginning (the prelaunch of the book in early Sep‐
tember 2012). Our investment has been considerable on many fronts (PPC ads, PR
firms, book trailers, etc.), but the social media front has been minimal. Due to our
slightly longer sales cycle (it’s common for commercial real estate contracts to be written
for 60 to 120 days to close), we’ve seen only a handful of deals directly from the book…
but it only takes two average closings for us to recoup our entire investment. When the
dust settles, I expect the ROI from this book to be about ten times the marketing cost.
Real-Life Q&A
Q: How is social media different for authors?
A: It isn’t. It’s exactly the same as social media for anything else. You want to engage your
audience. You want to generate interest and participate, not just push your links out
there to everyone. That is where you will generate the community and engagement from
your audience.
Q: I got some great results with social media last time. I’m publishing another book in
a few months. Do I do everything the same the second time around, or is there a different
strategy I should take for a second book?
A: Hopefully, you’ve been continually engaging your audience since the first book, and
haven’t let it go stale just because you’re not launching a book. If you let it rot, then you’ve
got some repair work to do.
If you’ve kept your community going, then you will have that groundswell behind you
each and every time you launch a new book. All you have to do is keep going, except
now you’re going to focus on the new book.
Q: I’m sure I could sell a lot of books if I could speak at an industry conference. How do
you get invited to be a speaker?
A: Start by proving that you’re a decent speaker. Make a video that shows that you can
present an informative, intelligent, and entertaining talk. Then post it on YouTube and
promote it a little. This gives you social proof, and supports your application to speak.
You can also reach out to satisfied clients and ask for recommendations. If they attend
industry conventions, they may have the opportunity to tell the event organizers that
they want you to give a presentation at next year’s conference.
Before you hit the big convention circuit, you might want to build your speaking résumé
by presenting at smaller or regional events. There are many industry or topical groups,
Other Tips and Tricks

such as Java User Groups (JUGs) and Linux User Groups (LUGs), that actively seek
people to give short presentations at monthly local meetings.
Some conferences take public requests for speaker pitches. This usually has to be done
far in advance of the actual conference date. To speak at Search Marketing Expo (SMX),
for instance, go to the SMX website and fill out the pitch form. SXSW has a panel picker
on its site.
Some conferences do not take open requests. If that’s the case, contact the conference
organizer and give your pitch directly.
Q: I have an Amazon Associates account. Can I create a link to my book with that and
get a commission on my sales?
A: Absolutely. There is nothing wrong with doing this. Not only will you get a com‐
mission for your own book, you will also get affiliate credit for anything else that reader
purchases from Amazon that day, even if he doesn’t buy your book. The Amazon As‐
sociates cookie is valid for 24 hours.
Q: I suck at making videos. Am I doomed in terms of video promotion?
A: You are not doomed. Instead of making a fancy, well-produced video, you can do a
live interview or webinar with a simple webcam in the lead-up to the book launch. You
can do this as a Hangout on Google+, or by using a screencasting service. You can
interview key experts that you used for the book, experts in the field whom you know,
or you can have someone interview you. Take questions from your live viewers, and
show video of your face. Then, later, you can promote the replays of these interviews
for people who discovered you afterward. Or make an animated video (Figure 10-2),
whiteboard video (Figure 10-3), or screencast (Figure 10-4). All three create easy op‐
portunities for hooking in an audience.

Summary
This chapter is a bit meta, isn’t it? After all, the people who wrote this book are, by
definition, authors. And if you’re reading this, then you’ve almost certainly bought at
least one of our books, so we must have done something right in terms of marketing it.
The thing is, we don’t necessarily know which channel reached you, and we don’t know
if you are an outlier. Give that some consideration, though: how do you find the books
that you’ve bought and read? How can you get your book involved in the channels that
would reach you or (more importantly) your target market?
All we can do is explain what we know can work, but different genres and markets can
have dramatically different paths to success. Fiction, for instance, is an epic uphill battle
in terms of marketing unless you are a major celebrity or have a lot of social connections,
a huge marketing budget, and/or a big publisher that will put a serious marketing effort
behind your title. Even if you have all of those advantages, there are still no guarantees.
You can even have a really good book with a great cover, produced by a major publisher,
and sink a ton of money into marketing and still not earn a spot on the bestseller list.
Meanwhile, a low-brow pop culture novella about mopey teenagers is making a mil‐
lionaire out of some no-talent hack. It’s just not fair, is it? Sometimes a work of fiction,
even if shallow and poorly written, touches a cultural nerve that creates a literary sen‐
sation in spite of itself. If anyone could reliably predict that bit of magic, then publishers
would never take risks on books that might make it. We hope that you’ll market your
188 
| 
Chapter 10: Book Promotion

fiction in an affordable and sensible manner that will give it the best chance of catching
that cultural wave, if it’s destined to do so. While it may be discouraging to consider the
odds, keep in mind the fact that an unmarketed book has about as much of a chance of
being successful as an unpublished manuscript.
Nonfiction is a little more clear-cut. Know your market, find the channels to reach it,
and get out there and convince people that the easiest path to their dreams leads directly
through your book. Most of the successful authors we know are using their books as
one part of a multifaceted career, as we showed in the case study. It’s a lot easier to add
to an existing infrastructure than it is to create one from scratch.

CHAPTER 11
Event Promotion
Promoting events such as concerts, seminars, conferences, classes, and workshops re‐
quires a slightly different strategy from other ecommerce categories. For non–speaking
events such as concerts, games, or tournaments, it’s simply a matter of designing great
ads, spending enough money on the campaign, and doing extra-fine-grained targeting.
Speaking and teaching events (conferences, classes, etc.) involve more work to prove
the value and importance of the content. People are going to spend a lot of money not
just to attend your event, but probably also to travel there. This chapter deals mostly
with four kinds of events:
• Digital (virtual)
• Local
• Regional
• International
Each requires a different approach to ad targeting when you’re trying to attract the
largest audience.
Within the digital category, there are three subcategories that you should keep in mind
when thinking of your marketing strategy:
• Automated (seems like it’s live, but it’s actually prerecorded)
• Prerecorded
• Live
191

Establish Thought Leadership
The first thing you need to do is show that the event is going to be worthwhile—inter‐
esting, engaging, and valuable. To do that, you’ve got to establish the thought-leadership
status of the people who are speaking at the event. This is true even for virtual events.
Your speakers should be doing a certain amount of this (as well as promoting your event)
on their own. Check with them to make sure that they’re mentioning the event on social
media, and ask if they can contribute an article or podcast that you can post on your
event website. Podcast-type interviews are fairly easy to do; just send three questions
relevant to the topic, and either ask the speaker to record them, or set up a call or video
conference to record the answers. I taught a two-day SEO workshop for the American
Marketing Association, and to promote it, AMA and I partnered on a short podcast that
was marketed to prospective attendees. You can find that example at https://cc.ready
talk.com/play?id=9au7h. You can also host a short panel-type discussion and record it
as a podcast.
If you’re hosting a panel discussion, you might want to concentrate only on the most
well-connected panelists. Market your biggest names. If you aren’t sure who the top
people are, use the research tactics mentioned in Chapter 13.
Record a preliminary thought-leadership conference as a podcast in the style of a group
conversation with one moderator. Create a transcript from it to use as promotional
material later.
It’s also helpful if you, as the event host, are known in the industry. Everything public
you do creates thought-leadership status. So any articles, podcasts, videos, or other
content you can post around the Web will help draw attention to and give relevancy to
your event. Don’t just post on your own pages and sites; try to get in as a contributor
on prominent industry blogs and in magazines. Most commercial content sites will not
turn down free content as long as it’s excellent. You can also try to get invited as a guest
speaker on other people’s podcasts and radio shows. Two sites to look into for this are:
• webmasterradio.fm
• blogtalkradio
If you have the time and speaking ability, you can even start your own regular podcast
or online radio show. James Schramko uses his weekly podcast “SuperFast Business” to
supplement his blog and business training course. His end result is around 23,000 sub‐
scribers.

Chapter 11: Event Promotion

Add Hashtags
Go to Twitter and Facebook and create relevant hashtags for your event. Use them
whenever you post something about that event, and encourage your speakers to do so
as well. See Figure 11-1 for a good example.
During the actual event, make sure you let all of the attendees know about your hashtags
so that they can use them in their social media posts. Assigning someone the task of
live-tweeting from the event is also a great way to get discussion going around your
event. And if you plan to hold regular events, using the same hashtag for each can
generate buzz around future events.
Create Virtual Badges
You can get some extra reach by creating graphical badges that speakers and attendees
can add to their social profiles, blogs, and other sites. If you need some inspiration, a
good example is the SES conference.
Establish a Basic Ad and Content Strategy
Your event ads should be progressive—they should build up to the event. Have a count‐
down series of ads for every major interval (“One month until,” “One week until,” “Two
days until,” etc.). Offer an early-bird price, with a hard date for a deadline.
In terms of ad design, use a photo of the location as the image in the ad. If the event is
in Los Angeles, use a photo of a building in Los Angeles, and be sure to use the words
Los Angeles in the ad or the title so that you can more effectively reach your demographic.
People who view ads don’t know that they are targeted specifically to view them.
Giving away tickets in the weeks prior is a great way to get a buzz going about your
event. People will begin to envision themselves possibly attending the event, and if they
don’t win, they’re more likely to sign up. Jairek Robbins had a great promotion for his
Rapid Results Retreat (Figure 11-2). The promotion involved 7 possible ways to gain
additional entries in a giveaway drawing for a free ticket to the retreat, a cruise that
spanned 16 days and 7 countries. Additional vote opportunities included sharing the
promotion on a social media platform.

Chapter 11: Event Promotion

Figure 11-2. Robbins’s contest saw huge success, with 1,190 individual entries
There are apps that will enable you to give people multiple giveaway entries if they share
the giveaway on social networks. Definitely take advantage of this if you can. If you don’t
have the budget to use contest/giveaway apps like that, then at least ask entrants to share
the event on Facebook or Twitter as part of their entry requirement. Similarly, you can
give discounts for people who share the event on social networks.
Ask people to submit questions about the event and the content you’ll be presenting at
it. In the weeks leading up to your event, putting out a call for questions is a great way
to get people thinking about the event, which increases the chances of them attending
while also giving you ideas that you may not have considered. You can also livestream
Q&A sessions from the event to give people a vested interest in coming up with questions
or comments beforehand.
In addition, another successful tactic for event promotion, particularly for local events
or “expert” events, is to find influencers in the local market who have large followings
and offer them free attendance to the event in return for their promoting the event to
their followers.
Leverage Social Networks
In this section, we discuss some tactics for specific social networks.
If you’re having trouble thinking of good content, then lean on your speakers or pre‐
senters. Get some snippets from them that you can share on social media. Do they have
previous content you can share? Leverage the existing fan base of the people who are
speaking whenever possible.

195

If you’re a one-person show, then use snippets from your event content. Give part of it
away for free. Talk about related books and current events related to this topic.
Regardless of which networks you participate or advertise on, you must build an audi‐
ence before you can announce the event—if you have time to plan, that is. Event pro‐
motion is a long-term strategy for a long-term business.
Multiple Events
If you run more than one event, then start a topic-based group on Facebook and/or
LinkedIn so that you can maintain a list of people who may be interested.
Slideshare
Slideshare is a site for hosting and sharing PowerPoint-style slide presentations. In gen‐
eral, it is a great site for raising your professional profile as a speaker, presenter, thought
leader, or manager.
If you can, create a virtual version of one of your event talks by uploading the slide deck
and adding an audio voiceover. Then share the presentation on all of your social net‐
works.
Lanyrd
Lanyrd is a social network entirely dedicated to conferences and speakers. It’s practically
a necessity to have an account here if you want to build your profile as a host or speaker
for a technology-themed conference.
Regardless of your industry, having an active Lanyrd account with good content is a
great way to build your online reputation as a speaker or conference host. A decent
amount of engagement here is social proof of your speaking and organizing skills. Con‐
tent on Lanyrd that is associated with you will also increase the volume of positive
Google search results involving your name, your brand, and your company.
Portfolio Sites
If you have a significant body of work spread out across multiple publications and events,
then you should establish an online portfolio. This makes it easier to find and review
all of your work without doing a lot of searching. Some sites we like for writer and
speaker portfolios are: 
• clippings.me
• Muck Rack
• Contently
196 
| 
Chapter 11: Event Promotion

• Pressfolios
AllConferences
AllConferences is a social network dedicated to conferences of all kinds. You definitely
want to register here, and participate appropriately.
YouTube
If you have the resources to create a three-minute promotional video, then by all means
do it and post it on YouTube. You can do an interview with some of the speakers, you
can give away part of your presentation, or you can just talk for a few minutes about the
event and how it will help attendees be happier, more successful, or more effective. For
an example event promotion video, check out Next Level Experience.
Use YouTube ads to promote this video to people who are fans of the event’s topic or of
the people who are speaking there. Share the video everywhere you can.
Meetup
You should have an account on Meetup (Figure 11-3) even if you’re not promoting
events. As explained in other chapters, it’s a great way to network and to increase your
search visibility. Meetups often feature speakers who have mastered a professional skill.
Speaking at these can bolster your credibility in the local area, and even lead to part‐
nerships or consulting gigs. In addition, if you are looking into giving talks at confer‐
ences, this is a great stepping-stone.
Create a Meetup group for your event. You can make this the main site for the event, if
you want, or it can be a complement to your event website. This is particularly effective
for local events, since Meetup is primarily a local service. Or, mention your event at a
local meetup group that is relevant.
In the event description of your Meetup, be sure to use good keywords so that it’s easily
found through Google and the on-site search function. Don’t do keyword stuffing,
though; the description should make sense to a human reader.
Meetup has limited utility for international events, but if you have the resources to put
into it, you can definitely attract a larger local crowd.

Figure 11-3. Properly used, Meetup can be a gateway to local colleagues, customers,
and fans
Facebook
All of the previously explained tactics for Facebook apply. Create a page for your event,
post good content, engage, promote, and so on. Certainly also create a Facebook event
for your event and promote it to your fans, but make it clear to attendees that confirming
their attendance on the Facebook event isn’t sufficient to save their spot—they must
register at your official event page to confirm their registration.
You’re also going to want to create your own Facebook group dedicated to the topic that
the conference covers, and leverage your Facebook fan base to participate in it.
Twitter
As already mentioned, create a custom hashtag (or hashtags, if appropriate to do more
than one) for your event on Twitter.
You can take this one step further by using Twitter’s API to create a custom widget for
your site that displays tweets with this hashtag.

Create Your Own Social Network
It’s possible to use a service to create your own social network. However, you or your
event needs to be extremely popular, and you must dedicate a lot of resources to main‐
taining a custom social network and engaging with the participants. In most cases, it’s
better to create a Facebook group or Google+ community so that you can take advantage
of an existing infrastructure with which your fans are already familiar. When existing
networks don’t have the features or control that your community needs to be successful,
then you have a good business case for a custom social network. These are some services
that we recommend: 
• Crowdvine
• Ning
• Presdo Match
• Bizzabo
If you take this route, you’re going to want to promote your custom social network
everywhere—Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Do whatever you can to get speakers and
attendees to sign up here and participate on the site. Here are some examples of suc‐
cessful custom social networks:

Coach Marketing Machine.
How do you use Facebook ads?
Leverage Social Networks

199

Taki: We use predominantly newsfeed ads with some retargeting (see Figure 11-4). Some
is righthand sidebar stuff, but mostly its News Feed link post ads. The main reason for
me is that eyeballs are on the News Feed. People have been trained to ignore the other
stuff. You can actually get great click-through rates on the righthand side, but the News
Feed shows up better on mobile. I’m pushing people towards content, so it just makes
more sense that way.
Figure 11-4. One of Taki Moore’s higher performing Facebook ads
Sometimes we use News Feed ads to promote blog content to create engagement. But
most of the time we are sending people straight to an opt-in page, usually to a free report
or checklist (see Figure 11-5). We’ve gone straight to webinar, and our show up rate isn’t
as good. We’ve found really great show-up rates on the Facebook ads if they’ve clicked
on the ad that day or the day before, but too much before that and it’ll be about 20%
show up, compared to our returning audience, which is around 50%–55%. For that
reason when we go to webinar, we usually go to something else first, and make the
webinar the Thank You page strategy.

Chapter 11: Event Promotion

Figure 11-5. One of Taki Moore’s landing pages, built in LeadPages
Any surprising strategies you’ve found useful?
Taki: I typically think the more value that I can give people the better. I sent people to
this killer video course, but our conversion on the landing page was lower. I believe in
part it is because people think it will be valuable, but know they are going to have to sit
through a bunch of video content to get the value. On our second video in the video
series there was a 27-point checklist with a 3×3 grid of some steps on how to run a
webinar that sells really well and how to market it. It turned out that the checklist was
a hotter offer than the video course. So we just put that front and center and made the
landing page just mail out the checklist. That page doubled our conversion rate, and in
some cases almost tripled it. The video course was giving us around 11% conversion on
the video course, depending on targeting; I think it ended up averaging around 28% for
the checklist. People want it because the checklist is like a quick win or a magic pill,
something that you can get big value from without having to work too hard for it.
How do you market differently for events?
Taki: We’re doing a look-a-like audience on Facebook ads. We take our client base and
upload them to Facebook. Facebook then looks for people who have six data points in
common with our current clients. Then, we overlay that with the likes and interests that
we are targeting, say “coaching and this person and that person.” This creates a much
more targeted list who are almost certainly the right type of people. Obviously, we’ve
done custom audience, and we’ve done a look-a-like to our prospect list as well. We
targeted LA, California, West Coast much heavier than we did East Coast because of
travel time, because we are driving people to a live event.
We just had 58 people in the room this weekend, at least half from Facebook. The ticket
price wasn’t the big obstacle. The big obstacle is “I’ve got to get to LA and take two days
out of my life. And maybe pay for accommodation.” Upside, the room was nice and full;

201

we sold a lot of stuff. Downside, we managed to attract a few people who weren’t my
ideal, just because of the likes and interests we targeted. Of the 58 people in the room,
we sold it to 18 of them at $18,000 a piece. We’ll call the total between $270,000 and
$329,000.
What do you use for landing pages?
Taki: We use LeadPages. I love it because you can get a page up quickly and test things
out. If something works out really well, but you want a little more control over how it
looks, you can take your page to a designer and say “I want this, but Like us!" or some‐
thing.
The great thing about LeadPages is that you can go to a page type like an “opt-in page”
and then sort by conversion rate. The top 3 or 4 layouts are usually the ones we’ll pick.
Then we split-test them against each other and run them for a few days until it is stat‐
istically 98% guaranteed to perform better or worse than the other. Then we just ditch
the loser. We’ve tested four different landing page templates with probably 40 different
designs, and run Improvely to then track the sales funnel.
Real-Life Q&A
Q: I’ve got some great material for a webinar, but I have no idea what software to use.
Can you make some suggestions?
A: Sure. Here are some webinar recording and delivery services that we’re aware of:
• Autopilot Webinars
• StealthSeminar
• Evergreen Business System
• WebEx
• GoToWebinar
• Join.me
• Google Hangouts
In general, webinar software and services used to be very expensive, but they have re‐
duced in price quite a lot, and continue to get cheaper with time. Google Hangouts, for
instance, is an excellent tool for giving webinars, and not only is it free, it’s also connected
directly to a major social network (see Figure 11-6).

Chapter 11: Event Promotion

Figure 11-6. Google+ makes it easy to host, find, sign up for, record, and comment
on Hangouts
Q: I had a whole plan for a traditional marketing campaign, but you’ve talked me into
abandoning it all in favor of social media. Should I do that?
A: Maybe. If you have already had success with your previous traditional marketing
efforts, then absolutely don’t abandon them! Rather, select some of the things we’ve
talked about in this chapter that you can easily add to that strategy, and see what happens.
Now, if you’ve seen rising costs and diminishing returns in traditional advertising, then
you should think about cutting back on the parts of it that aren’t working, and ramping
up your social media efforts. The world in general is moving toward social media and
away from old-style media.
For products and services that have a long or detailed sales process, or are very com‐
plicated and/or expensive, webinars tend to convert very well to sales, more so than a
plain old landing page. Definitely go for the sale during the presentation, but don’t show
or provide the “buy” button until you get to the “bonuses” for fast-acting buyers.
The strategy for promoting a webinar is pretty universal, no matter where or how you’re
doing it. It’s just a lot easier, quicker, and cheaper online if you focus on social media.
When you’re promoting your webinar, foster a sense of urgency and scarcity. There are
only so many seats, slots, or tickets. Show a countdown timer, or show the exact (low)
number of available free tickets. Offer people the chance to win something extra by
signing up early (“The first 20 people to sign up get this extra”), such as a free ticket to
another event, free access to bonus material or other recordings of expensive events, or
free product giveaways.

LeadPages has premade templates for webinar registration pages that are incredibly
quick to fill in (see Figure 11-7).
Figure 11-7. LeadPages has a variety of templates to choose from that are designed
specifically to promote webinars
Q: In the beginning of this chapter, you said that there were three types of digital events.
Why is that important?
A: It’s just something to keep in mind for marketing purposes. A live event is going to
generate more interest than a prerecorded event, so you’re going to want to advertise
that fact. You also don’t want to mislead people; if you advertise something as live, but
it is actually automated, it could backfire and generate a significant amount of negative
buzz for future events if you’re found out.
If your event is prerecorded or automated, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you’re
going to have to focus on a good value add. The recorded content is only part of the
value. It may be prerecorded, but there is still someone there to field questions afterward,
or there is some other interactive element to it that makes the fact that it’s not live a
nonissue. Or maybe the content is so good and so unique that you can do it live once
and resell the recording a few times for people who couldn’t attend the first event.
Another way to advertise or set up a prerecorded webinar is to tailor it for new customers
or qualified prospects. Tell them that you have a webinar coming up in the near future,
and then arrange to deliver it at that time. This can be done on an ad hoc basis, or you
can schedule the events regularly.
204 
| 
Chapter 11: Event Promotion

Even though you’re not going to lie about a webinar being prerecorded, you probably
don’t want to make it obvious that it is—you still want to give the appearance of it being
live. Even if your attendees are aware that it’s prerecorded, a well-configured presenta‐
tion will still put them into the same mode of thinking as if it were live. For instance, if
an attendee is late, don’t let him start watching from the beginning of the presentation;
make him miss the beginning and pick up where and when he joined, just as though it
were live. The Q&A portion of the webinar should always look live, even if it’s not. This
may require you to handle the Q&A in a separate service or session. You can also allow
new questions to come in during the prerecorded Q&A session from the original live
event, and say at the end of the session that you will reply to all other questions via email.
If you offer to do that, though, make sure you collect those questions and reply to them
personally.
Q: I’d like to start a local LUG (Linux User Group), but I don’t have any good promotion
ideas. It’s not something I want to spend a lot of money on, but I would really like it to
be successful. What can I do for little or no cost?
A: First, make sure the event is worth going to. The launch event of a weekly or monthly
group meeting has to have some spark and incentive in order to get off the ground. If
you can affordably cater the event (offer free food), that will help quite a lot. In your
case, one of the signature events of a LUG is an installfest where Linux experts help Linux
newbies install a desktop distribution on their computer in a dual-boot configuration,
or they set up a USB drive to provide an alternate boot option. If you can afford to cover
the cost of pizza and soft drinks for the attendees, and offer to perform free data backups
to DVD (bring a spool of blank DVD-R discs), those would be two excellent, inexpensive
incentives that would drive participation.
Think about the subject of an installfest. You need people who know Linux, and people
who want to learn Linux. Where would you find people who have interest on both sides
of that operation? Computer repair shops, perhaps. Can you post a sign or flyer there?
What about at computer stores? Perhaps the owner of a small local shop will even offer
to cover the cost of the refreshments if he’s allowed to bring some demonstration models
and service flyers to the event.
It’s possible that you can leverage an existing technology-oriented group on Meet‐
up.com as well. Search through the site and see if you can find related groups, then
contact the group organizer and see if she’s amenable to your hosting your own event
through that group.
In general, local events have gotten a little tougher to promote because local periodicals
have lost a lot of popularity and relevance. You can’t take out an ad in the newspaper
and expect results from it anymore. However, there’s Craigslist—that’s free, and has a
lot of reach in the metropolitan areas that it serves. Post an ad there and keep it current
right up until the actual day and time of the event. Then for the next meeting, post a
different ad with photos and praise from the attendees of the inaugural event—social
proof that this is a fun and interesting group that real people attend.
Leverage Social Networks 
| 
205

Also try to reach out to local bloggers; search all of the blogging services (e.g., WordPress,
TypePad, Blogger) for people who are in your area and might have an interest in your
event. For technical events, look for local blogs through Technorati.
Create a Facebook group for your meeting, and on the night of the event, take pictures
and short videos and post them to that group. While you’re among the attendees in
person, go around with your smartphone or tablet and invite each of them to the Face‐
book group and ask them to post something and invite their friends. After the first event,
you should have enough momentum to see a benefit from spending a little bit of money
($20–$50) promoting your Facebook group to continue to improve attendance. Re‐
member: you’re always looking for new members, even if you feel that you’ve achieved
your attendance goals!

Events should definitely have a place in your professional life, even if you’re not hosting
them. We’ve explained in this and other chapters how attending industry conferences

CHAPTER 12
Social Search Engine Optimization
So far we’ve concentrated on direct sales and customer interaction through social media.
While social networks may be taking over the Internet at a rapid pace, traditional ecom‐
merce websites are still where most online sales hapåpen. In fact, most etailers who are
successful with social media are using it to eventually direct customers and prospects
to a landing page on a corporate site or online store, so even if the method of getting
there is new, the traditional website is still the focuså of ecommerce.
Traditional search engine optimization (SEO) may involve a number of different factors,
from code changes and URL redirects on the server to getting people to link to your
sites from places where search engines look. Hopefully, you already have a good SEO
process in place. (If not, we recommend The Art of SEO [O’Reilly], which was coau‐
thored by one of this book’s coauthors, and is widely recognized as the definitive work
on the subject.) Adding social media to your existing SEO strategy is both easy and
inexpensive.
Beyond driving traffic to your site, you also want to be found in social network search
engines. Google is pretty good about finding your publicly accessible social media pro‐
files and pages, but what about the search engines that are built into the social networks?
That’s a whole different, and quickly advancing, kind of SEO.
There are a lot of technical terms in this chapter. If you need clear
definitions, you can find them in the Glossary.
Optimizing for Web Search
As long as Google remains the fastest route from point A to B, it will be the operating
system of the Web, and the need for SEO will continue. Social networks offer just another
207

venue within which searchers can conduct their queries. That means that large social
networks like Facebook serve a dual purpose as search engines. As we’ve already men‐
tioned, YouTube is the second most-used search engine. So optimizing for better visi‐
bility in search engines, whether Google or Facebook, isn’t going away.
Use relevant keywords whenever appropriate, and post and engage with your followers
regularly. By following these two simple rules, you are already well on your way to
effectively optimizing your social media presence.
Using Photo-Sharing Sites for SEO
We have specific advice on Pinterest in the section “Pinterest for SEO” on page 213. How‐
ever, there is one constant across all social photo sites: the SEO impact can be significant.
Because most photo-sharing sites nofollow all outgoing links (meaning that search en‐
gines do not count those links toward rankings), there isn’t usually a direct impact on
the placement of search results.
While outbound links on photo sites probably won’t directly impact your ranking, that
doesn’t mean these sites aren’t useful for SEO. Google gives a lot of weight both to Flickr
and to its own Picasa photo-sharing service, and so photos that you upload to these sites
can rank well in Google and Google images. This can be particularly valuable for product
images.
Google+ for SEO
Don’t think of Google+ as a social network; think of it as Google’s social interface to the
Web. It’s kind of like a mashup of every other social network—it’s a little bit of Twitter,
Facebook, and Pinterest all mixed together. The massive upshot is, if you post something
to Google+ that ends up being +1’d and shared a lot, Google gives it more weight in web
search results for logged-in Google users who added you to their circles. This is far more
valuable than a generic link to a specific post on a different social network. Your content
on Google+ is also indexed in a matter of moments, whereas other social networks will
probably take longer.
If you have a local business, or any location to which customers will need to navigate,
it is a strict requirement that you have a Google+ profile for your business. This is how
your location will show up on Google Maps, and gives you the ability to customize your
Google Local page. Additionally, you’ll show up (and hopefully rank highly in) Google
search results for your business name.
Google+ is also a great place to post live content, such as video demonstrations, inter‐
views, and Q&A sessions. The recorded video can be stored and linked from indefinitely
from YouTube, but the initial interaction and delivery happens through a Google+
Hangout. Most of this is valuable only after you’ve built a following.
208 
| 
Chapter 12: Social Search Engine Optimization

So how do you build a following? More so than most other social networks, Google+
demands that you interact and engage with others to gain followers. You can’t stand
back and deliver content and hope for people to find and follow you—that is not a viable
tactic. You have to find people and communities related to what you do or sell, and +1,
comment, and share with them. Link back to people, mention them, ask them questions.
After a few months, hopefully you’ll find yourself in a significant number of circles. This
takes a lot of work, and that work is ongoing, but for sustained influence on search
results, it’s a great investment.
Facebook for SEO
When properly optimized, your Facebook fan page can increase your business’s online
exposure without requiring a huge time investment (see Figure 12-1 for a great example).
Figure 12-1. Coca-Cola’s Facebook page is a great example of good SEO
Here are three important ways you can optimize your Facebook page:
Use descriptive keywords.
There are a number of places on your page where you should be including keywords
that accurately describe your product or brand. It shouldn’t take more than a few
minutes to do this. Make sure you include them in your page name (particularly
the first word), vanity URL, company description, and periodically in your posts
(particularly within the first 18 words). Your page name and description are espe‐
cially critical because they directly correspond with the title tag, meta description,
and H1 tag on your Facebook page.
Optimizing for Web Search 
| 
209

Post regularly and be engaging.
Likes, shares, comments, and check-ins are important for increasing your ranking
in Graph Search. This means you should focus on regularly posting new content,
and engaging with your fans. In addition, blog posts and articles that are linked to
from within Facebook posts may receive higher search engine and Graph Search
rankings when frequently liked and shared.
Make sure you’ve filled out every section of your page.
Facebook is more likely to move you to the top of Graph Search if you’ve filled out
every section of your page. This includes your full address (especially critical for
local search), phone number, product information, mission, overview, and about
fields.
Twitter for SEO
Yes, tweets can rank in the search engines!
While Twitter links are nofollowed, Google does index tweets and profiles, and does take
social signals into consideration. This means tweets that are retweeted are more likely
to rank, and URLs within popular tweets may be weighted more heavily. However, tweets
will not directly affect the search rankings of links to external sites.
As with all social networking optimization, keywords are of special importance. For
instance, if you type “twitter reddit marketing” into Google, the first five results are for
Twitter profiles and tweets, as shown in Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-2. Tweets do indeed show up in Google, and can rank highly
Figure 12-3 is a screenshot of the second result in that list.

Figure 12-3. If you choose your tweet content carefully, you can rank highly for related
search queries
This was favorited only twice, and not retweeted at all, yet this tweet ranks simple be‐
cause it contains keywords relevant to the search query.
Here are some other ways to optimize your Twitter profile and tweets (some of which
are illustrated in Figure 12-4):
• Include your keywords in your Twitter bio. Your bio will automatically be used as
your meta description.
• Include keywords in at least some of your tweets.
• Tweet excellent content that gets retweeted to increase social authority.
• Optimize your Twitter lists by using keywords in the names of your list. These lists
have unique URLs, so make the most of them.

LinkedIn for SEO
Google also gives a lot of authority to LinkedIn pages, so long as they are publicly
accessible (that holds true for all social media profiles, though). To test the visibility and
SEO friendliness of your LinkedIn profile, do a Google search for your name. If your
LinkedIn profile is among the top results, you’ve got a good head start. Follow through
by ensuring that your business page on LinkedIn is filled out, publicly viewable, and
has a good URL.
LinkedIn profiles have three places where you can put in external URLs. There are
several choices, the most obvious ones being Personal Site, Company Site, and Other.
You can put any URL you want in any of these, but Other will also ask you for a de‐
scription. This is your chance to use a compelling keyword phrase to connect to your
ecommerce or business site. You can also customize the anchor text if you choose Other
for your other links. You can put High-Fashion Blog or whatever pertains to your com‐
pany. However, keep in mind that this is nofollowed.

YouTube for SEO
You can dramatically increase the chances your video will be found via YouTube search
and in the search engines by following these tips:
Use descriptive keywords.
There are a number of places you should include your keywords:
In your video title.
Choose your top one or two keywords, and work with them to create a title that
will be friendly to both visitors and search engines.
In your video description.
Be sure to make these sound as natural as possible.
In your tags.
Tags are how YouTube categorizes videos, so you should use words people are
likely to use to find your video, including your brand name where relevant. To
view a video’s tags, either view the HTML source (incredibly tedious) or use
the Chrome extension VidIQ Vision.
Upload a transcript.
You can provide your own transcript or captions file, or you can rely on YouTube’s
automatic transcription. If you have the time, we suggest overriding the automatic
transcription (as it is very inaccurate) and instead opting to manually transcribe
your video. This is searchable content and you’ll want to ensure the right words are
being used. There are inexpensive transcription services available such as dotsub,
captionsync, and castingwords.
Upload foreign language translations.
Again, it’s searchable content and will help you rank for foreign language queries.
And the translation appears in the video as subtitles.
Pinterest for SEO
Here are four ways to improve SEO with Pinterest:
Use relevant keywords throughout your profile and pins.
This includes:
• Your company username
• In your About section
• In your board names
• In your pin descriptions
• In your pin filenames

Choose appropriate categories for your boards.
Because many people will go to the Pinterest categories section to find relevant pins,
it’s important to make sure you’ve listed your boards under the most relevant cat‐
egories. To view a list of categories, click on the red button next to the search box
at the top left of your screen (see Figure 12-5).
Figure 12-5. Ranking highly in a top category will give you a shot at increased
traffic
Consider using the long-tail keywords.
For individual pictures, consider using longer, more descriptive keywords that
won’t be as difficult to rank for.
Include your city or region.
If you’re looking to attract local search traffic, be sure to include your business’s city
name in your profile and/or your board names (Figure 12-6).

Optimizing for Social Search Engines
This is a tough subject to write about because most social networks are secretive about
their search engines. In some cases, we suspect that they don’t want to expose the lim‐
itations and primitive nature of their search capabilities; in other cases, they may have
major flaws that would allow users to easily exploit the system and get to the top of the
results. Social networks are extremely competitive with one another, especially when it
comes to the quality of features—search being one of the big ones.
LinkedIn
If you’re using LinkedIn to find clients, SEO for your business page should be one of
your top priorities. Fortunately, improving your rankings on LinkedIn shouldn’t take
long, assuming you’re already well connected and active on the site.
Here are a few tips for increasing your LinkedIn rankings (and your outbound SEO as
well):
Fill out your profile completely.
LinkedIn gives preference to accounts that have every section is filled in.
Use keywords.
In your headline, description, products, services, and specialties fields.
Make connections.
LinkedIn appears to give preference to profiles that have at least some connections,
so even if you don’t plan to use LinkedIn regularly, be sure to connect with at least
a few people.
Join LinkedIn groups.
By actively participating in LinkedIn groups, your profile activity goes up, increas‐
ing your social ranking.
Get recommendations.
There is some evidence that profiles with more than 10 recommendations may
receive improved rankings.

Facebook Graph Search
Facebook has put a ton of resources into its on-site search engine. There isn’t much
room for exploiting it, since you’re limited as to what you can put into your profile and
the Facebook admins are vigilant.
When you search Google, you’re asking for relevant results from the widest possible
array of sources; when you search Facebook, you’re asking specifically to find people or
some attribute that is normally associated with people. A Google search result will show
you information in an anonymous manner, whereas Graph Search enables you to con‐
nect with the person, page, or group that you’ve found. So you could say that Graph
Search is about who you know (or can know), whereas Google search is about what the
Internet as a whole knows. By extension, Graph Search is also about who knows you.
So if you have a relevant audience, then Graph Search will connect the friends of your
friends with your business page.
The Graph Search result algorithm represents a mix of the following criteria: freshness,
relevance, and closeness. There is also a geotargeting component to the algorithm, so if
you have location data (both your business location and check-in locations), then you
can rank more highly locally.
Here are some other general tips for increasing your visibility in Facebook’s Graph
Search engine:
Claim your page name.
Choose a good page name using your business name and/or location. Remember
to keep it short and simple.
Choose your business category and subcategories.
Most pages can choose three subcategories.
Find the most relevant keywords for your business.
These can be your main SEO keywords, keywords from your AdWords campaigns,
or even keywords from Google Webmaster Tools.
Provide detail and keywords in the About, Mission, and Company Description sections
of your page and profile.
The more detail you can provide here, the better. Use strong, relevant keywords
and URLs for best results.
Use relevant apps.
Apps for surveys, forms, menus, newsletters, ebooks, contests, and the like make it
easy for fans to find your content. When you post only status updates, visitors get
lost in a matter of days. By keeping your relevant information in an app, you ensure
that most info is quickly retrievable.
216

Chapter 12: Social Search Engine Optimization

Create your own version of a Facebook mini-website with an app.
Use it for lead generation, sales of top products, promos and giveaways, free down‐
loads, and any other relevant content. You can get your app to appear as a tab/link
next to Timeline, About, and Photos. See Figure 12-7.
Figure 12-7. Steve Spangler’s Facebook page has an “Experiment of the Week” tab
and app
Develop an interactive, engaging, entertaining page-post style that suits your brand.
This is very important! Find your voice, and use it in your posts. Engagement is
everything on Facebook, so it’s worth investing some time in getting your message
right. Regular, entertaining posts will keep users coming back for more.
Encourage content sharing.
Make it easy for people to share your content by posting plenty of photos and videos.
Keep videos very short (under five minutes) and have them subtly branded with
your company name and/or URL.
Optimizing for Social Search Engines

217

Discuss it.
Chat, reply, tag, and interact with your readers/fans regularly. Many big brands
totally overlook this aspect of social media. Ignore this, and you will fail. Discuss
hot topics, confront blunders head on, answer questions, and be fair, honest, and
straightforward.
Tag photos with your page name, being sure to include your business name and loca‐
tion in the description.
Tagging photos is a great way to ensure your page will be seen when customers are
searching for a business like yours.
Be careful what you click Like on with your personal account. Since you have liked your
business page, you’re associating your likes with your page and therefore your business.
If you “like” racism, Graph Search will associate you with everything else you like, in‐
cluding your business. Someone could then search for people who like racism, and your
business logo will appear in the results along with your page and profile. Find other
examples at Actual Facebook Graph Searches.
If you have some time to spend experimenting with Graph Search, you can get an idea
of where you rank in comparison with your competitors. Search for your keywords and
adjust the filters to see what the results are.
Case Study: Going Viral for Links and Likes
In early 2010, home improvement retailer BuildDirect had exhausted many of the tra‐
ditional means of acquiring links to boost their rankings in Google. They needed a new
strategy for continuing to attract quality links, new sources of traffic, and social signals
that Google pays attention to, such as social media shares and activity. As a pure play
ecommerce site offering building materials to both DIY consumers and builders/devel‐
opers, BuildDirect traditionally pursued a content strategy focused around providing
useful how-to and product feature information. Its then-Director of SEO, Content, &
Social Media, Rob Woods (now an SEO consultant and content strategist), decided that
what was needed was a new approach to the content strategy.
The approach Woods took was a multifaceted one. The first step was to conduct detailed
research and build personas for those who were actually reading the content and driving
the purchase process for their products. This allowed BuildDirect to understand that
the true drivers of its success were not the (usually) men who were most often making
purchases on the site but rather the (usually) women who were looking at how they
wanted their homes designed and how they wanted their homes to feel, then finding the
products that matched those wants and needs.
This led to Woods creating a strategy for content creation and promotion that focused
much more on informing those female users about the latest trends and styles, and how
to achieve those in their own home. “One of the best strategies I found for getting started
218 
| 
Chapter 12: Social Search Engine Optimization

on a basic editorial calendar and getting ideas for what to write was actually going back
to the traditional print magazine industry,” Woods says. “I laid out several years of each
magazine and you can really get a sense from that as to what the most popular topics
are and when certain topics tend to be written about. The magazine industry has spent
many decades perfecting what content to publish, when to publish it, and how frequently
to rewrite and republish an article,” states Woods.
While the creation of this type of content was meeting the needs of BuildDirect’s actual
readers and customers, it was intended to drive more engagement once users were on
the site rather than driving new traffic. This led to the second wave of the content strat‐
egy: creating content designed to almost exclusively drive links and social shares to the
site while still remaining somewhat on topic with the theme of the site.
The next step was to hold brainstorming sessions to come up with ideas for content that
might have more entertainment value than educational value. In addition to their own
internal team, Woods brought in two outside consultants, Brent Csutoras and Matt
Siltala, who specialized in creating and promoting viral content. “Unless you have ex‐
perienced viral content and promotion experts in-house it really is worth bringing in
someone expert in the field, at least to get you started,” says Woods. These consultants
not only helped with coming up with ideas for viral content and developing processes
for creating that content, they also provided access to power users on social media plat‐
forms to help with the promotion of the posts. Woods says, “Unless you have a vast
social network of your own, it’s vital to leverage influencers or power users who have
the ability to give your content a kickstart in social media.”
Even with a strong kickstart, you have to be prepared for many of your viral content
pieces to fall flat and only a few to be stars. It’s impossible to create content where every
single piece you create goes viral. You have to experiment, test, and in some cases, even
get a little lucky. “We tried several different ideas for humorous content. Not all of them
worked, but we learned as we went. Our most successful content piece was one called
Redneck Home Remodels”, says Woods (see Figure 12-8). “It connected on several of the
factors that help contribute to a piece of content going viral. It was on its face humorous,
showing ingenious and, to be fair, somewhat stereotypical, home renovations and hacks
purportedly created by rednecks. It also, quite unintentionally, created controversy
wherein many users thought we were making fun of poor people. We weren’t, of course,
but the discussion that followed in the comment section helped drive more views and
shares of the piece. Our social media manager at the time, Rob Jones, made sure that
we responded to all criticisms in a calm and professional manner,” relates Woods. The
article also had the good fortune of being seen and retweeted by Jason Alexander (George
Costanza from Seinfeld). Being seen by someone so influential with a large following on
Twitter gave the piece an additional bump in traffic after the initial spike had begun to
wear off.

Video Search
No matter what you’re selling, it will help you to have a video presence. Google Video
Search still exists despite the fact that most videos are posted on YouTube and most
video searches take place there. Video search is not sandboxed; if you’re doing a normal
web search, if there is a highly ranked video that is relevant to your query, it will show
up in the standard search results.
Aside from YouTube, there are several other relevant (but substantially less popular)
services that are worth paying attention to if you have some great videos: 
• Vimeo
220 
| 
Chapter 12: Social Search Engine Optimization

• Dailymotion
• Metacafe
• blip.tv
Instagram accepts videos as well, though they are time-limited to 15 seconds. You can
also share videos through Pinterest. Twitter has its own 6.5-second looping, mobile
video app called Vine that we’ve mentioned in previous chapters.
Facebook Graph Search takes tags into account, so whenever you link a video (or an
image) on Facebook, make sure you tag it with your keywords. Also tag your own page
in all of your photos and videos; this also impacts Graph Search.
Optimizing for YouTube Search
A YouTube analytics tool called Voot is a must-have for marketing on YouTube. It tracks
your videos’ YouTube search rankings as well as various engagement metrics like views,
favorites, likes, and comments. Management icon Peter Drucker once said, “What gets
measured gets managed,” so put your analytics in place as soon as possible.
YouTube Insight is also helpful for monitoring popularity metrics, but only for your
own videos. You can also glean some insight into your competitors’ videos simply by
clicking on the graph icon next to the number of views—if the posters weren’t savvy
enough to turn that off. (Obviously you should turn this off on your own videos to keep
it away from competitors’ prying eyes.)
When you upload a video to YouTube, optimize the title, description, and tags (key‐
words). These all make a big difference when it comes to its ranking in YouTube—and
for which keywords. Don’t be too broad or too esoteric. Use YouTube’s suggestion feature
(autocomplete), Google Trends, and the YouTube Keyword Tool for keyword brain‐
storming. Google Trends has a great YouTube keyword research feature accessible by
selecting the option “YouTube Search” instead of “Web Search”. The title is one of the
biggest factors in convincing a user to view the video, so give your videos keyword-rich
yet catchy titles. And remember that YouTube has a title tag display limit of 62 characters.
Don’t go beyond that, but use it to your advantage. Append your brand name to your
video titles in order to help build more prominence for that keyword in your channel.
Make copious use of tags on your videos, with all tags relevant to the content. Separate
each tag with a comma, use adjectives as well as category descriptors to make your videos
more visible to folks searching based on their mood, and don’t use throwaway words
like and or to.
Write unique descriptions that are optimized for SEO and differentiated from compet‐
itors. The words you use in the description of the video will make a big difference when
it comes to where it ranks in YouTube, and for which keywords. Remember to use the
words for which you are trying to rank. Don’t be too broad (e.g., “construction video”)
Optimizing for Social Search Engines

but don’t be too esoteric either. Make sure you add a URL before the descriptive text.
That way, even when the “More info” option is collapsed, the user will still see the link
and will be able to click it, provided you use a complete URL (including the http://).
In addition, make sure you have links back to your site so that people know where the
video came from and calls to action in annotations. Make sure that the page to which
the video links contains content that complements and enhances what the user experi‐
enced in the video so you are more likely to drive some links to your site as a result.
Make good use of thumbnails influence the searcher’s click decision. The thumbnail is
more important for clickthrough than the video ranking, so you want one that’s eye-
grabbing. Get in the habit of always creating a custom thumbnail where you’ve chosen
a frame that piques the searcher’s interest, ideally with graphics overlaid. If you are a
verified YouTube user (meaning you supplied a mobile number to which YouTube texted
a verification code), you can upload your own custom thumbnail (see Figure 12-9).
Figure 12-9. The Custom Thumbnail tab should be next to the video thumbnail options
in the upload page
Videos longer than three minutes run the risk of not being watched to the end. Videos
longer than five minutes are completed even less often. Whittle down your script until
it’s three minutes or less, if you want it to have a shot at going viral.
Allow users to view likes/dislikes on your videos. This encourages sharing and com‐
menting. YouTube also uses ratings when calculating search result rankings. This is also
a component to going viral, as lots of likes and views demonstrate “social proof.”
222 
| 
Chapter 12: Social Search Engine Optimization

Offer the option to embed your videos in other people’s sites. This really encourages
people to spread your video around, and makes it easier to share on Facebook and other
social media sites.
Include a URL to your site or social media page within the video’s description. YouTube
will automatically make it clickable. The link will not help your search engine rankings
because it’s nofollowed, but you will get direct clickthrough traffic from it, and hopefully
mentions in blogs and mainstream media.
Posting links via Twitter and Facebook, and embedding videos in blogs, can help with
getting them indexed and ranking more rapidly.
Finally, annotate your videos with calls to action such as “Like this video,” “Watch next
video,” and “Subscribe to our channel.” It’ll help drive engagement and, hopefully, gen‐
erate more incoming links to your video.
Real-Life Q&A: The Searchers
Q: Should I promote my social media channels on my ecommerce site?
A: If it’ll help drive sales, sure. Keep in mind, though, that social media is mostly for
marketing—that is, for getting people to become aware of your brand and products.
The destination is your ecommerce site, so the endgame is to get someone from a social
network to your site and then to make the sale. It doesn’t make much sense to send her
back to social media once she’s where you want her to be.
Having said that, in some cases it might make sense. If it’s a tough sell, like if you are
selling something that is expensive and a lot of visitors are interested but unsure about
spending that amount of money, then it might make sense to embed a YouTube video
showing a success story or a demo, or customer testimonials on Facebook.
Summary
Search is still the most complex and quickly adapting part of the technology that drives
the Internet. There really are only four ways for people to get to your site: with a direct
link from someone, with a shared post on a social network, with an ad that introduces
it to them, and through a search engine. Social media has strong influence on all of those
paths.
Search engines are always watching, so use your keywords everywhere you can, fill out
all of your account information on every site, make sure your pages and sites are publicly
accessible, and encourage sharing as much as possible. Links are still the most powerful
factor in search results.

CHAPTER 13
Influencer Outreach
You can’t do social media alone. We’ve well-established the fact that you need to engage
with your customers and followers. There’s another kind of audience to reach, though
—one that can provide a huge advantage: influencers. In SEO, they are referred to as
the linkerati. The linkerati are social media mavens who command gigantic audiences
and determine the virality of other people’s content. If these people link to your site,
you’re going to get a lot of attention from humans and search engines alike. So you’re
going to want as many influencers to say as many nice things in as many places as possible
as often as possible. Not only does this lead to more sales, it also increases your social
media following and improves your SEO.
Back in Chapter 2 we described content marketing—an article or video that is designed
to be popular and spread through social media like an aggressive virus through a willing
host. You can create the best content piece in the world, but it won’t go far on social
media unless an influencer takes an interest in it.
Not only does social media provide another venue for searching, it also serves as an
invaluable tool for acquiring links. Specifically, social media provides a venue to virally
spread your content piece. One good article can put you at the top of Google search
results, saving you a ton of money in PPC ad costs.
Of the three pillars of SEO—content, architecture, and links—it’s the links pillar that’s
usually the weakest. Looking at sites individually, formulating your approach, sending
personalized emails, picking up the phone to speak to webmasters—it’s a hard slog. Yet
without high-quality, relevant links, you won’t be able to earn the trust, authority, and
importance required to rank, and your optimization efforts will fall short.
Content marketing by itself isn’t sufficient. You need to seed this content piece into social
media and social news sites such as reddit and StumbleUpon, using power user accounts
within those communities. In other words, you need to be (or be in good with) a social
media insider who has wide-reaching influence within that site’s social community.
225

Without a bevy of friends, followers, and fans, it’s much harder to reach critical mass
quickly enough. That’s because the algorithms that determine what’s new and hot within
social news/bookmarking sites take into account the timespan within which the positive
votes are acquired: 50 reddit upvotes in 10 minutes is entirely different than 50 upvotes
over the course of a year.
The secret formula really is a formula. Think of it as an assembly-line process: viral ideas
are generated, the chosen ideas are researched and written up as articles (or produced
as videos), and then they are published to your website or social network page. Next,
the articles are seeded into appropriate social sites by influencers within those sites’
communities. The point is to reach the journalists or bloggers who will write about and
link to your viral content.
Social news power users spend day and night monitoring various oddball news RSS
feeds and other social sites for content. Once they find something, they quickly submit
the URL along with a killer title and description before anyone else. This is how users
move up in the pecking order within these social sites. The more stories they can get to
the front page, the higher their status. If you’re not a power user, you’re nobody; your
submissions have a very low probability of making the front page. On the other end of
the spectrum, nearly everything that a top-ranked user touches turns to gold; it’s not
atypical for the majority of a top user’s submissions to hit the site’s home page.
Before you continue reading up on influencer outreach strategy, you must understand
that this is a process that can succeed only if you already have an established following.
You must have a social media presence, you must understand your marketing strategy,
and you must have a decent-size audience. Without a solid social media foundation, it’s
going to be very hard to get the attention of major influencers.
We wish we could say, “this is a quick and easy process,” but it isn’t. It’s going to take
weeks or months to reach powerful influencers, but it’ll be well worth the effort.
Nearly everything in this chapter is part or all of a process that journalists use to contact
sources for news articles. Nothing here is underhanded or even particularly secret.
Build an Initial List
If you’re active in social media, or if you are socially active in your industry, you should
already have a good idea of who the big names are—the people who speak at conferences,
the people with huge Twitter followings, the people who everyone circles on Google+.
Start making a list of influencers, and use the names you already know as initial items.
Maybe you’re just getting started in social media, or you’re running a local business and
don’t go to a lot of conferences. In this case, you’re going to have to identify influencers
and begin following and interacting with them through social media. For instance, if
you own a restaurant, follow all of the Food Network personalities like Rachael Ray and
226 
| 
Chapter 13: Influencer Outreach

Bobby Flay, and other celebrity chefs and related public personalities like Martha Stew‐
art.
Fiction book list building can be difficult at first. If you’re writing a science fiction novel,
you could follow other science fiction authors, editors, agents, and publishers that pub‐
lish science fiction. It would also be useful, though, to find news sources that report on
topics like science, space exploration, medicine, and other topics that could be related
to what you’re writing about.
It’s going to take several hours over the course of a few weeks to build a solid list. And
by list, we mean the people you’re following/friending/circling. Every major social net‐
work has a way of showing who you’re connected to from your side; that’s your list. Or,
rather, over several networks there are several lists, but we refer to them as a single entity
here for the sake of simplicity.
This list is going to be broad; it’s going to cover an appropriately wide range of topics
and people. At this point, don’t pare down the list at all—make it bigger. Expand out as
much as possible. Follow anyone and anything that might be related.
You should also expand out beyond social media a little. If you identify some extremely
high-value influencers, subscribe to their blogs, RSS feeds, newsletters, and podcasts.
You are not doing this so much to learn from these people (though there’s almost cer‐
tainly something to learn from them, no matter how much of a guru you are) as you are
to get to know them better. Only after you know them are you prepared to interact with
them positively.
Begin Interacting
As just mentioned, once you get to know some of the people you’re following, you can
begin interacting with them. If they ask a question, send them @ replies. If they post a
link to something, comment on it. Retweet or reshare their posts. On Facebook or
Google+, post thoughtful comments or links to stories with more information. Repin,
tweet (with an @ mention), and comment on their Pinterest photos.
Don’t ask them to link to you or repost your content at this point. Later on, you’re going
to contact these people directly and ask them to help share your content or write a review,
but you’re likely to fail if you make your request too early. You will have a much higher
success rate if you’re already somewhat familiar to them through social media. The
whole point of this process up until now is not strictly “greater influence with the in‐
fluencers,” though that is one of the goals. The point is also to raise your own profile
and build your own audience to the point that you are no longer a nobody on social
media; you become a budding influencer yourself, which has the added benefit of mak‐
ing it easier to reach your customers and prospects.
Begin Interacting

227

Refine the List
By this point, you should either have a solid following, or you should be steadily building
it and your target number should be in sight. While you’re engaging your followers,
begin to whittle down your initial list of influencers by using reliable metrics. How
popular are their blogs and other domains? How much reach do they have beyond their
social media followers and fans?
Instead of answering that question on your own, you may want to use a tool like Kred
(kred.com), shown in Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1. Kred shows you the most powerful influencers among those you’re follow‐
ing on social media
Also useful is Klout (klout.com), which creates a composite Klout Score that shows your
own influence (the more influential you are, the better your chances of getting the
attention of a more powerful influencer), shown in Figure 13-2.

Chapter 13: Influencer Outreach

Figure 13-2. Klout shows you your overall influence across many social networks
Some other tools that you may find valuable for the purpose of gauging blogger’s au‐
thority based on their proprietary metrics (which we have noted):
Open Site Explorer
Measures mozRank and mozTrust
MajesticSEO
Measures TrustFlow and CitationFlow
LinkResearchTools
Measures Power*Trust
Followerwonk
Measure influence
All of these tools have their own algorithms to measure importance/authority/trust.
Depending on your industry, product, and/or content, any of these tools may be more
valuable than the others. It’s important to note that Open Site Explorer, MajesticSEO,
and LinkResearchTools analyze websites and web pages, not individuals.
Ultimately, though, this is not a numbers game; it’s a quality game. If someone were to
theoretically only have a dozen followers, but everything he posts goes massively viral,
Refine the List 
| 
229

then despite the numbers he is a highly valuable influencer. That would be an unusual
situation, but it’s possible. There are some people who are on only one or two major
social networks, such as YouTube or Google+; these people can be deceptively
influential.
It’s also not a numbers game in terms of how many influencers you must contact. Half
a dozen really influential bloggers are more powerful than a thousand small-time
bloggers.
Contact the Influencers
Cold calls are always difficult, even when they’re emails. You want something, and you’re
contacting someone who is in a position of power and asking her to give it to you. This
is not a role that anyone enjoys being in, but the most successful salespeople and mar‐
keters put that aside and master the art of initial contact. Think about how much you
want social media success (or the business success that is on the other side of social
media success). What are you willing to do to achieve that?
All you need to do initially is get your foot in the door with one good, solid influential
mention on social media. Then you’ll use that first big mention to get the attention of
other influencers. Even among the top people on social media, everyone wants to be in
with the cool kids. That first mention becomes the best method of obtaining mentions
from others, so invest big in your first major influencer outreach effort. From that point
forward, it gets easier.
Before you start sending emails, give serious thought to where you want to claim to be
mentioned. On Twitter? On a famous blog? On Facebook? The social network or site
where you want to be mentioned will help you narrow down your choices and customize
your outreach message.
Pinterest Group Boards
If you are an active and established Pinterest user, you can use group boards to your
advantage in contacting and participating with Pinterest influencers.
You can invite a mutual Pinterest follower (someone whom you follow, who also follows
you) to be a contributor to one of your boards. This creates a group board. You will
always be the administrator of that board, but you can add as many mutual followers
as you like. By the same logic, one of your mutual followers can invite you to pin to one
of his group boards.
If you can find a way to get a Pinterest power user to participate in one of your group
boards, you could inherit a lot of his followers as a result. Similarly, participating in the
same group board as an influencer gives you much more trusted and intimate access to
him, and a much higher chance of getting a review, repin, or mention from him.

Why bother with a cold call when you can get more success with a warmup? Even if
you’re not targeting Twitter, if the influencer you’re going after is active there, you’ve
got to engage her there. High-value targets are almost certain to ignore a cold email,
and will require a warmup on Twitter. If you make this effort to engage her with mean‐
ingful comments and retweets, it’ll help her become more comfortable and familiar with
you.
Tweet @ people. When the influencers you’re watching say something that you can
respond intelligently to, reply to them positively. Answer their questions. You can also
thank people publicly for recommending something.
Watch their Twitter feed for a while so that you can be sure that they really are as
wonderful and interesting as you think they are, and that you like what they’re saying.
You may discover that while someone seems to be influential, she mostly posts negative
things about companies and products; that outreach effort could be a disaster for you.
Don’t hide behind a brand account; use your full name (your personal account). Or, if
you intend to have more than one person represent you on Twitter, you might create a
public persona who virtually represents your company. This name will be your public
face, and will get all the credit for your posts. It’s not a good idea for an employee (or
even a partner or cofounder) to use a personal account for Twitter outreach because if/
when that person leaves your company, he’ll take all of his Twitter followers with him
and probably delete all of his tweets. All of the work that you’ve done to build up your
outreach engine will be destroyed, or at least at the mercy of someone else. If you’re
going to create a persona, make it a woman; women (or female names, at least) have a
much higher response rate in outreach email.
The Twitter warmup is not a one-time event; it is an ongoing effort that will take weeks
to complete.
After you’ve successfully warmed up your target, you can ask for a link to your site or
page via Twitter, but contacting her by private email is better.
Getting Contact Information
Certainly, if you can get someone’s phone number and you’re fairly certain he’d be
receptive to a quick phone conversation, then give him a call and follow up at an ap‐
propriate time with an email.
Some people are more inclined to respond on-network (a message sent on the social
network they participate in), and some are more receptive to email. Usually, email is
better because it’s more personal and is more easily noticed. Some influencers are so
popular that they don’t check their in-network messages at all—they get inundated with

notifications and frequent messages from raving fans—but they almost certainly do
check their email.
Getting someone’s email address can be tough and time-consuming. If you find yourself
spending an unreasonable amount of effort trying to get the email address of someone
who has taken great pains to hide it from the public, then fall back to tweeting @ him
on Twitter.
First, try looking on the influencer’s blog or corporate site for an email address. Maybe
it’s in an obvious spot.
Do you have his business card from an in-person meeting at a conference or event?
People usually put their email address on their business card.
Does his blog or corporate site have a Contact Us page? That goes to someone’s email
—if not your target influencer, then probably his assistant.
If you add someone on LinkedIn, you can get his email from there. The reply to the
invitation comes from his email address. You can also send InMail.
As a last resort, do a whois lookup on the influencer’s blog domain name (assuming it
is a real domain name and not a subdomain on a public blogging site like Typepad,
WordPress, Tumblr, or Blogger). Every domain has contact information for the domain
owner; hopefully that will include the email address of the person you’re trying to reach.
Paying for Reviews?
If you are trying to reach a product reviewer, be warned: some high-level reviewers may
ask you for money in exchange for a review. Among journalists this is highly unethical,
but bloggers and social media power users don’t always fall into the “journalism” cate‐
gory. In the United States, anyone who posts a product review, whether she considers
herself a professional reviewer or not, must disclose the fact that she received compen‐
sation (including a free product) for it. This is an FTC regulation; you can read about
it at the FTC website.
The FTC puts the responsibility for disclosure on the brand, not the publisher. That
means you. So if you send a check with your review materials, or if you tell a blogger or
journalist to go ahead and keep the review unit you’re sending, you must check back
and make sure that she has clearly printed an appropriate disclosure notice. This even
applies to endorsements on Twitter.

Chapter 13: Influencer Outreach

The preceding paragraphs contain really important legal liability
information about product reviews. Don’t skip this stuff. Read it
twice. We don’t want you to get in trouble with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission.
Also, the following paragraphs contain really important informa‐
tion about following rules set by the world’s largest search engine. It
would be very bad if it decided to blacklist you, so please don’t skip
what’s written next either.
Paying for reviews, or giving free products to reviewers or influencers, is an ethical grey
area at best. Usually it’s all right with disclosure if it’s posted to someone’s blog or social
media page, but it could reflect badly on you depending on context. In some instances
it is definitely unethical—for instance, book reviews or any product review on Ama‐
zon.com that is done on a for-hire basis is against Amazon’s rules. Google also frowns
upon paid links, so if you are paying a blogger for a review that includes a link back to
your site or product page, that is technically in violation of Google’s rules unless the
nofollow attribute is applied to the link in the HTML.
Some social media power users offer expanded services for hire. For instance, a popular
Pinterest user might solicit money to do a photo shoot with an in-depth review or
interview. Food bloggers might offer to publish a recipe and high-quality photos and a
review of the resulting product. This is not prohibited by Pinterest, but if you take this
route, make sure any links are nofollowed and proper disclosure is printed.
Creating Templates
First, you need good unique content. A lot of social media gurus will tell you that you
should try to build followers by linking to interesting stories. That will get you a small
amount of success. If you want major success, though, you’ve got to be the source of
interesting information, not just someone who links to it first.
Start with a pool of unpublished articles that can be customized somewhat. They should
be mostly or completely written, but don’t tell anyone about that. The point of your
influencer outreach email is to ask for help or input on an article you’re currently writing.
You will, of course, quote or cite the influencer as a source. Quoting experts for articles
is the best way to get them to link to you or mention you on social media.
The article you’re customizing should be relevant to a topic that the influencer covers
or is interested in. Don’t publish it more than once; don’t try to repurpose a published
article unless it is more than three years old and can be rearranged and re-edited to be
modern and relevant.

Don’t mass-mail your target influencers. Personalization is hugely important. The mes‐
sage must be personalized. Absolutely do not send a generic message that starts with
something like “Hello, fellow blogger.”
Not only are impersonal messages likely to be ignored, they’re also likely to be caught
in a spam filter. The same message sent to many addresses on the same network (such
as Gmail or Yahoo Mail) can be flagged as spam by the system. Not only will you have
completely wasted your time, you’ll also have associated your email address with spam.
Your whole domain could get blocked.
This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have a standard message template that you start
with. It does mean that the template must be customized significantly. To do that, read
the influencer’s blog and social profiles; write as if you are familiar with him. Since you’ve
been following him and attempting to engage publicly with him for a while, most of this
work should be done.
The template should not be long—fewer than 300 words or so. Busy people don’t have
time to read long messages from strangers.
Initial outreach
Make the influencer understand that you took the time to read his work; express genuine
interest in him. Mention something he did in the subject line: “Just saw your <title of
last blog post>”—that will get him to open the email. You can also try mentioning his
name in the subject line, or using an actionable phrase like “Need your decision,” “Need
your feedback,” “Can I quote you for this article?”, or “One minute to read this upcoming
article?”
For the message body, don’t talk about yourself or your background too much. When
you talk about yourself to a busy stranger, that’s boring and skippable. Establish yourself
in one sentence. If you referenced something he did recently, follow up that reference
in the message body. Or talk about something else he’s done recently and how it affected
you. Talk more about him than yourself.
If you’re writing to someone who consistently uses an online handle or persona, then
go ahead and address him by his blog handle or persona first. If there’s no response to
the first outreach, make note of that and use his real name in the follow-up email. Most
people use their real names today, but in the old days handles were more popular. People
want the credit; they want to be more transparent about who they are.
Close with a request for a reply. You want to encourage more dialogue. Don’t ask for
more than that, though—never ask directly for something of value in an outreach email,
such as a link or a review. Compliment or comment; ask a question or ask for advice,
and ask for a reply or feedback; establish friendly contact; and then work from there.
The time at which you send your message can make a big difference. Each industry has
different prime days and times. Look at the posting schedule if you can, and try to figure
234 
| 
Chapter 13: Influencer Outreach

out the editorial calendar as well (if it’s a big blog, the blogger probably plans out certain
themes for content on certain days or during certain months). If it’s a tech blog and you
know that the blogger publishes three stories a week, try to get him the day before a
story publishes (or the day after), but not on the day. Most of the responses you’re going
to get are early or late, when people check email. Very busy people typically check email
on a schedule.
Many spammers send their email late at night, so try to be off-schedule from that. Send
your email during the day in the afternoon to avoid the spam rush, but before the last
email check of the workday in your influencer’s time zone.
Follow-up
If you haven’t heard back from your first outreach within three days, then you should
send a follow-up. Following up is more crucial than many people realize. Michael Gen‐
eles, cofounder of outreach tool Pitchbox, asserts that following up increases your re‐
sponse rate by 60%. You should have a separate template for follow-up emails; don’t
send the same message you sent before.
It rarely pays to go beyond two follow-ups—don’t send more than three emails to some‐
one who isn’t responding to you. If someone doesn’t reply after the third attempt, there
is a very low chance of a reply, and you’re better off spending that effort on the next
influencer on your list.
Before sending your first follow-ups, get reinvolved on Twitter to make sure you’ve got
a solid connection.
Third attempt
If your first two emails didn’t get responses, then the third probably isn’t going to work,
either. You’re going to have to take a different approach with your third attempt. Is there
a different email address for this influencer? Some people list a Gmail account as a
technical contact or as part of a regular Google account, but they rarely check it. Look
for an alternate email address for this person, and explain that you’re trying to get in
touch and wondering if you’ve got the right address.
You can also try to use in-network messaging through Facebook, LinkedIn, or other
social networks in which this influencer participates. If you do this, come up with com‐
pletely different content for your email; mention that you’ve tried to reach out and
haven’t gotten through, note that you love his work and want his advice on something,
and ask for a reply.

Tracking Responses
The only way to improve is to measure. Keep metrics on what gets through and what
doesn’t. If a particular template or a particular kind of influencer is not working out,
then change your strategy.
Was the response favorable? Was there a response at all? How often does the first follow-
up work? The second? You may want to make a quick spreadsheet to keep track of this
data.
Automating Outreach
Many of the techniques previously mentioned can be automated, or at least partially
automated, to help save you time. As noted, it’s never wise to fully automate your out‐
reach, especially where you are reaching out to top influencers. There are, however,
tools, systems, and techniques you can use to at least partially automate the outreach,
responses, and tracking involved in reaching out to influencers, such as Pitchbox. A
number of advanced techniques for outreach automation are laid out in an article by
one of our authors, Stephan Spencer, called “Scaling & Systematizing Your Link Build‐
ing”. While the article speaks specifically to building links, the techniques are equally
applicable to reaching out to influencers in the social media world. As the final sentence
of that article states: “Of course no tool, no matter how awesome, will ever eliminate the
need for creativity in the creation of viral content, but with some systems and workflow
in place, you will be able to achieve scale with your outreach in ways you never thought
possible.”
Offering Giveaways
If you’re selling a product or service and hope to get a review from an influencer, you
should consider arranging a giveaway as part of that effort. Regular product reviews are
helpful, but in the grand scheme of things they aren’t usually a major influence on sales.
One thing you can do to easily enhance the impact of a product review is to add a
giveaway. Not only does this encourage engagement with and sharing of the review, it
also helps your influencer look good because she’s enabling her readers/followers to get
free stuff.
There are many ways to offer giveaways—social media apps, websites, desktop software
programs, and the capabilities built into sites like Goodreads and LibraryThing. One
site that we find particularly effective across multiple media and sites is Rafflecopter.
Configure a giveaway that will launch with the review, and pitch it to your target influ‐
encers as an exclusive extra bonus that you’re offering for their readers. You can create
a different giveaway campaign for each influencer, if necessary. Don’t forget to ask for
reviews and social media mentions from all of the giveaway winners!

Using Other Approaches
If you totally strike out despite your best efforts, then try a more indirect approach. Try
to get through to the people who your target influencer follows. These are her friends
and close colleagues, and people she admires. Likewise, if you do manage to get a positive
reply, ask the influencer who else she knows who could contribute to the article or
provide a quote. Oftentimes you’ll get names, phone numbers, and email addresses of
other influencers—and with a personal referral!
Nothing establishes initial contact like actual in-person communication. Go to industry
conferences and meet your influencers in person. Have coffee with them. If they are not
accessible in person, then build relationships with their friends; they will become your
references. Take a long-term strategy. Or play golf with them—or whatever social ac‐
tivity is appropriate to the industry.
Watch for Mentions and Links
If you were successful in getting a positive response, then keep a close eye on the net‐
works that you’re targeting. Watch for links and mentions that involve you or your
company. This might not happen immediately. Often an article costs you a lot of money
or time, so don’t wait too long to see if it gets published or mentioned. If you get an
agreement, follow up after a week and see if there’s anything else you need to provide.
If you don’t get a publication date, ask nicely for one.
Twitter is the hub for monitoring what’s new on the Internet, so that should be your
place to watch for mentions. It may not come in the form of a hashtag or an @, so watch
your target influencer’s feed closely. Social media monitoring will be infinitely easier if
you use one of the many social listening tools out there, such as Trackur or Radian6.
Tread Carefully on reddit
reddit seems like a gold mine for outreach because whatever becomes popular there will
be popular everywhere else. All you need is upvotes, and you’ve got it made, right?
Wrong. While it may be OK to solicit follows and friend requests on other sites, soliciting
upvotes on reddit is a good way to get yourself downvoted, attacked, and blacklisted.
reddit is quirky and aggressive. Outreach to influencers on reddit (moderators, top
posters, top commenters, people with a lot of karma points) will likely prove more
harmful than valuable. Anyone soliciting reddit interaction via upvotes or submissions
is almost always seen as a spammer, and treated harshly.
Every once in a while, a reddit influencer (typically a moderator of a significant sub‐
reddit) is publicly exposed (and humiliated) as being corrupt or as a shill for some site
or company. As a result, it’s difficult to appeal to reddit influencers without looking like
a selfish spammer. There is no reliable strategy for influencing reddit moderators or

power users. All you can and should do on reddit is try to participate normally and
submit your viral content along with a lot of other people’s great content to the correct
subreddits without the appearance of self-promotion.
Establish Yourself on Google+
Google+ can be a good platform for outreach, but it requires a lot of work. While it is
growing rapidly, it’s still tech-heavy. So if you’re doing outreach for clothing, it could
possibly be worth it to get established there and connected to influencers in that industry
who are there, but right now that effort will probably be better spent on Facebook or
Twitter.
However, Google is forcing Google Account logins for everything it does now, so you’re
probably already using Google+ without knowing it. It’s worth it to set up a presence
there and circle your influencers. If they seem to be in a ton of circles and have a lot of
engagement, then give it a shot and track your progress.
Case Study: Influencing the Influencers
A prominent etailer who wishes to remain nameless wanted to generate critical mass
for a content marketing campaign. The company sells premier designer swimwear
brands and styles, many of which have been featured on celebrities and in leading fashion
magazines. Since the company’s launch in 2000, it has established itself as the go-to place
for fashion-forward swimwear.
It was successful enough that it reached the limits of what traditional ecommerce tech‐
niques, such as email campaigns and banner ads, could provide. At the same time, the
influence of traditional media was declining and consumers increasingly began to rely
on social media for information and trustworthy recommendations. The company de‐
cided that social media was a must-have marketing channel, for several reasons:
• Increasingly, it’s where consumers were going to find out what’s new and what to
buy.
• Content on social media sites could help build credibility and loyalty. People choose
which brands they want to follow, and trust the brands they choose.
• Relationships with authoritative brands would drive traffic to the company’s own
website, boost its domain authority, and improve its search engine rankings.
• Exposure via social media could help offset shrinking publicity opportunities in
traditional media. With declines in advertising revenues, the company was finding
fewer traditional media outlets and the outlets that remained had less editorial space
than before. And with fewer opportunities, the competition for placements had
intensified.

Chapter 13: Influencer Outreach

The Initial Content Marketing Strategy
The company’s social media strategy was to offer high-quality content to influential
bloggers and independent media outlets. It quickly realized that traditional marketing/
public relations techniques were entirely unsuited to this new channel, which left it with
no established tools to use or methodology to follow.
The world of independent media is a classic long-tail market; instead of a few key in‐
fluencers with wide reach, it contains vast numbers of outlets. There are a handful with
huge audiences, and many more with fewer but highly loyal followers. Because this world
is fundamentally based on social relationships, the company couldn’t simply blast out
one-size-fits-all content to everyone. It had to cultivate relationships and develop trust
with influencers, and create content that was unique and tailored to each opportunity.
The company started with a seat-of-the-pants approach: come up with content ideas,
Google search to find some blogs that look good, poke around on the sites to find contact
info, send emails pitching the ideas, and see what came back.
That approach seemed to work at first, but once the company tried to scale up past the
first 15 or 20 opportunities, the process quickly became impossible to manage. Hundreds
of responses to its outreach were coming in, often days or weeks after the initial email
had been sent, and many arrived from email addresses different from the one the com‐
pany had originally sent the message to. When it ran new searches to identify more
placement opportunities, the problems compounded; someone had to check these leads
against ones already in the pipeline to be sure they didn’t overlap. With all of these
administrative challenges, the campaign wasn’t scalable. It wasn’t a question of how
many opportunities were out there, it was a question of how many opportunities the
company could manage. It was putting in more and more effort, and costs were rising,
but results weren’t following.
Cutting back wasn’t an option because independent media campaigns must reach critical
mass to be successful. A mention here or there doesn’t create momentum. The buzz
starts when consumers—and influencers—start seeing your name pop up everywhere.
Stopgap Measures
Next, the company tried setting up Excel spreadsheets that contained lists of contacts
and related information, such as the initial and last contact date for each. Even with this
higher level of organization, it still took a lot of time to manage these spreadsheets—
time that would have been better spent cultivating relationships, pitching ideas, and
creating content. As time went on, the pipeline began to clog. Opportunities stalled, and
in each case the company had to go back and figure out why. Was the ball in the com‐
pany’s court, or the influencer’s? Did the contact owe the company feedback? Had the
contact gone dark and nobody had noticed? Soon, the company found itself creating
more spreadsheets and other ad hoc systems to try to keep up with these issues.
A CRM (customer relationship management) system seemed like the next reasonable
step. The company looked at several, but the logic and the language were a poor fit
because CRMs are set up for sales, not for media outreach. For example, most are built
Establish Yourself on Google+

239

around deals—how much a sale is worth, how far along it is, who the decision makers
are, and so on. That logic doesn’t work for a media campaign. Similarly, CRMs didn’t
have metrics for social media, such as Klout scores or domain authority, or a good way
to track and report results.
Automating the Outreach Campaign
In 2013, the company became a beta tester for a new prospecting and relationship-
building platform, Pitchbox, that automated most of these administrative tasks
(Figure 13-3). What appealed to the company was that Pitchbox wasn’t just a repurposed
CRM. It was built specifically around the tasks involved in social media outreach. For
example, it starts with a search function that looks for new opportunities on a scheduled
basis, and then strips out contacts that are already in the pipeline. It ranks the oppor‐
tunities by influence—using criteria that the user can define—which helps the company
prioritize its efforts. It automatically identifies contact info and allows the company to
reach out individually (for the most important contacts) or using templates to scale.
Then it follows each opportunity through the entire pipeline—from initial contact
through placement. Along the way, it flags stalled opportunities, shows where the cam‐
paign stands overall, and guides the user to the next step.
The automation of these administrative tasks revolutionized the company’s outreach
efforts. Using the same resources as before, the company saw placements go from
approximately 10 per month to 50 per month. Administrative tasks were no longer
throttling the campaign, and the amount of time spent on these tasks declined from
approximately 75% of total hours to 15%. That freed up time for staff to spend on high-
value activities: cultivating relationships, coming up with ideas, and creating content.
In addition, the retailer was better able to forecast results, allocate resources, and hit
goals. For example, it can look ahead and see how many placement opportunities it is
likely to have in upcoming months, so it can allocate resources to create the content
needed to fulfill those opportunities. Or if the company sees that it needs more oppor‐
tunities in the pipeline to meet its goals, it can deploy more resources toward outreach
instead of content creation.

Achieving Critical Mass
Automation is critical to any long-tail business because long-tail markets have too many
events happening to manage individually. The same principle holds for social media
campaigns. They need to scale—reaching hundreds or thousands of influencers in a
highly fragmented market—in order to reach critical mass. And to be scalable, they need
tools and techniques to help manage these events. Enter, Pitchbox.
Real-Life Q&A: Reach Out and Touch Someone
Q: This whole thing makes me nervous. I’m nobody. The person I need to contact is
somebody. Why would he reply to me? Is this even worth my while?
A: Become somebody first by building up your own social media presence; that makes
you somebody. Before starting outreach, you must be established. The more followers
you have, the better your response rate will (probably) be.

Old or infrequent content can be a problem for someone investigating your social media
worth. You may need to remove dates from old articles on your blog, or backdate them
to show a longer history of established content. If you’re trying to bring attention to
your blog, then you’re going to need to host it on your own domain name (not as a
subdomain of WordPress.com or blogspot.com). You don’t want to look cheap and am‐
ateurish.
Q: What happens if I don’t get a response? How many times should I contact someone
without being a pest?
A: Three is the outside figure, over a period of a week or two. People are busy, especially
entrepreneurs.
Q: How do I make my list?
A: Search for your keywords on social networks and see who’s most active for those
terms or hashtags. There are some people who write about different stuff each week,
and some people who specialize in one topic. You can do a Twitter hashtag search or a
Facebook page search. Twitter searches are good because you can search by keywords
(not just hashtags) on people’s profiles. You can also try LinkedIn, especially for anything
related to B2B. Look for people who are speaking at conferences in your market.
For Google Blog Search, you won’t want to use search terms like “fashion blogger” or
“fashion blog”—look for the subject “fashion,” or something more targeted, like “winter
fashion,” and then find bloggers therein. For a Google web search, “fashion blogger” or
“fashion blog” are fine. Specific long-tail keywords are better than broad keywords.
When you’re writing your articles for outreach participation, focus your content on
issues and subjects that apply to these targeted bloggers. The bloggers who write about
broad topics are swamped by a lot of junk content, so it’s harder to get through to them.
Q: This is way too much work for me. Is there a way I can spend like an hour on this
instead of weeks or months?
A: There are firms that do this for you. There are also products that make the whole
process much easier and provide a single interface for everything. Pitchbox is a great
example of this chapter’s entire process folded into one web application.
Summary
If you’re just starting out in social media from a commercial perspective, it can feel a
lot like you’re at the foot of Mt. Everest with no guide or equipment. If you want to climb
that mountain, you have to be a positive contributor at base camp; you have to make
friends with the experienced guides and knowledgeable climbers; you have to pull apart
the term social network and be social and network with those above you in the hierarchy.
Influencers are people who spend a lot of time, personally and professionally, on social
networks. If you’re a successful entrepreneur, then you don’t have time to be an influ‐

CHAPTER 14
Affiliate Marketing and MLM
More than anything else, the key to making money off of affiliate and multilevel mar‐
keting (MLM) sites is by gaining social proof through social networks. In either case,
you’re a middleman, so you’ve got to show that you, above all the other middlemen, are
the most trustworthy and interesting.
In the past, an affiliate or MLM marketer would simply have to build a small website,
buy some ads targeting relevant keywords, and, if she could successfully optimize her
site, she could receive a decent amount of traffic and earn a decent amount of money.
Unless you were going door-to-door or in some other way leveraging your local com‐
munity, social proof was largely lacking. That was great for many affiliate marketers;
you could be a relative nobody, and because you were ranking highly for your keywords,
people would find you and potentially buy based on your recommendations.
That’s all changed. People now rely heavily on social media for product recommenda‐
tions, reviews, and social proof. This is not a limitation—it’s an opportunity. To succeed
long-term, you need to look at social media as a key part of your master plan, not simply
as a quick way to make sales.
Think about it. Would you be more likely to buy a product promoted by someone who
had 10 fans on Facebook, or 10,000? Would you rather buy from someone who spends
all his time spamming on Twitter, or someone who is constantly expanding his number
of followers by building authentic connections and dialogue?
The way you engage with people on social media, along with the number of people who
follow or like you, says a lot about you and your brand as an affiliate or MLM marketer.
Affiliate Marketing
Some merchants offer commissions for sales and/or leads that you deliver to them; this
is affiliate marketing. Credit for affiliate sales is typically given through a special tracking
245

code in the URL, or through a browser cookie that must be persistent in the visitor’s
browser from his visit on your site all the way through to the final checkout page on the
destination site. An example of a well-known affiliate program is Amazon Associates.
If you’re willing to really invest in your affiliate marketing efforts, social media is an
excellent tool for establishing credibility and increasing sales.
Start by building your reputation. Without a solid reputation, you’ll have a very difficult
time being successful at affiliate marketing. People want to buy from those they trust,
and trust isn’t built overnight.
Create valuable content that establishes you as an expert. Having a solid content mar‐
keting strategy is key, because nothing says “expert” like someone who is consistently
providing valuable content in the form of blog posts, ebooks, and whitepapers. Creating
high-quality content, and then sharing it via social networking sites like Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, is a surefire way to drive traffic to your site, build your
reputation, and in the long-term, drive conversions.
Create Themed Content
A large percentage of your content, whether it’s on a blog or social media, should be
about topics, not products.
Let’s say you’re promoting a weight-loss product. Rather than creating reams of content
about the product you’re promoting, offer unique, high-value information based on the
general theme of weight loss.
Within that strategy, you can most definitely include content about your affiliate prod‐
ucts, and promote it however you see fit. Just keep in mind that shamelessly promoting
a product to the exclusion of everything else (i.e., providing great content) will surely
damage your reputation and sales in the long term.
Disclose All Affiliate Links
Whether you’re promoting affiliate links on your website or social media, it’s always a
good idea to include a disclosure. Many affiliate marketers like to use a shortened URL
on Facebook and Twitter (particularly on Twitter due to space limitations), but in some
cases this can damage your reputation in the long term.
There’s nothing wrong with using a shortened URL. Sometimes it’s necessary, but be
aware that you may take some flak for it, especially if you don’t disclose the fact that you
are getting compensated. If you truly believe in the products you’re promoting, and are
willing to stand behind them, then this shouldn’t be a big deal.

Chapter 14: Affiliate Marketing and MLM

Multilevel Marketing
Multilevel marketing is similar to affiliate marketing, except you are directly selling
goods and services for a merchant. You are the middleman between a wholesale or
specialty manufacturer and an individual customer. Some examples of MLM companies
are Avon, Pampered Chef, Mary Kay, Amway, Scentsy, Thirty-One, WorldVentures, and
Cutco.
Most MLM or network marketing companies encourage you to write up a list of friends
and family members who might be interested—a warm market. But if you are not com‐
fortable doing that, or that list has already been fully explored, a Facebook presence may
be just the thing you need to get your business going.
First and foremost, you need to have a business Facebook page that is separate from
your personal account. There is a tendency for people to simply use their personal
account, but remember: this is a business. A Facebook page will give you a variety of
marketing and advertising tools.
Before we get into specifics, let’s talk about your overall Facebook strategy for this busi‐
ness model. Basically, you need to concentrate on relationship and credibility building.
You also have to be enjoyable to follow.
Choose Pictures Wisely
The first thing people will see on your Facebook page will be your profile picture. Many
business owners make the mistake of putting a picture of their product as the profile.
You’re smarter than that. You know that Facebook is a social experience and people will
want to connect with you, not a picture of your product, so make sure you have a great
profile picture of you smiling into the camera.
You will also want to use the photo album available on your business page. Use this to
post interesting photos (and most of them should have you in them).
Be Multidimensional
Show that you have more to offer than simply your product. Whatever field you are in,
strive to become a thought leader, and display your expertise on your Facebook page.
If you sell a product associated with cooking, post helpful tips, tricks, and recipes. Think
about this: Food Network star Rachael Ray didn’t have to strongly push her line of
cookware to her devoted followers. Her fans grew to like her and trust her over time,
and when she had a product to sell, they trusted her and went out to buy it.
If you are selling something for the home, offer weekly tips or tutorials on home dec‐
oration. Nutritional products? Offer the latest studies along with your thoughts or anal‐
ysis on the topic.
Multilevel Marketing 
| 
247

The more varied (but topical) information you post, the more you are setting yourself
up as an expert in your niche. Concentrate on becoming a thought leader first, and then
you will find natural ways to encourage sales of your products when the moment
presents itself.
Network
Become socially active on Facebook by using your business page. Commenting on other
pages and responding to comments left on your page will foster that sense of community.
Comments should be upbeat and valuable without any product pushing. As you con‐
sistently produce quality content, people will look to you as a leader or consultant, not
a salesperson. This is an important distinction.
Here’s what the Facebook business page specifics could look like for someone selling
makeup products:
Profile picture
This should be a photo of you smiling into the camera.
Album pictures
Your album should include a variety of pictures of you working with clients.
Videos
Provide a collection of how-to videos that take people step-by-step through com‐
mon product applications.
Posts
Your posts should be varied in content, but all pointing back to you being an expert.
If you see a great article related to your product, post it on your Timeline with an
extra tip or two. Make your posts interesting and conversational. Try to incorporate
a bit of your personality here because you want people to be able to relate to you.
Facebook Ads
This will be a little tricky, but worth your effort. Facebook is not known for liking
MLM or affiliate ads, but the more you offer valuable content on your Facebook
page, the greater your ad approval chances will be.
For an MLM business model to be effective of Facebook, you’ll want to strive to be
respected, trusted, and enjoyed by your fans and potential clients.

Chapter 14: Affiliate Marketing and MLM

Case Study: A Sneak Peek into a Super Affiliate’s Facebook Ads
Zac Johnson, “super affiliate” and long-time Internet marketing blogger at ZacJohn‐
son.com, loves the potential for easy profit in affiliate marketing. He has understood the
incredible value of social media and Facebook ads to create affiliate revenue since very
early on, and continues to benefit from his knowledge of multivariate testing and interest
targeting to optimize click-through and conversion rates for an impressive sales rate.
Typically, Johnson looks for offers that can be associated with an interest or hobby that
are likely to be liked on Facebook. He then uses those interests to target users with that
interest for the ad. Because he can target a concrete, directly-related interest, the po‐
tential for clickthrough becomes so much higher. In one case, Johnson found an eBook
and online course through ClickBank that teaches how to do skateboarding tricks that
seemed to be a winner. As an affiliate for the offer, he would earn 50% commission on
all referred sales, which comes out to $7.78 basically just for referring quality traffic to
their site.
For the skateboarding course offer, Johnson chose to target men age 25-35 who currently
live in the United States and are interested in “skateboarding” and/or “Tony Hawk”. The
end result targeted around 2 million current users on Facebook.
Figure 14-1. Johnson used demographics to feasibly scale the ad’s reach
He then set up the ad. The key was to make sure he was never paying more to get a click-
through than the profit margin of the campaign’s sales and commissions. The tactics he
had set up first worked, to a good extent. The click-through rate was fantastic, and it
was definitely making sales. However, Johnson was not yet turning a profit.

Figure 14-2. Johnson’s initial ad
Here’s where he finds the value of multivariate testing. If you have an ad that you believe
is not yet reaching its full potential, multivariate testing makes it easy to see the formula
that your ad campaign needs. Upon monitoring the clickthrough rates of several cam‐
paigns, one can generally gauge which one is most cost-effective and converting. Most
commonly, the higher the clickthrough rate on your ads, the lower the cost per click.
Figure 14-3. This shows the variation one can see through testing various ads. The
top ad has the highest clickthrough rate and lowest cost per click.

Chapter 14: Affiliate Marketing and MLM

Figure 14-4. Johnson’s updated ad after multivariate testing
One strategy Johnson found effective was to make the copy more personalized. Instead
of targeting “United States” in general, he started making separate campaigns for skate‐
board enthusiasts in a particular state or region, and then mentioning the specific state
in the copy. As a result, and after a few additional tweaks, he finally found a formula
that achieved profit.
Real-Life Q&A
Q: The competition in this space is huge. I get the feeling there are companies a lot bigger
than mine that are able to put a lot more time and money into this than I can. Are there
any secret weapons for smaller MLM sellers?
A: It depends on what you’re selling. If you’re with a huge MLM provider, then there’s
going to be a ton of tough competition. However, that in itself creates a new market that
you might be able to sell to. Surely, there are many things you’ve learned about MLM
success; you can sell these tips to people with less experience via webinars, training
courses, and other gated content.
This might not be the answer you’re looking for. However, if you’ve already exhausted
your ability to develop creative ads and social media pages, then it’s time to consider a
different approach. If you’re not selling to the long-tail of the MLM market, then perhaps
the solution is to look at emerging and niche social networks where there will be less
competition.
Q: I’ve been trying to test an affiliate offer with Clickbank using a redirect, but my ad
continues to get rejected. Are redirects not allowed?
A: It depends on the offer. Clickbank stuff can be tricky sometimes. We use redirected
traffic in client ads every day.

Summary
It can be tough to make a living solely off of affiliate or multilevel marketing. If that’s
your goal, though, you’ve got to be a social media hard-charger. Build an audience and
a following at all costs, and then slowly work your sales pitch into your regular routine.
We wish we could validate the promises that a lot of MLMs make about being inde‐
pendently wealthy by merely leveraging already established contacts, but it’s never as
simple as that. Like any business, you have to get out there and make it clear that you
are the person to buy from. Product quality is a baseline; personality and relationships
are what makes the sale in this realm.

Colophon
The animal on the cover of Social eCommerce is a greater adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius),
member of the stork family (Ciconiidae). The name adjutant comes from their stiff
military gait when walking.
The greater adjutant is huge—57 to 60 inches in height. With an average wingspan of
99 inches, these are the largest of living storks. They have a massive wedge-shaped bill,
which averages about 12.7 inches in length, bare head, and distinctive neck pouch.
The adjutant feeds mostly on carrion and offal, sometimes feeding on vertebrates when
the opportunity presents itself. They used to be found in large numbers in Asia, but
numbers have been declining to the point of being endangered. This is thought to be
due to improved sanitation. Drained wetlands, pollution, and disturbance has led to
loss of adjutant nesting and feeding habitat. This, paired with hunting and egg collection,
has caused massive declines in population. In 2008, the population was estimated at less
than 1,000. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the greater adjutant as en‐
dangered.
Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to
the world. To learn more about how you can help, go to animals.oreilly.com.
The cover image is from Cassell’s Natural History. The cover fonts are URW Typewriter
and Guardian Sans. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font is Adobe
Myriad Condensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.
