Lecture 18 
Repeated measures ANOVA

Two segments 
•  Repeated measures: Pros & Cons 
•  Repeated measures: Example

Repeated measures  
Pros & Cons 
3 
Repeated measures: Pros & 
cons 
•  Pros 
– Less cost (fewer subjects required) 
– More statistical power  
•  This is the important new concept

Repeated measures: Pros & 
cons 
•  More statistical power 
– Variance across subjects may be systematic 
– If so, it will not contribute to the error term 
Between groups design (SS)

Subjects(S) 
Unsystematic = 
(AxS) 
Error in a repeated measures design  
is the inconsistency of subjects 
from one condition to another 
Therefore:  
FA = MSA / MSAxS 
MS and F 
•  MSA = SSA / dfA 
•  MSAxS = SSAxS / dfAxS 
•  F = MSA / MSAxS 
Repeated measures: Pros & 
cons 
•  Cons 
– Order effects 
– Counterbalancing 
– Missing data 
– Extra assumption 
Counterbalancing 
•  Consider a simple design with just two 
conditions, A1 and A2 
•  One approach is a Blocked Design 
– Subjects are randomly assigned to one of 
two “order” conditions 
•  A1, A2 
•  A2, A1

Counterbalancing 
•  Another approach is a Randomized Design 
– Conditions are presented randomly in a 
mixed fashion  
•  A2, A1, A1, A2, A2, A1, A2….. 
Counterbalancing 
•  Now suppose a = 3 and a blocked design 
•  There are 6 possible orders (3!) 
•  A1, A2, A3 
•  A1, A3, A2 
•  A2, A1, A3 
•  A2, A3, A1 
•  A3, A1, A2 
•  A3, A2, A1 
Counterbalancing 
•  To completely counterbalance, subjects would be 
randomly assigned to one of 6 order conditions 
•  The number of conditions needed to completely 
counterbalance becomes large with more 
conditions 
–  4! = 24 
–  5! = 120 
Counterbalancing 
•  With many levels of the IV a better 
approach is to use a “Latin Squares” 
design 
•  Latin Squares designs aren’t completely 
counterbalanced but every condition 
appears at every position at least once

Counterbalancing 
•  For example, if a = 3, then 
– A1, A2, A3 
– A2, A3, A1 
– A3, A1, A2 
Missing data 
•  Two issues to consider 
– Relative amount of missing data 
– Pattern of missing data 
Missing data ~ Relative 
amount 
•  How much is a lot? 
– No hard and fast rules 
– A rule of thumb is 
•  Less than 10% on any one variable, OK 
•  Greater than 10%, not OK 
Missing data ~ Pattern? 
•  Is the pattern random or lawful? 
–  This can easily be detected 
–  For any variable of interest (X) create a new variable 
(XM) 
•  XM = 0 if X is missing 
•  XM = 1 if X is not missing 
–  Conduct a t-test with XM as the IV  
–  If significant then pattern of missing data may be lawful

Missing data ~ Remedies 
•  Drop all cases without a perfect profile 
– Drastic 
– Use only if you can afford it 
•  Keep all cases and estimate the values of the 
missing data points 
– There are several options for how to estimate 
values 
Sphericity assumption 
•  Homogeneity of variance 
•  Homogeneity of covariance 
Sphericity assumption 
•  How to test? 
– Mauchly’s test 
– If significant then report an adjusted p-value 
•  Greenhouse-Geisser 
•  Huyn-Feldt 
•  Pros 
– Less cost (fewer subjects required) 
– More statistical power  
•  This is the important new concept
