What is Docker?
An Introduction to Docker

What is Docker?
• Docker is a standard for Linux containers. 
• A “Container” is an isolated runtime inside of Linux. 
• A “Container” provides a private machine like space under Linux. 
• Containers will run under any modern Linux Kernel

Containers can:
• Have their own process space. 
• Their own network interface. 
• ‘Run’ processes as root (inside the container) 
• Have their own disk space. 
• (can share with host too)

A Container is not a VM!

Docker Terminology
• Docker Image - The representation of a Docker Container. Kind of 
like a JAR or WAR ﬁle in Java. 
• Docker Container - The standard runtime of Docker. Effectively a 
deployed and running Docker Image. Like a Spring Boot Executable 
JAR. 
• Docker Engine - The code which manages Docker stuff. Creates 
and runs Docker Containers.

Mul$plicity of Stacks

Do services and apps 
interact 
appropriately? 
Can I migrate 
smoothly and 
quickly? 

Cargo Transport Pre 1960
Mul$plicity of Goods 
Mul$pilicity of 
methods for 
transpor$ng/storing 
Do I worry about 
how goods interact 
(e.g. coﬀee beans 
next to spices) 
Can I transport quickly 
and smoothly 
(e.g. from boat to 
train to truck) 

Intermodal Shipping Container
Mul$plicity of Goods 
Mul$plicity of 
methods for 
transpor$ng/storing 
Can I transport 
quickly and smoothly 
(e.g. from boat to 
train to truck) 
…in between, can be loaded and 
unloaded, stacked, transported 
efficiently over long distances, 
and transferred from one mode 
of transport to another 
A standard container that is 
loaded with virtually any 
goods, and stays sealed until 
it reaches final delivery.
