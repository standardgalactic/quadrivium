This work had a long gestation period and is the culmination of a number of varying inputs from 
key individuals – in particular Professor Barbara Allan (Dean of the Business School of Westminster 
University), colleagues in the Business School of Hull University and my wife Christine Pownall who 
is far more knowledgeable than I on the application of learning theories in the classroom. I am also 
grateful to the international student input and comments received, that shaped the relevance of this 
work. We hope that you find this small text of value to you the international student or you the tutor of 
the International student, in planning and supporting the achievement of higher grades.

Introduction and Learning Context

Learning Context
TARGET READER – The international student and the tutor of the international student
This is a book for you.
This is a book written not just for international students who come to the UK and want to get a good 
grade. It is also aimed at tutors working with international students who want to help their international 
students to be successful. The aim of this book is to help international students to learn from the 
experiences of other students and tutors, as well as some underpinning theory. The authors have used 
their extensive experience of teaching in universities in the UK and also working overseas to inform this 
book. There are many study skills books that are available to students and this book does not follow the 
conventional pattern of these books. It is not a ‘how to’ book but rather a resource that you may use to 
learn from and reflect on your own experiences.
Being an international student studying in the UK is not easy. It is a difficult but we believe a very 
rewarding option you have chosen. There are many difficulties for you – the first and as we see in the book, 
perhaps most important of which – is language. For this core reason, although this book does contain 
some complex language, we have also sought to produce simple clear sections for your to reflect upon. 
Anyone who travels to a different country to study is brave, determined and aware that they will different 
challenges at their destination. These challenges include adapting to living in a new culture (shopping, 
travel, food and, of course, the weather), studying in a university or college where the approaches to 
learning, teaching and assessment may be different to the ones you have previously experienced. In 
addition, although all international students have achieved the English language requirements of their 
course, living and studying in a different language is different from studying it in the classroom. This 
means that you will have to learn to deal with different English accents, different speeds of speaking as 
well as learning your subject of study.
Being a tutor of international students studying in the UK is not easy, your preparation and teaching 
methods need to consider different learning styles, motivations and attitudes from those you may be 
familiar with.
So, our prime objectives in this book are to help:
•	 international students studying in the UK
•	 tutors and others who are supporting international students

Introduction and Learning Context
The aim of this book is to provide international students and their tutors with information and practical 
advice so that they understand what is required when studying for a degree in the UK. We have designed 
this book to provide clear and helpful guidance, and this is often supported by brief summaries of 
(potentially complex) relevant theories and also references. This will enable you to follow up different 
ideas at your leisure. Our belief is that the more anyone understands about their own approaches to 
learning and teaching, and also the context in which they are studying then the easier they will find it 
too be successful.
Within this book, we have written specific chapters aimed at students or tutors and this is made clear 
in the chapter title and also the start of each chapter and in the contents page. This is denoted by the 
‘Target Reader’ reference. The chapters also contain glossaries of key words used, useful tips and key 
phrases (highlighted in bold), chapter references and action lists and plans. Each chapter commences 
with a statement of aims.
Chapters 2 and 4 are for the International Student
Chapter 3 is for the tutor of the International Student
Chapters 1, 5 and 6 are relevant for both the international student and the tutor of the international student
Learning is a messy business and specific topics may be inter-connected. This means you will find that 
rather than read the book from beginning to end, some people may want to jump about and follow 
specific ideas or areas of interest. The chapter headings and index will help you do this
Commencing any journey requires a map – even if it is simply to say ‘I’m going to go in this direction’. 
So, here is our map of what we think is important for you the student and you the tutor.
The map of the book:
1.	 Understanding who is the international student
2.	 Joining and understanding the undergraduate (first degree) Higher Education (HE) learning 
environment in the UK
3.	 Joining and understanding the taught postgraduate (second degree) Higher Education (HE) 
learning environment in the UK
4.	 Joining and understanding the research postgraduate (third degree) Higher Education (HE) 
learning environment in the UK
5.	 Understanding the international student tutor
6.	 Strategies for improving marks for international students
7.	 Strategies for improving marks for international student tutors

Introduction and Learning Context
1.1	
The International student in the UK
You – the international student in the UK – are not alone! Data for 2010–2011 indicated that there were 
435, 230 international students studying in the UK (HESA, 2012). This number included 14% of ALL 
students studying for their undergraduate degree, 69% of ALL full time postgraduate students studying 
for their second degree and 48% of ALL postgraduate research students (studying for a research degree).
In terms of the origins of international students studying the UK on varying higher education awards, 
from this very large number of international students, nearly 20% were from the People’s Republic of 
China (PRC), 7% from India, 4% from Nigeria, 4% from Pakistan and 2% from the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia. And what were they (you?) studying?
The study of Business and Administrative studies (at all levels of study, from first degree to third degree) 
accounted for 36% of all international students in the UK (2010–2011). This was followed by Engineering 
(which accounted for 32%), Law (which accounted for 22%) and Computer Science (which accounted 
for 22%) (HESA, 2012). The experience of the authors reflects a dominant understanding of learning and 
teaching from a Business and Administrative studies perspective, but we hope that if you are studying 
another topic, you will find something helpful in this text too.
1.2	
Do you know why you want to study for a degree in the UK?
International students typically come to the UK for a number of different reasons including:
•	 Gaining a ‘good’ degree from a reputable university
•	 Learning about life and culture in the UK
•	 Developing a network of international friends and potential colleagues
Naturally there are many important topics to be discussed when looking at how you can improve your 
grades, not least the quality of learning and teaching, how this is adapted to suit your cultural needs (if 
at all), what teaching and learning styles are important and many more; however, if you do not wish to 
improve then there is little point in continuing. Therefore, the starting point has to be your desire to 
improve. Of course, your desire can be influenced by how much you understand of your learning and 
teaching environment – which is after all – an aim of this book. Some writers on this topic argue that 
the more you are told about how you will learn, the more motivated your will be to learn (Mahrous 
& Ahmed, 2010). Of course, this assumes that you understand what you are told about how you will 
learn – which is not necessarily true!
So let’s start to understand something about WHY you are reading this book, by using a simple example 
(or an analogy) of an overweight person who needs to lose 10kg. This desire is mainly wanted because 
of health reasons but also, that person may wish to feel more aesthetically pleasing. So what will drive 
this person to lose the weight?

Introduction and Learning Context
So, here comes the first ‘academic’ reference. This is an interesting one and well worth thinking about 
in different contexts, even if it is not followed up in any great detail in this book.
Azjen (1991) The theory of planned behaviour – Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision.
Icek Azjen, a psychologist, proposed this famous understanding of motivation in people, as a development 
of an earlier 1975 proposal between Icek and Martin Fishbein, to understand people’s actions. Put simply, 
Azjen suggests that there is a basic approach to human actions, that says we do what we plan to do. 
This statement can be further considered as requiring you (and me) this can be broken down as follows:
•	 How much does a person want to achieve something?
•	 How much pressure is there from outside sources (family/peers/social/culture/etc.) to achieve this 
goal?
•	 How easy is this goal to achieve? (how much control do you have to achieve the intention?)
Think of the above then in terms of the getting fit for a marathon run – the desire to complete the 
run, who you want to run for and how easy and how much control you have over your fitness. So for 
example, your intention to improve your grades can come from your attitude towards this aim, the 
views of family and friends, the abilities you have to focus and study in your work and the effort you 
can expend to achieve this goal. There are many examples which could then be considered and to which 
these 3 questions would be equally appropriate.
In our experience of working with international students, you will have many potential factors that 
influence what you achieve and why in your studies in the UK. You may wish to read more about this 
approach to understanding your intentions and motivations as perhaps you have not considered it before. 
You may find it easier to consider these questions as independent from each other when you look at 
them in terms of a your desire to achieve academically. It is something we will reflect on in parts of this 
text with you.
1.3	
How people learn
There has been much consideration over a long period of time as to why and how people learn. What does 
it mean to learn? A simple definition is that through learning, you enjoy a change in your behaviour. You 
do something different. In your studies, this could mean you get a better grade for work by understanding 
more of your topic – but it could also mean other outcomes are achieved. That you for example interact 
with others differently by developing skills through interaction with your fellow students that you engage 
with you tutors differently or that you see more of the UK in your travels by understanding how the rail 
network operates. So learning is changed behaviour in you.

Introduction and Learning Context
Of equal importance to us in writing this book and for you reading it, is that here are also barriers or 
difficulties that weaken your learning. We have already mentioned one of these, as language. There would 
be little point in you reading this book, expecting through your efforts to improve your grades, if you 
found this book difficult to understand and read. It must be written simply to avoid this. As you are (we 
hope) still reading this book (and understanding it), that barrier to your learning has been overcome. 
As you are reading this then you are reading with the intention of improving your grades and therefore 
you have taken the first step in achieving it – you are looking for help. You have the correct attitude.
An international student tutor may also find this more practical ‘back to basics’ approach useful because 
it tears back the layers of jargon and ‘technical research’ speak in order to focus on the person who really 
matters in the L&T process – the learner. However, we are keen in this book to recognise the importance 
of the two people: of you the learner and student and of you the international student tutor. You are part 
of a team and construct knowledge and understanding together.

Introduction and Learning Context
This approach to overcoming barriers to learning is called Constructivist Teaching. It is a method of 
learning that encourages you to challenge your own ideas and prior thinking in order to construct 
your knowledge and where you create knowledge as you understand your experiences (Driscoll, 2002). 
Learning and teaching is not a one way street; the international student tutor does not transmit while 
learner receives. Instead, you and your tutors ‘blend’ learning, through many different methods to form 
part of the same team. This approach challenges a traditional view of how you work with your tutors, 
where the power lies firmly with the teacher is challenged and replaced by a more democratic and 
empowering experience for you. You are then – along with your tutor – autonomous and intellectual 
co-constructors of your meaning and understanding. This is an integral approach for this book and one 
we explore in more detail in chapters 4 and 5 in particular.
1.3.1	
Learning Styles and Effective Learning
It is such a simple statement – if you are motivated, you are an effective learner – but to a large extent, it 
is true. If you value your learning and what you are trying to achieve then you are more likely to achieve 
your goal. This is because you are more likely to make the required effort. So how is an environment 
created where you can value your learning and is it your responsibility or is it that of your teacher/tutor 
to create it? The answer is both, but for now we will concentrate on what you can do to ensure you have 
the best learning experience possible.
There are many studies which look at various learning styles and we will discuss some of those in this 
book (see chapter 4 for a more detailed discussion). There are many different approaches to learning 
styles and it is a topic that is widely debated. However, developing an understanding about learning 
styles will enable you to reflect and learn from your own approaches to learning. This is considered in 
chapter 4 and 5.
Your language competence will shape your learning style in important ways (discussed in detail in 
chapters 4 and 5). Not only do you have the task of trying to achieve a degree in a foreign country, but 
you may be trying to do it in a second language and where the lesson material is provided in English. 
Your spoken English may be stronger than your written English or vice versa and/or you may have 
trouble reading books and understanding it in context. Doing so in a timely manner is also a frequently 
observed difficulty of international students.
Add to this you may be used to a learning environment that is more formal with less independent 
learning and so managing the independent study time of a UK Higher Education degree may prove a 
challenge. Indeed, sometimes the more flexible scope of UK based assessments can cause difficulty for 
international students who may be more accustomed to prescriptive assessment tasks.

Introduction and Learning Context
So there are many variables to consider which contribute to how you engage with your studies and the 
grades you achieve. Regardless of the country of origin a learner, you can still identify and embrace the 
‘type’ of learner and thinker you are. This is helpful for your learning but also can help your tutor to 
know how to prepare for and teach effective lessons that will appeal to the way you learn.
Summary
This brief introduction to our book has sought to raise with you a number of key factors which we feel 
you need to think about, to understand how you might improve your grades whilst studying in the UK 
as an international student. This book is not intended to be a study guide, nor an academic textbook on 
theories and concepts (although we will consider and present them where we feel they might help you 
to understand an action or advice better). We want this book to raise reflective considerations of your 
approach to your learning. We want it to help you determine a strategy – a series of actions – which will 
help and contribute to good and improved grade achievements. We also want this book to be similarly 
help tutors reflect on appropriate learning environments for international students.
As outlined in this introduction, our broad framework for the book suggests we focus upon how you 
learn (by a focus upon approaches to learning), your motivation to engage with your studies and what 
constitutes effective teaching in a global educational marketplace. We might visualise this as:

TARGET READER: The international student
2.1	
Pre-arrival and Travelling to the UK
The process of joining a degree programme (or other higher education programme) in the UK can be 
quite complex but your institution will guide you through this process. It is important to follow advice 
you receive from them and their guidance. Always allow yourself plenty of time to follow the necessary 
steps to secure your admission and all necessary travel documents to support your travel and study in your 
institution. Our concern here is to support your understanding about joining your academic programme. 
In general, international students join a degree programme by either:
1.	 Travelling from their home country after completing the previous schooling period to 
commence new studies directly
2.	 Travelling from their home country after completing the previous schooling period to commence 
a preparatory language and/or skills programme prior to starting new degree studies. In this 
case you will have received two offers from the University and/or college providing language 
instruction, to support your visa. You must follow the requirements of the UK Border Agency 
as you may be required to return to your home country to apply for your visa to join your 
degree programme (after your language course has concluded.
3.	 Already in the host country, typically having completed a prior course of study or language 
programme. To pursue your programme of study you may need to extend your visa. Again, 
please refer to specific advice on this issue with the UK Border Agency. European Union (EU), 
European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss National students do not require visas to study 
for degrees in the UK (although you will still need to prove your have an offer of a place and 
show your passport/identity card upon entering the UK).

Preparing for, travelling to and basic 
study questions about the UK
It is helpful at this time, to clarify some important language that is used to describe UK higher 
education studies.
•	 You join a degree programme (or programme of studies)
•	 Your degree programme will be managed by a tutor (sometimes called a programme or 
course leader)
•	 Your degree programme will be constituted from a number of separate short courses (sometimes 
called modules or units). These modules/units are managed and delivered by your tutors.
•	 Your degree programme will be structured and delivered over a number of semesters or terms.
The majority of UK universities and colleges operate Induction and Welcome Weeks (for International and 
Home (UK) students), which are specific periods of orientation time used to allow you to become familiar 
with your new learning environment and ensure you have both understood some of the basics of your 
programme (e.g. where the rooms are, your timetable) and have had time to organise your own personal 
affects (accommodation, banking etc). It is important you give yourself time to do this. Arriving late to join 
a programme of study, will add difficulty to both your adjustment and to the University seeking to integrate 
you into your programme of study. We present an overview of a typical induction programme in chapter 5.
Before you leave for the UK, you will receive a ‘pre departure guide’ from your host university. This details 
information about travelling to your university and whether any pre-arranged pick-ups are scheduled 
from airports for example. This can be very helpful when you arrive new to the UK and many universities 
arrange for these pick-ups to be staffed by student ambassadors. This means that you will immediately 
be able to talk to an experienced student who will be willing to answer your questions. The University 
will also ask you to let them know of how and when you intend to travel to the UK. Ensure you inform 
the University of your travel arrangements.
The advice from your host university (they are your ‘sponsor’ in the UK), will also inform you of the 
paperwork you need to bring with you. It is important to bring all of this paperwork otherwise you 
may not be permitted to enrol on your programme of study. This typically will include the following 
paperwork (but check with YOUR university/HEI for specifics):
•	 Passport – which should indicate your immigration status and your period of leave to remain 
in the UK.
•	 UK Biometric Card – for students who have applied for a Tier 4 visa
•	 The Original documentation of your qualifications (NOT photocopies) which were used to 
generate the offer for you when you applied to your university. This will be further detailed 
in your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) statement (e.g. references, certificates 
and transcripts).
•	 Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate –for postgraduate students and 
this may or may not be required (depending upon the subject you intend to study), check the 
specifics with your university.

Preparing for, travelling to and basic 
study questions about the UK
•	 Any medical evidence that evidences your health (this is required from some countries where 
there is a risk of infectious disease). Contact your university for further details.
•	 Evidence of any tuition payments you may have already made. Most UK universities allow 
online tuition fee payment and part payment/instalment payment. Check with your university. 
Your fee status should have been determined prior to your arrival in the UK.
•	 Evidence of any university scholarships or other awards you have been allocated.
There are a number of other items to consider that would help you prior to your travel to the UK:
•	 It is also advisable that you bring with you sufficient British Currency to allow you to organise 
your immediate needs, whilst banking requirements are organised and implemented. Lancaster 
University for example recommends £300. Bringing into the UK currency (in whatever form) 
that exceeds £10000 has to be declared at the point of entry to the UK (to Her Majesty’s Revenue 
and Customs (HMRC)).
•	 Bring spare passport photos – they are useful when joining organisations and as spares if required.
•	 If you are from the EEA/Swiss National – don’t forget to apply for a European Health 
Insurance Card.
•	 Bring suitable clothing! The weather in the UK follows a well defined seasonal pattern. You 
will need warm clothes in the Winter and early Spring. UK weather can be very wet with snow 
showers during Winter.

If you feel you need specific immigration advice upon arrival at your university, ask to speak to the 
immigration officer / adviser. The only advice you should accept is that from staff specifically trained 
in this area of law.
2.2	
Helping you settle in the UK
As well as organising your academic study in the UK, your university or college will help you find 
somewhere to live, become familiar with your living environment and also help you to meet other new 
students to make friends. We discuss the importance of your social network in chapter 4 of the book 
for your learning. Again, your university will be able to help with the following:
•	 Your accommodation – this could be university owned or managed. You may also wish to seek 
accommodation in the private sector. The University’s Accommodation Office will be able to 
help on both issues. Ideally this should have been organised (at least on a temporary basis 
prior to your arrival in the UK as it is a particularly stressful problem faced by international 
student arrivals (Webster, 2011).
•	 Orientation information – such as help with bank registration, joining a health clinic, how to 
contact home upon your arrival, how and under what circumstances paid employment may 
be possible (check your visa for particular details on this), local transportation around your 
university (bus and rail information), local cost of living information and how to obtain a TV 
licence (which is required in the UK for any viewing of public broadcasts).
•	 Insurance – for your belongings and health.
•	 Student services available at your university – including student health/well being, careers, 
disability, financial supports and advice and student counselling. 
•	 Information on faith service available in the University and in the local social environment.
•	 Information on immigration services and who to speak to in the University to give you 
appropriate legal advice.
•	 Some universities initiate contact with international students prior to their arrival, so if this 
includes you ensure you have full contact information for this individual(s). They can be very 
effective and help in supporting your academic transition.
•	 Consider that in general, electronic forms of communication are faster, more focused and able 
to be more reactive than traditional hard copy forms of communication. Both the University 
and the international student should seek to exploit this wherever possible.
Overall, you will receive a great deal of additional information from University and other important 
sources upon your arrival at the University. We don’t expect you to know all of this immediately as the 
staff know that for new entry students from overseas, progressing your studies can be both, a challenging 
and a very rewarding activity. One important piece of advice to remember is that – if you are ever in 
doubt about your studies or your assessments, always ask a tutor.

We discuss in chapter 4, the importance to your learning of developing a social network of friends. 
It is important therefore that you do participate in organised social events as you will benefit during 
your programme.
2.3	
Your typical first two weeks at University
Typically, in all cases you will be invited and expected at the following:
1)	 An International Welcome Week: This normally occurs in mid/late September each year 
and lasts one week. This is the preferred time for new international students to arrive at a 
University. The week has a range of very important immigration tasks for you to complete as 
well as educational and social activities to enjoy, which are designed to help you settle. You 
are normally invited to arrive in the UK for these events and will receive further information 
from the University.
2)	 Your school or faculty’s ‘Induction and Welcome’, typically follows the IWW, and is a welcome 
for all new and returning students. This week is very important as it will outline to you how the 
faculty works and provide you with a range of important information. A number of events are 
organised in this week, specifically for new direct entrants – these are particularly important 
to attend.
When you have finished the induction events (discussed earlier), you will then join your classes for your 
studies. Make sure that you receive a copy of the module handbook or equivalent for every module 
you study. These are very important documents as they will tell you where to be, when to be there, 
what to do before you arrive in class and what your assessment will be for those modules. These may be 
in hardcopy or in electronic copy, available from the university’s Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). 
If you are going to be (or expect to be) arriving late to the University, make sure you go to the International 
Office of your university or college in the first instance. You may also find it helpful to locate and visit 
your faculty’s Undergraduate Office in the first instance. From there you will be able to collect the 
information you have missed during induction and you will then be directed to your classes. Always 
introduce yourself to the module leaders in your classes and ask them for a copy of the module handbook 
(or access to them) and any missed information as soon as possible.
By the end of these two preparation and orientation weeks, you should have:
1.	 Organised your accommodation (for new arrivals to the UK)
2.	 The International Office Welcome Pack
3.	 A Faculty Welcome Pack
4.	 Your timetable for your studies
5.	 A guide to the Regulations of the Faculty

2.4	
Studying structure and information
Joining your programme means you will be in class studying for a number of hours per week – this will 
be made up of time in lectures, seminars and workshops / tutorials. In general, most undergraduate 
degrees in the UK are structured along similar principles. In the UK, degree programmes are loosely 
based upon a common structure appropriate to that discipline. For a majority of your degree choices, 
you will study in two semesters (the first running from late September to early January and the second 
from February to early May typically). Some universities operate three semester years and a majority 
include examination weeks at the end of these semesters. Hence a useful tip to note here is:
USEFUL TIP – Always check the dates of the examination weeks each year and do not book flights 
home in those weeks.

In a typical week therefore, you may expect to be with a tutor in a class for a range of time (from 10–12 
hours for a social science discipline up to perhaps 30 hours for a science discipline). It is important to 
note, that some faculties you join may have a strong ‘student centred’ learning approach which means 
there is an expectation on students to positively engage with their work.
Where this is the case the UK HE environment is constructed so that for other times in the week, you 
should be studying outside of class on that topic. This is a common approach in many HEI faculties in 
the UK where a 20 credit module is taught as needing approximately 200 hours of study over a semester 
and/or year (again depending upon the programme structure). So if your module has a requirement for 
40 hours of teaching in a class with a lecturer, then an additional 160 hours of private study are expected 
for successful completion of that module.
It is increasingly common that Universities offer smaller and larger credits for a module so expect 
variations on the teaching in class hours and private study hours. In the majority of undergraduate 
programmes, you will study 120 credits in a given year. UK undergraduate degree programmes that are 
3 years duration (the standard length of time) – teach you 360 credits of topics/units/modules through 
varying combinations. A small number of undergraduate degrees may have a higher credit summation, 
typically for those with integrated master awards or where an additional year is added to the programme 
(for example with a year working in industry). In those cases, you may see a total credit count of 480 
for the programme of study.
For a taught postgraduate award, a similar credit structure typically applies but it is taught over one 
calendar year (from September to August) with 180 credit count. Variations can be expected for the 
different kinds of postgraduate award – Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), Masters by 
Research (MRes).
Joining in the second or final Year of an undergraduate degree programme, brings different challenges 
for international students and we discuss some of these in chapters 4 and 5 in detail.
2.5	
The Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)
Universities use varying VLEs – which provide key academic information to support your studies. These 
are electronic resources which contain information about your modules and can also be used to assess 
your work. You will gain access to this VLE upon registration with the University and will then have 
access to your units/modules and a range of general support information. It is important that you check 
your access as soon as you are able, after registration.
If you experience difficulty in accessing the VLE for your modules, please first consult your degree 
programme handbook before seeking help from your tutors.

2.6	
Using your University email address
Universities have a general preference for you to use the assigned university email after you have 
registered on your programme. This does not mean that personal email addresses are not used, but that 
your university email account is the formal and official mechanism to advise you of programme relevant 
information. As a result all registered students should check their University email address on a regular 
basis. You may wish to set up an email rule to allow forwarding of university communication to your 
personal email address.
You should not expect that any prior communication methods with staff (pre-arrival) will be used 
again, once you have joined your university. If you fail to check that email address, you may miss out 
on important information and then fail to act upon that information.
2.7	
Progressing your studies
Lectures are: Formal learning environments whereby your tutor presents to you – typically in 40/50 
minute sections information concerning a given topic or theme. The purpose of the lecture is to present 
and identify to you the key information as signposts of what you need to understand. Sometimes the 
40/50 minute sections are added together with breaks. A lecture tends to be a monologue by the tutor 
with little option or possibility for your participation.
Seminars are: Informal learning environments, whereby you typically work with a smaller group drawn 
from your class with the tutor on issues identified in the preceding lecture. This tends to be an opportunity 
to engage in a conversation with your tutors, to address shortcomings in your understanding or skill 
development.
Workshops (or tutorials) are: Informal, very small group (or individual) meetings with your tutor. They 
are normally focused upon a particular aspect of learning or activity that requires a smaller group to 
engage effectively with.
University staff know that sometimes overseas students find difficulty with new words and phrases heard 
in class and it is always better to ask for clarification and explanation of anything new or unfamiliar to 
you, later in the seminar. Students joining at advanced entry (into year 2 or year 3) are expected to have a 
good grounding in basic fundamentals of your degree already and be able to discuss those with staff. This 
expectation is problematic though for you and we explore how you can engage better with higher levels 
of entry in Chapter 5. Sometimes, students find the step between Year 1 (level 4) and Year 2 (Level 5) 
quite challenging, so be prepared for this. If you find yourself struggling, always ask your tutor for help.

USEFUL TIP – It is common that in Universities for advanced entry students, your grades will begin 
to contribute towards your final degree classification. The exact percentage will vary by programme 
and university.
When you meet your programme leader, he or she will explain this to you.
For UK Universities, your class attendance is really important. We will expect you to attend all timetabled 
sessions for your programme of study. It really is in your benefit to attend as there is plenty of evidence 
(see later chapters) that good attendance is correlated to good performance. If you cannot attend a class 
for a good reason (e.g. you are ill) then you can usually advise your faculty and they will note you are 
not expected to attend.
USEFUL TIP – students that attend regularly receive better grades for their work – if you do not 
attend your classes then you will miss important information and the opportunity to develop your 
understanding of the topic to help you do well in your assessment activities.
If you are joining your programme of study at the final year, there are particular additional concerns to 
consider – and which are discussed shortly (see Chapter 5).

2.8	
How UK Universities test your learning and understanding
The broad forms of assessment you may experience are listed below (this is not an exhaustive listing 
however).
•	 Examinations (open book and closed book and oral)
•	 Essays
•	 Reports
•	 Oral presentations
•	 Poster presentations and displays
•	 Reflective learning journals
•	 Computer based assessment
•	 Multiple choice assessments
•	 Practical demonstrations
•	 Group work (and in varying forms)
As a very basic rule you should follow, if some of these methods may be new and/or challenging for 
you and you are uncertain as to what is required or how to prepare for them, speak with your module 
tutor concerned.
Information about your assessments (assignments and/or examinations) will be available in your module 
handbooks which you receive in the first week of teaching. If you arrive late to your faculty then ensure you 
collect or have access to, the module handbooks from your module tutor as soon as you are able. Sometimes, 
the assessments will be made available later in the module, if that is important to how that module operates. 
You will also receive general information about assessments during induction and there are periodic support 
sessions throughout the year which you can attend, to refresh your study and assessment skills.
Where group work is required for an assessment, this can be particularly challenging for all students 
especially new international students who may not know current students or may find it initially difficult 
to express themselves in this new environment (again we will discuss this issue of learning shortly in 
Chapter 2 and 3). However, it is important to ensure you try to join in quickly into this way of learning 
and begin to accept collective responsibility and ownership for any work produced as part of that group. 
In the UK, you can only normally attempt each assessment only once. It is therefore very important to 
ensure you know what to do for the assessments and achieve the best you can in those activities. Many 
tutors provide guidance on assessed work as part of the module teaching programme. If you are unclear 
about what is expected of you then ask your tutor for guidance before you submit work for assessment. 
This is particularly important for Year 3 (top up) direct entrants. Where you receive a low grade for an 
assessment, always ensure you understand if this causes a difficulty or is below a passing grade at your 
university. In such cases, speak with your personal tutor about your grades and studies, so you can be 
correctly advised.

2.9	
Feedback and good practice
Feedback about your work and progress is very important in your studies. It provides you with both 
information about how you are performing in your studies at present, but also about how to improve 
your grades for future modules and studies. It is therefore important to ensure you recognise feedback 
as being discussions with tutors about your studies as well as the traditional written feedback received 
when you submit work for assessment. Do not just rely on your received grades and marks as indicators 
of your progress in your programme, always ensure you know why you have received your grade. Speak 
with your tutor about this.
USEFUL TIP – Always know why and how you have received a grade for a piece of work.
In the UK it is expected that students will take responsibility for their academic work and not to use 
Unfair Means e.g. to avoid plagiarism and correctly reference all your sources, and to follow the normal 
assessment and examination practices. Universities and your faculty, will be able to provide a referencing 
guide that will allow you to submit work that follows appropriate academic conventions and uses the 
correct academic register.
2.10	
Word Count
For written submissions, you should expect your faculty to have a specific policy on how many words you 
can use in your work. The penalties for exceeding this can be significant, so again, ensure you understand 
what these are. The reason why UK universities adopt this view is to ensure you develop skills in being 
focused and concise in your discussion of professional issues.
2.11	
Grades and how your degree is classified
For many international students, understanding the UK grading system can be something new and 
complex. A brief summary of this follows. Honours degrees achieved from the UK are graded by ‘class’ – 
this means your final overall average grade is converted into a ‘class’ award:
•	 Achieving 70% or better at the end of your Final Year (Year 3 – level 6) studies with us means you 
will be awarded a ‘first class’ degree. This is very difficult in the UK to do. Only approximately 
5–15% of students will gain this award in a given year. Some institutions will have further 
categories within the first class grade range (70%–100%) – such as ‘exemplary first class’.
•	 Achieving between 60% and 69% at the end of your Final Year (Year 3 – level 6) studies with 
us means you will be awarded an ‘upper second class’ degree. This is a very good award in the 
UK and approximately 30% of students will gain this award.

Securing good marks: A guide for

28 
Preparing for, travelling to and basic 
study questions about the UK
•	 Achieving between 50% and 59% at the end of your Final Year (Year 3 – level 6) studies with 
us means you will be awarded a ‘lower second class’ degree. This is a good award in the UK 
and approximately 40% of students will gain this award
•	 Achieving between 40% and 49% at the end of your Final Year (Year 3 – level 6) studies with 
us means you will be awarded a ‘third class’ degree. This means you have reached the standard 
required for a UK degree. Approximately 10–15% of students will gain this award
These grades are also typically written onto your work with feedback, when you submit for assessment. 
Sometimes international students, who are not familiar with UK marking, are worried by receiving a 
mark for a piece of work they think looks ‘bad’. It has become increasing practice that UK universities 
are being encouraged to adopt a full marking range (from 0 to 100%) – see chapter 4 for a detailed 
discussion of the issues surrounding the marking range for degree programmes. So achieving a grade 
greater than 70% in UK Higher Education, means your work has been regarded as excellent by your tutor 
in comparison with all the other work they have assessed and the standard expected in that discipline at 
that level of study. Your faculty and your tutors ensure the quality of your education and degree, by taking 
great care therefore, in how grades are determined and by requiring the use of an external examiner (a 
staff member from a different higher education institution) to oversee all grades awarded to all students. 
It is a strength of studying for a UK degree.

29 
Preparing for, travelling to and basic 
study questions about the UK
Wherever possible and practicable, in the UK, all work is graded anonymously. Different systems exist 
with for example, one of the author’s home institution using a bar code and student number system, 
whereby you will receive a unique bar code and number that identifies your work, but is not known to 
teaching staff. The only exceptions to this are during assessed presentations.
2.12	
The structure of UK degrees
Undergraduate Honours degrees follow a clear structure in the UK. Typically, your first degree will be 
either a BA (Hons) award or a BSc (Hons) award, depending upon your programme (although variants 
also exist such as BSc (Econ)). These degrees are awarded by class (as above). Generally you need to 
obtain an upper second class degree to progress to a typical Masters Degree (MA or MSc) in the UK 
(although this is hard to generalise and you are advised to call a particular University of interest, to 
confirm their current postgraduate admissions policy). Masters degrees last for one full calendar year. 
Depending upon their research ability and strengths, some students can then progress onto a doctorate 
degree (which can last between 3 and 6 years).
2.13	
Managing your studies
It is very likely that your timetable with your university will be different from the one you are familiar 
with in your current University or College. Classes can start at 9:15 am in the morning and can finish at 
6.00pm or later, from Monday through to Friday. You need to ensure you arrive for your classes at least 
5 minutes before they begin. Ensure you know the location of your classrooms in advance.
You need to ensure that you prepare for all your sessions, including scheduled lectures and seminars 
(again we look at this in more detail shortly). This also means managing your time so that you can 
attend your scheduled classes and effectively to complete your work. You can gain help in managing 
your time if this becomes a problem for you. A range of support services are usually available for you, 
to help you achieve this.
In short, you will need to develop effective study skills. Whilst this is an important topic in of itself, it is 
not the focus of this book. Consequently, you may find the following helpful if you wish specific advice 
on developing your study skills.

2.14	
Managing your language
Joining your programme in the UK brings many new and interesting challenges. One main problem for 
overseas students is language. You should expect that it may take some time for you to feel comfortable 
in your classes, both listening and speaking in English. Your faculty staff are aware that this can be an 
initial difficulty and are happy to revisit a new phrase or concept introduced in a lecture or during a 
seminar activity. The seminar discussions are also your opportunity to find out what is meant by a certain 
phrase or concept you have heard.
It is tempting to try to translate every new word you hear in a lecture, but this will take you time. It is 
often better to simply try to follow the main argument or discussion. This will give you a better overall 
understanding of that lecture. You can then after the lecture, check on new words or phrases in more 
detail. You may also find it helpful to review some of the English language support books listed below 
(some may be available from your home University / College / School library).
•	 Jordan, R.R., (1999), ‘Academic Writing Course’, Longman.
•	 Bailey, R., (2003), ‘Academic writing: A Practical guide for students’, Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes.
•	 Cox, K and Hill, D., (2004), ‘English for Academic Purposes Melbourne Longman-Pearson.
•	 Wallace, M.J., (2004), ‘Study skills in English’, (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
You will find that your language skills and abilities will develop faster if you try to work with other 
nationality students in your classes, as you will all be then using the English language. This is difficult 
to do, but it will help your studies and make you feel ‘at home’ more quickly. Try to not work in a same 
nationality group and use one person (the most confident speaker), to comment on the group’s view on 
an issue. You must seek to gain your own voice. These observations are explored more fully in chapters 4 
and 5.
2.15	
Dealing with problems in your studies
This section lists a range of typical questions and answers you may find useful to refer to, once you joined 
your faculty and which provide the questions for key chapter in this book:
What to do if…you receive a poor grade?
Firstly – don’t worry. Secondly, always make sure you speak with your tutor to know why you received a 
low grade and try to address those weaknesses you had in your next assessment. You may be encouraged 
to speak with the Study Advice Service and you should do so.

Preparing for, travelling to and basic 
study questions about the UK
What to do if…you cannot attend a class?
Always let your department know if you are unable to attend a class (you will be introduced to staff from 
this office during the induction sessions). If you feel that you will not be able to attend several classes, 
speak with your personal tutor.
What to do if…you need to extend your visa?
You need to speak with staff from the International Office and/or professionally trained immigration 
advisers in the University.
What to do if…you want to complain?
Firstly speak with your tutors to try to resolve your problem. This is the best way to improve a problem. 
If that is not successful, then talk to the programme leader. If the problem has not been resolved then 
you can bring the issue to the attention of your faculty formally, by whatever mechanism is in place for 
this purpose. 
What to do if…you are going to arrive late in the UK?
Let your faculty know.

Preparing for, travelling to and basic 
study questions about the UK
What to do if…you need help choosing options in your programme?
Speak with your programme leader and/or personal supervisor and read the available guides (this will 
also be typically introduced during your induction sessions).
SELF-MANAGEMENT
A key feature of university education is self-management. In HUBS we expect ALL students to:
•	
Be on TIME for lectures, seminars, workshops and tutorials
•	
Be PREPARED e.g. by reading work set in your module handbook
•	
RESPECT other students and also teaching staff e.g. by not talking or disrupting the learning of others in lectures 
or other taught sessions, switching off mobile phones, not listening to each other.
To ensure that there is a constructive learning environment for ALL students, lecturers and tutors may:
•	
Exclude late arrivals
•	
Exclude students who are not prepared for their classes i.e. who have not read or worked on preparatory 
learning materials
•	
Ask students to leave lectures or other taught sessions if they are disrupting the learning experience of others. 
In extreme cases, the Business School may use the University disciplinary code to ensure that unruly students 
do not disrupt the learning experiences of others.
If there are good reasons for you not being able to engage with your studies then please contact your personal 
supervisor or module tutor(s).
Summary
This chapter has considered some of the practical activities you will need to address and do, in order to 
support your higher education experience in another country. This has ranged from a broad discussion 
of a typical University welcome and Induction periods through to the learning approaches employed 
within UK HEIs. Whilst it is difficult to offer specific advice about the structures in your UK learning 
environment because of the diversity of HEIs, we have outlined a common framework for assessment, 
attendance and engagement with your studies. If you read this prior to arrival at your HEI, it should 
help you to adjust more effectively. In chapters 4 and 5, we add additional observations to your ‘pre 
departure’ activities from an academic and learning perspective as well as explaining why we feel these 
activities will benefit your grade achievements.
In the next chapter we focus upon ‘how you learn’ generally which is an important exploration to 
undertake. This is narrowed in chapters 4 and 5, to one considering the specific situation of the 
international student and where and how ‘you’ can join a programme of higher study in the UK.

TARGET READER – The tutor (although the keen international student will find it helpful!)
Aim of Chapter
The purpose of this chapter is to primarily present the tutor with a concise and current understanding of 
the mechanisms through which individuals learn (where we view learning as described as a permanent 
change in the actions of the individual and which is not solely explained by the age of the individual 
and their cumulative experiences). These issues are then discussed in the context of the international 
student and their learning environment and history. Through this discussion, the practitioner will develop 
a cognitive understanding of more appropriate methods to deploy when working with international 
students in the UK. Chapters 4 and 5 add specific understanding from current research on this topic 
for both the tutor and the international student.

Theories of Learning
At the end of chapter 1, a broad outline of the key areas of, and barriers to, improving the grades of 
international students was presented (see figure 1.1). This structure is broadly based upon that of Illeris 
(2012) who articulates a 4 factor relationship shaping effective learning. Effective learning is understood 
therefore as:
•	 Identifying the basis of the learning theory employed in a given situation
•	 Identifying the internal conditions that directly shape subjective effectiveness of the learning process 
•	 Identifying the external conditions in which the learner is seeking to learn
•	 Identify and select appropriate applications of learning methods and pedagogies
From figure 1.1 therefore and combining this with the broad themes that comprise Illeris’ approach to 
learning:
Illeris (2012)

Key comments
Basis of learning theory
Constructivist teaching and student 
activated teaching1 by learning with 
the teacher.
In both interpretations, there is a focus upon the 
ontology of the learning theory and resultant 
epistemological and methodological arguments. 
Internal conditions
The intention of the individual learner.
The learner’s disposition, motivation, reward, 
stage of life and disposition towards the learning 
activity (see chapter 5).
External conditions
The context of the learner
The learning environment of the individual, 
their social pressures and situational needs (see 
chapter 4)
Application
Approaches to learning 
The diversity of available pedagogical methods 
to fit with individual learners and their needs (see 
chapter 5)
Learning
Effective Teaching
Focuses upon the barriers to learning, learning 
types and structures (see chapter 4 and 5)
Table 3.1: Comparison of the Illeris (2012) model of learning and the key parts of this book1
Whilst a consideration of these initial frameworks is effective in bringing together the primary components 
of individual learning, the core argument – and one which as highlighted in chapter 1 as integral to this 
book – is that of grasping learning as an interaction between the external environment and the individual, 
which is effected by the manner in which learning is gained and incorporated into the individual. We 
see later how this can be described as the academic practice of your degree programme. Arguments of 
motivation and intention (in the sense of an individual’s control of their learning environment), the ease 
(or difficulty) with which they are able to shape that environment, the importance of significant others 
in their learning activities and their attitude towards the learning process of the student learner from 
chapter 1 are important to understand from the practitioner/tutor perspective, especially in the sense 
of selecting appropriate applications of pedagogical methods. This latter issue has been significantly 
explored in key literature.

How you learn
As noted in table 3.1 a critical assumption in these frameworks is that individuals cognitively construct 
new meaning and understanding. It has long been recognised by psychologists that the brain is a highly 
effective pattern matching organism and individuals maintain mental schemata (both general and specific) 
that allow them to act in a given situation, even one which is new to their understanding and experience. 
Much work has been conducted on this view of the brain (see for example Schmidt, 1995:2011). As Illeris 
(2012) illustrates, learning occurs then when new observations from the environment, suitably enabled 
by an internal predisposition to that stimulus, shape/modify/extend the existing mental schemata. This 
is the heart of Piaget’s2 concept of learning. Clearly then there will be different mechanisms through 
which a schemata is changed or developed and this will not always been the same for all members of a 
class under instruction. We can therefore state that this is the first important practitioner observation:
Note 1: International students will present varying a priori mental schemata constructs that may be quite 
different from home (UK) students.
It may also be observed from Piaget’s original conception of learning that:
Note 2: The traditionally dominant assimilative learning process may be far more fragmented for 
international students that for home (UK) students when following a UK derived curriculum.
Note 3: Illeris (2012) notes that desired transformative learning can be experienced by individuals in 
certain situations but that this may be particularly difficult for international students.
This approach to learning (transformative) describes an extensive and far reaching revision of many 
schemata of pre-existing learning skills and knowledge, by new ones – and which challenge and revise 
the very nature of the individual and ‘self’. This clearly would be demanding and stressful for individuals 
concerned as it is profound and extensive. This may, for some international students, be their experience 
of learning in the UK and echoes comments observed in Cadman’s (1997) and Brown’s (2009) work 
of the importance of these changes. Both authors examined the meaning of identity and self for 
international students studying in new learning environments, which challenged the core of their pre-
existing schemata and frameworks for learning, knowledge development and skill acquisition. Indeed 
as discussed in chapters 4 and 5, self-identity and how much you feel your ‘belongingness’ to your 
programme is an important focus for understanding your effective international student engagement 
and grade achievements.

How you learn
Overall, Illeris (2012) presents four types of learning : cumulative, assimilative, accommodative and 
transformative – where assimilation and accommodative are the two most frequently employed learning 
approaches for individuals. It is the argument of this chapter however, that assimilative learning is more 
likely to be fragmented for international students due to ill fitting a priori schemata for learning and 
potentially, for some international students, the learning process in a UK learning environment, will 
necessarily be transformative – in other words you will change how your understand yourself, your 
values can change as can your actions.
Recent research on both notes (1 and 2) above illustrate these two concerns clearly. Jang et al (2009), 
Cadman (1997) and Sloan & Porter (2010) for example, present analyses that are all concerned with 
these two observations but from different audience perspectives. Jang et al (2009) are concerned with 
how an international learner reflects on the abilities of their teacher to meet their learning needs. In 
other words, they are concerned with the Illeris (2012) condition under which individuals acquire new 
understanding and learning by focusing upon the perceptions of the learner towards the tutor.
The Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) of tutors is a measurement instrument developed to provide 
a student centred view of the acquisition of understanding by the student. Sloan & Porter (2010) 
subsequently developed a behavioural and structural understanding of the situational context in which 
learning is enabled for international students (through the Contextualisation – Embedding – Mapping 
model (CEM)). This is a framework that blends the internal – external conditions from the Illeris (2012) 
model of learning by considering how to integrate English for Academic Purposes (EAP) modules of study 
within degree programmes. Finally Cadman (1997) offers a reflective analysis of experiences working 
with doctoral international students and relates to how international students develop a self identity when 
learning in an international (to them) environment. This is an important and interesting issue we need to 
understand as it will help the international student and the tutor for international students, understand 
why engagement in a learning environment may be very different from familiar home environments.
The development of an individual identity (and the self) is argued by psychologists to have both an 
individual and a social input (Terry et al. 1999; Tsoukas, 1996: Anderson & Warren 2005). Thus how 
international students are acculturated to their learning environment and how this process is managed 
both by the student and by tutors involved in that learning process, also suggests that the tutor must 
consider the origins and starting point for the learning process of each individual learner. This could be a 
focus upon the subjective situation of the learner (Illeris’ Internal Conditions) and learning barriers. The 
acculturation of the international student learner and the impact upon effective learning, is a particular 
focus for Zhang & Goodson (2011). Chapter 5 further explores these ideas.
From a tutor perspective a number of considerations emerge from this discussion.
USEFUL TIP – Know the student learner.

How you learn
Effective teaching depends both upon the tutor’s competence in a given subject knowledge but also 
on knowing the student’s prior knowledge and anticipated learning difficulties. Jang et al (2009) 
present a succinct argument of this, that effective teaching requires a competent understanding of both 
subject knowledge and pedagogical options, so as to be able to implement an appropriate and fitting 
communication process with the student. This combination of competences and subsequent judgement, 
has been identified as the Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) of the tutor introduced earlier.
Jang et al (2009) in research examining PCK tested to what extent the four categories of input into 
PCK explained the perception by students of what an effective teacher was3. The four hypothesised 
categories were:
•	 Subject Matter Knowledge (SMK) – the demonstration of subject matter comprehension by 
the tutor
•	 Instructional Representation Strategies (IRS) – the demonstration of linguistic techniques to 
illustrate issues to aid understanding by the tutor
•	 Instructional Objects and Context (IOC) – the demonstration of knowledge of the aims of 
education, classroom management and instruction by the tutor
•	 Knowledge of Student’s understanding (KSU) – the demonstration of an evaluation of current 
student understanding, before and during teaching by the tutor

Their analysis highlighted good levels of competence (SMK) but weak levels of KSU shaping student 
perception of what was a good tutor. There was insufficient evidence offered by tutors to generate 
positive perceptions in the students, of the teachers KSU. Indeed their results stressed that most tutors 
were “…insensible to students’ learning difficulties and their prior knowledge.” (Jang et al, 2009:603). 
Key causes of this perception were the adoption by tutors of a subjective view of student progression 
and understanding in class, the explanatory competence evidenced in class and progressing too quickly 
through the curriculum in class.
USEFUL TIP – as a tutor do not assume you know how your international students value good 
teaching and how they approach learning.
PCK has its roots in the constructivist argument of learning because of the importance of understanding 
previous experience and knowledge of both the teacher and the international student. This is called a 
dialogic view of learning which then emphasises – knowing the student through –
•	 Being competent in a variety of pedagogical methods. Question – how would you describe your 
breadth of skills and understanding of different pedagogical methods? Is it time to refresh them?
•	 Considering how the student can progress through the subject matter (the order and structure 
of learning materials). Question – notwithstanding the QAA Subject benchmarks, HE teachers 
have considerable flexibility in what parts of the subject matter knowledge are included in a given 
modular focus. How often do you consider whether your preference for the knowledge focused 
upon in a module is appropriate for the learner?
•	 Gaining an understanding of the international student’s previous knowledge of the subject 
matter. Question – how often (if at all) do you consider the pre-existing knowledge and skills 
that a learner brings to your classes? Are you aware of gaps in that knowledge? Are you aware of 
strengths in the abilities of learners in your class?
•	 Ensuring attention is directed to being aware of initial and progressing student understanding 
in a class. Question – do you have any information on the make-up of your classes? Initial student 
qualifications and experience, their international entry profile? How often do you ensure students 
are following and understanding your instruction during your classes? 
•	 Using appropriate assessment strategies to evaluate student achievement in learning the subject 
knowledge. Question – Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) if used (or paradigmatic skills and 
knowledge) can be assessed in a number of different ways. How often do you think about whether 
the assessment strategy selected to evaluate learner achievements, is appropriate for the diversity 
of student learners in a class? Can different strategies be employed concurrently in a given class, 
that then give a greater measurement of the actual achievements of a given student learner?    4

Structuring the learning process
Sloan & Porter (2010) considered the difficulties experienced by international student learners in 
their engagement and achievement in undergraduate business degrees. Of particular focus was the 
need to consider not only the development of English (typically described as English for Academic 
Purposes (EAP)) competence skills and understanding by international students upon joining their 
degree programmes, but also an explicit consideration of when and to what extent, these are aligned 
with subject matter requirements as the learner progresses through their programme of study. The 
tendency for EAP programmes to be run in parallel to their disciplinary studies and to be perceived by 
the student learner as then separate from that discipline, weakens their effectiveness and the achievement 
of the learner. The learner perceives their EAP studies to be separate from and less important than, their 
subject matter studies. The importance of language competence is returned to again in chapter 4 but 
we can note here from Sloan & Porter (2010) that by changing how EAP was viewed and managed, the 
effective structure of the learning process was enhanced. This was addressed by:
•	 Assigning specific EAP staff to faculties with International Students. Question – as a subject 
matter specialist working with international students – what contact do you have with EAP staff? 
•	 Identifying subject champions who could focus upon modules where the transferability of skills 
from the EAP studies was particularly weak – yet important for student achievement. Question – 
do you know where international students experience particular difficulties in units/modules? Do you 
know what aspect of learning is a particular barrier for the international student in those modules?

•	 Revisions to both the EAP syllabus and the timing of EAP skills development to align with 
faculty subject knowledge requirements. Question – in the delivery of your subject knowledge, 
have you ensured that where particular new skills and understanding are being introduced to the 
international student learner, that you have confidence that the learner will have the appropriate 
abilities at the right time?
•	 Changing the traditional view of EAP by faculty from one of being external and additional, 
to internal and integral helps to generate successful achievements by the international student 
learner. This included prioritizing EAP work within faculty timetables (and making that 
visible to the international student). Question – what is the perception of EAP in your faculty 
or department? Are you confident that sufficient importance is accorded to EAP faculty staff?
These observations formed the Contextualisation – Embedding – Mapping (CEM) model of learning 
for the international student.
3.2	
Prioritizing the evidence of originality in international student achievement 
over achievement in mastering academic conventions.
It was noted earlier that individuals develop a sense of self from two environmental inputs – the 
external environment (notably significant others) and the internal environment (attitudes, dispositions 
and situations). This is a strong fit with the framework presented in this chapter for effective learning. 
It is perhaps then no surprise, that international students exhibit anxiety, stress and concern when 
commencing studies in a new international learning environment as they may feel their sense of self and 
identity is no longer secure or perhaps even valid or valued in that new environment (see also chapter 5 for 
a detailed exploration of this issue) (Cadman, 1997). Indeed, in the ethnographic work by Brown (2009) 
of the development of friendships between international students (see also chapter 4), some student 
comments noted the immersion into a new learning environment as ‘alienating’. This argument is again 
supportive of the constructivist approach to learning (where meanings are developed in conjunction with 
experiences), although here a clear dissonance can be experienced by international students, between 
prior experiences and values (perhaps highly rewarded ones too) and these new experiences.
At the heart of this difficulty for the international student is a different set of rewards and values for an 
alternate learning style. International students cannot be expected to share the same epistemological 
orientation found in the UK culture (Connor, 1996). International students no longer feel ‘at home’ 
(Brown, 2009) and indeed as presented in Note 3 Section 3.1.1, are potentially exposed to a transformative 
learning environment (which can be rejected or resented by the learner (see chapter 5 and the discussion 
of Information Processing Styles (IPS)). Bruner (2012) argues that learning and thinking are always 
situated in a cultural setting and always dependent upon using cultural resources. This is the culturalist 
view of learning and is concerned with “…how humans in cultural communities create and transform 
meaning.” (Bruner, 2012: 161). It is therefore focused upon how humans construct realities and meanings 
of the world around them.

How you learn
We can imagine some of the difficulties an international student might experience when immersed for 
the first time into the UK HE learning environment by recognising that learning is now presupposed 
without an appropriate prior cultural context. As Bruner (2012) succinctly illustrates, whilst it might 
be possible to define and translate every English word into the language of the international student, it 
is impossible to translate any cultural context that is giving or taking meaning to/from that word. We 
lack a universal ‘contexticon’. The task would be analogous to asking you, the HE tutor, to present an 
interpretation of the history of the Shandong province of China using Tai Chi! We simply lack both the 
tools, a priori schemata and understanding to achieve this aim.
It is perhaps then of limited surprise that originality of thought, criticality of engagement with problems, 
literature and methodologies become primary areas of difficulty for evidencing competence and for 
reward in the UK learning environment for the international student. Indeed the concept of ‘critical 
thinking’ itself is contested, particularly for the modern student living in an information rich world. 
Why do the critical thinking yourself when it is likely someone else has already done it for you? …and 
that you can easily find that answer through modern search engines and databases? (Wallace, 2014). 
Wallace (2014) further argues that with students opting for this as a form of critical thinking, their own 
rational abilities are diminished and there can be an increased use of “…irrational, emotional, or non-
sequitur responses because that is what their current ability and motivation levels promote.” What can 
the international student do, to address this?
Wallace (2014) suggests increasing the ability for critical thought as skill development in the identification 
and evaluation of determined evidence, although this will vary student to student. Achievement in this 
area should also be transparently evaluated (i.e. explored in a constructivist manner with the international 
student). Secondly, developing skills in identifying who to ask and what to ask about, would also ensure 
the development of critical thinking skills in the individual concerned.
With this problem also typically comes difficulties with presenting acceptable forms of expression of 
those competences through use of an academic register and academic referencing conventions. Yet, it 
is in the experience of the authors, often the case that a student’s ability to articulate a response to a 
set assessment task in a manner in which that discipline accepts can be more important (and achieve a 
higher grade as a result) than the actual originality of arguments encompassed in that response.

For example, in a recent review of a University’s module in Entrepreneurship (where one of the authors 
was the external examiner) and which encompassed both home and international students in their 
final year of study, the assessment criteria focused upon many aspects of the ‘quality’ of the work –for 
example, the financial forecasts in the business plan, the marketing research and data underpinning 
the idea, operational resource management needs, human resource management needs for example – 
however, there was no criteria for judging the originality of the idea for the business. In other words, 
the functional and to a certain extent, the mechanistic performance of the proposed organisation was 
prioritized in assessment, over the idea for the business. This is not to say that those functional activities 
of a new organisation are not important, but they can be addressed, learned, taught (or even hired) from 
the marketplace in practice. Possessing a distinctive vision of the organisation though adds value to the 
venture and arguably, will underpin longevity of the resultant organisation. So why was it missing in the 
original assessment structure of the assignment?
Cadman (1997) proposes a similar argument in her reflections of working with international postgraduate 
students, that HE tutors often present to international students barriers to learning that focus upon the 
mechanistic achievements over the (preferred) aim of criticality and originality in assessed work. These 
can be in conflict with the development of a secure sense of self in the new learning environment (see 
also Block (2007) and chapter 5).

Hence questions for the tutor to consider in working with international students would be as follows:
•	 Reviewing how the assessment criteria are presented and understood by the learner. Question – 
what is the fundamental evidence sought to warrant a grade allocation to an assessed submission? 
Does that evidence allow the learner to gain a ‘voice’ (using Cadman’s terminology). Are you 
prioritising academic register and conventions above evidence of criticality and originality?
•	 Work with international students on their assessment tasks in a supportive formative manner. 
Question – do you review intended submissions from international students. Can you identify 
the student voice in that work? Can you guide the student to value that voice, to help build their 
identity in this new learning environment? See chapter 5 and the discussion of student identity 
processing systems and in particular mode 1 and 2).
•	 As noted in 1 – section 3.1.1 above – the articulation of a valued assessed response in the 
UK learning environment for the international student, should be able to be captured by an 
appropriate assessment strategy. Question – have you considered in your assessment strategies, 
whether they are UK/Euro centric in their application? Do they consider the variety of international 
students in a given class who may find their self-expression difficult in some forms of assessment?
•	 Should rigorous adherence to the academic convention of writing in the third or neutral person 
be deployed at the expense of evidence of originality and criticality? Question – Cadman (1997) 
raises this interesting point that the widespread disuse and punishment for using the first person ‘I’ 
in assessed UK HE submissions (which has sound professional aims of objectifying that discussion) 
may also erect learning barriers for the international student. Do you need to be impersonal in 
assessing submitted work? Or can you be accommodating of the use of ‘I’ in that work? Cadman 
citing Flowers (1981) and Ivanic & Simpson (1992) clearly articulates that returning to the use of 
‘I’ does foster academic enquiry in international students. By doing this, the international student 
is allowed to define themselves in their work, helping to secure a renewed sense of identity in this 
new learning environment and to relate directly and personally to literature and argument. See 
also chapter 5 and mode 2 and 3 of the IPS.
The idea of transformative learning5 has been noted in this chapter as providing some parallels to the 
experience of the learning process for international students studying in the UK. Mezirow (2012) explains 
that transformative learning is focused upon the difficulties experienced through what Habermas termed 
as communicative learning, where as noted, international students are akin to Mezirow’s adult returning 
learners to education and are (likely) to lack a suitable contexticon. Communicative learning is an 
abductive learning process, which is a process of both inductive and deductive analysis. This approach 
to learning seeks to generate socially useful understanding that is derived from “…gaps in the solutions 
to concrete problems more than gaps in the literature” (Visconti (2010) citing Van Maanen (2007)) (see 
also Feilzer, 2012). It appeals to the learner as it encourages a critical engagement with the subject matter 
when engaged with an effective teacher. The weakness of this approach to learning is the dependency 
upon a skilled subject specialist, who as we have noted, is also competent in appropriate pedagogical 
methods (see the earlier PCK discussion).

International students studying in the UK therefore need to develop an appropriate frame of reference 
to support effective learning (Mezirow, 2012). This includes two cognitive elements –
1)	 A habit of mind (which are the individual, social and life experiences that allow interpretative 
schemata to be developed – such as moral ethical values, sociolinguistic norms, religious and 
aesthetic values).
2)	 Resultant points of view, which are the articulation of habits of mind. This might for example 
be illustrated by the way in international students view non culturally similar individuals in 
a class as outsiders and then do not seek help or support from engaging with them. It is an 
issue we return to in chapter 5 when considering how international students build cultural 
friendships and socially embed themselves into the UK learning environment. 
If we consider what Mezirow (2012) presents as the processes involved in transformative learning, we 
begin to appreciate some of the scale of difficulties encountered by the international student in the UK 
HE learning environment.
The transformative learning processes include:
•	 Being able to critically reflect on the source and nature of the individual’s assumption and 
those of others
•	 Being able to deploy empirical research methods (instrumental learning)
•	 Being able to arrive at justified beliefs and arguments by participating in an informed discourse
•	 Being able to act upon the transformed learning by being able to apply it to new evidence 
presented6
So now with this discussion, we can add a further point of reflection for the tutor of international students: 
•	 Question – with revisions to habits of the mind and resultant points of view, frequent formative 
engagement with the international learner is required. How often do you undertake this with 
your international students on required / assessment tasks – where you particularly focus upon 
missed assumptions in the views of students7? Various pedagogical methods are offered by Mezirow 
(2012) to achieve this such as; metaphor analysis, critical incidents, journal writing, conceptual 
mapping etc.

Acculturation of the International Student
The discussion above in 3.3 highlighted difficulties for international students in gaining a sense of self 
and identity in a new international learning environment. This concern has also been explored through 
international student acculturation. Acculturation is the process through which individuals having 
different cultures interact and generate changes in those original cultural patterns. This can either be 
through changes in the home (UK) or host culture in the international learning environment. Berry et 
al (1997) propose five acculturation strategies along these two axes:-
•	 Integration – a sense of identity and self emerges from adjustments to both the host and home 
cultures. This bicultural adjustment generates the lowest form of acculturation stress for the 
individual (Brown citing Ward and Rana-Deuba (1999)).
•	 Assimilation – a sense of identity and self emerges from embracing the host culture. Although 
this must be tempered as it would not generate a multicultural learning environment (indeed 
the host culture risks being viewed as chauvinist). See also chapter 5 and mode 2 and 3 of IPS.
•	 Separation – a sense of identity and self is reinforced by rejecting the host culture. The 
international student remains monocultural. See chapter 5 and mode 3 of IPS.
•	 Marginalization – a sense of identity and self is separated from both the host and home cultures. 
See chapter 5 and mode 3 of IPS.
•	 Multiculturalisation – a sense of developing multiple integration adjustment strategies.

For Zhang & Goodson (2011) the integration acculturation strategy is the most effective for the well-being 
of international students8 and considers both psychological (the available stress and coping frameworks 
available to international students) and sociological adjustment (the fitting in of the international student) 
and conflict reconciliation in international students and their tutors. The value of social connection 
and embeddedness from this bi-linear perspective emphasises both interaction with host nationals but 
also values conational interaction between culturally similar international students (Brown, 2009) (i.e. 
that UK students also benefit from this interaction). There is significant literature on the benefits of 
acculturation integration strategies (see Zhang & Goodson (2011) and Brown (2009) for a detailed listing 
and discussion) and which tend to cite – reduced prejudice, equality, support for pursuit of common 
goals, recognition of differences in communication patterns, mutual respect for prevailing policies and 
opportunities for friendships to develop.
•	 Question – to what extent are activities by international student associations promoted and 
supported by faculty?
•	 Question – are there visible elements of social connectedness through host culture integration 
for international students? (dietary preferences, language supports, familial recognition, worship 
facilities, recognition of (different) national holidays for example).
•	 Question – are ‘buddy’ or pairing schemes operational in the faculty? (where these could be 
friendship or academically oriented).
In considering the nature of the learning process for the international student and their acculturational 
process, the chapter has posed a number of reflective questions for the tutor of international students. 
These questions are particularly acute now for UK HE institutions, as the market for international 
students is highly competitive and the ‘international student offer’ becomes a more visible aspect of the 
faculty’s portfolio.
An operational difficulty arises however in structuring the learning environment for international 
students so that the benefits of acculturalisation are experienced but not at the expense of negating 
the supportive framework offered by conational friendships of similar cultural students (Brown, 2009). 
These friendships are recognised as important in decreasing the likelihood of loneliness and stress in 
international students. Moreover, for the international student these friendships are critical at the initial 
stage of the enrolment of the international student to their programme and faculty. This can extend to 
both academic and non-academic areas of international student life. Even where those international 
students who form class and study groups also recognise the limitations of that conational support 
framework, the linguistic ease of same indigenous language friendships is a significant attractor for the 
formation of these friendships but stress can also be induced as the international student realizes that 
practising English with non-native speakers may actually be to the detriment of their own language 
proficiencies (Brown, 2009). The strength of this conational framework can vary culturally, so the HE 
tutor needs to be able to recognise the importance and strengths of this framework from international 
student class members.

•	 Question – Do you seek to micro manage group activities and group assessments in your classes? 
If so, do not neglect or negate (especially in early sessions of a module for new international 
students) the benefits of supporting and engaging same culture working groups. 
•	 Question – Do you seek and solve problems presented by international students – it is important 
that when an issue is raised by an individual/collective cultural group to a faculty member that 
it is addressed (and does not reinforce a cultural belief that the only effective support comes from 
within the cultural group).
With the development of cultural groups, will also come the risks of group conformity and groupthink, 
in the actions and decisions taken by members of that group. It is therefore a difficult task to determine 
and balance the benefits of an early conational support framework but also seek to support acculturation 
integration of the international student. Yet it is one that the HE tutor must address.
3.4	
Addressing barriers to learning
What has become clear in the preceding discussions, is that learning is not a linear process for any 
individual – it is not a simple matter of knowledge and skill transmission. It is a complex series of 
interdependencies between groups of factors, only over some of which the tutor has influence. To this 
difficulty, we can add a fifth consideration, that of barriers to learning. It was noted above (section 3.1.1 
and section 3.3) that if we view the learning process for international students as being transformative, 
then potential barriers to that learning may become more acute.
All individuals living in today’s contemporary society, operate learning barriers to help them identify 
and filter what information and understanding is perceived as relevant and important (Illeris, 2012). A 
simple example would be the work noted earlier from Jang et al (2009) that focused upon the perceptions 
from Chinese College Students of their teachers PCK. Teachers needed to demonstrate a range of skills 
and knowledge bases, to allow those students to perceive the value of the materials and delivery from 
those teachers and hence to overcome any resistance (and to negate the dismissing of the learning being 
‘offered’ by those teachers).

How you learn
For an international student studying the UK however, this everyday barrier to learning is amplified when 
transformative learning is required. A new and previously unexperienced learning environment now 
demands that the international student must change – perhaps radically – how they learn and acquire 
skills and knowledge to secure appropriate evidence of learning and competence. Illeris (2012) labels 
this barrier to learning as an identity defence. These learners may also exhibit ambivalence towards their 
learning and progression as they are unwilling to relinquish the learning schemata that had previously 
been developed and served effectively in their home learning environment. One interesting observation 
from this discussion is to contrast it with other literature that highlights conflict and cognitive dissonance 
as a source of individual creativity and originality (see for example Gilson & Shalley, 2004). In other 
words, whilst working with international students experiencing transformative learning may require the 
teacher to address significant learning barriers, overcoming these difficulties can result in major learning 
developments and progressions for the individuals concerned.
•	 Question – are you aware of which international student learners in your classes may have the 
most difficulty in adapting to the UK learning environment – and which as a result, may experience 
the most resistance to learning?

Summary
This chapter has sought to present a broad conceptual framework of how we learn (in particular 
sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) with subsequent thought then given to how this might be problematic for the 
international student learner in the UK. A conceptual argument was presented that the international 
student learner experiences learning difficulties because of cultural, contextual and pedagogical differences 
in their transformative learning. These problems were presented in five broad considerations with a 
number of reflective questions (or as we present shortly, actions) that the HE tutor can reflect upon, in 
seeking to improve the learning environment for these individuals.
The considerations:
1)	 Know the international student learner
2)	 Structure the micro and macro learning process
3)	 Prioritize the evidence of originality in international student assessments over achievement 
in academic conventions
4)	 Encourage the sense of self and identity development
5)	 Address barriers to learning
Emergent questions that arise from exploring these considerations and hence actions that the HE teacher 
could pursue to address these considerations are:
From 3.1.1:
1)	 Do you have sufficient breadth of knowledge and skills in a variety of different pedagogical 
methods?
2)	 Have you considered the structure and order of your subject matter materials from the viewpoint 
of the student?
3)	 Do you have an understanding of what skills and knowledge students bring to your classes 
already?
4)	 Are you aware of strengths or weaknesses in that student knowledge – or know where gaps 
are (or likely to be)?
5)	 Are you aware of the qualifications and attainment of students in your class – so you know 
where they are beginning their learning from?
6)	 How often do you check understanding by your students in your class?
7)	 Have you considered the appropriateness of the assessment strategy to meet ILOs?
8)	 Can you offer more flexibility in how ILOs are evidenced by student achievement in your classes?

How you learn
From 3.2:
1)	 What contact (formally and informally) do you have with EAP (English Language) staff in 
integrating both subject matter delivery and discussion of the learning process?
2)	 Have you identified with EAP staff which parts of the programme of study have/will be most 
difficult for the international student learner? And what barrier needs to be addressed?
3)	 Have you ensured that where particular new skills and understanding are being introduced to 
the international student learner, that you have confidence that learner will have the appropriate 
abilities at the right time? (through prior collaboration with EAP staff)
4)	 Is the perception of EAP staff in your faculty or department weak? If so, how could this be 
improved?
From 3.3:
1)	 What is the fundamental evidence sought to warrant a grade allocation to an assessed 
submission? Are you actually looking at or for, the ‘voice’ of the student?
2)	 In your assessment strategies, are you prioritising academic register and conventions above 
evidence of criticality and originality?
3)	 Do you review intended submissions from international students?
4)	 Can you integrate formative learning points in your module where you guide the student to 
value their voice, to help build their identity in this new learning environment?
5)	 Have you considered in your assessment strategies, whether they are UK/Euro centric in their 
application? Do they consider the variety of international students in a given class who may 
find their self-expression difficult in some forms of assessment?
6)	 Can you support the use of the first person (‘I’) in assessed work to encourage originality and 
critical engagement with assessment tasks?
7)	 How often do you undertake formative discussions with your international students – where 
you particularly focus upon missed assumptions in the views of students? 
From 3.4:
1)	 To what extent are activities by international student associations promoted and supported 
by faculty?
2.	 Are there visible elements of social connectedness through host culture integration for 
international students? 
3.	 Do you have ‘buddy’ or pairing schemes operational in the faculty? 
4.	 Encourage (initially)the benefits of supporting and engaging same culture working groups in 
your classes
5)	 Seek and solve problems presented by international students early and ensure this is visible 
to that community.

From 3.5:
1)	 Are you aware of which international student learners in your classes may have the most 
difficulty in adapting to the UK learning environment – and which as a result, may experience 
the most resistance to learning?
To close this chapter, we present below an indicative template that reflects on the 25 emergent questions 
above and shows how a HE tutor might consider and structure a class with a high international student 
make up.
1.	 Identification of the objective of the class – aligned with the aim of the module and its function 
and contribution to the programme of study.
2.	 Express and focus upon any ‘big ideas’ for the class which may reflect an aspect of important 
threshold knowledge and learning. These will follow from the objective of the class.
3.	 Reflect on the audience in the class and their learning needs.
4.	 Are there particular language needs or preparation requirements for your class? Does this need 
to be advised to EAP staff and/or integrated into those sessions?
5.	 Think about how to structure your class – working in blocks of 20 minute periods. 
6.	 Pace the delivery of materials – do not rush.
7.	 Ensure you are able to explain further what you have presented.

8.	 Within those 20 minute periods – identify what parts of knowledge and skills you can focus 
upon but which will continue to contribute to the objective of that block and of the class as 
a whole.
9.	 Try to ensure each opening block period of time is engaging and captures the attention of 
the class.

of the block.
11.	Have you checked the understanding of students in your class as you deliver your materials?

Glossary:
Academic Practice – Is the manner in which the primary components of individual learning are brought 
together. It is the managed interaction between the external environment and the individual, which is 
effected by the manner in which learning is gained and incorporated by the individual.
Mental Schemata – are cognitive frameworks acquired through familial and societal constructs that 
shape our interpretation and meaning of information and the world around us.
Assimilative Learning – is the integration of new information into existing knowledge or cognitive 
structures (mental schemata) without restructuring the current schema. 
Transformative Learning – is changed behaviour that arises through psychological changes, revisions 
of values and belief systems and changes in lifestyle and behaviour in individuals.
Cumulative Learning – is changed behaviour that accrues over a period of time.
Accommodative Learning – are those who learn through interaction and hands-on practice. They often 
prefer acting on instinct using other people’s analysis and interpretation and are often found working in 
team settings. Trial-and-error methods of learning are common.
Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) – This is a framework developed to account for the student 
perception of tutor engagement and competence in education. It has four inputs: The tutors Subject 
Matter Knowledge (SMK), the tutor’s abilities in linguistic instruction (IRS), the awareness of the tutor 
of the aims of education and classroom management (IOC) and the scope to which the tutor understand 
the initial student understanding and that at the end of the sessions (KSU).
Epistemology – the study of knowledge and beliefs.

Culturalist Learning – The interaction of peers (students) in a classroom that facilitates learning.
Abductive Learning – occurs where learning outcomes result from the employment of abductive 
reasoning – which is undertaken from incomplete set of observations and then proceeds to the likeliest 
possible explanation for the set.
Acculturation – the process of cultural change that result from the interaction between two or more 
dissimilar cultural contexts.

TARGET READER – The international student
Aim of Chapter
The purpose of this chapter is to present you, the student, with a guide as to how you will be assessed 
in your academic work in the UK, to identify and manage differences in your previous experience of 
education with that you will find in the UK and to give you strategies and actions to achieve appropriate 
grades in your work. In doing this, this chapter as outlined in the narrative of the book, is not proposing 
to be a skills guide or self-study aid, although these are important aspects of your learning. We instead 
aim to give you an understanding of what your tutors do when they prepare, lecture and then accept 
your work for assessment, in a variety of forms.
Chapters 2 and 3 presented a framework to understand the most important topics that can influence 
the grades you receive for your work. In short, this was how you think and how this relates to how 
you learn, the motivation you have to learn, the environments in which you are asked to think, learn 
and on occasion, be assessed within and the effectiveness of the learning structure chosen by your 
tutors in your studies. These parts of the framework for securing good grades in this book, continue to 
structure this chapter but we want to present to you also within this discussion, personal observations 
and reflections from working with international students for nearly 20 years of how your tutors engage 
with your assessment process.
This chapter will start with a discussion of the assessment environment for your tutors, rather than you. 
In doing this, we hope to give you some understanding of the pressures currently existing within UK 
higher education, which will – either directly or indirectly, shape how you learn (the learning structure) 
and the grades your receive.
4.1	
The UK Higher Education Learning Environment
You may be unaware that over the last 5 years (since 2011 in particular), there have been significant 
changes both in UK Higher Education but also in Higher Education generally as a human activity. The 
changes in the former are strongly influence by the changes in the latter, although each country offering 
higher education to its citizens and international students, chooses to manage this relationship differently. 
For this particular discussion we can note that the UK is at present the third most expensive global 
destination for an international student wishing to study for an undergraduate degree (THES, 2013)9.

Table 4.1: Comparative Global Higher Education Costs (Top 5)
Whilst this in of itself is perhaps of limited concern to you, given as an international student fees for 
study would have been considered in your planning for your studies, what you may be less aware of is 
that for home students (those born in the UK), they are also now being required to pay a similar fee for 
their higher education study. UK Government reforms (HEA Act (2004) and the Willets (2010, 2012) 
papers on HE Sustainability) of the Higher Education sector in 2012 resulted in more flexibility from 
Universities to raise their fees for UK students to a maximum of £9000, which in most cases is very close 
to the fee you are asked to pay for your undergraduate studies.
In the space of 5 years, UK students saw the listed price for their studies for home students rise by 
almost 400%. The main difference in the payment of these fees from UK students to their universities 
compared to you, is that they are able to secure low interest loans from the UK Student Loan Company 
(SLC) and repayment is not required until the graduate achieves a salary in excess of £21, 000 per annum 
(for students starting a programme since September 2012). Nonetheless, these developments created 
a significant amount of change in the UK Higher Education Sector. In short, the delivery of higher 
education began to operate more as a market, where better universities were able to recruit students who 
were willing to invest their loaned monies in the expectation of securing a valuable post degree income. 
This marketization of Higher Education has a number of outcomes of direct relevance to you and is part 
of a much wider development in the global education markets. Perhaps the main consequences being 
observed in UK Universities at this time, because of these changes are:
•	 An enhanced focus upon employability within the programme structures of your study
•	 An enhanced focus upon your university either being research driven – with the expectation 
that this will improve your programme of study OR for your university to have an enhanced 
focus upon learning and teaching (as discussed in chapter 3).

Of relevance to international students (you) as well are two additional changes: firstly that in order to 
secure applications and student enrolments to UK Universities, where possible significant investment 
into the learning environments by UK higher education institutions has been undertaken (although the 
UK in general still has major policy concerns regarding how to fund higher education10) and secondly, 
that in order to be visible in the market place of a bustling 120 or so UK Higher Education institutions, 
league tables were created. More recently Key Information Statistics (KIS data)11 have become available 
to allow potential applicants to see which University and faculty therein is ‘better’ than another on certain 
reported indicators and this can help make a more informed decision regarding where you would like 
to study.
We now arrive at the most important part of this discussion for you. League tables of UK HE institutions 
combine a variety of measurements to generate a ranking. Some of the measurements are relatively slow 
to change or use indicators that your tutors who teach you in class, will have little influence over (such 
as the staff to student ratio (SSR) or the employability of graduates) – other measures however can be 
directly influenced by your tutors. The most important of these for you and the focus of this book – is 
grading. As a small but important aside, Huang (2013) has undertaken a detailed literature review of 
what is known about international students and your career intentions and employability. He finds this 
to be a relatively under researched area despite the important contribution of international students to 
both the institution, host economy and potential benefits to the home country.

How you learn and are assessed
4.2	
Will you be graded fairly?
This is a very simple question, but with a very complex answer.
A recent debate on grading and marking between External Examiners in the UK identified the broad 
problems your tutors will face in assessing you. This debate is important for you to understand as it 
will directly impact on how you prepare and submit your work for assessment, in what discipline and 
against what criteria of assessment.
For your information again, discipline here refers to broadly whether you are studying an arts degree or 
a science degree as there are long established patterns of grading in both broad discipline areas. In the 
former (arts based degrees) – grading rarely in practice uses the full 0–100% marking range (for work 
graded on this scale) whilst science based degrees tend to have a greater use of the full 0–100% marking 
range. Whilst there are reasons for this practice, it is important for you to manage your expectations based 
upon the broad discipline you are studying. The second point noted above is that of your assessment 
criteria. Not all university systems in the world (or even across the UK) employ assessment criteria. 
For those that do you need to know that assessment criteria are the priority areas of knowledge, skills, 
understanding and professional development that you tutor is looking for in your work. You will 
be informed of these criteria in your taught classes (probably via some sort of module/unit handbook 
or guide) and perhaps represented by a table of descriptors against which the assessment criteria are 
matched to % achievement, or perhaps through broad % threshold categories (some examples will be 
presented shortly). For some of you, your module tutors may hold the belief that your work is ‘excellent’ 
for its level of submission (undergraduate) and should be awarded a high grade (>90%) whilst other 
tutors will note that work can always be improved and will grade it high, but less than 90%. You must 
therefore be prepared and aware that marking in UK universities, remains a subjective activity and 
that by joining such institutions, you have agreed to this peer marking system.
A summary of the key issues raised by external examiners during a recent online conversation (April 
2014) on this issue and by a recent HEA publication (Brown, 2004) that specifically explored this area12 
are noted below. These comments are of direct interest to you and how you will be graded. We urge you 
to note the outcome statements.
•	 Marking in arts based degree tends to ‘cluster’ in a range of 30–70% which can arise for a 
number of reasons such as historical patterns, previous practice and the more discursive and 
subjective nature of the disciplines. For you to note – It can be harder to secure a higher 
grade in a social science than a pure science.
•	 Clustering of marks can be made worse by assessment submissions that contribute relatively 
small % to the overall grade for a module/unit studied. This disaggregation of marks is popular 
for example in many first year skills based modules. If you study modules with lots of small 
assessments – it can be harder to gain a higher grade.

How you learn and are assessed
•	 Graded submissions (perhaps like people in general)- tend to perform in a narrow range of 
outcomes making differentiation between abilities and evidenced achievements difficult to 
capture. Most people perform averagely generating average grades.
•	 There is the need for more distinctive differentiation between the classification thresholds 
(e.g. 60–69% and 50–59%) – but there can then be difficulties in differentiating between grade 
allocations in a threshold. Grading in a threshold (following from the preceding point) can be 
skewed by a symbolic comparison bias (i.e. it is easier to allocate a 69% than a 62%, as the unit 
digits (9 and 2) are more easily differentiable than say a 68% and a 67% by the human mind). 
Crisp (2008) has also identified that markers may also evidence other heuristics during the 
assessment process. One such heuristic is an ‘affect heuristic’ whereby an emotional response 
to a submission for assessment can bias the awarded grade to that work or the ‘availability 
heuristic’ which influence a grade allocation by the marker not finding the information required 
completely to make a judgement on a grade, but being able to identify it elsewhere in a response. 
In short you should – Expect variations of grades within classification thresholds between 
your friends because your tutors find it harder to grade between thresholds. 
•	 Some universities employ specific marking grades in their assessments to mitigate the risks 
of symbolic comparison bias discussed above. For example the following values – 8, 18, 28, 
35, 42 45 48 52 55 58 62 65 68 74 78 82 86 94 can be the allocated % grades. Your tutor and 
programme may follow a similar marking structure and system – if you do not know then 
ask your tutors.
•	 It is relatively easy for a module tutor grading your work to say ‘Could your work be better?’ – 
clearly the answer will almost always be a yes, but a better question is to ask – given the level at 
which work is being submitted – has the work met the learning outcomes of the task in a manner 
that has fulfilled all levels of study expectations? If so, the work should gain an excellent mark 
(perhaps 100%). When you receive details of your assessment tasks, ensure you understand 
the assessment criteria and what your tutor wants to see in your submitted work.
•	 Differences between the written feedback for a submission and the subsequently allocated 
grade for that work can occur. As external examiners, the authors have experience of reviewing 
work of colleagues which is wholly positive in its views of a submission outlining no faults or 
areas of improvement. Yet, the grade allocated was then less than 100%. When you read your 
feedback does it always align with your allocated grade?
•	 The allocation of a measured % grade award to a submission introduces potential tension 
and resistance by the marking tutor. This has been labelled as a “kind of cultural resistance to 
absolutes in an arts context” (HEA, Part 2) or “…where the implicit absolutism of the percentage 
scale (of the sciences) is at odds with the inherent relativism” of the arts based disciplines” 
(HEA, Part 4). Always look at the grade you are given and the written feedback – do you 
understand why you have received both?

How you learn and are assessed
•	 The historic academic development of the module tutor and how they approach the marking 
process may itself have established poor and/or unprofessional patterns of behaviour that 
are perpetuated by that module tutor. This may also arise through custom and practice in an 
institution. Whilst this can be difficult to address in your work, expect to see differences in 
how your tutors mark and grade you (Hand & Clewes, 2000). 
•	 The impact of word count limits can significantly skew the quality of a submission as work can 
be written down to the word count limit. Expect different practices in how your university 
and your tutors use a maximum word count for an assessed submission. It is important 
that you understand any potential penalties that a submission that has too many words 
could receive but also that you use the word count you have available.
•	 Awarding high grades for a submission, can result in the inflation of a student’s overall 
performance (i.e. where the student has not been perceived to have performed ‘as well’ in 
other studied areas). As a result, the student exits with an award that does not fully represent 
their ‘average’ performance and which also generate in an incorrect perception of ability and 
performance in the relevant employment sector. Try to aim to gain high and consistent 
grades. Often there are common weaknesses (discussed in Chapter 5) in submissions 
from international students that result in them maintaining a lower average performance. 
Identify those weaknesses and improve them.

How you learn and are assessed
•	 Criterion based marking can help to mitigate the effects of the bunching of grades, but it is not 
adopted by all universities (in the Palatine HEA working paper for example, 73% of surveyed 
UK respondents cited they used such criteria). Instead, assessed achievement based on the 
expectations of a subject expert for what ‘should’ be an assessment worth 40% or 50% or 60% 
etc can also be a common marking environment in which you will be judged. If it is not clear 
to you, how you grade has been determined, always ask your tutor for an explanation.
•	 There is evidence (see the Brown (2004) HEA Palatine report) that the third class degree 
(and awarded cumulative grade profile) is disappearing in UK HE education for the reasons 
cited in the preceding text and in this commentary. There is commensurately a growth in the 
awarding of upper second class and first degree awards. Your tutors are likely to be under 
pressure to ensure that their class performances are good and support the allocation of 
grades typically >60%.
•	 There may well rules and regulations (sometimes called output algorithms) in your university 
that determine how your grades are added together to generate your final degree classification. 
If you do not know if this applies, ask your tutors for this information and guidance.
Further relevant observations of the online debate between external examiners noted that the effective 
awarding of higher grades (in the 75–90% range in particular) should not be undertaken without a clear 
re-organisation of the other degree classification bands for a submission, to help manage the tendency for 
grade inflation to result. What this means is that overall, it can be very difficult to compare the award of 
degree classifications between institutions – but this as noted before, is a major input into the generation 
of comparative league tables of UK HEIs.
Clearly marking and grading your work is not an easy or simple task. As well as the points noted above, 
we need to also consider the following potential issues that may also shape the marking practices of your 
faculty staff when marking your work. These are:
•	 The measured ‘quality’ of incoming students to programmes of study (such as the published 
and actual input tariff) and the perception of the quality of students by faculty staff. In other 
words, if staff expect students to submit quality work as they entered University with very good 
grades, this can influence how well or not, they grade that subsequent work. Your selection of 
your university and programme is important and you need to think about how you compare 
with the advertised student entry profile (tariff points or school and college grades).
•	 The volume of contact time with a student. How often are you actually in a class, with your 
tutor per week per module/course of study? How does this figure differ between universities 
and programmes?
•	 The scope of that contact time – in other words HOW is the time used between you and your 
teachers? Is that time mainly lectures (your tutors talk to you)? Is that time mainly seminars 
or workshops (where you talk to your tutors)?

63 
How you learn and are assessed
•	 As noted earlier, a significant factor impacting upon your achieved grades must also include 
your attendance and motivation (which can vary by class content and/or the tutor concerned). 
•	 The type and validity of selected second marking practices. It is common practice in Universities 
that a small sample of the work from your classes is also looked at and read by another staff 
member. This is usually a moderation process – i.e. the second marker or moderator is 
focusing upon whether the first marker (your tutor) has been consistent in how a grade has 
been allocated across the sample considered. Different universities have different methods 
of second marking – be clear you understand the process for your studies.
•	 Differences between individual staff on what quality is in an assessed submission (whether 
by criterion or norm / gatekeeping / or achievement assessment). You need to be aware that 
every staff member will have different views on what ‘quality’ is (for a detailed discussion 
see the work of Barnes et al, 2001: Allen, 2005).
•	 The historic impact upon you of receiving low and/or high marks13. In other words, individuals 
vary in the extent to which they attribute their success (or failure) to their own abilities 
or their environment.
•	 The extent of supportive training and development for staff of the marking process.
•	 The actual length and duration of the process of assessment for a typical staff member. Your 
tutors may have a limited amount of time to grade each received submission. This can place 
your tutor under significant pressure to maintain both speed and quality of feedback to you.
•	 The order within which work is assessed by a staff member – in other words would you get 
a better mark if you work was read earlier in the assessment process or later? Or if your 
work was being graded after a number of prior good/bad submissions?
•	 The history and legacy of how your teachers, when they were students, were assessed contributes 
significantly to their view of the quality of your submissions (Allen 2005). 
•	 The allocation of a grade from your tutor may also have the strategic aim of trying to develop 
you by encouraging you (and giving you a generous mark) or by encouraging you (by giving 
you a low mark).
HE institutions remain a primary vehicle for the development of higher cognitive, practical and 
transferable skills and have received post 2008, a greater spotlight of public attention on them due to their 
financial requirements and the expectations of innovative and creative outputs in terms of individuals, 
products and processes for multiple stakeholder interests (if you want to read more about this see Yiannaki 
& Savvides (2012)). In short, society is expecting more from Universities by producing better, more 
employable and skilled graduates. Your tutors are tasked with generating a good output from you, so 
that you achieve good grades and that overall, the faculty and University is then reported as being a 
good place to study. Clearly, this can be achieved through considering those issues introduced in the 
introduction to this chapter but also it can result in pressures upon your tutors to mark generously when 
perhaps in a different external environment, they would not have done so. This is called grade inflation 
(for a detailed discussion see Hand & Clewes, 2000: Oleinik, 2009).

How you learn and are assessed
A better term that is perhaps more accurate of the difficulty your tutors face when grading you, is that 
of ‘grade integrity’ (a term developed by Sadler, 2009). This describes the ways in which faculty staff 
are able to reach a satisfactory determination on the quality of an assessed submission. The perceived 
integrity is the extent to which staff are able to have confidence in their decisions is shaped by other 
stakeholders in that marking process for example. Crisp (2008) has explored some of the psychology of 
marking, from the markers perspective for University entry examinations (A levels in the UK). Whilst not 
of direct relevance to your studies it is interesting to note some of the findings of that work as they could 
illustrate further the complexity of the marking process you are participating within. In summarising 
the existing research on the marking process, differences were noted in the use of criteria and norm/
achievement based assessments (discussed earlier) but also markers were observed to undertake a process 
of ‘self control focus’ whereby they consider the situation of writing and the writer so as to establish a 
personal view of the qualities of the work being considered. 
This observation is particularly important because of one key reason for you as an international student, 
that it is likely your language competence will not be as strong as a native domestic student in your classes. 
Thus your written and oral submissions for assessment will (likely) lack some of the linguistical clarity 
of your peers. The importance of language competence for your academic achievements is discussed in 
chapter 5, but here we can consider how will your marker view your language competence? Should a 
submission that is high in terms of originality and concept, receive a low grade because of poor language 
presentation? Or be restricted from achieving a first class grade (>70%) because of spelling or grammatical 
errors? Although the research of Crisp(2008) is not derived from marking in a HEI context, it does 
offer the interesting insight that markers did – to an extent- try to reconstruct the intended meaning 
of a submission for assessment and saw that as an important part of the assessment process. However, 
it was also observed that not all markers in that research undertook that reconstruction with the same 
breadth or thoroughness.
Hence, the extent of accommodation of variations in language competence within assessed work 
is dependent primarily upon the marker and the discourse (knowledge base) they belong to (we 
shortly discuss the marking range given the discourse of your given degree programme). Adherence 
to institutional guidelines tend to be vague on this issue.
However, what is clear at present is that an overall increase in the grades you achieve has benefits both 
for you, but also for the faculty, the institution and to a more limited extent, the wider community. 
In other words, your assessments are not only subject to the stated assessment criteria but one of potentially 
many, none stated and implicit assessment criteria. You need to be aware of this and maximise your 
chances of securing a good grade through knowledge of these pressures.

How you learn and are assessed
Whilst it may not be a universally agreed statement, the experience of the authors of this text strongly 
suggests that there can be variation in why YOU achieve the grades you do as:
•	 There is NO best way to assess you.
•	 There is NO guarantee that the grade achieved for a submission would receive the same grade 
if marked by another tutor.
•	 That the tutor marking your work will use a mix of marking and grading methodologies (so 
if you study a science you will be assessed by more examinations and by more numerical 
activities than if you study a social science (this is discussed further shortly)). Whilst this may 
seem obvious the result is as discussed previously, marking in the sciences refers to an absolute 
scale – there IS a right answer to find. Marking in the social sciences is more relativist scale – 
YOU must make your answer seem a possible right answer. 
•	 The experience of the tutors who assess you (in knowing how to assess students – especially 
international students) will NOT be the same.
•	 Tutors will have different perceptions of what quality is in your submissions. Indeed observation 
of how tutors mark clearly shows very different method and styles. Once you know how a 
tutor will mark you, you will have guidance in what you can do to try to ensure you meet their 
expectations of what a quality submission looks like (for a detailed discussion of this issue in 
particular see the work of Bloxham & Boyd, 2011).
•	 The institution where you are studying WILL have a particular set of policies about how to 
determine your final degree classification once all your assessments have been marked. These 
output algorithms and they are not the same across institutions.
There is evidence that also clearly shows there is a wide variation in mark achievements and method of 
assessment by faculty and by institution (Yorke et al (2000: 2002)) and supported by the data analysis 
from the SACWG (Student Assessment and Classification Working Group of Higher Education Quality 
Council (HEQC)). This difference has been called adaptation level theory (Barnes et al, 2001) where 
in different academic disciplines students (and staff) that are less academically competitive migrate to 
those degrees that are perceived as less demanding in order to secure higher exit awards. Students can 
therefore move to programmes that are perceived to offer a better chance of a better degree award. 
So, a student might gain an excellent grade in one discipline but would not have done so well in another 
discipline, even with the same effort, engagement and commitment of time. Two questions for you to 
consider therefore are:
1)	 WHY do you want to study your degree?
2)	 WHICH is more important – the degree topic area OR the degree grade?

4.3	
Assessment criteria and norm / achievement grading–your difficulties
There is evidence from observing marking practice, that the scope of what is assessed to construct the 
awarded mark for your work is typically not sufficient nor clearly articulated in that mark construction. 
This makes communication to the student or other stakeholders sometimes unclear (Kelly, 2008: Allen, 
2005). In other words, the grade/mark you receive may itself not be clearly explained to you. Allen 
(2005) and Bloxham & Boyd (2011) argue that because of these difficulties, staff can generate outcome 
marks which do not seem to follow a given marking methodology or practice, as they seek to justify an 
awarded mark and reward those students who live up to the staff member’s expectation of what a ‘good’ 
student is. It can be helpful therefore to try to be an active participant in the learning environment, 
say the classroom, not only as it will contribute to the construction of your understanding, skills 
and knowledge, but it will also increase your visibility as an active (and ‘good’) participant to the 
tutor of your class.

How you learn and are assessed
It was noted earlier that you may be assessed generally according to either criterion based assessment 
(Frame of Reference) or assessment based on a (subjective) sense of student achievement (sometimes 
called gatekeeping, norm assessment or achievement assessment) compared with the achievement of a 
given cohort. One research exploration of how tutors view and deploy these two approaches to grading 
identified that where your module and tutor is more focused upon analytical skill and time management 
development, then ‘gatekeeping’ or norm grading was more commonly used (Barnes et al, 2001). In 
other words, tutors were more likely to grade you according to a perception of effort and engagement 
of you and the cohort, in those taught areas emphasising analytical skill development. Similarly, 
where the tutors in your course are concerned with how much you understand (your knowledge base) – 
gatekeeping grading was more likely to be used than criterion based grading. Criterion based grading 
tended to be used in personal skills development areas – typically for example of first and second year 
skills modules in Business Schools.
A deeper concern in this difficulty for your tutors is the question of what the achievement of a grade 
means – both to you but also to important external stakeholders (such as actual or potential employers). 
Some HE Institutions reflect upon this problem by also developing Personal Development Planning (PDP) 
achievements in parallel with grade achievement. In terms of what type of approach to marking your 
work you can expect, the following table 4.2 – adapted from Barnes et al (2001) and drawing upon the 
disciplinary classification work of Biglan (1973) – outlines what marking and grading priorities might 
be argued to exist and to which you may be exposed.
Biglan’s ‘Soft’ and ‘Hard’ labels denote the discursive vs non discursive nature of the discipline which is 
also reflected in Barnes et al (2001) work of preparadigmatic vs paradigmatic study respectively. In the 
latter, there is a clear and largely consistent and agreed body of knowledge to know, understand and 
utilize, whereas in the former, this is more open to change, discussion and challenge. In paradigmatic 
disciplines, marking and grading is made against an absolute scale (thus more likely to operationalise 
the full 0–100% marking range) and in doing so control access of students to the professional discipline. 
In preparadigmatic disciplines the marking scale is more likely to be relativist and criterion based. 
In table 4.2 these labels have been used loosely where a discipline can be argued to be more or less 
paradigmatic or preparadigmatic.

What you need to know about how you will be graded
In the preceding discussion, a range of issues were identified that impact upon the tutors’ marking 
process. By being aware of these issues, you will be able to consider how to engage with the assessment 
process most effectively, so as to be able to maximise the opportunity for a better grade.

How you learn and are assessed
Issue
What you can do
You are studying in the 3rd 
most expensive country for 
higher education
You are important to your university. Your success in your grades is an 
increasingly important factor in your faculty’s success. Ensure you:
•	
Speak with your tutors regularly
•	
Work with your tutors on your work
Your concerns and pressures are relevant.
Think about your 
degree – are you studying a ‘soft’ 
or ‘hard’ discipline?
Understand that your grade will typically be within traditional ranges and that 
these operate across the discipline in all universities.
It is harder to gain a higher grade in a social science than a science in general.
Understand what method of 
marking will produce your 
grades – is it criterion based?
Most universities in the UK use criterion based assessment. 
Always ensure you understand the criteria against which you are being judged- 
if in doubt – ask.
Always ensure your grade and feedback is clearly related and derived from these 
criteria. If this is not clear – ask.
Always ensure your written feedback complements your allocated grade. If you 
feel it does not – ask.
Understand what method 
of marking will produce 
your grades – is it norm or 
gatekeeping based?
Your grade will be generated by consideration of how much knowledge you 
have understood and evidenced in your answer and by how you compare with 
the average submission for that assessment.
Are your modules/courses/units 
of study made of many small 
assessment activities?
If yes – it is harder to gain an overall good grade in these modules/courses/units.
It is easier to gain a good grade in a module/course/unit that has few 
assessments.
Tutors find it harder to grade lots 
of work within a degree threshold
Don’t be surprised if – after working with your friends on similar submissions, 
you all achieve similar grades.
Different tutors will engage in the 
assessment process differently. 
There is no external standard 
against which UK assessment is 
presently judged.
It is very difficult to compare marking between tutors and you will not find much 
faculty support to investigate when you find tutors marking very differently. 
Study how your tutor will mark you and maximise your opportunities to 
be ‘visible’ for those tutors – e.g. attending classes and contributing, clear 
preparation before class, asking questions in class etc.
Check if your submissions are 
word count limited
Ask your tutors how they implement any word count system – it is possible that 
any words after the limit for example would not be read at all by your tutor? 
Consistency in your grade 
achievements helps establish an 
expected norm of behaviour.
Although many Universities operate an anonymous marking policy – this is 
in practice very difficult to achieve. Tutors get to know you, your student ID 
and in some assessments will know who you are during your assessments 
(such as presentations and closely support research work). Establishing a clear 
consistent grade performance helps to establish an expected norm for you for 
future assessments.
Your grades achieved will not 
always clearly indicate your 
degree class achieved
Many universities operate ‘output algorithms’ – where your grades from your 
modules and different years of study (if applicable) are combined to generate 
your final degree class. Ensure you understand this process, so you know exactly 
what the impact of a grade will be for you and what you may need to achieve, 
to secure the overall degree class you want.

How you learn and are assessed
The selection of a university and 
programme of study will shape 
your grades achieved.
Your entry to a programme in a given faculty in a given university, generates an 
expectation of a particular level of performance and achievement. In selecting 
your programme consider how well or not you match the general profile for 
admission. If you are significantly below that profile, you may struggle achieve 
good grades.
How much of your success or 
failure is because of you?
The grades you will achieve are influenced by the grades you have achieved 
and to what extent you feel your success (or failure) is attributable to you or 
to your learning environment. If you believe it is more because of the learning 
environment, then see the next point.
Consider how you learn and your 
preferred learning environment.
Universities can differ in how much ‘contact time’ (or the time staff are working 
with you in an activity) they offer on their programmes. Ensure you know what 
this amount of time is and how it is used, in your programme.
Consider how you engage with 
your tutors in the undertaking 
of research projects – typically 
completed in the final year of 
undergraduate study.
Even where explicit criterion based assessment is evident, the grading of final 
year research projects can tend to exhibit individual norm based bias marking. 
To mitigate this, being visible, active and speaking with your tutor(s) regularly 
becomes particularly important to support a higher grade achievement.
After having considered in detail, some of the difficulties your tutors will experience in marking and 
grading your work, in the next chapter we look at research to help understand your learning process 
and resultant actions that can help the international student (YOU) achieve and sustain higher grades.

How you learn and are assessed
Summary
This chapter has highlighted a range of grading issues and practices that influence how your tutors will 
assess work you submit. The issues for you to be aware of in the assessment types you will be required 
to undertake is presented and discussed in the next chapter. It is important though for you to identify 
and recognise the external environment in which your work will be assessed and where appropriate and 
necessary ensure your work is viewed as positively as possible.
To achieve this, you must appreciate that you are a valuable asset for any faculty and university. Both 
your financial and cultural contribution to your faculty and in your programme is welcomed. More than 
previously perhaps, this is an active consideration in shaping academic and personal support for your 
studies. Against this background of a changing higher educational environment in the UK, you need 
to be aware of the pedagogical and epistemological boundaries of your topic for degree study. Studying 
a social science degree will tend to result in a different marking scale (relativist) and different range of 
likely % grades being made available than if you are studying a science based degree. Within your study 
area, you should expect variations of tutor practice in how they both assess you (Chapter 5) and in how 
you are consequently graded in those assessments.
Where criteria based assessments are used, ensure you are fully aware of what those criteria are and how 
they are to be applied to your work. Where you are being assessed by a norm or gatekeeping framework, 
it is important to evidence your understanding of your own discipline as well as be a visible member 
of your classes to show the expected professionalism for your degree area. The chapter concluded by 
highlighting a number of key areas that you should consider and focus upon to ensure your work has 
maximum opportunity to secure a high grade.
In the next chapter we consider the breadth of assessment methods that you will be exposed to and some 
of the key issues to note (and avoid) so as to maximise your grade opportunities.
Glossary
Key Information Sets (KIS) – This is the collection of data that describes the performance of a programme 
or set of programmes against a range of criteria (such as staff student ratio, % achievement of quality 
degrees, graduate employability and so forth).
Criteria of Assessment (and Criterion Based Assessment) – these are typically descriptors of what 
tutors expect from a submission of work so as to evidence the achievement of a given learning outcome 
for a module or course of study.
Peer marking – a system of assessment where you defer to other individuals as qualified to comment 
knowledgably upon a topic of interest.

How you learn and are assessed
Symbolic Comparison Bias – a heuristic (i.e. mental activity) whereby your tutors find marking within 
a classification threshold (say 50–59%) more difficult than marking across thresholds (say allocating a 
58% rather than a 62%).
Moderation Process – the (typically internal) process whereby a sample of assessed work is reviewed 
by a colleague to ensure marking has been consistent and where criteria are used, that they have been 
applied equally fairly to all the sampled scripts. This process does not usually result however in changes 
to any grades allocated.
Grade inflation – this is the phenomenon arguably experienced across multiple educational levels of 
study, where both internal and external pressure for improved class, programme (award) and institutional 
performance, can influence the allocation of higher grades to student submissions.
Output algorithm – this is the (usually statistical) process whereby Universities determine the final 
awarded class for a degree. The process can vary between Universities significantly. 
Adaptation level theory – this is the observed tendency for students to select areas of study that are 
more likely to generate a higher output award than other areas of study.
Paradigmatic knowledge (and preparadigmatic knowledge) – this is the body of knowledge argued 
to be fundamental to a competence in a given area of study.

identifying actions to improve 
your grades
TARGET READER – The international student and the tutor of the international student
Aim of Chapter
The purpose of this chapter is to present you with both an overview of how you can understand your 
engagement with your learning and with your assessments. This will include consideration of the different 
assessment methods you will be expected to undertake during your studies but also propose how you 
can manage these assessments so as to gain the highest grade you can achieve. In developing your ‘grade 
strategy’ the chapter will consider current evidence of how you, the international student, can adapt 
to different learning environments and why and where in particular, difficulties in that adaptation can 
impact upon achievements. Recommendations to manage these difficulties will be outlined.
5.1	
Your entry to UK HE
In joining your programme of study, it is likely that you will be entering a different learning environment 
from the one you are familiar with, which places upon you different expectations of your abilities and how 
they will develop as well as different expectations of how you will engage with your studies and in your 
assessments. Your faculty and the programme you are joining will be comprised of students potentially 
from a large variety of learning environments, some of which have also been subject to assessments 
under external pressures for grade inflation to ensure appropriate ranking and league table positioning 
of HEIs (Friedl et al, 2010 and see chapter 4). There is the likelihood therefore that student enrolments 
into your programme of study, will have varying abilities and it is not uncommon that if you join the 
first year (or Foundation Year) of your programme, there will be a number of basic skill and knowledge 
based courses and modules in your studies to ensure common levels of skill and understanding. To clarify, 
you can join a degree programme at a number of possible entry points and these are labelled below:

Position in your 
programme of study
Entry point description
Year 0 – Foundation Year
This is a year of study (sometimes called pre-certificate) that is offered to UK/EU 
students with perhaps insufficient grades to join Year 1 and/or other students (such as 
International students) who have not completed sufficient equivalent years of study as a 
UK student would have at the end of compulsory education
These programmes tend to be a blend of skill and knowledge based activities, with often 
language support and development for international students whose first language is 
not English.
Year 1 – First year
This is the entry point for most UK/EU students to a first degree programme. Typically the 
study is focused upon a mix of important introductory skill and knowledge bases as well 
as supporting the expected different levels of abilities and understanding associated with 
an eclectic intake of students.
Year 2 – Second Year
Entry to this year of study – sometimes called advanced entry – is feasible for applicants 
who have already studied either a higher qualification post School/College or have 
studied at least one year at an equivalent institution on a sufficiently similar programme. 
Year 3 – Third (Final) Year
Entry to this year of study – sometimes called advanced entry – is feasible for applicants 
who have already studied either a higher qualification post School/College or have 
studied at least two years at an equivalent institution on a sufficiently similar programme.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Particular learning and grade achievement difficulties arise for ‘advanced entry international students’ 
who join their UK undergraduate degree programme in the second or third year and these are considered 
later in this chapter. All international students are typically expected to manage the rigours of academic 
study without the benefit typically of the local support mechanisms afforded to home students (such as 
a family and an accessible pre university friend network). For advanced entry students, this challenge is 
especially difficult even when compared to an international student joining at Year 0 or year 1, as those 
students will have developed at least a partial friend/support network in place by the time they progress 
to higher levels of study.
5.2	
Developing a strategy for achieving and sustaining high grades
In considering developing your grade strategy – we need to identify a reasonable aim and appropriate 
methods of achieving that aim, cogniscent of the factors which impact upon your effective learning 
(as outlined in chapter 3). To begin to explore this further, we will explore some recent insights into 
these issues.
Yang et al (2006) in their study of the cultural adjustment of international students from collectivist 
cultures such as China, studying in Canada (when compared with Canadian students) identified a 
number of key influences upon expected grade achievement and personal growth at University that are 
worth noting here. This research identified that your cultural adjustment depends both upon your 
individual self-esteem but also your language self confidence in contributing to a higher psychological 
adjustment to your new learning environment. Barron et al (2007) undertook research focused upon 
the expectations of international postgraduate students about to commence their studies, noting that 
language competence was also identified by the cohort as a likely learning barrier to address. 
Certainly the experience of the authors working with International students (particularly those from 
collectivist cultures such as China, Japan and other Far Eastern countries) is that there is a tendency 
for this language adjustment to be ‘managed by outsourcing’ whereby the same mono-ethnic or mono-
cultural study groups are formed, with an informally nominated ‘speaker’ for that small student body. 
This makes it very difficult both for the tutor to engage all students in a given class, as some are shielded 
by their compatriots, but also difficult for those students to gain the confidence to subsequently develop 
personal self-esteem. Your effective adjustment to your learning environment requires both that 
you develop language confidence as well as knowledge confidence. Achieving increases in both areas 
supports effective adjustment in your new studies.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
You can expect in your university, that there will be language support classes (either as part of your 
curriculum or as after class support for example). These are typically identified as English for Academic 
Purposes (EAP) courses. These are therefore offered to address both your confidence and your language 
competency. You are strongly advised to participate in these classes even where you may not be 
required to and where it may not be clear to you how they fit with your programme of studies. As we 
present shortly, the stress you feel when adjusting to your new learning environment, the availability 
(or otherwise) of social support and your language proficiency – all contribute to your weakened 
psychological adjustment and weakened grade achievements (Yang et al, 2006) and an EAP course can 
provide you with the linguistic tools and confidence to address this adjustment.
Your cross cultural adaptation to your new learning environment comes from two personal outcomes – 
your emotional and affective adjustment to your learning environment and your behavioural adjustment 
to that learning environment (we take these two adjustments (emotional/affective and behavioural 
adjustment) – to define ‘cultural adjustment’ in this chapter). Your ‘grade strategy’ therefore needs to 
consider how you will manage both of these adjustments (behavioural and cultural). Critically whilst your 
language confidence is related to both these adjustments in a complex manner (called self construals 
by Yang et al (2006)) it is an important aspect for you to focus upon and not to ignore. We will also 
consider further what your ‘adjustment’ is and could be and what you can do to improve it in this chapter.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Glass & Westmount (2013) have explored the relationship between academic success and cultural 
adjustment of international students, in their research work in the US. They focused upon the sense of 
belonging a student maintains with their learning environment, particularly in the areas of: their student 
support network and the balance between student challenge and academic support. Their research was 
relatively large in scale and scope (>1200 students, a third of which being a non-domestic stratified 
multinational sample) and considered a variety of study programmes. Significant evidence was offered 
that developing a sense of belongingness, which is more than just intercultural interaction, had a 
significant impact upon grade achievement for international students (see also the study of Seabi & 
Payne, 2012 and the commentary of O’Keefe, 2013).
Glass & Westmount (2013) further identified that cultural events, leadership programmes and community 
service activities that are typically offered as part of your university experience, all seek to enhance a sense 
of belonging and impacted upon grade achievements. These activities also helped to mitigate negative 
aspects of cultural adjustment such as racism. Developing programmes to support intercultural 
integration across a variety of social and academic issues, that steadily increase in depth of engagement 
over a programme of study, were identified as being effective in increasing intercultural adjustment 
and interaction, but seem to be of limited support for developing a sense of belonging (for a detailed 
narrative see Glass & Westmount(2013). O’Keefe (2013) also comments on the importance of a sense 
of belonging for both first year students and postgraduate research students. In particular he cites 
that Universities must themselves take care to not exacerbate any disconnection and thus weakened 
student performance, through increasing reliance upon larger classes, poor staff : student ratios and 
online materials – in the hope of managing budgetary problems.
In an interesting perspective that allows us to consider further the cultural adjustment concept defined 
earlier, Seabi & Payne (2012) explored the personality constructs of first year students to seek to identify 
if there were preferred types that supported the transition to University. In short, their focus was on 
whether there are preferred personalities that are more likely to support a sense of belonging in a degree 
programme and thus then support higher grade achievement. This can be particularly important in trying 
to identify if you maintain a supportive (or not) identity processing style (IPS) that will support your 
progression to University. If not, then seeking support to address this (your IPS) is argued to help with 
your experience, studies and finally grades.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Your identity is a cognitive construct shaped by both an individual and interpersonal context (see Trafimo 
et al, 2002 for a more detailed discussion). In a given class of students it is reasonable to expect there to 
be a wide variety of identity constructs. As a construct, identity is open to change and influence indeed, 
the use of the phrase ‘identity processing style (IPS)’ (Berzonsky (1990) cited by Seabi & Payne (2012)), 
refers to the strategies you use to engage with or avoid the tasks of maintaining your sense of identity 
within your learning environment. Three processing style styles outlined by Berzonsky (1989) in Seabi 
& Payne (2012)14 were described as:
•	 Informational – If you are a student with this IPS you would be confident in seeking information 
relevant to progressing your work and not overly concerned with if/how this tests your self identity. 
Possessing this IPS supports self exploration which is valued in a University setting and such 
students maintain a higher sense of belonging to their programme and faculty, supporting higher 
grade achievements. Tick this box if you think this describes you: ☐
•	 Normative – If you are a student with this IPS you prefer to manage conflicts with your sense 
of belonging and your environment through internalised reflection so as to be able to meet the 
expectations of your tutors and significant others, rather than as a series of external explorations 
of that environment (such as with the informational IPS). One observed outcome of this IPS is 
whilst you can progress to university – in order to meet the pressures and expectations placed upon 
you – your adjustment and development of a sense of belonging in that environment can manifest 
as a lack of external engagement, an intolerance of ambiguity and the emergent perception of 
differences in values causing the internalised conflict to be threatening. Tick this box if you think 
this describes you: ☐
•	 Diffuse avoidant – If you are a student with this IPS – you lack internal direction and are more 
likely to respond to external pressures upon you (e.g. deadlines). Thus you will be more likely to 
neglect your studies until required to and you will seek to avoid problems and dealing with them. 
You may also maintain a negative view of your academic success and progress. Tick this box if 
you think this describes you: ☐
It can be argued from the discussion so far that your achievements will be derived from your cognitive 
function (how you perceive, act and understand – e.g. the IPS discussion above) that generates your 
intrinsic motivation for study (a sense of mastery of your understanding for normative and informational 
IPS and for diffuse avoidant IPS there will be a preference for grade achievement shaped by extrinsic 
motivation (Remedios & Lieberman, 2008)) and the non-cognitive attributes of your environment (the 
teaching style, structure and focus in your learning environment). One explored area of this relationship 
is that of trait theory.

Managing Assessment – identifying

Trait theory was an early research focus in many human activity areas trying to understand if personality 
traits are positively or negatively associated with a given behaviour (e.g. the need for control trait with 
entrepreneurship and leadership). It is a somewhat controversial area of study because of its reliance 
upon individuals being able to self-report their own behaviour accurately, that the focus tends to be 
upon describing rather than predicting behaviour and being limited in clarifying why that behaviour has 
happened. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that aspects of your personality, just as with the IPS discussion 
above, do affect your grade achievements. For example, Geramian et al (2012) examined which personality 
traits were positively correlated to the academic achievements of 146 international postgraduate students 
studying at a Malaysian University. Their work followed that of Mathiasen (1984), Mouw & Khana (1993) 
and Teachman (1996) (– all of which were cited by Geramian et al (2012)) where positive correlations 
were found between openness and agreeableness traits and with grade achievement. In their study 
in Malaysia, positive correlations were identified for conscientiousness and openness with grade 
achievement (in this case cumulative grade point average (CGPA)) and certainly conscientiousness 
and openness traits fit well with the informational IPS discussed earlier.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
It is not suggested though that you or any given student is or should operationalise one IPS, as these 
are indicative concepts – but they are helpful in identifying how and why you may find difficulty in 
your new learning environment. It is more likely that you will operationalise hybrids of these concepts. 
Nonetheless, we can apply some broad cultural criteria to them to provide some guidance on where to 
focus energies to support the development of a strategy that could maximise your grades. For example, 
for students from a collectivist culture, a normative IPS could perhaps be more expected as influential 
in shaping the engagement and sense of belonging felt by the student, with the consequent impact upon 
grades. This is also presented shortly as a form of ‘deep learning’. A faculty could then look to address 
the individual tensions and concerns raised by a normative IPS so as to be able to support the potential 
for improved grade achievement. In other words, the expectation of student centred learning, student 
self-study and student directed learning can be in conflict with the engagement and approach to 
learning and belonging maintained by students with a normative IPS. Universities could develop an 
audit or screening tool for new arriving international students to complete so as to be able to identify 
varying IPS, which could be a very helpful and informative method of identifying and targeting student 
achievement needs and ensuring that teaching styles accommodate those identified preferences.
In reference to the learning discussion in chapter 2, we can see clearly that your effective learning 
then requires both the internal and external conditions of you, the learner to be considered (Illeris, 
2012). An IPS acts therefore as the interface between these two conditions. It is we hope clear, that 
your academic success cannot be divorced from your social experience nor your learning environment 
presented during your studies. This context is very important, arguably more so that an historic cultural 
preference towards a learning style. Your belongingness to your programme and studies is a concept 
that describes how much you feel part of your ‘campus community’. It has also been described as a 
drive to form and maintain lasting and positive interpersonal relationships. There is also evidence that the 
genders experience this sense differently – with men pursuing this through group activities and women 
through dyadic relationships – i.e. relationships of many one-to-ones (see Baumeister & Sommer (1997) 
cited by Glass & Westmount(2013)). Anecdotally, this may also impact upon learning activities such 
as classroom attendance where Pownall (2012) identified a gender difference as a contributing factor 
shaping attendance at a large Business School in the UK.
Belongingness is the one of the most frequently cited factors shaping academic success for international 
students studying in a new learning environment (Hausman et al, 2007; O’Keefe, 2013) and has emerged 
as a parallel area of interest for universities accepting international students, alongside the more typically 
accepted resilience based models of intercultural adjustment15. Resilience is best understood as 
describing individuals who are compassionate, flexible and in touch with their environment so that 
when facing difficulties or set backs, they can continue to move forward (Van Breda, 2001). It is “the 
capacity to maintain competent functioning in the face of major life stressors” (Kaplan, Turner, Norman, 
& Stillson, 1996: 158 cited by Van Breda, 2001: 5).

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Resilience models of cultural adjustment emphasise identifying protective and supportive factors in a 
learning and social environment that aid and secure your resilience, as an international student (Pan, 
2011). Cultural identity and ways of living, working and interpreting your environment have been 
identified as important aspects of resilient individuals – but it is not always clear how a University can 
manage or support this (see McCubbin et al. (1998) cited by Van Breda, 2001). Wang (2003)16 undertook a 
detailed analysis of the cultural adjustment of international students in American Universities identifying 
that important resilient characteristics were gender, your father’s education, country of origin and 
how you thought about yourself in these environments (see the earlier discussion on IPS above). The 
outcomes of Wang’s (2003) work were addressed to both the (US) University and to the international 
student – you. We reproduce (summarised) accounts of those findings below:
Recommendations to Universities were made as:
•	 Provide training for staff who work with international students, on resilience. 
•	 Ask international students to complete resilience questionnaires to help them identify their 
strong and weak resilience characteristics17. 
•	 Offer lectures on resilience and provide professional advice to international students on how 
to enhance resilience. 
•	 Identify existing resilient international students at the institution and ask them to tell of their 
experiences to other international students. 
•	 Focus on groups which tend to have more adjustment problems. Statistical analyses from Wang 
(2003) indicated that:
○
○Asian students tend to have lower resilience scores than students from other continents. 
○
○Middle Eastern students tend to have more difficulties in English language competency 
and Student Inter-Activity; 
○
○Asian students tend to have difficulty in English language competency; 
○
○African students tend to have problems in Living and Dining in the new learning 
environment.
•	 Offer international students special preparation on the general culture of the country and the 
academic culture at the university.
Recommendations to you, the international student were (again from Wang, 2003):
•	 Start the adjustment process well before ever arriving in your host country.
•	 Your adjustment is a process – not an event. It will take time, effort and focus. 
•	 Ask yourself what you feel are your strengths and weaknesses are going to be in studying in a 
new learning environment.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
•	 Maintain an open mind in that by joining a new culture of learning you will need to appreciate 
different ways of viewing an issue or problem that could be very different from those of your 
home country.
•	 Seek out opportunities to work with other international students particularly those who might 
view their new learning environment in a more positive manner than yourself. 
•	 Try to establish social networks to ask for help to overcome difficulties but be wary if those 
networks are only constituted from other international students of your nationality. 
•	 Look for opportunities to engage with the local community (through for example volunteering 
at events or for charities) or in the UK through the HOST scheme (whereby international 
students can live with a UK family at a subsidised rate).
You will probably encounter some of the above identified university actions during your welcome week/
induction process to your university and degree programme (the key points of which were outlined in 
chapter 2). It is a common practice amongst Universities in the UK to offer a series of activities, usually 
spread out over a couple of weeks at the start of your programme if you are new entrant. It is less common 
that you will encounter considerations and support for cultural adjustment along the recommendations 
in the second list above that focus upon the sense of belonging discussed in chapter 4.
As an example of the university actions supporting cultural adjustment, here is the scope of the 
international induction programme from the institution of one of the authors:

Table 5.1: Resilience Factors for International Students
Whilst the above (in practice) resilient framework for cultural adjustment is quite common for UK 
universities, it is less common for UK universities to address international student belongingness – 
with as noted an effective social programme of engagement and support out of the classroom and not 
associated with any particular assessment or learning activity. You should ask if this is available at your 
institution, how it functions and how you can engage with it. At the institution of one of the authors, 
international buddy schemes have been implemented where for example, you are paired with a higher 
level international student to offer social support and guidance during your studies. Your grades will 
improve as a result if you participate in these activities.
Lebcir & Bond (2008) have also explored the academic achievements of international students in UK 
universities, albeit in the narrower sense of those studying project management. In their research and 
reading, they highlight that often UK learning professionals view you, the international student, as 
typically deficient in some area(s) – hence the predominance of resilience based orientation activities 
for new international students to address your perceived strengths and weaknesses. A viewpoint that 
maintains you as being deficient, is then articulated in practice as a problem needing to be addressed 
for this group of students – rather than asking a more fundamental question of what is a good learning 
and teaching strategy for you (and others) in this learning context (Burns & Foo, 2013)? In particular, 
consideration of how to adapt learning and teaching styles – outlined in chapter 2 – to suit the learner 
and their learning environment is less considered and this is an important consideration for you.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Remedios & Lieberman (2008) offered an interesting analysis of the influences upon grades in general for 
university students, where teaching style and resultant stimulation of your interest was the most important 
factor in whether you (the student) enjoyed the module – not the final awarded grade nor the workload 
of the module upon you the student. What is apparent from emergent evidence from chapter 2 and 3 
is that your grade success is a mix of internal and external factors but moreover, this is a complex 
interaction of personal, cultural and environmental factors requiring both institutional engagement 
but also your commitment and recognition of the need to consider your learning style and whether 
it is sufficient to support your achievements now – in the UK.
If we were to try to summarise the areas of attention that you need to consider as important in shaping 
your effective learning style as well as the resultant teaching style of your tutors, we could present the 
following (Wang, 2003: Remedios & Lieberman, 2008: Lebcir & Bond, 2008: Saebi & Payne, 2012):
•	 Language competence (both written and oral) for assessment in particular – LANGUAGE
•	 Language competence in the four skills areas (reading, writing, listening and speaking) in 
general – LANGUAGE
•	 Sense of belonging to your programme and campus/university – LANGUAGE & 
COMMUNICATION & BELONGING
•	 Level of entry and entry qualifications and profile of you and the university that you have joined 
(some aspects of which were discussed in chapter 4) – PRIOR STUDIES
•	 The pedagogy of marking your work by your tutors (the focus of discussion in chapter 4) – 
ASSESSMENT
•	 Finding methods to communicate across cultures – student to student and student to tutor – 
LANGUAGE & BELONGING
•	 Developing competence and comfort in the academic discourse of your study (language 
and concepts) – which is a particular concern for advanced entry international students. – 
LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION
•	 The extent to which the student identifies and acknowledges their cultural adjustment to their 
learning environment – LANGUAGE, COMUNICATION and BELONGING
•	 The extent to which the faculty recognises the different challenges that cultural adjustment 
can bring to international students and identifies bespoke support strategies (i.e. via IPS) – 
PRIOR STUDIES
•	 Study skills in general – especially note taking during taught sessions becomes problematic 
and a slower process for you, the international student – PRIOR STUDIES & LANGUAGE
•	 Lebcir & Bond (2008) offer evidence from De Vita that the method of assessment can also 
disadvantage you the international student, with examinations being identified as particularly 
problematic – ASSESSMENT
•	 The extent of personal interaction between the international student and tutor in a workshop/
tutorial environment shapes your effective learning – ASSESSMENT & BELONGING & 
COMMUNICATION

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
In the above points, we have extended the proposed framework of Lebcir & Bond (2008) to identify 
in total (and following the discussion in chapter 4), 5 interdependent factors argued to shape your 
grade achievement (through influencing either the teaching style, your learning style or your learning 
environment). These are:
1.	 Language. Aside from the above issues, it was noted earlier in chapter 3 that there is evidence 
the accuracy of expression of a concept / idea by an international student should be of more 
merit than the accuracy of that expression.
2.	 Communication – focusing upon cultural adjustment. The teaching style and pace are particularly 
important for international students. The structure of the session needs to be strong (clear 
opening/closing and content) and with effective use of the VLE to make materials accessible. 
For classes with a high proportion of international students, more effective engagement with 
the learning materials is facilitated by the tutor through presenting a significant volume of 
materials in a structured manner and extensive use of the VLE. There is a reliance upon this 
conduit of knowledge more so that books for that course/module. Effective perception of 
improved engagement with learning materials is also improved by your faculty offering tailored 
support to international students.
3.	 Prior studies and profile of entry.
4.	 Assessment methodologies. There is evidence of a strong bias towards mathematically oriented 
assessments (perhaps unsurprisingly) being favoured by international students.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
This overall framework helps understand and explain international student grade outcomes follows from 
both the work of Lebcir & Bond (2008) but also Kettle (2011). In the case of the work of Kettle (2011:1) 
the concept of academic practice is outlined as a comprehensive discourse framework to explain “the 
interface between university academic requirements and international student learning and the crucial 
role that teaching has in facilitating the experience”. In short, the scope of the concept –and the focus 
of much of this book for you – has been to recognise that your learning experience- and by implication 
the achievement of your grades within that learning environment – depend both upon structure (your 
programme, faculty and institutional frameworks) plus agency (your tutors, their teaching style and 
resources and your motivation (whether intrinsic or extrinsic)) and as such, it is their inter-relationships 
that we should focus upon.
One of the major implications of this perspective of the international student experience is to view the 
more traditional supportive learning environments (discussed previously as resilience models) that focus 
upon developing generic applied academic skills or cultural adjustment skills (such as writing, referencing, 
registering with a doctor or opening a bank account for example) as incomplete and insufficient as they 
are narrowly focused and lack scope through limited relevant inter-relationships with the international 
student’s actual experience environment. Academic practice identifies the need to frame desired aims 
through multiple points of action and through participatory approaches. We have already spoken of the 
need for you, the international student, to be ‘visible’ during your classes – both to ensure your tutors 
can associate you with your performance but also to ensure your learning experience is developed, by 
‘inhabiting’ the classroom, elaborating on the issue at hand and finishing your contribution (Kettle, 
2011). By ensuring you undertake these actions for example you will have secured your voice in the class, 
worked within a controlled but supportive environment, and confidently explored your understanding 
(see the earlier discussion on informational and normative IPS). An example from one of the authors 
may help illustrate this important point.
A module on Strategy was a core module taught across a number of Business Degree 
programmes in the first semester of the final undergraduate degree year. It is a well 
established module, with developed materials and taught by an experienced staff member 
often receiving high internal and external praise. It was assessed by two coursework 
assessments: 1) a critical comparative essay on two (randomly selected) schools of thought 
on strategy and 2) an applied critical report evaluating the strategy of an organisation 
using a framework derived from the different schools of strategy introduced in the first 
assessment. For the selection of the organisation in (2) students were able to choose any 
organisation (with tutor validation) or choose from a selection of prepared case histories 
upon which to build an analysis.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
As a final year module of circa 100 students, approximately 25% are typically international 
students with a large majority of these students joining the module as advanced entry 
students (that is they join their programme as final year students only) after completing 
the equivalent of two years of university study elsewhere.
After work was received from the first assessment, it became clear to the markers that 
this year’s group of advanced entry students was struggling to generate academic output 
that competently addressed the learning outcomes and assessment criteria. During oral 
feedback to all students, the tutor identified the assessment weaknesses to those students 
(all of them) and a programme of additional support to work with the students to address 
those weaknesses in this area of business skills and knowledge was developed. At this time 
of feedback, a majority of the students acknowledged the need for development in their 
work but later, once the support classes were organised – none were willing to commit the 
time to attend and address identified weaknesses.
One international student member grasped the initiative and volunteered as the de facto 
spokesperson for this group (although this student did not need that additional support). This 
student canvassed his peers to encourage them to attend the scheduled sessions, but still none 
were interested or willing to attend. The tutor was unable to understand why this was the case 
and students refused to accept the help that the tutor was willing to give additional time for.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Now in considering the above actual scenario, we might be able to understand why there was resistance to 
the offer of additional support – in that it was perceived in a narrow, disjointed manner by the students. 
This was supported by feedback from the student canvasser above:
•	 Students perceived the support classes as focused upon strategic management knowledge 
rather than more broadly in terms of other inter-relationships (which was the actual intent of 
the proposed support classes).
○
○Where those relationships included language competence and that with competence 
comes the ‘right to speak’ in class.
•	 Student motivation was mixed, with some students reported as being intrinsically motivated 
(with information or normative IPS) but also some students being extrinsically motivated (by 
their grade achievement) and diffuse avoidant IPS.
•	 Students had not previously been encouraged to ‘occupy the classroom’ and now, by specific 
selection, they were and hence evidenced resistance.
The combination of these issues, which gives some insight into the concept of academic practice, may 
help explain why there was resistance to the offered programme of support. It strongly also suggests a 
need to review – especially as a final year module with a relatively high % of direct international student 
intake – the academic practice of that module. This can be proposed as a guideline for other modules in 
a similar situational context. Such actions for the international student tutor might constitute:
•	 Creating a safe class environment in which expression is valued and recognised and where 
weaker linguistic expression are not viewed negatively or punitively.
•	 Recognising that international students working in same nationality groups should not be 
immediately dismissed as inappropriate, but welcomed to help create the environment where 
confidence can be developed.
•	 A recognition of different motivations within a given group of international students and 
that these should be differently addressed – whether through the reward of grades or that of 
self-enlightenment.
•	 Scaffolding knowledge in a manner accessible to international students
•	 Maintaining consistency in the structure and delivery of materials to ensure this is habitualised 
in the module.
•	 Addressing potentially difficult aspects of the identity of the students – for example to think 
critically and develop with students, a sense of valued self (which can be different from being 
a good student).
•	 Ensuring that as required, the skills needed to ‘learn how to learn’ are available in the module’s 
materials.
•	 Look to learn the names of international students and invite their participation in class activities 
to help gain ‘voice’.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
As with all students on a programme of higher education, we cannot view your experience in a narrow 
sense, but as one that necessarily is complex and interdependent with your social environment. Academic 
achievement is not one solely linked to language proficiency and nor solely the responsibility of the 
student (Kettle, 2011).
Overall, the aim of this discussion so far has been to identify to you aspects of your learning in an 
international environment that can help or hinder your success in that environment. Your University 
will probably offer varying mechanisms of support to enhance your cultural adjustment and perhaps (but 
less so) mechanisms of belonging to your programme and your faculty. However, as the international 
student, you need to also appreciate that whilst you need to avail yourself of these opportunities and 
participate, your success is also dependent upon how you recognise and address your weaknesses in 
that new learning environment. These twin foci need to be considered by you. Figure 5.1 overleaf 
presents a summary of the interdependency of factors shaping your effective learning and subsequent 
grade achievement, whilst table 5.2 identifies emergent actions for you to undertake or to determine 
their operation in your HEI. The factors in figure 5.1 can also become more acute if you join your new 
international university as an ‘advanced entry student’. In the next section, some of the implications of 
where you join your programme of study are considered before the actual assessment methodologies 
are reviewed to identify how you can maximise your achievements.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
5.3	
Joining your programme as a Foundation or First Year student
After considering the generic factors shaping your grade achievement (summarised in Figure 5.1), we 
now narrow our focus to particular concerns for groups of international students with firstly that for 
new year 1 or Foundation year students.
 Star & MacDonald (2007) presented a review of South Western Australia University’s development of 
their first year experience. Their focus was on improving how to manage and work with a large diverse 
multinational cohort of students and much of what is outlined as good practice, you may experience in 
your first year at your host institution. As outlined in chapter 4, UK universities are operating in complex 
and changing environments and as a result, the diversity (in terms of nationality, ability and context) 
of the cohort in which you study will also be changing. The entry profile of the university and faculty 
you have joined is particularly important to consider as this will, as noted in chapter 4, contribute to 
the expectations of your tutors over the quality of your output for assessment. As a new international 
student, your tutors will tend to assume you possess:
1.	 Appropriate learning skills
2.	 Appropriate language and linguistic skills
3.	 Appropriate critical discourse skills
4.	 Appropriate information literacy skills
5.	 An awareness (and willingness to address) identified weaknesses in your skills and competences 
(see the earlier discussion on ‘resilience’ and belonging)
One area you will need to reflect on in your learning, is the tension between the extent to which your 
tutors provide information and deliver it to you as packaged knowledge (transmissive learning) and / 
or in a constructivist teaching style (see chapter 2), where you work with your peers to construct your 
understanding from your activities. This may be very different from your previous learning environment. 
It is also not necessarily the case that there will be a uniform approach to teaching and learning with all 
your tutors, although this is recommended from the work of Star & MacDonald (2007). For example, in 
the institution of the authors, constructivist learning is an emerging theme across all the levels through 
the use of simulations and practice-based learning situations addressed in particular through off campus 
residential activities, but it is not a common nor uniform practice.
You should also expect pedagogical shifts in your learning environment which promote the earlier 
introduction and integration of research informed teaching and research oriented learning in class, 
although this may itself depend upon the institutional strategic focus (discussed shortly). Scaffolding of 
your learning and the use of threshold concepts18 as important pedagogical practices are also becoming 
more prevalent. The once standard transmissive pedagogy of learning in universities (in other words, 
learning by listening to the presentation of the tutor) is losing its traditional pre-eminent position, as 
Universities and cohorts change their constitution and strategies.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
One further consideration for you to think about in your programme of study is the mix of teaching 
and research staff in your classes – are there particular difficulties that you would need to be aware of 
when studying in an environment that is a blend of teaching and a research orientation? Wood (2009) 
examined this question and associated literature importantly stressing the following:
•	 Good researchers do not automatically make for good teachers. If you recall the point raised in 
chapter 4 about the expected entry profile for students joining a university then in a research 
intensive university you may expect to be taught by active researchers and/or perhaps at lower 
levels of study, by advanced doctoral students.
•	 There is a limited evidence of a correlation between high staff research output and effective 
undergraduate teaching.
•	 The likely effective integration of research with teaching is one that follows a constructivist 
pedagogy where taught knowledge is viewed pluralistically and interpretively.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
So the expectations upon your skills and abilities differ between those types of universities you may 
attend (whether research or teaching focused). Wood (2009) citing Griffiths (2004) further offers a typology 
of relationship between research and teaching in undergraduate programmes (and universities) as being:
•	 Research led teaching
•	 Research oriented teaching
•	 Research based teaching
•	 Research informed teaching
Hence as we move down the listing previously, the contribution of the research output of staff and their 
engagement in their research process is lessened in the content of the materials taught, or in other 
words, at the start of the listing there is strong focus upon the research process as a source of teaching 
materials which then evolves to one where teaching is wholly student focused. Arguably these perspectives 
somewhat simplify the relationship between research and teaching maintained by your tutors in your 
studies, particularly if we view teaching as a process, rather than as an outcome or deliverable package 
of knowledge. In other words, much of the difficulty for you will be how your programme and faculty 
construct the learning environment in which taught and research constructs are examined – as discussed 
in chapter 4. It seems clear that you need to be able to consider the statement of whether you know 
how your faculty and your institution view this relationship? Has it been identified and articulated? 
How does it manifest in the taught programme you are commencing?
Wood (2009) also presents an example of good first year practice (based on an undergraduate award in 
Digital Media) in addressing this relationship from the University of South Australia. In that example, 
the focus on the first year redesign was on the scholarship development of students in the areas of:
•	 Discovery
•	 Teaching and Learning
•	 Integration of concepts
•	 Application of concepts
•	 Reflective analysis – especially of professional practice
•	 Problem solving
•	 Team Working and communication
The intention in this scholarship approach was to create a learning community that involved you with the 
need to understand paradigmatic knowledge (or key threshold and critical knowledge) of your discipline 
but also to participate in research based assessments and reflective research practice with your peers. The 
most significant challenge for you if you join an institution with this focus will probably be the sense 
of increased freedom and creativity that your assessments encourage as they move away from a set 
task with narrow defined and prescribed parameters. This may be very different and heighten your 
anxiety if this is not what you had expected. It may also be very different from your previous learning 
environment if you are joining your programme at an advanced level.

Managing Assessment – identifying

This tension you may feel and experience will also vary by the discipline you are studying at your 
institution. In other words there could be tension between the ‘academic’ aspects of your studies and 
the ‘practical’ aspects of your studies, shaped by the programme of study and your perceptions of what 
you expect that programme of study to be like (Wood, 2009).
5.4	
Joining your programme as an Advanced Undergraduate student 
(Years 2 and 3)
The difficulties experienced by new foundation (Year 0) and first year students upon commencing a 
programme of HE study exist for advanced entry students as well but with additional assessment concerns 
to note. It is likely that as Transnational Education (TNE) and Cross Border Education (CBE) grow, there 
will be increased numbers of international direct entry students joining first degree programmes of study 
at advanced entry points in the UK. Securing an advanced entry point is dependent upon evidencing 
prior appropriate education and/or experience (which is then accredited against the learning outcomes 
of the programme). Expected skills and competences for this group of students will encompass the 
earlier listing given above then of:
1.	 Appropriate learning skills
2.	 Appropriate language and linguistic skills
3.	 Appropriate critical discourse skills
4.	 Appropriate information literacy skills
5.	 An awareness (and willingness to address) identified weaknesses in your skills and competences 
(see the earlier discussion on ‘resilience’ and belonging)
However, there may be assumptions on the part of the joined institution that the items (1–5) above are 
individually present, but we should note that progress will have arisen in a different cultural learning 
environment from UK HE (such as a further education college or International HEI). Thus items (1–5) 
may be weak and/or missing in individuals but such students may also have the comparative disadvantage 
of an under developed peer network or a secure understanding of the rules and regulations of the joined 
HEI as the social input into ‘belongingness’. Brown and Holloway (2008) and Edwards et al (2010) in 
work cited by Lilleyman & Bennett (2014) identify that academic anxiety and stress are at their peak in 
the first 3 months of study for an international student generally, which then gradually reduces over the 
next 9 months. Clearly though, this only amplifies the difficulty faced by an advanced entry international 
student who may (if joining the final year of an undergraduate programme or a one year postgraduate 
programme) only just becoming comfortable working in a new learning culture, as they finish their 
programme! This area of advanced entry student learning is relatively under developed19 (Barron & 
D’Annuzio-Green, 2009) but existing materials highlight some key concerns. In moving to a joined HEI 
from an FEI, cited student difficulties can include:

97 
Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
1.	 Perception of less approachable and accessible staff.
2.	 Stricter time frames for work and less flexibility.
3.	 Less familiarity with the variety of pedagogical techniques used. Quan et al (2013) highlighted 
that this was a primary first difficulty encountered by direct entry international students. 
4.	 Higher expectations of the work asked for by HEI staff from international direct entry students.
5.	 Lower levels of independence and self-belief in the quality of produced work – which arguably 
follows from (3 and 4) and is a critical component of Figure 5.1.
6.	 An increased potential for you, the student to have additional familial concerns to manage
7.	 Feelings of isolation and worries over developing student relations (particularly problematic for 
international students). This seems to also apply within the international student cohort – so 
that international direct entry students struggle to integrate with existing international students 
(those who joined the HEI in a previous year) (Quan et al (2013)).
8.	 Language – the issue of language has been discussed as a significant learning barrier so far in 
this chapter – but for international direct entry students this brings additional concerns because 
of the speed at which the tutors talk often with unfamiliar accents can make engaging with 
that tutor difficult, but it is critical given the increased importance of higher years of study and 
reduced time to gain familiarity with those voices. Existing international students who joined 
previously, will have had time to become more familiar with those issues.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
In response to these difficulties, HEIs can offer bridging sessions to ease the transition and other 
targeted support as well as monitoring the achievements of DE students and their feedback through 
their programme. However, HEI resources are constantly squeezed given the focus on the demands of 
the majority of new students, in other words, the new year 1 student body at the start of an academic 
year20. In summarizing the existing literature on this theme, Barron & D’Annuzio-Green (2009) refer to 
evidence that if you are a member of this group of students you are potentially more likely to feel 
their identity challenged than other established year groups (those progressing from earlier years of 
study within the joined institution) and experience ‘academic anxiety’ (Quan et al, 2013). This anxiety, 
as was noted in chapter 3 and is discussed further in this chapter, can be a major barrier to effective 
learning by the individual. Indeed, if we reconsider the elements of effective learning outlined in Figure 
3.1, for a direct entry international student – concerns for the engagement of that student with their 
learning can manifest in all five elements of: the rationale and basis of learning as the student moves to a 
likely different learning culture at the joined institution, that there may be different internal motivations and 
very likely changed external conditions, that there are likely to be different pedagogical practices unfamiliar 
to the international direct entry student and therefore that learning will be a significant challenge that the 
international direct entry student will not be able to rise to. As Quan et al (2013:417) referring to Zhou 
(2008) and Foster (2008) cite the, 
“…learning experience, cognition and habits Chinese students acquired in their home country 
have significant influences during the early stages of their stay at UK universities (Zhou 2008). 
The listening-driven teaching system in China is hugely different from a discussion-driven 
tutorial system in the UK, so the academic adjustment period is often protracted…”
HEIs have attempted to address some of these concerns for (international) direct entry students, 
through for example clear and distinctive induction and early support processes in place to meet mutual 
expectations (of both the students and HEI staff concerned) and that this ideally persists through the 
‘honeymoon’ period to support an acceptance of the new learning environment by you, the student 
(Barron & D’Annuzio-Green, 2009).
Nonetheless, there remain significant concerns that the international advanced entry student does not 
understand why for example, a grade (especially when it is a failing grade) is given to them for a piece 
of assessment (Lilleyman & Bennett, 2014). This can be exacerbated by a ‘fear of failure’ too and a level 
of academic anxiety that whilst peaking at the start of your programme of study, may continue to both 
increase and decrease throughout your period of study (Brown and Holloway, 2008)21. Indeed, the ‘fear 
of failing’ can manifest as stress which exacerbates that same fear.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Zhou and Todman (2009) found a similar result in their interviews and questionnaire sampling for 
a group of Chinese international postgraduate students (IPG) joining a UK HEI, that adjustment 
patterns and the management of academic anxiety varied across individuals to an extent that it was 
difficult to generalize. However that work did identify that IPG students arriving in groups rather than 
individually, managed the acculturation process more effectively. It would seem important therefore 
that your pre-departure activities should ideally be managed by your new HEI so that you are ensconced 
early and with others, in your programme experience.
5.5	
Joining your programme as an International Postgraduate Student
Moving on to consider the international postgraduate (IPG) student in more detail much of what has been 
identified in 5.3 and 5.4 will also be a concern shaping your effective learning. A focus upon the effective 
learning environment for an IPG student though is not as well understood as that for the international 
undergraduate student market (Gao, 2012). Important differences between the different levels of study of 
the programmes focus upon the additional costs of postgraduate study and the importance of independent 
research within those programmes. In the case of the former, the perception of programme cost upon 
student engagement perception is presented in key literature as a concern for the IPG student dependent 
upon who is paying rather than the price per se (Barnes, 2007 cited by Gao, 2012).

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Brown and Holloway’s (2008) research on a large group of new graduate students (at a Southern UK 
HEI) identified a number of issues regarding their HEI experience (many of which are again common 
for international students):
•	 The initial arrival and commencement of the programme evidenced IPG students with fear, 
anxiety, disorientation and depression – despite some evidence of excitement too. A period of 
significant upheaval was common with a primary goal of developing communication abilities 
quickly and effectively.
•	 The individual experience of international PG study was subsequently dependent upon:
○
○Previous experience of international study and prior studies.
○
○Pre-arrival preparation including linguistic (re)fresher courses and support for the 
journey to the UK.
○
○Interaction strategy – with the initial activities of forming monoethnic groups to alleviate 
feelings of loneliness, but which then potentially hinders cultural learning and linguistic 
development when strategically managed by you.
○
○Cultural similarity between host and home environment.
Whilst it may be that not all undergraduate and IPG students can endure the academic anxiety and 
personal pressures of international study, the marketability of the experience is increasingly recognised 
by organisations seeking individuals comfortable working across cultures who will have developed a 
more multicultural sense of self and identity (Brown and Holloway, 2008). This is certainly an area that 
can be developed further by UK HEIs.
Terraschke & Wahid (2011) also highlight that you as an IPG student, as with undergraduate international 
students, similarly benefit from undertaking English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses at the 
start of (and during) your programme of study (when compared with those that did not undertake 
an EAP preparatory course) – both for the benefit of improved linguistic expression, but also as that 
improved expression supports you being able to state and more clearly understand how you learn, 
address assessment requirements (through for example more adept use of formal written language), 
feel more confident within your work and generally manage the demands of your programme of study 
more effectively. It is worth noting however, that assessments (particularly) examinations were cited by 
both IPG study groups (those having taken an EAP course and those that had not) as a major concern. 
In other words it seems that the EAP course did not address that form of assessment anxiety in you, the 
international postgraduate students.

Managing Assessment – identifying

Phakati (2008) similarly offers empirical evidence of the assessment value of undertaking an EAP 
preparatory course for IPG students, in an analysis of a group of Chinese postgraduate students (n=125) 
half way through an Australian postgraduate programme. In that work, language proficiency, reading 
efficiency and strategic reading of materials22 are presented as accounting for 22% of the assessment 
achievement by the student23. Sun and Richardson (2012) examined the learning approaches of Chinese 
IPG students in particular and to what extent their learning reflects existing understanding of either:
1.	 A deep approach to understanding the meaning of materials – where you focus upon seeking 
meaning to materials, relating ideas and have an interest in both ideas and their use. We might 
identify this learning approach as the Informational IPS from chapter 3.
2.	 A surface approach aimed at memorising the materials – where you focus upon organising 
your study with care to maximise use of time, are clear on what assessment demands are and 
monitor your achievement against those demands. This description does not wholly reflect 
either of the three IPS presented in chapter 3. We might identify this as a partial engagement 
with the Informational IPS but with clear selective engagement.
3.	 A strategic approach aimed at obtaining the best marks – where you focus upon the relevance of 
your work, you seek to memorise materials that seem relevant but you have no clear association 
between them, your efforts focus upon received prescriptive guidance and are motivated by 
the risk of failing rather than by achievement. We might identify this learning approach as the 
Diffuse Avoidant IPS from chapter 3.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Phakati (2008) has suggested that strategic reading is a practice of Chinese IPG students and of course this 
text is seeking to identify how (3) can be addressed for you. Sun and Richardson (2012) identify that for 
their sample, the chosen learning approach was shaped by your perception of the quality of your course 
and its academic context. In terms of this last point, there was limited evidence of ‘rote’ learning evidenced 
by the Chinese postgraduate students when compared with non-Chinese postgraduate students. It was 
the context of learning – and ‘whatever works’ – strategy that seemed to delineate between adopting 
deep, surface or strategic learning and potentially IPS. Fitkov-Norris and Yeghiazarian (2013) reach 
a similar conclusion in a more general study of IPG students studying a general business management 
programme – that cultural and educational backgrounds are not a dominant feature of the realised 
learning strategy deployed – that learning choice is context dependent. They did however identify that 
kinaesthetic and auditory learning were commonly preferred learning styles for IPG students and that 
students benefit from a teaching style that used different methods to present learning materials.
The benefits to you of undertaking an EAP course are further evidence by Elder’s (1993) research cited by 
Phakati (2008) on this topic (across a smaller sample but wider institutional basis than Phakati (2008)) 
suggests that the benefits of EAP accrue at the start of a programme of study, where those that have 
not undertaken the preparatory course require the first semester to acculturate and develop the skills 
and competencies that EAP otherwise seems to offer. As we have noted, this is also the suggestion from 
Brown and Holloway (2008) albeit shaped by a range of unpredictable personal factors. 
Wright & Schartner (2013) suggest that of the additional factors shaping successful IPG student 
engagement, a critical one is that of intercultural engagement with indigenous students – yet this is 
arguably the most problematic to deliver from an institutional perspective – because of the perceived 
language competency of the IPG student. The creation of buddy and mentoring schemes can be 
implemented by HEIs to help address this weakness. A further comment by Wright and Schartner 
(2013) underlines that difficulties encountered by IPG students are similar to those of final year direct 
entry undergraduates, by virtue of having a very limited time in which to acculturate to the joined HEI 
learning environment.
Furthermore, Wright and Schartner (2013) argue that the lack of interactional engagement by IPG 
students results in limited interaction time and that “…participants’ expressions of external and internal 
barriers reflect a sense of being caught at a threshold, in conflict between their capacity and choice to interact. 
We suggest that in certain cases, such as intensive 1-year master’s programmes in the UK, the combination 
of external and internal barriers, even for proficient and motivated students, may be just too high to 
cross without greater support” Wright and Schartner (2013:125). The reduction in academic anxiety 
is dependent to what extent your sense of ‘success’ in your studies and experience is attributed to 
external and internal factors of that experience (Brown & Holloway, 2008). This makes it difficult to 
identify the postgraduate ‘sojourn’ as being typical at all.

Managing Assessment – identifying

Proposed actions to address this which could be evidenced in the HEI include:
•	 Greater on-going constructive support and training for you, the international student before 
and throughout your period of study, to help you manage as successfully as possible to cross 
the threshold to successful international study. 
•	 Encouragement to take advantage of opportunities to speak with and interact with members 
of the local English-speaking community even before arrival for your academic sojourn. 
•	 Construction of web-based communities (for example, using resources such as university pre-
arrival online chat rooms, or recruiting a group of informal online mediators to engage with 
you pre and post arrival).
•	 Encourage a wider involvement for you within and beyond the academic programme, (e.g. 
mixed-language study groups for credit-bearing work, setting up native-speaker ‘buddy’ links 
with other international students, ensuring international students are actively engaged in 
university social or sporting programmes, or informally encouraging you to pair up with 
English-speaking roommates in order to boost much-needed opportunities for interaction in 
and outside the classroom. (Wright & Schartner, 2013: 126).

actions to improve your grades
In terms of programme level outcomes, perhaps what might be the key distinguishing issue however 
between the IPG student from the undergraduate international student is the increased focus upon 
independent research through the dissertation (which is typically a significant final credit bearing part 
of most taught UK masters programmes). Indeed Nguzi and Kayode (2013) suggest that the (failure to 
complete the) dissertation is the single largest reason for non-completion of postgraduate programmes 
of study. Brown (2007) has explored some of the expected difficulties that IPG student dissertation 
supervision entails of24:
1.	 Time pressures
2.	 Language difficulties 
3.	 Insufficient critical analysis in the written submission
4.	 Significantly more personal difficulties than those reported for Home PG students
Some of these concerns may be surprising to note, given that progression to the dissertation stage of a 
taught masters programme requires the successful completion of the preceding classroom based elements 
of learning and that a significant period of time will have elapsed from the commencement of the 
your programme. However, the dissertation tutor can indirectly unwittingly adopt the role of personal 
supervisor and through ongoing personal contact, develop an understanding of persistent issues and 
concerns affecting you which they may or may not feel competent to manage. The passage of time may 
also be a hinderance for your academic achievement as this may have allowed interactional patterns of 
behaviour such as mono-ethnic interaction, to have become dominant for you, inhibiting further oral 
and written English language competency development. Expectations by the superviser may also result 
in the need for significant amounts of time to be spent in addressing linguistic weaknesses which is 
not usually available or allocated to a PG supervisor and who may not be used to offering that level of 
support and prescriptive structure to learning. As a result both you and your supervisor may approach 
the dissertation process with different preconceptions of the role of each other through cognitive cultural 
dissonance. Brown (2007) and MacDonald (2014) suggests that tutors need to consider repoliticizing 
and deconstructing the supervisionary process to accommodate the diversity of learning styles you and 
other IPG students will exhibit.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
It has been noted previously that the selection of an international HEI to attend, establishes preconceptions 
both about you, the international student with tutors of that institution but arguably also with you, 
about what you may expect education to be like at that institution. This is potentially important on two 
fronts – firstly as an IPG student you are more likely to be aware of HEI ranking both in country and 
internationally (Priporas, 2011) and secondly it places a requirement on HEIs to actively consider this 
aspect of their corporate marketing (Wilkins and Huisman, 2013). Priporas (2011) further clarifies that 
in his work examining Greek IPG students, University branding that stressed the following attributes 
constituted an appealing offer:
•	 Ranking
•	 Accreditation
•	 Employability and career aspects
Overall, whilst the framework in Figure 5.1 outlined the generic factors influencing grade achievement 
upon commencement of a degree programme, aspects of this figure are more or less emphasised 
depending upon your point of entry to your programme.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
In the table below, strategic actions that you could undertake from this discussion and figure 5.1 can 
be summarised:
Influential factor
Recommended Action(s)
Prior studies
Expect different abilities of students within your programme and entry point.
Motional 
and Affective 
Adjustment and 
Communication
Development of social networks will take time – try to initiate these before you depart your 
home country – getting to know and work with others will make your cultural adjustment 
faster and easier in your host country and impact positively upon your studies.
Communication
View improving your English language as not a class or unnecessary activity – it will help both 
with your produced work for your studies but also your confidence and self esteem
Language and 
Communications 
and Behavioural 
adjustment
Working with culturally similar international students at the start of your studies is a good 
thing to do, but try to ensure this is not your only source of student interaction and that you 
broaden your cultural engagement with different ethnic students, as your studies progress.
Communication 
and IPS
You will not feel comfortable or even perhaps happy, until you develop a sense of belonging to 
your programme and institution. This means both engaging with your studies and with other 
activities that enrich your study experience. Make sure you look out for these.
Language and 
Communication 
and IPS
How you engage with your studies and seek to progress them – is influenced by your IPS 
and what you personally view as your motivation for your studies. Your IPS is also related to 
your approach to learning. Reflect on your motivations to identify how you can maximise 
your grades.
Prior studies 
and IPS
Being open and agreeable to developments and new experiences support better grade 
achievements.
Resilience and 
Belonging
Engage with your University’s induction but be aware this is not sufficient alone for effective 
engagement with your programme and cultural adjustment.
Communication 
Working in groups with other international students supports your learning and adjustment as 
well as encouraging you to approach your learning environment more positively.
Assessment and 
fear of failure
Modules you enjoy can be more important than how you are assessed within them – as the 
teaching style can match your learning style helping to achieve better grades.
Assessment and 
fear of failure
Think about your learning style and how you most effectively engage with and understand 
your studies.
Emotional and 
Behavioural 
adjustment and 
communication
The more you engage with home students in your courses, the more likely it is you will engage 
successfully with them and support the achievement of higher grades.
Voice and 
belonging
In all your classes – an important aim for you is to be visible and secure your voice in your 
classes but do not aim to do this too early in your classes. It may take probably a full semester 
before you acquire this confidence.
Communication
Look ahead to your classes on the local VLE and identify the structure of the materials you will 
be presented with.
Communication
You will encounter different teaching styles – some of which will be difficult for you to access. 
Ask your tutors for materials in other formats if possible.
Assessment
Identify those modules with qualitative assessments as these are those which you will struggle 
most within your assessment in general.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
Influential factor
Recommended Action(s)
Communication 
and Assessment
Look out for your tutors to signpost key knowledge and understanding in your classes. 
Acquiring this understanding will be critical for you to grasp a fuller understanding of 
your courses.
Communication 
and Language
Look for opportunities in your courses to be visible and safely practise ‘your voice’.
Assessments
The more research focused your courses is, the more you could expect variations in the 
uniformity of your tutors in the class room – this can result in less prescriptive guidance for 
your assessments.
Communications
Ask your tutors how research shapes your class materials.
Belonging 
and emotional 
motivation
Academic anxiety and the fear of failing can be significant barriers to securing higher grades.
Communications 
Expect to adapt your learning style to find a ‘whatever works’ method.
Assessments
Reflect on whether you feel your academic success is because of your efforts or those of 
other factors.
Table 5.2: Summary of Factors shaping International Student grade achievement
5.6	
Forms of assessment and International Student difficulties
It is important to realise for your own esteem, that whilst there may be a perception that you as the 
international student are deficient in some knowledge and skill areas by your tutors but we concur 
with the observation of Burns & Foo (2013) that a better view of your abilities is that the UK learning 
environment values those abilities less, than your home environment. To be studying in the UK as an 
International student implies that in your home country, you are a high achiever. A focus on self awareness 
and adjustment – as discussed in this and the preceding chapter – has hence been our focus. In our 
experience, common areas of your learning abilities that require attention for the UK HE environment 
tend to be:
1.	 Independent research
2.	 Extended academic writing
3.	 Research strategies for collection of materials
4.	 Critical evaluation of research materials

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
The ability to demonstrate competence in these areas is a key contribution towards an improved grade 
performance in your assessments. There are many texts on study skills you can find and review which 
will provide some support in your awareness and development of these areas, but we feel this is a 
necessary but insufficient approach to try to address grade performance. As we have argued in this 
book, the academic practice of your engagement and that of your tutors, needs to be the wider focus. 
The recent work of Burns & Foo (2013) explores this wider focus in their development of the Formative 
Feedback Intervention (FFI) for a key research module whereby a small part of the intended work for 
the assessment was reviewed and formal guidance offered to the student, prior to the actual submission 
of the work. In their research, they found this manner of engagement effective in giving confidence to 
you, the International student – especially for final year direct entry candidates who have little time to 
culturally adjust. If this is not a practice in your programme area, approach your tutors and ask to see 
if they would engage in this formative style learning process?
How you use the feedback you receive from your returned assessments (in whatever form that is), is a 
particularly important aspect of your learning, but one that is not as understood as perhaps it needs to 
be by both you and your tutors. Should you receive comments stating weakness in your work (such as 
any of the four areas identified previously for example), then ask yourself ‘what does this mean?’ To an 
extent, the comments from your tutors are ‘easy’ to provide but may mask far deeper ontological and 
epistemological difficulties – i.e. how you see the work around you and how you give it meaning. Indeed 
they should be developed in conversation between staff and student, to explore the nature of academic 
strengths and weaknesses and in so doing, construct mutual awareness and understanding of necessary 
knowledge and skills. If this is not undertaken and feedback remains transmissive only, this could be a 
significant barrier in securing higher grades for your work. It is one we try to reflect on shortly, in the 
assessment type discussion.
Perhaps two final comments to note are that whilst we are focusing upon the grade you achieve, we do 
not wish to negate the value of feedback and neither should you. There are ongoing academic discussions 
about the merit of marking criteria (see chapter 4 for a more detailed discussion and Nichol & McFarlane-
Dick (2006) cited by Burns & Foo (2013)) and the construction of a summative grade diverting attention 
from the messages in feedback or generating egos. The second point to note concerns the experience 
of one of the authors:
As part of a review of grade achievements, in one of the Business Schools of the authors, 
a survey of threshold students was undertaken. These were defined as students currently 
achieving mean grades just below the next classification of degree awards (so students 
achieving a mean grade of 48–49%, 58–59% and 68–69%).

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
In discussions with the students achieving 68–69%, a reflection of feedback received 
identified a common concern of ‘professional writing style weaknesses’. A formative 
feedback activity was undertaken whereby the students agreed to send to the author a 
paragraph from a recent submission which would be reviewed and rewritten by the tutor. 
The rewritten paragraph would then be reviewed with the student to identify differences 
between the two versions of the work. In a relatively short period of time, the students 
concerned were able to integrate the differences in style and subsequently consistently 
secured first class grades.
An effective constructivist approach to learning can be relatively efficient with appropriate identification 
of concerns from feedback received. In short, work with your tutors and do not ignore feedback or rely 
solely upon your grade as a measurement of your achievements or otherwise.

Managing Assessment – identifying

5.6.1	
The examination
International student performance is generally higher in examinations than other forms of assessment 
(Fuchs & Wossman, 2008) primarily due to shifts in assessor expectations over research contributions, 
writing style fluency and accuracy and presentation of examination answers (especially in the ‘soft’ 
disciplines). In practice, examinations are in some capacity always timed assessments. They can possess 
different rubrics (their assessment rules) and with in some instances be like coursework assessments where 
you receive an assessment task before the examination. These are often labelled as open examinations. 
Similarly, you can be assessed through closed examinations, where you have no prior knowledge of 
the content of the examination prior to the assessment day and are not allowed to use any additional 
materials during the examination. In between these two forms of examination are a variety of other 
assessment rubrics:
Open Examinations – Type I – examination 
questions are pre-released (ahead of the 
examination date) and you are allowed 
to use your notes and books during the 
examination period.
Open Examinations – Type II – examination 
questions can be either pre-released 
(ahead of the examination date) and / or 
you are allowed to use your notes and 
books during the examination period.
Closed Examinations – are 
assessments where you are allowed 
no additional learning materials and 
you are unaware of the content of the 
examination paper.
The examination rubric will be determined by your tutors as to how they wish to structure the 
assessment so as to evaluate whether you can evidence the achievement of the expected learning aims for 
the module/course of study. Lewthwaite (1997) noted in a small survey of non-native English speaking 
postgraduate students in New Zealand that whilst undertaking examinations caused significant stress 
to international students, this was not as marked as that induced by coursework assessments. The latter 
stress being sourced from concerns with understanding coursework assessment directions, tutor language 
and guidance and fear of speaking in classes.
Summary
Following chapter 4’s discussion of the grading process for you, this chapter has considered the barriers 
to learning you may expect as you undertake your studies internationally. This has been presented as a 
complex mix of factors from your internal and external environment. Your joined HEI can help to bridge 
the transition between your previous education and your new studies, but these activities are generally 
limited in their scope and effectiveness, so you must consider actively how to continue to progress your 
academic and social development so as to support effective grade achievements.

Managing Assessment – identifying 
actions to improve your grades
In this chapter, two foci emerged to consider the inter relationships between these internal and external 
factors – determined by the stage of entry to your programme of studies. By considering a range of 
literature and experiences, figure 5.1 was constructed to highlight the individual and grouping of factors 
that influence your grade achievement. Subsequent to this discussion, different points of entry to your 
programmes were considered – notably the advanced entry undergraduate student and the postgraduate 
student on a taught programme. For both these students the limited time to culturally adjust was an 
apparently critical factor but also the need to begin the adjustment process early i.e. before your departure 
to your host country and HEI. Table 5.2 listed the emergent actions that you can undertake to improve 
your opportunity of securing a higher grade.
In the final chapter next, we summarise the international student grade sojourn with the hope that 
you will find a number of activities to support both your international student experience but also the 
achievements in your experience.
Glossary
Cultural Adjustment – the process through which you secure self esteem and self confidence in your 
studies which is shaped by two considerations of your emotional and behavioural adjustment to your 
new learning environment.
Self construal – describes how confidence with your English language is related to your emotional and 
behavioural adjustment.
Belonging – is the process and affective behaviour that generates a sense of identity and engaged purpose 
with your programme and your learning environment.
Identity processing style – refers to the strategies you use to engage with or avoid the tasks of maintaining 
your sense of identity within your learning environment – this can be both positive and negative with 
regards to your grade achievements.
Resilience – describing individuals who are compassionate and flexible and who can continue to move 
forward under pressure from their internal and/or external environment.
Academic Practice – is a comprehensive discourse framework to explain the interface between university 
academic requirements and international student learning.
Scaffolding – refer to your learning and subsequent understanding being secured by building upon 
previous understanding.
Threshold learning – refer to those identified and important central concepts and practices, the 
understanding of which allows mastery of your course or module of study.

Transmissive pedagogy – is a form of teaching reliant upon oral instruction and that is primarily from 
the tutor to the student.
Constructivist pedagogy – is a form of teaching reliant upon the development of a dialogue between 
the tutor to the student.
Academic Anxiety – the stress experienced by (international) students upon commencing a programme 
of studies that arises from both social and academic weaknesses compared with established student 
learning practices for a given learning environment.

6	 Conclusion – studying in the UK?
TARGET READER: The International student and the tutor of the international student
Aim of chapter: To extract from the preceding discussion, an ‘action’ plan for the international student 
and the tutor of international students, which has the aim of helping to achieve higher grades achieved 
for the student and a more engaged and rewarding experience for the tutor.
6.1	
What have we learned?
The journey we have undertaken in this book has illustrated that effective learning – where it achieves 
permanent changes in the behaviour of individuals – is a multi-factor endeavour for the international 
student and their tutor within the learning environment. In chapter 1 we proposed that learning is a 
messy process, but that we can structure our understanding of this process by focusing upon a number 
of key areas which we identified and discussed in subsequent chapters. In undertaking this journey, we 
did not set out to construct a ‘new theory’ of learning for any given stakeholder, but we did want to 
address a weakness in UK Higher Education that we felt existed based upon our experiences of working 
with international students over a period of years. Fundamentally this weakness is not one per se of 
academic skills development, of which there are many excellent guides for you the international student, 
but one of providing a guide or map for effective acculturation (or developing a good ‘fit’) to UK HE 
and through that process also be able to achieve grades that reflect more accurately your potential as the 
international student. We feel this is needed for you and your tutors because of the resource and efficiency 
limits placed upon modern HEI provision and institutions which risk (your potentially very different) 
learning needs being less valued or recognised, than addressing the needs of the cultural homogeneity 
of the majority of students in a given class.
From chapter 1 (and expanded in chapter 3), we established a structure for the book and the areas we 
would explore using contemporary research and available evidence of the scope of effective learning. 
These included:
•	 A discussion of the typical pre departure and arrival experiences you might enjoy at the start 
of your learning experience
•	 A discussion of your motivation and its importance in your learning experience
•	 A discussion of how you are assessed and the factors that influence that tutor activity and how 
you engage with that activity
•	 A discussion of what effective teaching is for you, the international student
•	 A discussion on the importance of other students in your learning experience
•	 A discussion of how and why your HEI seeks to support you in your learning experience
•	 A discussion of the importance of recognising your social welfare on your learning experience
•	 A discussion of the importance of recognising your linguistic abilities are more than just 
competence development in that area but impact more widely upon your learning experience

Conclusion – studying in the UK?
We don’t state this is an exhaustive listing of factors that shape your grade achievement in your studies, 
but drawing upon our experiences and established learning theory, these seemed to be appropriate areas 
to bring to your attention and from which, to establish an action plan that we hope will provide both 
you – the international student and you – the international student tutor- with opportunities and ideas 
to improve the learning experience.

Action Plan for the International Student
Before you arrive in the UK at your HEI
Factor
Action
External learning conditions
Try to identify who else is travelling to your HEI and perhaps joining your classes. 
•	
Developing a support network of friends prior to departure will help your 
adjustment in the UK.
•	
Ask your HEI/admissions tutor/agent for information
Development of social networks will take time – try to initiate these before you 
depart your home country – getting to know and work with others will make your 
cultural adjustment faster and easier in your host country and impact positively 
upon your studies.
.
Your selection of institution and HEI is important as this will establish 
preconceptions in your tutors of your abilities.
External conditions
Advise your HEI/Agent of your travel arrangements to the UK.
Upon arrival in the UK at your HEI
Factor
Action
Internal and External 
learning conditions
If your HEI/faculty/programme organises specific welcome events prior to the start 
of your studies, ensure you attend them.
•	
Developing a support network of friends prior to departure will help your 
adjustment in the UK.
Engage with your University’s induction but be aware this is not sufficient alone for 
effective engagement with your programme and cultural adjustment.
Early, at the start of your studies in the UK – ensure you have access to key study 
information – such as your module/courses guides and that you are aware of when 
assessment work will be required from you.
Spend time in understanding the UK UG degree classification system.
Are you joining your HEI and undergraduate degree programme at a higher level of 
admission/entry? If so, do you know if the grades from this level contribute to your 
final degree classification?
 
Assessments are attempted once in UK HEI – get it as right as possible, first time.
When you receive feedback – read it – if you do not understand it, ask your tutor / 
personal supervisor.
View improving your English language as not a class or unnecessary activity – it will 
help both with your produced work for your studies but also your confidence and 
self esteem.

Conclusion – studying in the UK?
Working with culturally similar international students at the start of your studies is a 
good thing to do, but try to ensure this is not your only source of student interaction 
and that you broaden your cultural engagement with different ethnic students, as 
your studies progress.
Working in groups with other international students supports your learning and 
adjustment as well as encouraging you to approach your learning environment 
more positively.
External conditions
Give yourself time to organise your living arrangements when you arrive in the UK.
Assessment 
Marking in HEIs is a subjective activity (everyone is different!).
Think about the degree you are studying – is it ‘hard’ or ‘soft’? It is more difficult 
to obtain a higher grade in a social science than a pure science and you need to 
moderate your views and expectations accordingly.
Where your modules/courses involve smaller pieces of assessment to create an 
overall grade – it will be more difficult to obtain a higher resultant final grade in 
general.
.
Understand what method of marking will produce your grades – is it norm, criteria 
or gatekeeping based? Marking in a social science uses a more relativist scale – so 
you must make your answers seem possible and feasible however you decide to 
present them.
Expect variations of grades within classification thresholds between your friends 
because your tutors find it harder to grade within thresholds (i.e. it is easier to 
award a mark of 65% and 75% to two students than it is to award 65% and 63% to 
two students). 
Expect to see differences in how your tutors mark and grade you.
Securing consistent grades – preferably high grades – by looking for consistent 
weaknesses in your submitted work. Consistent grades also helps establish an 
expected norm of behaviour from you with the tutor and your work.
Remember that your tutors are under pressure to award good class grades.
Different HEIs have different methods of second marking – be sure you understand 
what this is for you.
Being open and agreeable to developments and new experiences in your studies 
supports better grade achievements
Modules you enjoy can be more important than how you are assessed within them – 
as the teaching style can match your learning style helping to achieve better grades.
Identify those modules with qualitative assessments as these are those which you 
will struggle most within your assessment in general
Belonging and Engagement
It can be helpful for you to be an active participant in the learning environment, 
say the classroom, as not only will it contribute to the construction of your 
understanding, skills and knowledge, but it will also increase your visibility as an 
active (and ‘good’) participant to the tutor of your class.
An important aim for you is to be visible and secure your voice in your classes but 
do not aim to do this too early in your classes. It may take probably a full semester 
before you acquire this confidence.
.
Tutors are more likely to grade you according to a perception of effort and 
engagement of you and your cohort, especially in those areas emphasising 
analytical skill development.

Conclusion – studying in the UK?
.
You will not feel comfortable or even perhaps happy, until you develop a sense of 
belonging to your programme and institution. This means both engaging with your 
studies and with other activities that enrich your study experience. Make sure you 
look out for these.
.
Academic anxiety and the fear of failing can be significant barriers to securing 
higher grades.
Internal
Consider what your Information Processing System (IPS) is.
How you engage with your studies and seek to progress them – is influenced by 
your IPS and what you personally view as your motivation for your studies. Your IPS 
is also related to your approach to learning. Reflect on your motivations to identify 
how you can maximise your grades.
Your Prior Knowledge
Expect different abilities of students within your programme and entry point.
6.3	
Action Plan for the International Student Tutor
As with the previous table listing those areas that have been identified as supporting improved grade 
achievement by the international student, the final table below lists those areas that have also been 
discussed as important for the tutor of the international student to support their grade achievement.
Factor
Action
Student Language
Do you have contact with EAP staff in your institution – specifically those who deliver 
classes to your international students? Are you aware of the scope and content of EAP 
classes and how to fit (or not) with the delivery of materials in your module/ course?
What is the perception of EAP in your faculty or department? Are you confident that 
sufficient importance is accorded to EAP faculty staff? Can this profile be raised? Can 
EAP staff be integrated into developmental meetings of the programme staff?
Do you know where international students experience particular difficulties in 
courses/modules? Do you know what aspect of learning is a particular barrier for the 
international student in those modules? If not – can you find out?
Have you ensured that where particular new skills and understanding are being 
introduced to the international student learner, that you have confidence that the 
learner will have the appropriate abilities at the right time (through prior collaboration 
with EAP staff…)?
Have you identified with EAP staff which parts of the programme of study have/will 
be most difficult for the international student learner? And what barrier needs to 
be addressed?
Student prior knowledge
Are you aware of the qualifications and attainment of new students in your class – so 
you know where they are beginning their learning from?
How often do you check (formatively or summatively) the understanding of 
international students in your class?
Do you have an understanding of what skills and knowledge students bring to your 
classes already?
Are you aware of strengths or weaknesses in student knowledge – or know where gaps 
are (or likely to be)?

Conclusion – studying in the UK?
Assessment strategies
Have you considered the appropriateness of the assessment strategy to meet ILOs? 
Can you offer more flexibility in how ILOs are evidenced by student achievement in 
your classes?
Supporting International students in their learning can be aided by encouraging 
their ‘class voice’ above the mechanics of requiring them to use the correct academic 
register – can you enable this in your classes and assessment tasks? Think about what 
the fundamental evidence sought to warrant a grade allocation is for your assessed 
submissions? Are you actually looking at or for, the ‘voice’ of the student?
Do you operate any formative review/support sessions for (international) students prior 
to assessment submission?
Have you considered in your assessment strategies, whether they are UK/Euro centric 
in their application? Do they consider the variety of international students in a 
given class who may find their self-expression difficult in some forms of assessment 
particularly where there is reference to named organisations and contexts they may 
also be unfamiliar with?
Can you support the use of the first person (‘I’) in assessed work to encourage 
originality and critical engagement with assessment tasks?
How often do you undertake formative discussions with your international students – 
where you particularly focus upon missed assumptions in the views of students?
International Student 
belonging
To what extent are activities by international student associations promoted and 
supported by faculty?
Are there visible elements of social connectedness through host culture integration for 
international students?
Do you have ‘buddy’ or pairing schemes operational in the faculty? If not, can one be 
established?
Try to encourage (initially) the benefits of supporting and engaging same culture 
working groups in your classes
Seek and solve problems presented by international students early and ensure this is 
visible to that community

It is also important to recognise that for example in the dialogic process of learning, that the teacher is 
also an active element of the learning process as well as the learner. This is discussed in chapters 4 and 5.
2.	
Jean Piaget was a famous psychologist who studied cognitive development, initially in children.
3.	
This was tested with 182 Chinese college students, a small sample of novice teachers (15) and a series of 
rich interviews. Each of the four themed categories comprised a number of items per category.
4.	
We return to this important issue shortly when considering whether academic conventions themselves 
raise learning barriers in University education for international students.
5.	
Pioneered by Jack Mezirow after extensive studies of the education of adults returning to academic studies 
in the US in the 1970s.
6.	
It is interesting to note that these four parts of the description are in essence a paraphrasing of the thesis 
learning outcome aims articulated by Cadman (1997) and which caused much distress to her international 
postgraduate students!
7.	
And by doing so, you would encourage the student to reflect on their work and seek to recognise and 
appreciate the different ways of interpreting data and experience.
8.	
This was for international students studying in the US.

Based on a report by the Higher Education Strategy Associates and HSBC Research, as reported in the 
Times Higher Education Supplement. That data cites the 10 largest universities in each country, while 
living costs are taken from Global Higher Education Rankings 2010: Affordability and Accessibility in 
Comparative Perspective.
10.	
See the discussion here for example by Paul Whitely (http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/33033) 
where according to UNESCO and OECD figures, the UK continues to have a significantly smaller 
proportion of enrolments per 100, 000 people than the US and in comparison to other OECD countries, 
has reduced rather than increased HE funding since 2007 and made admission and enrolment to UK HE 
programmes by International students a more difficult and time consuming process.
11.	
Concerns with the value of league tables can be reflected in some evidence from Europe (Italy) that using 
this data of achievement to make an informed decision on the quality of an institution and programme 
is flawed (see Bagues et al, 2008).
12.	
See http://78.158.56.101/archive/palatine/files/1349.pdf April 2014
13.	
This is an issue because of how we understand individuals attribute success or failure to themselves (called 
attribution theory) and through social cognitive views of their self potential for achievement.
14.	
The work cited by Saebi & Payne (2012) does not outline any expected gender differences for these IPS.
15.	
For a detailed discussion of the breadth and scope of Resilience Models, see Van Breda (2001) accessed 
at: http://www.vanbreda.org/adrian/resilience/resilience_theory_review.pdf May 2014.
16.	
See http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5049&context=etd Accessed May 2014.
17.	
Note – it is unlikely that such questionnaires will be identified by the word ‘resilient’ to you.
18.	
Scaffolding practices refer to your learning being progressed through building upon your existing 
understanding, to construct new knowledge and understanding with your tutors and peers. Threshold 
concepts refer to those identified and important central concepts and practices, the understanding of 
which allows mastery of your course or module of study.
19.	
The HEFCE funded project ‘Student Progress and Transition’ project (SPAT) of 2004 sought to identify 
and address this deficiency.
20.	
Moreover, an important reason for student drop out and poor retention is where student expectations 
about HEI study differ from the reality (Barron & D’Annuzio-Green, 2009). Ensuring that the two are 
convergent through appropriate supports both increases retention and is cost effective.
21.	
The promulgated ‘U’ model of student adjustment to an international HEI is now of limited 
credibility – primarily due to limited empirical evidence of its viability and actual existence (see Brown and 
Holloway, 2008). Mixed models of influences are instead promoted as more effective ways of understanding 
international student ‘adjustments’.
22.	
This is described as reading that is directed to achieve a purposeful outcome and goal.
23.	
Phakati’s (2008) work explores a selected number of variables only through Structural Equation Modelling 
(SEM). It can be expected that other variables account for grade achievement on an individual basis and 
are not presented.
24.	
Neither Brown (1997) nor Nguzi and Kayode (2013) offer evidence that suggests it is the supervisor: 
supervisee relationship that directly affects the successful completion of the dissertation. Other (student 
oriented) factors are predominant.
