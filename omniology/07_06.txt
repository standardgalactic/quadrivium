Problem 7.6
Given 
 [there exists something that is slower
than all horses and faster than all rabbits] ]and 
 [faster is transitive], use
the Fitch system to prove 
 [every horse is faster than every rabbit].
To apply a rule of inference, check the lines you wish to use as premises and click the button for the
rule of inference. Reiteration allows you to repeat an earlier item. To delete one or more lines from
a proof, check the desired lines and click Delete.
Whenever entering expressions, use Ascii characters only. Use ~ for  ; use & for ; use | for ;
use => for 
; use A for ; use E for ; and use : for . in quantified sentences. Also, for variables use
strings of alphanumeric characters that begin with a capital letter. For example, to write the
sentence 
 , write AX:EY:(p(X)&q(Y)=>r(Y)|~s(Y)).
