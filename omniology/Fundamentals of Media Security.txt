Introduction
Chapter 1
Introduction
With the development of computing technologies, digital media security becomes an ever
increasing issue of daily life. As computer software and hardware evolves and as more
of it becomes accessible as an Internet application or service, information security has
gone from initially protecting digital images, into the area of multimedia. This area of
multimedia includes computer graphics, images, digital video and digital audio. As the
Internet expands, so does the signiﬁcance of multimedia security. This chapter will cover
some of the basic knowledge required and what should be considered when discussing media
security. Analysis of the theoretical background of these issues is given, which is used to
guide the practical applications.
1.1
Overview
Computer security with regard to system security and network security has been
broadly studied. With the development of multimedia processing and applications,
multiple types of media security have been broadly taken into consideration. The
type of media includes audio, video, image, text, web pages and graphics.
From a hardware perspective, in order to protect the copyright of Intelligent Prop-
erty (IP), special fonts were written into the ROM on microchips so that fraudulent
chips could be identiﬁed. If these marks are removed, the fragile microchip will no
long function. This technique has been employed even today, the microchip protec-
tions are still regarded as one of the best ways to protect information pertaining to
that chip. Another typical software protection is a “serial number”, which attempts
to block illicit copying, along with online Internet registration of that software.
Visually, logos have been adopted as a type of visible watermark, used frequently
within the television industry. These marks are used to denote content ownership.

Introduction
Nowadays, secure protection approaches have been embedded into the commercial
products such as computer games, digital music, digital video, engineers drawings
and many other forms of digital media and documents. Due to the rapid expansion
of the amount of digital content available, illegal usage of these products can have
many detrimental eﬀects. It cannot be denied that media security will play a vital
role in the impact multimedia products will have over a long period of time.
Although the research in the area of media security has made great progress in the
past ten years, there are still many problems with existing products and additionally,
during that time, many more problems, previously not considered have presented
themselves. The robustness and capabilities of the existing security models have not
been suﬃciently investigated or updated to handle these new problems.
In this book, the research in the area of media security will be presented from a
mathematical point of view, starting from the basic principles of cryptography, and
how they can be used for a much wider application in terms of media security. The
research areas that this book covers are presented within the next section.
1.2
Research Areas of Media Security
Media security is one of the family members of information security. Media security
including information hiding is built upon cryptography and multimedia processing.
The primary research topics covered within this book include steganography, wa-
termarking, scrambling, authentication and forensics, and surveillance. This type
of research is commonly employed in digital commercial products for tasks such as
evidence veriﬁcation and authentication [4]. The following paragraphs give brief
details of these techniques, making it clear what will be covered in the following
chapters. These paragraphs correspond to the outline of this books content.
Steganography, namely information hiding refers to hiding secrets in other media.
The host media should remain fully complete and contain all original data. The
hidden media should be embedded with a certain degree of robustness so that the
secret can resist certain attacks, but must also be fully recoverable after such attacks
or manipulations in order to ensure the secret can be correctly extracted.
Watermarking is a typical problem in information hiding. After a secret is embed-
ded into some type of media, that media can then be inspected or tampered with.
Even after this inspection and tampering, the hidden information, in the form of a
watermark, should still be intact such that it can be extracted as evidence to prove
the ownership. A digital watermark usually refers to a tiny binary sequence. An
example of a typical well known watermarking algorithm would be the LSB (Least
Signiﬁcant Bits) algorithm. The key issues in information hiding and watermarking

Introduction
are watermark capacity and robustness. Fragile watermarking is another technique
that can be applied in information protection. Logos on videos and images are a
visual watermark.
Scrambling is primarily employed to break the coherence within the temporal and
spatial domain in order to encrypt a television signal. This is to help protect the
content and owners of that content from piracy. The reason why scrambling is re-
searched is that the approaches based on cryptography do not aﬀect the signals which
have spatial or temporal coherence. Progressive scrambling is specially designed for
multimedia data, such as audio, video, and images. This progressive scrambling can
break the coherence at multiple resolutions, like a public key system. Without the
keys, the secret cannot be restored even if the algorithms are public. If some of the
keys are given, the media, in some degraded quality can be partially decoded and
viewed. If all the keys are provided, the media can be fully decoded and displayed
in perfect, original quality.
Media authentication and forensics are an emerging problem in information veri-
ﬁcation. With the rapid development of Internet applications and digital devices,
such as digital cameras, video cameras, microphones and scanners, digital forensics
have been playing a pivotal role in information processing. Some people hope real
photos are fake while some expect the fake photos are real. The responsibility of
media authentication and forensics is to determine the truth about particular events
which have been photographed or videoed. Various techniques are used in analyzing
media in order to determine whether or not it has been tampered with.

Introduction
Video surveillance is a hybrid of computer vision and media security. The main
problems in video surveillance are: capturing the video and eﬃciently storing it,
online camera control, visual search and event mining using the stored data. Due
to the expansive nature of recorded video, processing the shear volume of material
eﬀectively is another primary concern. Therefore, the main techniques required in
this area are object detection and tracking, trajectory analysis, occlusion analysis,
visual search and multiple camera coordination. Depending on the application, these
techniques can be used to pinpoint certain activities that the surveillance system
may be responsible for.
There exists many unsolved problems within the media security domain. Although
all of these problems cannot be listed due to space limitations, it is hoped that
through the use of this book, they may present themselves to the reader. As the
practical requirements for this type of media security work increase, these techniques
will need to be improved and enhanced to handle more speciﬁc cases. Before an
examination of each of the techniques are presented in detail, a brief overview of the
evaluation criteria used for analyzing said techniques is given. This criteria should
be considered when working in area of media security.
1.3
Criteria for Media Evaluation
In media security, if the tampered data and the original data have signiﬁcant dif-
ferences, then an objective evaluation method is not required. It will be apparent
to an observer that the image has been altered by some degree. The quality of
multimedia data can be measured subjectively by a number of methods, such as,
understandable or perceivable diﬀerence, or degree of resemblance that occurs.
The understandable or perceivable diﬀerence corresponds to the information ca-
pacity that a human or machine can obtain by observing the original and altered
media. The degree of resemblance refers to the diﬀerence between the original stan-
dard data and the new target data. The criteria for media evaluation includes two
main aspects: subjective and objective criteria [5]. The following sections present
mathematical inspections of each type of criteria in order cement a solid base upon
which to start.
1.3.1
Subjective Criteria
Subjective evaluation is performed by the human perceptual system, it is closely
related to media quality but also the characteristics and conditions of the observers.
Subjective evaluation includes absolute evaluation and relative evaluation.
It is
calculated by:

(1.1)
where ci is the score of class i, ni is the number of people evaluating the image that
belongs to class i [5]. That is, given a group of people, how perceivable are the
changes that have been made to the original media. Results may vary in this type
of evaluation due to the nature of sight in that some people’s vision operates in a
much less eﬃcient way to anothers. Age may also have an adverse eﬀect on this
type of study.
1.3.2
Objective Criteria
Due to the limitations that occur when subjective criteria is used for examining
media, objective criteria was introduced. An objective and more scientiﬁc way of
examining and testing for diﬀerences between a set of data is to use objective criteria
methods. These objective methods help to quantify senses and perceptions that may
be somewhat more diﬃcult to describe in terms of computing on a ﬁnite scale. These
objective methods attempt to bridge the gap between what a group of users perceive
and what is actually happening.
Suppose the intensity of a pixel within an image I at coordinate (i, j) is f(i, j),
0 ≤f(i, j) ≤255; and suppose the pixel intensity within another image I′ at
coordinate (i, j) is f ′(i, j), 0 ≤f ′(i, j) ≤255, the diﬀerence between image I and
image I′ may be described using the following objective criteria and methods:
1. Deﬁnition of Reality [5]:
ε =
M
j=1
N
k=1[σ{f(i, j) −σ{ ˆf(j, k)}}]2
M
j=1
N
k=1[σ{f(i, j)}]2
(1.2)
where σ{·} is the probability expectation [6].
2. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is deﬁned as [7]:
PSNR = 10 log
m · n · P 2
RMS

(1.3)
where P is the peak of the signals, m and n are the horizontal and vertical
resolution, RMS (Root Mean Square) is:

For the discrete case:
RMS =


i=1
m

j=1
(f(i, j) −f ′(i, j))2
(1.5)
3. Energy signal noise ratio is deﬁned as [7]:
SNR =
S2(x, y)
ε{N 2(x, y)}
(1.6)
where S(x, y) is the energy signal, N(x, y) is the energy of noise, ε{·} is the
expectation.
The PSNR metric is one of the most common objective methods used, speciﬁcally
within the areas of watermarking and steganography. After watermark or informa-
tion embedding, high PSNR values of the altered/watermarked image correspond
to high similarity against the original. Further examples are provided later in this
chapter which show the capacity of certain types of images for information hiding.

Introduction
1.3.3
Distance Measure on Various Color Spaces
The distance measure between two colours is another objective method used for
analyzing a set of images. It allows one to quantify the diﬀerence between two pixel
values that would otherwise be subjective if described by a person.
Firstly, the distance measure on YIQ colour space is examined.
The transform
between RGB and YIQ is given by Eq. (1.7), where YIQ is the brightness, saturation
and chrome.
⎛
⎝
Y
I
Q
⎞
⎠=
⎛

0.523
0.312
⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝
R
G
B
⎞
⎠
(1.7)
Thus, given two images, the diﬀerence can be measured by:
RMSY IQ =
m
i=1
n
j=1(Yij −Y ′
ij)2 + (Iij −I′
ij)2 + (Qij −Q′
ij)2
m · n
(1.8)
where (Yij, Iij, Qij) and (Y ′
ij, I′
ij, Q′
ij) belong to two diﬀerent resolution images, m, n
are the resolution in the vertical and horizontal direction.
The perception of two images L · a · b from CIE is equal when two images are
computed. The steps required to convert from an RGB colour space to the L · a · b
colour space are described as follows:
Firstly, complete the conversion from RGB space to CIE XYZ space:
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠=

Secondly, from XYZ space to L · a · b space:

and (X′, Y ′, Z′) is the reference, L stands for the luminance, a is the degree from
green to red, b is the degree from blue to yellow. Therefore, in CIE L · a · b, the
distance between two images is deﬁned as:
RMSLab =

i=1
n
j=1(Lij + L′
ij)2 + (aij −a′
ij)2 + (bij −b′

m · n
(1.14)
where (Lij, aij, bij) and (L′
ij, a′
ij, b′
ij) belong to diﬀerent images having the same res-
olution, m, n is the resolution on the vertical and horizontal direction [7].
1.3.4
Comparison Among Variant Measurement Approaches
The above approaches are divided into subjective and objective evaluation criteria.
There are two types of object evaluation criteria: The 1st evaluation is based on
comparing two images in the spatial domain using the L2-norm in an Euclidean
space by computing the average values. The comprising result reﬂects the physical
diﬀerences between two images, however it is a weak comparison based purely on
content of an image. The 2nd is a comparison based on statistics. This approach
attempts to solve the resemblance problem from a statistical point of view. It sup-
ports invariant attributes such as rotation and translation of an image. Therefore,
the later approaches are reasonable when measuring the quality of images. The fol-
lowing sections consider this statistical approach from an mathematical viewpoint.
1.4
Mathematical Models for Information Hiding
When information hiding in terms of images is discussed, the ﬁrst question is: Based
on an image’s bandwidth and signal to noise ratio (SNR), how much information can
be hidden within the image? That question can be answered by following several
facets:

Introduction
1.4.1
Mathematical Models Based on Colour Space
Given f(i, j) of image A and g(i, j) of image B, (i, j) is the coordinate on an image.
According to these discrete properties, f(i, j) and g(i, j) may be represented by:
f(x, y) =
7

i=0
bi · 2i and g(x, y) =
7

i=0
b′
i · 2i
(1.15)
where bi = 0, 1, b′
i = 0, 1, i = 0, 1, . . . , 7.
f(x, y) =
7

i=4
bi · 2i + O(24)
(1.16)
g(x, y) =
7

i=4
b′
i · 2i + O(24)
(1.17)
Using this, the following function can be constructed:
h(x, y) =
7

i=4
bi · 2i +
7

i=4
b′
i · 2i−4
(1.18)
Using bit-operations:
f ′(x, y) =
7

i=4
bi · 2i and g′(x, y) =
3

i=0
b′
i · 2i+4
(1.19)
The error of the image restoration can be calculated using:
|f(x, y) −f ′(x, y)| ≤16 and |g(x, y) −g′(x, y)| ≤16

Since the humans visual systems (HVS) sensitivity can be measured on a logarithmic
scale, very bright pixels can have a diﬀerence of 16 continuous tones, the HVS cannot
detect these diﬀerences. Therefore, the pixels that have 16 continuous degrees of
diﬀerence will not be perceptible with 256 colour tones. Thus, the information within
this range will be hidden. This simple principle is widely employed in information
hiding. That is, if it cannot be seen by humans, it is more than likely suitable as a
base for information hiding.

Mathematical Models Based on PSNR
Given a public image which contains a secret, suppose an 8-bit grayscale image is
used, the deﬁnition of PSNR (Peak Signal Noise Ratio) is:
PSNR = 10 log

M × N × 2552
M−1
i=0
N−1
j=0 (f(i, j) −g(i, j))2

(1.21)
where f(i, j) is the original greyscale image, g(i, j) is the pixel value from the refer-
ence image (the image that contains the secret), (i, j) represents the coordinate of
the pixel on each image.
From experiments, it is known that if two images have minimal diﬀerences, their
PSNR should satisfy:
PSNR ≥28
(1.22)
Table 1.1 and Table 1.2 are the comparison after using the simplest LSB watermark-
ing algorithms for diﬀerent image types. Table 1.1 corresponds to a greyscale image
while Table 1.2 represents the results from an RGB image.

From Table 1.1 the following conclusion can be drawn: for an 8-bit grayscale im-
age, the four lowest bits can be employed to hide information. Correspondingly,
from Table 1.2, for a 24-bit color image, the three lowest bits can be employed for
information hiding.

central paradigm of classical information theory is the engineering problem of the
transmission of information over a noisy channel.
The channel capacity can be
approached by using appropriate encoding and decoding systems.
In information theory, there are two important concepts: entropy and degree of
security, they are the important criteria for secure communication and information
measurement. Any secure communication system can be evaluated using these two
basic concepts, and they are quite reliable for new system design.

Introduction
Generally, if there are n messages, their probabilities are P1(x), P2(x), . . . , Pn(x)
respectively, then it can be proven that the average information capacity of each
message is:
H = −
n

i=1
Pi(x) log2 Pi(x)
(1.23)
Eq. 1.23 reﬂects the entropy.
Smith and Comiskey [9] presented a communication model of information hiding
from information theory based on digital images [10]. They synthetically take ca-
pacity, robustness and imperceptible of information hiding into consideration. The
cover image is thought as 2-dimensional commutation channel with limited band-
width having average noise energy. The secret message is transmitted from this
channel. Starting from this simple model, based on Nyquist and Shannon theo-
rem, the capacity of this communication channel in the given bandwidth can be
calculated, and the inferior boundary of S/N to obtain the capacity C:
C = W log


(1.24)
When bandwidth w tends towards inﬁnity:
lim
w→∞C = lim
w→∞w log


≈1.44 S

(1.25)
This indicates that when the bandwidth tends to inﬁnity, the channel capacity will
become a constant instead of inﬁnity.
Ramukumar et al. [11] improved the above model by designing a model with in-
creased noise, and analyzed the performance of the system. In the system, there are
two noise sources: noise I is introduced by modulation with the original images while
P is introduced by signal processing including compression and decompression. S
is the secret transmitting through the noisy channel. In information detection, if
the original image is used as a reference in information hiding, the channel contains
noise P only. X →[fX(x), δ2
x] is the information to be transmitted; Z →[fZ(z), δ2
z]
is the noise in the channel; Y →[fY (y), δ2
y] is the information received from the
output port. Suppose X and Z are independent on each other, the capacity of this
noisy channel C in information theory is:
C = max
fX(x) I(X, Y ) = max
fX(x)(h(y) −h(Y |X)) = max
fX(x)(h(y) −h(z))

Where I(X, Y ) is the information of X and Y . Therefore, given a system with

where σ2
S is the energy of hidden information, σ2

P is the energy of signal processing.
By simply analyzing the perceptual and impartial information, the capacity of com-
munication channels in information hiding can be understood. If the imperceptible
information in the media is the real communication provider, and Smith’s basic
scheme is adopted, from Eq. 1.27, the following is obtained:

(1.28)
In Eq. 1.28, the factor of image energy γ is introduced to show that the noise is
from part of the image not the whole image. If modulation and demodulation are
considered as a pair of reversible transformations, the reversible degree reﬂects the
perceptual degree of imperceptible information. If γ = 0, it means the sender owns
the original information and the receiver gets a clear piece of information.

Theoretical Security Model for Information
Hiding
In security communication, the space spanned by cipher text set X is called the
cipher space. The space spanned by encrypted set Y is called encrypted space while
the key set K = {ki, i = 1, 2, . . . , r} is called key space. The encryption transforma-
tion Tk is the mapping from the cypher space to the encrypted space, the decryption
transformation T −1
k
is the mapping from the encrypted space to the cypher space, k
represents the elements in the key space K. If P(x, k) is the joint probability of X
and K, then the deﬁnition of a secure system is: C ≜{X, K, Y ; P(x, ki, y)}, or C is
a secure system deﬁned by set X, Y, K and distribution P(x, ki, y). Tk maps x ∈X
to y ∈Y , therefore,
P(x, ki, y) = P(xi, k)T(y|x, ki)

0, otherwise
(1.30)
The principle when measuring whether a communication channel is secure or not
includes the adopted degree of security, size of keys, complexity of encryption and
decryption along with error spreading.
The secure model of information hiding is built on a test. Suppose Alice sends a
message to Bob, attackers should judge whether it includes hidden information. If
it does, how much is hidden and what is it? The famous hypothesis in information
theory and mathematical statistics should be used. Now, a Bayesian approach is
used along with the average entropy D(PC|PS) to quantize the security between
public cipher text PC and pseudo cipher text PS. If the entropy distribution of
public cipher text and pseudo cipher text is D(PC|PS) = 0, then the attacker cannot
get the hidden context, unless the secret was already known beforehand.
In this modal, the transmission procedure is regarded as a random procedure. Dur-
ing a given period of time, the encrypted results are diﬀerent from other encrypted
results, therefore, it is secure. In terms of validation and security, the key problem
in information hiding is robustness and accuracy of a system.
The potentiality of set S is noted as |S|. The entropy of x and probability PX is
deﬁned as:
H(x) = −

x∈X
PX(x) log PX(x)
(1.31)
The condition entropy of X given Y is H(X|Y ) = −
y∈Y PY (y)H(X|Y = y),
where H(X|Y = y) is the entropy of conditional distribution PX|Y =y.
Deﬁnition 1.5.1 (Security). If D(PC||PS) ≤ε , then the system consisting of cover
information C and secret S are E-passive secure. If ε = 0, the system is completely
secure [10].
Theorem 1.5.2 (Detected Probability). In an E-passive secure system, the proba-
bility that an attacker cannot detect the secret α and the possibility that the wrong
secret β is obtained, satisﬁes:
d(α, β) ≤ε
(1.32)
d(·) is the relative entropy, if α = 0, then
β > 2−ε
(1.33)
In a secure system, D(PC||PS) = 0, therefore, PC = PS [10, 11].

Theorem 1.5.3 (Passive Security). Security of the system mentioned above which

stable procedure, if the compression is an E-passive secure system, then the com-
pressed data is at least E-passive secure [10, 11].

Steganography
Chapter 2
Steganography
Steganography, namely information hiding refers to hiding secrets in other media. The
host media should contain the majority of its original content. The hidden media should
be embedded with certain robustness so that the secret can resist certain attacks. This
ensures the secret can be correctly extracted. This chapter, introduces the history, status
and trends in information hiding in terms of steganography. Using digital multimedia data
such as video and audio as the host media, a comparison and analysis for some well known
information hiding algorithms is presented.
2.1
Overview
The word steganography is of Greek origin and means “covered”, or “hidden writ-
ing”. Its ancient origins can be traced back to 440 B.C. Herodotus mentions two
examples of steganography in The Histories of Herodotus. Demaratus sent a warning
about a forthcoming attack to Greece by writing it on a wooden panel and covering
it in wax. Wax tablets were in common use then as re-usable writing surfaces, some-
times used for shorthand. Another ancient example is that of Histiaeus, who shaved
the head of his most trusted slave and tattooed a message on it. After his hair had
grown the message was hidden. The purpose was to instigate a revolt against the
Persians. Later, Johannes Trithemius published the book Steganographia, a trea-
tise on cryptography and steganography disguised as a grimoire. Today, the term
steganography includes the concealment of digital information within computer ﬁles.
Steganography always adopts hidden messages on paper written in secret inks under
other messages or on the blank parts of other messages. During and after World War
II, espionage agents used microdots (photographically produced) to send information
back and forth. Since the dots were usually extremely small (the size of a period
produced by a typewriter or even smaller), the stegotext was whatever the dot

Fundamentals of Media Security
27 
Steganography
was hidden within. If the dots were concealed within a letter or an address, they
were usually inside some alphabetic characters. If under a postage stamp, it was the
presence of the stamp. The problem with the WWII microdots was that they needed
to be embedded in the paper, and covered with an adhesive (such as collodion), which
could be detected by holding a suspected paper up to a light and viewing it almost
edge on. The embedded microdot would reﬂect light diﬀerently than the paper [12].
Steganography also adopts “zero encryption”. Zero encryption corresponds to hiding
secret messages inside other forms of information, the information can be ﬁltered,
but the hidden secret cannot be determined from the ﬁltering process. The following
example illustrates this:
“News Eight Weather: Tonight Increasing Snow. Unexpected Precipita-
tion Smothers Eastern Towns. Be Extremely Cautious And Use Snowtires
Especially Heading East. The Highways Are Not Knowingly Slippery.
Highway Evacuation Is Suspected. Police Report Emergency Situations
In Downtown Ending Near Tuesday.”
If the ﬁrst letter of each word is extracted, the following message can be obtained:
“Newt is upset because he thinks he is President.”
The following message was sent out from German spies in World War II:
“Apparently neutral’s protest is thoroughly discounted and ignored. Is-
man hard hit. Blockade issue aﬀects pretext for embargo on byproducts,
ejecting suets and vegetable oils.”
If the second letter from each sentence is extracted, the following message emerges:
“Pershing sails from NY June 1.”
Steganography refers to hiding secrets in public messages. Compared with cryptog-
raphy, it allows potential adversaries to detect and intercept, even modify the public
secret, while, at the same time does not violate any secure limitation.
The aim of information hiding is to hide information inside innocent information in
order to alleviate any suspicion that some type of information may be hidden within
the innocent data. Any adversary monitoring the innocent information should have
a hard time proving the existence of any hidden information.

Steganography
other form of digital media. The secret message can be text, another ﬁle or binary
streams. The secret and the cover media merge together to form an information
carrier. Information hiding may need a pseudo key or password as the attached
information.
When a secret has been hidden in protected media, the media is
normally referred to as pseudo media. Generally,
Protected info + Embedded Info + Pseudo Key = Pseudo Info
The attempt to detect and break a steganographically encoded packages is called
steganalysis. The simplest method to detect modiﬁed ﬁles, however, is to compare
them to the originals. To detect information being moved through the graphics
on a website, for example, an analyst can maintain known-clean copies of these
materials and compare them against the current content on the site. The diﬀerences
(assuming the carrier is the same) will compose of a payload. In information hiding,
the cover information, pseudo information and key are employed to compare the
new information. Steganalysis is the counterpart of Cryptanalysis, the knowledge
of Cryptanalysis can be employed in steganalysis [12].
Information hiding provides imperceptible information encryption, this helps to re-
duce the likelihood of the hidden information from being detected. If the secret can
be hidden within public images, the signal transmission will be very much safe, and
will have a lower likelihood of being attacked or monitored [13].
The tag of a conﬁdential document for indexing purpose plays a pivotal role when
comparing it against the physical document. If the conﬁdential document is physi-
cally changed or has marks placed on it, that will be very obvious and dangerous.
However, without this tag, the documents become very hard to manage. The so-
lution requires hiding the tags within the document so that the tags stay together
with the data. This requires an algorithm to extract these tags precisely and swiftly.
Information hiding is closely related to the Human Perceptual System. This means
that if a piece of data is to be used as a cover for some hidden data, the important
parts of the original data should not be censored or obscured signiﬁcantly so that
the human perceptual system has diﬃculty in recognizing what the original should
be.
On the other hand, information hiding should have robust attributes, therefore, even
if the interceptor already knows that a piece of media contains a secret, perceptually,
they cannot determine where it may be located and therefore cannot obtain the
secret. Based on the requirements of robustness, currently the technology employed
in information hiding is presented within the frequency domain. This is because
the spatial domain and color domain have apparent patterns, interceptors can break
the security using brute force techniques based on statistical analysis. However,

the frequency domain is rather stable, it not only resists the impact due to various
noises that may be introduced, but also the complexity of the frequency domain will
require more skill and analysis in terms of breaking it.
2.2
Stego Algorithms
Digital media is an ideal secret carrier for information hiding, this is because digital
media has a huge volume of redundancy. This attribute provides the potential for
hiding information in this cipher space.
Therefore, the techniques and skills in
digital media processing have been applied to this area. These approaches are based
in the spatial and frequency domains. The spatial domain includes bit-operations,
a binary stream can be embedded in the Least Signiﬁcant Bit (LSB) [14]. As the
outcomes are based on statistics, these can be used to prove the ownership of a piece
of digital media. This approach is suitable for information hiding and is known as
the simplest information hiding system.
The mathematical algorithms used for information hiding within the frequency do-
main include: Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transfor-
mation (DWT) and the Walsh Transformation. These approaches are based on the
transformation of an orthogonal function system. These approaches provide an ac-
ceptable trade-oﬀbetween the secret and the robustness of the information carrier
for the ﬁnal secret extraction.
Many such approaches are independent of image
format and can be converted between lossy and lossless formats [15].

Steganography
JPEG (Joint Picture Expert Group) and JPEG 2000 utilize DCT and DWT to com-
press digital images. The compressed data are integers due to quantization and run
length coding. However, other approaches have multiple attributes in order to hide
information in both the spatial and frequency domains. The algorithms combine
these features together. These approaches are helpful to protect the hidden infor-
mation and use it to resist various attacks, such as rotation, scaling and cropping. A
patchwork technique selects multiple regions of an image to hide information, each
region includes a tag, even if one tag has been destroyed, other tags still keep the
marks so that identiﬁcation is still possible.
In steganography, the secret is transmitted using public channels, in a public image,
to hide the secret message. Digital images and the derived technologies are widely
being accepted. In this area, cryptography and forceful encryption are not welcome.
People are more interested in sending a secret without arousing any suspicion. This
allows the secret to be placed in full public view and can be potentially accessed from
anywhere, meanwhile, the secret remains totally imperceptible. Classic commercial
applications of information hiding are watermarking in banknotes and digital sig-
natures, these are employed to trace the copyright and ownership of physical and
electronic products.
If a watermark exists, and is not perceivable, the customers may assume no water-
marks are present, and will have a harder time trying to locate the watermarks if
they wish to remove them from commercial products. This is a very challenging
topic. This leads into the next section on detecting information hiding.
2.3
Detecting Information Hiding
Information hiding always hides a secret in a huge volume of data, while water-
marking hides binary streams in digital media. Thus the watermark digits can be
uniformly distributed throughout the media. No matter which scheme is chosen,
the eﬀect is imperceptible to the human visual system [16].
In order to evaluate hidden information, it is very important to deﬁne some criteria.
Generally it is very hard to deﬁne a standard image. It is only when the cover image
and original image are observed together, that the diﬀerences can be pointed out.
In an image using color indexing, in order to reduce the reference time, the color is
sorted in a speciﬁc order, the changes to these colors are minor. Information hiding
is very hard to gain from strong contrast images, the minor changes will reﬂect the
images.
The basic way for secret detection in information hiding is to compare the original
image and the secret carrying image, and take special note of the distinct details.

Steganography
A digital signature is a very important piece of information, the signature can be
employed to identify the existing hiding information.
Human eyes are very sensitive to the distortion, especially when the secret carrying
the media and the original have been taken into comparison. Based on knowledge
patterns, similar models may be established, this is very helpful in steganoanalysis.
All the information can be automatically detected, the corresponding tools can be
employed to detect the secret.
2.4
Bit Operation Based Information Hiding
Generally, the information hiding can be described as following:
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 (Information Hiding). Given digital media A and B, ﬁnding the
digital media C and D, and reversible transformation F, must satisfy:
|F(αi,j, βij) −βij| ≤ε
(2.1)
wij = F −1(βij, F(αij, βij)), |αij −wij| ≤ε
(2.2)
where αij ∈A, βij ∈B, wij ∈C, F(αij, βij) ∈D; 0 ≤i ≤m −1 and 0 ≤j ≤n −1
are image resolution, ε > 0 is threshold. A is secret image, D is the public image,
F is transformation for image information hiding [17].
Information hiding is not a new problem [18], surprisingly, it has origins in old chil-
dren’s games. However, because the rapid development of computer communication,
especially due to the swift development of the Internet, the requirements for image
information hiding become necessary and urgent. This requirement may be due to
the traditional cryptography schemes which have to face the huge volume of data
and due to its time consuming nature, is unsuitable for the job of information hiding.
New schemes must be presented which allow detection of these methods [19].
Watermarking in actual fact is important in terms of information hiding, however
it emphasizes the little tags consisting of random binary numbers. If the hidden
information is not minor, this will be an information hiding problem.
Usually,
the encrypted images will arouse the attention of an attacker. If a secret can be
hidden in public media, the media transmission will be very safe, it even can avoid
potential attacks. Techniques have been developed which allow watermarking to
happen in real-time, speciﬁcally when watermarking video [20]. Watermarking will
be discussed in further detail in the follow chapter. The research in information
hiding requires knowledge from two aspects: mathematical algorithms and validation
encoding.

Mutual Multimedia Information Hiding
This section will introduce the information hiding approaches used for concealing
data within other types of non-image related data. The main contents include hiding
images in sound, sound in sound along with a number of other approaches.
2.5.1
Images Hidden in Sound[1]
In order to hide images in sound, the wave format is introduced. In order to hide
images in sound, the wave ﬁle needs to be opened, and combined with the secret
data according to the following equations:
z = f(i, j)
(2.3)
y = g(i, j)
(2.4)
Where z is merged data, i is the data of the wave form ﬁle, j is the image ﬁle, f is
the operation which hide images into sound, (u, v) is the coordinates of each pixel,
g is the transformation from color image space to one dimensional space.
Digital sound can be spread like the digital images. In audio communication, the
caller and answer can conceal important information in the audio signals.
The
original audio can be treated as a public ﬁle, the secret can be hidden in this carrier.
The secret may be text, audio or other media, generally the hidden information can
be binary information. The key of information hidden is employed to embed secret
and extract the secret. In the scheme, secret sharing also can be applied to hide
information, an example is provided to hide digital media in audio signals below.
Low Bits Encoding In information hiding, the bits in a byte play diﬀerent roles,
the LSB can be applied in information hiding. The least bits can be replaced
by the bits from the secret, the key may include various transformations of
the ﬁnal bit sequence.
Phase Coding In phase coding, the secret is represented by a special phase and
change of the phase. If the audio signals are segmented into diﬀerence pieces,
information hiding always requires:
1. The diﬀerence of two phases of two segments should be ﬁxed, ρ(f) is the
phase of the i-th phase, f is the bandwidth deﬁned on the whole wave.
2. The signal carriers should be suﬃcient smooth, a discontinuous sound
will cause suspicious and alert.

Steganography
Once the embedding procedure is completed, the last step is to embed the fol-
lowing corresponding phase, refresh the rest spectrum of the rest each segment,
ﬁnally the relevant phase is modiﬁed. The new signals can be constructed from
the new phase set. During the procedure of extraction, the hidden information
may be obtained by checking the ﬁrst phase. The key includes the sequence
of the phase modiﬁcation and the size of each segment, this encoding can be
employed in digital and analogy communication.
Spread Spectrum Encoding In information hiding, robustness must be taken
into consideration, therefore the hidden information is not expected to be lost
because of some tempering operations such as lossy compression and crop-
ping. In the robust approach, the most common approach used is the spread
spectrum approach [21] [22]. Generally speaking, spread spectrum combines a
random binary pulse w(t).
In the embedding, public signals c(t) combined with a · d(t) · w(t) is adhered
to v(t),
c(t) = a · d(t) · w(t) + v(t)
(2.5)
where a is a factor, it is used to reduce the noise due to information hiding.
The embedded binary random stream will be extracted to get the secret.
Echo Hiding Echo hiding [23] hides the secret into audio sound delay when com-
pared to the time, the sound delay time keeps within the audible limitation.
In the procedure of embedding, the sound has been segmented, the echo is
embedded into each piece. In the simplest situation, the embedding can be
modeled as following:
c(t) = v(t) + v · (t −Δd)
(2.6)
The key is the time delay Δd and Δd′, the time diﬀerence must be restored
Δd and Δd′. Extraction utilizes the coherence of two audio clips. The time
delay can be obtained from the diﬀerence of the two signal peaks.
2.6
Summary
In this chapter, an introduction was given on the history, status, and trends of
information hiding. Information hiding is not only based on amplitude modulation,
but also based on frequency modulation and phase modulation.
In information
hiding, the most important considerations should be how perceivable the secret is
and how robust it is against attack. Trade-oﬀs are always expected between overall
quality and how much data can be hidden successfully.

Watermarking has been and still is a very important research area within media security,
it is expected to play an important role in Intelligent Property (IP) protection due to the
rapid development in computer communications and the Internet. This research started
in 1996 and has been intensely discussed since 2000. In this chapter, the development of
digital watermarking research is discussed. Afterwards, the technologies and approaches
in watermarking are introduced.
3.1
Overview
Since the 1990’s, the accelerated developments in digital communication paved the
way for multimedia. The commercial beneﬁts drive the increasing trends of digital
communication and networking. Intelligent Property (IP) Protection has never been
as important as it is now in these times of the Internet. Digital watermarking is a
common solutions to protect the ownership of digital products.
Digital products such as photographs, videos, and audio are very wide spread due
to the nature of the Internet and rather easy to misuse. Fingerprinting and wa-
termarking are recommended as the basic solutions to verify the copyright owners.
Digital watermarking involves embedding a secret consisting of binary streams into
a vast array of multimedia data, and use it to reserve the copyright. Watermarking
is diﬀerent from encryption, it keeps the integrity and recognition of the original
image. Watermarking, equivalent to digital signatures, will lose its power if the host
media and the adhered software disappear. Watermarks are expected to take eﬀects
in ﬁle preview, printing and transmission.

Watermarking History
SONY and Philips invented the “copyright series management device” to protect
the copyright of digital audio cassettes in 1980’s, it is recognized as the ﬁrst device
to protect copyright of digital commercial products. The aim of this product is
to protect the ownership of users and encourage them to create the products of
themselves.
In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc. added watermarking functionalities in Adobe Photo-
shop 4.0 which was developed by Digimarc Inc. At the same time, the institutes of
NEC completed the software: Tiger Mark Data Blade; Informix Software ﬁnished
watermarking functionalities in the database product Informix-Universal Server (In-
formation Management System).
Europe electronic industries hoped to monitor illegally copy video and audio com-
mercial products using watermark censoring system to ﬁnd the illegal duplications.
The project is called TALISMAN (Tracing Authors’ Rights by Labeling Image Ser-
vices and Monitoring Access Networks, it started from September 1995, 11 commu-
nication and broadcasting companies, research institutes and universities involve in
it. There are two important ID adopted in the system: ID of the copyright owner
which is embedded in the multimedia data; another is unique international code such
as ISBN. The two IDs are expected to work jointly so as to protect the ownership.
From 1996, the International Workshop of Information Hiding was held every year,
the topic of watermarking research became a hot research area [24]. In the past
ten years, conferences organized by the ACM, IEEE, and IFIP, watermarking is
the main research topics for media security and assurance [25].
A key point in
watermark research occured when Cox et al. extended watermarking algorithms
from the spatial domain, and presented a spread spectrum watermarking technique
in the frequency domain [21]. Even today, this paper has been widely cited. It is
thought of as the important milestone in watermarking research, it’s the landmark
of robust watermarking [26, 27, 28].
Audio [29, 30, 31] and video [32, 33]watermarking are also very important members
in the family.
In 2000, Zhao J. present a work about audio watermarking, this
approach combined scrambling and DCT transformation together, it guarantees
the quality of host audio while ensure the requirements of robustness [34].
The
research scientists from Microsoft research Asian applied watermarking in video and
presented the video watermarking based on wavelets [35].
In Siggraph’ 99, Praun et al. presented robust watermarking for meshes, and in-
troduced watermarking to computer graphics [5]. Before this work, Benedens [36],
Ohbuchi [37], Yeung et al.[38] also studied this issue, Song et al. compared the usual
watermarking techniques [39].

Digital Watermarking
Although watermarking is designed to protect copyright by embedding secret to the
host media, according to the diﬀerences of functionalities and appearance of wa-
termarking, watermarking has been grouped into many categories. Usually water-
marking is divided into visible and invisible, fragile and robust, spatial and frequency
domain based.
3.2.1
Visible and Invisible Watermarking
Watermarking is grouped into two basic categories according its imperceptible to
human visual system: visible and invisible. Visible watermark such as logo can be
seen on the visual media such as images, photos and videos. Although invisible
watermarks cannot be observed visually, invisible watermarking is used to validate
or identify original authors, ownership, distributors, and even the EXIF data in a
digital photo. They are all applied to protect the ownership.
Although visible watermarking reduces the commercial value of the digital products,
it does not decrease usability and authentication of the media. A typical example
would be television stations marking their logos at the corner of the screen while
broadcasting their programmes.
It is very hard for the human visual system to detect invisible watermarking, how-
ever, the invisible watermark is extractable by computer programs. Invisible wa-
termarking can be employed in audio, video and other digital media aside from
images. For an example, watermarks can be embedded into digital audio, the owner
can sensor the radio so that the radio station cannot play the illegal music disc or
songs.

Digital Watermarking
3.2.2
Robust and Fragile Watermarking
One of prominent attributes of digital media watermarking is to embed robust water-
marks in host media. Robust watermarking refers to tampering with the watermarks
in media, the watermarks can be restored from the destroyed media. In watermark
design, most approaches tradeoﬀoverall quality in exchange for strong robustness.
Tampering with a robust watermark includes following: 1) General signal process-
ing. This includes D-A and A-D transformation, re-sampling and re-quantization,
modifying the visual data in spatial domain, such as color, hue, saturation, con-
trast; 2) General geometry transformation, this includes: rotation, shift, cropping
and zooming; 3) double watermarking (not dual watermarking). This refers to the
embedding watermarks in the watermarked media again, this will cause conﬂictions;
4) Certain degree of generality. This means that a watermarking scheme for digital
images can be employed for digital audio and video; 5) Watermarking should have
clear authentication.
Similar to cryptography, there does not exist the absolutely secure cryptosystem,
watermarking robustness is relative, these does not exist absolutely robust water-
marking in this world, these does not exist any watermarks in this world that it
cannot be destroyed.
The fragile watermark is also used for authorization and authentication. Fragile
watermarking is suitable for detection of the minor changes in digital media, this
is very helpful in detecting the integrity of media. The obviously destroyed media
can be used to extract the fragile watermark, so as to conﬁrm whether the media
copyright has been destroyed or the media has been stolen.
Fragile watermarks
provide the relevant evidences in this area.
3.2.3
Spatial and Frequency Domain Watermarking
Watermarking schemes have been grouped as spatial watermarking and frequency
watermarking according to the application domain. Spatial domain watermarking
usually refers to embed watermarks in pixels of visual products in various color space,
sometimes watermarks can be embedded into luminance, saturation and contrast.
A very important watermarking form is LSB [40, 41]. Schyndel’s paper published in
ICIP’94 is thought as the world ﬁrst paper about watermarking. A lot of research
scientists have also suggested to select pixels randomly, so as to embed watermarks
in pixel blocks [42, 43].
On frequency domain applications, current technologies are still focused on DCT
and DWT transformation. These transformation embedded watermarks in the co-
eﬃcients of frequency transformations, the media is re-constructed by using inverse

Digital Watermarking
transformation. The watermarks are normally extracted from coeﬃcients of the at-
tacked media, the watermarks are identiﬁed by using statistics. Frequently asked
questions are: whether any watermark exists here? What is it [44]?
3.2.4
Watermarking Approaches
Mintzer invented the basic LSB approaches: Suppose there is a 24-bit (3 × 8bytes)
image, a watermark is binary stream, the least signiﬁcant bit is replaced using one
bit of the watermark, this approach adopts the principle that the changes of least
signiﬁcant bits do not impact the visual quality of the images, it is regarded as the
basic law of digital watermarking.
The frequency approaches based on Cox’s approach are thought as the main stream
of robust watermarking in frequency domain, the general steps of this approach are:
Suppose ﬁle D has a vector V = (v1, v2, . . . , vn), the watermark X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn)
is embedded in it and a vector, V ′ = (v′
1, v′
2, . . . , v′
n) is obtained, the new V ′ is used
to replace V in the document to get the watermarked ﬁle D′. D′ may suﬀer any
kind of attack so that it is only possible to get the tampered ﬁle D∗, if the original
D is known, and the attacked ﬁle D∗is also known, the tampered watermark X∗
can be extracted, and compare it with the original watermark X, so as to conﬁrm
whether the watermark has survived the corresponding attack.
Embedding Procedure
Watermarking usually adopts one of following formula:
v′
i = vi + αxi
(3.1)
v′
i = vi(1 + αxi)
(3.2)
v′
i = vi(eαxi)
(3.3)
The equations are employed in diﬀerent ways, Eq. 3.2 and Eq. 3.3 are suitable for
the status where vi is very small, Eq. 3.1 can deal with the situation where vi is
greater.

Extraction Procedure
The extraction procedure obtains the vector V ∗= (v∗
i , v∗
2, . . . , v∗
n) from the doc-
ument D∗using frequency transformation. Then V ∗= (v∗
i , v∗
2, . . . , v∗
n) and V =
(v1, v2, . . . , vn) are calculated to get the modiﬁed watermark X∗.
Detection Procedure
The detection procedure is based on statistics, the similarity of two watermarks is
deﬁned as follows:
sim(X, X∗) =
X∗· X
√
X∗· X∗
(3.4)
Finally the threshold T is given by statistics, if sim(X, X∗) > T, the watermark
exists, otherwise, it does not.
3.3
Video Watermarking
In video watermarking, Hartung et al presented the watermarking based on MPEG-
2 [45, 46, 47], Swanson et al. developed watermarking approaches MPEG-2 and
wavelets for multiple resolution [48]. Although the details are diversity, however the
core is orthogonal transformation, such as DCT and DWT. These transformations
convert various color spaces to frequency domain, the watermarks are embedded
into the coeﬃcients. These coeﬃcients are stable in frequency domain. With the
development of video compression technologies, MPEG-4 and H.264 are employed
to host watermarks [49].
Cox watermarking comes from spread spectrum, namely watermarks and noise are
modulated together and added into the host media. In MPEG ﬁles, watermarks can
be added into the DCT coeﬃcients, this allows watermarks and video frames to be
encoded and decoded together. To void the visual quality losing and making sure
the watermark invisible, watermarks can be treated like the general signals and even
can be resisted attacks such as Stirmark.
Wavelets have important usage in JPEG2000.
Usually in watermarking, water-
marks are embedded into HH coeﬃcients of the wavelets, the media has not obvious
changes. Because wavelets transformation generates lots of coeﬃcients in multiple
resolution, the volume of watermarks and volume of media data can be very large.
Evidences show that watermarks can be correctly identiﬁed in any resolutions.

In practical operations, suppose the resolution of image is N × N, R + 1 is the
wavelet layers, watermark vector is: XN = {x1, . . . , xn1, . . . , xn2, . . . , xnR}. Under
diﬀerent resolutions, it has the following relationships X1 ⊂X2 ⊂· · · ⊂XR. In
order to embed watermark X into the high pass band, and combine with the V
together, v′
i = vi(1+αixi). Zooming factors αi can change the energy intense, it takes
important role in invisible and robust. In order to detect watermark Xi from V ′, the
similarity between X′ and X can be determined, sim(X, X′) = X′ ·X/||X′||2. If the
watermarks match each other, a further threshold will be provided t. sim(X, X′) is
subject to the standard norm distribution.
3.4
Video Logo Erasing
A video logo, is a trademark or a symbol of Intellectual Property Protection (IPP)
and is popularly used by most television channels. It helps in identifying the owner
of the video clips. Figure 3.1(a) gives some examples of video logos. Generally
speaking, a video logo possesses the following characteristics:
• A video logo has a special shape that makes it diﬀerent from other video logos.
• A video logo should be visible. It should be distinguishable from the back-
ground color.
• A video logo has a stable position in video frames, it does not move with time
and events.
• A video logo area should not be large and should not aﬀect the visual eﬀects
of video content.
• A video logo is not altered for a long time.

However, a video logo sometimes results in annoying visual artifacts especially in
cases where multiple logos exist in ﬁled videos that are reused and in news videos
obtained from some other channel. Multiple logos in video clips aﬀect the visual
pleasure like in cases where some television stations superimpose their video logos
on other logos or when others mark the logo area in video frames and overlap it
with their own logos. In Figure 3.1(b), the logos are overlapped directly, stacked
on another mosaic style logo, and blended with the blurred one. This is visually
not very appealing to the viewers. These artifacts provided the motivation for the
research and the aim is to erase video logos from video frames. This is also very
useful as an attack on visible watermarks in digital videos.
(a) Video Logo Examples.
(b) Video Logos Superimposed.
Figure 3.1: Sample Video Logos.
After the video logo area is marked the logos can be erased from the video frames
based on image inpainting. This problem in [6] and [50] is described as a discrete
approximation of the partial diﬀerential equation (PDE):
It = ▽⊥I · ▽△I
(3.5)
where ▽⊥denotes the perpendicular gradient (−∂y, ∂x) and △denotes the Laplacian
operator ∂xx + ∂yy, I is the image intensity, It =

∂t , ∂
∂t is

the direction of the isophote [50]. In order to solve the PDE, compute-intensive
algorithms are provided in [6] and [50] based on ﬂuid dynamics.
Figure 3.2 is helpful in understanding the inpainting algorithm. In the Figure 3.2(a),
every circle is marked with an alphabetic character indicating a pixel in the video
frame. The region with “B” indicates that the area needs to be inpainted. The

region with “B” and “b” in Figure 3.2(b) has to be ﬁlled with the information from
the surrounding pixels with “R”. The region with the “R” pixels represents the
undamaged area of an image. When it is decided that the “b” pixel should be ﬁlled,
the colors are averaged of the surrounding “R” pixels. For example in Figure 3.2(b),
the “b” pixel is surrounded by “R” pixels in 8 directions. The “b” pixels are ﬁlled
with the average color of all these surrounding “R” pixels.
Suppose only one pixel needs to be ﬁlled, the average color of the surrounding pixels
represents the ﬁlled color. If there are many rings, all pixels from the outside ring to
the inside ring are ﬁlled by the average color. The remaining unﬁlled pixels, if any,
are ﬁlled by the average colors of the surrounding pixels. These are ﬁlled according
to the scanning order from left to right and top to bottom. After ring ﬁlling and
scanning ﬁlling are over, the region is completely ﬁlled.
The average color can retain a better visual eﬀect. Assume the color of a grey pixel
to be ﬁlled is I(i, j), then,
I(i, j) = 1

where Ik(i, j), i = 0, 1, . . . , Rx−1, j = 0, 1, . . . , Ry−1 is the grey color of surrounding
pixels about I(i, j) not to be pixels. So the error of ﬁlled color to the color of the
ﬁlled, N ≤8 is the total number of these surrounding pixels is:

Eq. 3.7 and Eq. 3.8 tell us that the error is related with the color of surrounding
pixels, if the surrounding color has little variance, the error is little and the area can
be ﬁlled more accurately.

Logo Removal using Video Inpainting
Image inpainting technique could be considered for logo removal. However, since
this method cannot erase logos that have a large area, a diﬀerent approach is ex-
amined in this section. The video logo is removed by obtaining the most similar
region in the video frame to ﬁll the region occupied by the logo. It is akin to the
idea of motion compensation used in compression albeit with an idea of doing re-
gion restoration. Although many distance measures can be selected for matching,
herein the matching method based on the Hausdorﬀdistance is used for the sake of
simplicity. The advantage of this proposed system is that it is automatic without
human intervention. Moreover, we deﬁne a new concept: video inpainting. In this
approach, we imagine the logo in a frame sequence to be a cylinder and the job is
to ﬁll the cylinder with the help of neighboring frames and boundary information.
3.5.1
Matching Based Logo Removal
Given two ﬁnite point sets A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} and B = {b1, b2, . . . , bm}, the
Hausdorﬀdistance is deﬁned as: h(A, B) = max(h(A, B), h(B, A)), h(A, B) =
maxa∈A minb∈B ||ai −bj||, ai ∈A, bj ∈B, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, j = 1, 2, . . . , m and
where || · || is a norm on the points of A and B.
The key advantage of using the Hausdorﬀdistance to compare the diﬀerence of
images is its low sensitivity to small perturbations of the image. The computation
of Hausdorﬀdistance diﬀers from many other shape comparison based methods in
which there is no correspondence between the model and the image. The method is
quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors
and other feature extraction methods [51, 52, 53, 54]. Although the pixel position
information is not used in the computation of Hausdorﬀdistance, each pixel has its
ﬁxed position in the blocks related to logo searching. The position of each search
block is the primary concern instead of the position of each pixel.
Assume that a video logo occupies a portion of video frames Iw(x, y) in image I(x, y),
the most similar region Is(x, y) should be found in the image I(x, y) among all video
frames under the deﬁnition of Hausdorﬀdistance. The content of this region is the
most similar to the content of the region that the logo occupies Io(x, y). Namely
the similarity takes the maximum value in all the candidate regions Ic(x, y):
dc = Io · Ic
|Io||Ic|, ds = min(dc), Is = Ic|dc=ds
(3.9)
If this region is found, it can be used to replace the logo. This method has a problem
since the logo overlaps the region, ﬁnding the best match for it is problematic. Since

it is not known what lies underneath the logo, adjacent regions are considered. The
regions to the right, left, top, and bottom of the video logo region are considered for
matching with other frames in the shot. For the current frame, these four regions are
matched with all the other video frames. The most similar pairs are found among
all the candidate pairs in the video frames. The corresponding position of video
logo in the best-matched frame will be found. For instance, if the highest similar
pair among the candidate regions is on the top of logo region in a video, the region
under the highest similar region of the matched frame will replace the logo region.
Subsequently the region with the logo will be replaced and thus the video logo is
removed.
When this algorithm is utilized to remove video logo, at least three frames are
considered; they are the current frame, next frame and previous frame in the same
shot if available.
Figure 3.4: Matching based algorithm for region overlapping.
In Figure 3.4, suppose the middle frame is a frame of the input video with a logo.
Around the video logo, four regions are marked with A, B, C and D. In order to
obtain the substitution region of the logo, the regions in the related frames (previous
frames and next frames) of the current frame are considered with the most similar
pair among all the candidate pairs being selected. The corresponding region is then
used to replace the watermarked region. If the most similar pair is on the top of the
logo, the region under matching is utilized to overlap the visible watermark, shown
in the left part of Figure 3.4; if the most similar pair is at the bottom of the logo,
the area above the matched region is utilized to overlap the logo as shown in the
right part of Figure 3.4.
Since the objects in video are moving, the region occupied by the video logo in the
current frame may not be obscured by the logo forever. Thus the opportunity is
there to locate that region without a logo covering which can be subsequently used
for removing the logo from the current frame.
The drawback of this technique is similar to that of locating the logo region. If most
objects in the frames of target video are stationary, perhaps a better substitution

region cannot be found to replace the region occupied by the video logo. However
it is possible to ﬁnd some regions to replace the logo even if it is not the optimal
one. Another shortcoming of the proposal is that sometimes the found blocks will
bring extra visible edges after overlapping and destroy the coherence of this region.
Therefore, the video frames should be inpainted using video inpainting. In short,
overlapping based logo removal is a supplementary measure to handle the logos with
motion in the background (for at least one logo region position). If the motion is
not so signiﬁcant, video inpainting can be employed to ﬁll the logo region.
3.5.2
Video Inpainting Based Logo Removal
Unlike image inpainting and block based overlapping algorithms for video logo re-
moval, video inpainting considers a frame sequence to ﬁll a logo region. The logo
region to be ﬁlled in the frame sequence is treated as a cylinder. The processing of
video logo removal can be considered as the ﬁlling of cylinder in the video volume
layer from the outmost to the innermost layers. The scheme is illustrated by Figure
3.5. Three example frames of video are shown in the diagram. The rectangles repre-
sent pixels in frames with the red ones indicating the current pixels to be inpainted.
In Figure 3.5(b), the green rectangles illustrate the pixels those are needed to be in-
painted later and the information of the blue pixels is utilized to inpaint the current
pixels. The yellow rectangles are also utilized in the rendering of the current pixels.

In Figure 3.5, the logo region is overlapped by using a 3-dimensional gradient vectors
instead of 2-dimensional gradient vectors normally used in image inpainting to obtain
a region to replace the logo. The contributions of the gradient vectors are computed
based on adjacent frames in order to predict the color value of the current pixels.

Motion vectors are also used for logo regions in order to ﬁnd the pixels on the outside
rings. The idea is to ﬁll the marked region more precisely than those proposed before.
Mathematically, suppose Ω is the logo region with ∂Ω being its boundary. A pixel
on the boundary δΩ that needs to be inpainted is denoted as y = f(x, y, t), where
(x, y) is the pixel position, t is the frame on which it is located. The tangent vector
is T(fx, fy, ft) and the normal vector N(nx, ny, nt) lies on a plane, where T · N = 0.
The gradient vector G(−nx, −ny, −nt) also is on this plane. In order to inpaint the
logo cylinder, only those normal vectors I(Ix, Iy, It) are utilized, whose direction
points towards the axis of the cylinder, namely: G × (0, 0, 1) · T > 0 as shown in
Figure 3.5(c). The inpainted pixels are estimated by using the ﬁrst order diﬀerence:
△ft = f(x, y, t + 1) −f(x, y, t)
(3.10)
△fx = f(x + 1, y, t) −f(x, y, t)
(3.11)
△fy = f(x, y + 1, t) −f(x, y, t)
(3.12)
f(x, y, t) =
wt · (2 · f(x, y, t −1) −f(x, y, t −2)) +
wx · (2 · f(x −1, y, t) −f(x −2, y, t)) +
wy · (2 · f(x, y −1, t) −f(x, y −2, t))
(3.13)
where the wt ∈[0, 1], wx ∈[0, 1] and wy ∈[0, 1] are weights that indicate the
contribution of the various gradients to the current pixels, and wt + wx + wy = 1.
In temporal domain, video frame coherence is exploited and the correlation between
these frames is utilized. Thus the 3D gradients from diﬀerent directions must be
computed. Not only are the 2D gradients used to compute the inﬂuence on the
current pixels; the temporal domain information from adjacent frames is also used.

The video inpainting based method ﬁlls the concentric cylinder step by step along
both the temporal and spatial directions by propagating the region information. The
video inpainting processing can be visualized as the dissolving surface of a cylindrical
“ice block” in a tank of water. One of challenges of this 3D dissolution method is
that it is needed to obtain the motion estimation; this is used to infer the optical
ﬂows and isohyets.

Chapter 4
Digital Scrambling
Scrambling a digital signal in the spatial or frequency domain corresponds to altering that
signal in such a way that the original semantic media loses its meaning and becomes diﬃ-
cult to view. This technique has been successfully applied in the television industry. This
chapter starts at looking at digital image scrambling, then progressive audio scrambling is
introduced. The approaches presented in this chapter can be applied in many situations.
Descrambling a digital signal is very easy to implement, it is usually the inverse procedure
of the original scrambling function.
4.1
Overview
Scrambling refers to transforming a semantic piece of media data into something
that contains suﬃcient disorder to make the original semantic meanings disappear.
Its inverse transformation is called descrambling.
The attackers cannot get the
original media even if they have the scrambled media. Scrambling should satisfy (1)
low degree of understanding; (2) high quality; (3) no change in the frequency; (4)
diﬃcult to be broken.
4.2
Digital Image Scrambling
Digital image scrambling originated from scrambling of cable TV signals.
With
the development of digital high deﬁnition TV, scrambling has attracted much more
attention. This is due to the fact that scrambling is an important means of digital
media security, in that it can transmit a scrambled signal and restore it successfully
with no quality loss.

Digital scrambling refers to transforming an image into another completely diﬀerent
image, the operator only knows the algorithm and keys, this allows them to restore
the original image.
If any user does not have any prior knowledge of the algorithm and the corresponding
keys, the original image cannot be restored. Image scrambling looks very easy, in
fact it is really not like this. This is because the algorithms are not secure and
cannot ensure the scrambled images lose the original semantic meanings. Digital
image scrambling requires that the scrambled image have the same size as that of
the original image. Scrambling does not aﬀect the image resolution.
Compared to the research objectives of cryptography, a digital image provides a
large amount of data, or in other words, it can provide a larger space for plain text
and cipher text. The most important thing is that the self-correlation of the digital
image is represented in two directions perpendicular with each other, while the self-
correlation of a text, such as one-dimensional signal sequence, is rather diﬃcult to
obtain. With these two characteristics of the digital image, attackers may try to ﬁnd
a ﬁxed frequency of each pixel, but, since diﬀerent images have diﬀerent histograms,
it will be very diﬃcult for them to ﬁnd it. How can a map be established of the
conversion between the original image and disguised one? In digital scrambling, the
attackers wish to ﬁnd out the frequency of each pixel, since diﬀerent images have
diﬀerent histograms, therefore, such a search is very hard.
In [55], the past and current encryption schemes have been summarized, such as
random scan line scrambling, scan line transposition scrambling, scan line cycling
scrambling, and pixel scrambling. Matias and Shamir presented a scrambling tech-
nology based on curve ﬁlling-up [56].

Chessboard Coding Based Scrambling
In 2000 B.C., the Greeks created chessboard coding. This ancient code has been
prevalent around the world. In the code, 26 letters are put in 5 × 5 grids, where i
and j are put in the same table cell in Table 4.1:
Thus, each letter corresponds to a group of numbers consisting of the row and

column numbers, e.g. “m” corresponds to “32”. Therefore the following text can
be expressed as:
Text: Digital Image Security Processing
Code: 14 24 22 24 44 11 31 24 32 11 22 15 43 15 13 45 42 24 44 54 35 42 34 13 15

Corresponding to the 256 color values of a grayscale digital image, there exists such
a table that maps one color value onto another. Therefore each color has a number,
the table is transposed and another image is obtained. Figure 4.1 is an example
using this chessboard based image scrambling.

Digital Scrambling
The chessboard coding scrambling scheme can be generalized which allows the prob-
lem to be described as follows:
Given matrix A and image I, image I should be re-ordered according to matrix A
within the color domain, spatial domain or frequency domain, the scrambled image
is completely disordered, any observers cannot acquire any semantic information
from it. Figure 4.2 is an example of using this chessboard coding based scrambling,
the matrix in this example is generated using Hilbert curves.

Caesar Coding Based Scrambling
In cryptography, Caesar coding is deﬁned as follows:
c = (k1m + k2) mod 26
(4.1)
Where m is text, c is cipher text, k1 and k2 are keys. The modulus is 26, as there
are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
Eq. 4.1 can be extended to a more general situation, the following formula is ob-
tained:

operation, (R, G, B) is the scrambled color, (R1, G2, B3) is the original color. Figure

DES Based Scrambling
XOR operation refers to:
1 ⊕1 = (1 + 1) mod 2 = 0; 1 ⊕0 = (1 + 0) mod 2 = 1;
0 ⊕1 = (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1; 0 ⊕0 = (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0;
where ⊕is noted as XOR operation. The advantage of using XOR operation is
repeating XOR operations will restore the orignial number. e.g. 110010 ⊕101101 =
11111; 11111 ⊕101101 = 110010.
Suppose an image is taken and a key is selected to generate a random image. Using
the XOR operation to combine both images on the color space, the result will be
indistinguishable. If the scrambled image is XOR’d again with the random image,
the original image can be recovered. Figure 4.6(c) is the scrambled image using
XOR operation between Figure 4.6(b) and 4.6(a). The advantage of this scrambling
algorithm is that it is swift, convenient, the key space is very small, the security of
the scrambled image has to be subject to the key and the relevant parameters.
Single direction scrambling based on XOR operations cannot generate very good
scrambling quality, the reason is the outline of the image still visible. Therefore, the
scrambling based on double direction XOR operations is shown in Figure 4.7(b).
The scrambling algorithm based on double direction XOR operation suﬃciently
scrambles the original image, the scrambled image successfully hides the outline of
the image. This guarantees the scrambled image is indiscernible in the color space.
Figure 4.8(a) is the original image, Figure 4.8(b) is the scrambled result using single
direction XOR operation based scrambling, the outlines can be clearly seen. Figure

Digital Image Scrambling Based on Magic Squares
Magic square is an old mathematical problem, of which record can be found in old
books. It has many useful properties and fantastic structure that it has attracted
the attention of numerous scholars. The standard magic square is an n order matrix

of which the matrix A is referred to as the standard magic square.
Suppose the n-order matrix of a given digital image corresponds to B. For a ﬁxed
n-order magic square A, a map between B and A is constructed. A sequence of
operations is established in A: moving element 1 to the position of element 2, move
element 2 to position of element 3. Generally, for each element m ∈{1, 2, . . . , n2−1}
in A, when it is moved from its position in A into the position of element m + 1, if
m = n2, then it can be moved to the position of element 1. After this kind of moving,
the magic square A changes to a matrix A1, denoting as A1 = EA ; for A1, A2 = EA1
is obtained by repeating the above procedure, and then, iteratively, A3 = EA2,
A4 = EA3, etc. This is known as a sequence of scrambling transformations. As a
result, An2 = A will be obtained after n2 steps of iteration.
For a digital image matrix B, taking into account the correspondence of elements
between B and A, elements (grayscale values of each pixel) of B are moved to
corresponding position to obtain a new digital image matrix B1, denotes as EB =
B1, while transforming A to A1. Similarly, Bm = EmB is possible. It has been
proved that the cycle of this kind of digital image scrambling is as follows:
T = N 2

code transformation to scramble digital images.
For any given non-negative integer n, its binary format can be written as n =
(npnp−1 . . . n1n0), where nj ∈0, 1. From such an addition: 0⊕1 = 1⊕0 = 1, 0⊕0 =
1 ⊕1 = 0 the following transformation is given:
gj = nj+1 ⊕nj, j = 0, 1, . . . , p g = (gpgp−1 . . . g1g0)2

thus obtaining g = G(n), G is called the Gray transformation, and g is known as
the relative Gray code of n. In Table 4.2, the result of Gray transformation from 0

Gray transformation has a hierarchy of ﬁne stratiﬁcation, thus assuming a structure
of self-similarities. In fact, Gray transformation can be expressed as following matrix
format:
Theorem 4.2.1.
I1 = I1 = 1, I2k =
 I2k−1
I2k−1

I2k =

I2k−1
I2k−1

k = 1, 2, . . .
(4.10)
where matrix I2k and I2k are block diagonal matrix and anti-diagonal matrix, re-
spectively, and each sub-block matrix I2k and I2k can be divided into a half order
diagonal matrix and anti-diagonal matrix.
As shown in the Figure 4.10, 4.10(a) is g = G(n) represented in the rectangle
coordinates system, 4.10(b) is the matrix I32, where the black stands for 1, and the
white stands for 0, and the solid line represents the hierarchy of ﬁne stratiﬁcation
and subdivision structures. The curve in Figure 4.10(c) is obtained from the matrix
of Figure 4.10(b), having the self-similarity.

Theorem 4.2.2. Suppose the Gray code of nonnegative integer n is G(n), let
G0(n) = n, Gk(n) = G ◦Gk−1(n), k = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Then, when positive integer n,
it satisﬁes 2k−1 ≤n ≤2k −1, G2k(n) = n.
From Theorem 4.2.2 it is known that, for any non-negative integer n, if it can satisfy
n ≤2k −1, then G2k(n) = n. Thus, for any image with a grayscale level of 2k, if a
continuous transformation process is performed for its gray level, an accurate image
can be reproduced.
Gray transformation can be expanded to a series of other transformations, which
can be represented in the following matrix forms:

Digital Image Scrambling Based on Conway’s Game
Conway’s game is a special image matrix transformation. In the 1970’s, British
mathematician John Conway and his students conﬁrmed apt rules after repetitious
experiments. Suppose there is a planar grid, in which each node represents a life
cell. If it is ﬁlled with black color, the cell is believed to be alive; if it is ﬁlled with
white color, the cell is considered dead. Suppose the planar grid is inﬁnite great (in
fact, the upper and bottom, left and right boundaries of a ﬁnite planar grid can be
linked up), then each cell will have 8 neighbors, of which state will aﬀect the state
of the surrounded cell. For the given initial states of all the cells of the planar grid,
the following rules should be used:

1. If the surrounded cell has 3 neighbors of which grid is black, then, no matter
what its initial state was like, it has to be changed to black;
2. If the cell happens to have 2 neighbors whose state is black, it will maintain
its initial state unchanged.
3. Otherwise, no matter what its initial state was like, it has to be changed to
white.
If the planar grid is seen as a 1-bit image, then Conway’s game will be a kind of
special image matrix transformation. Figure 4.12 shows a diagram of the multiplied
process of Conway’s game [57].

Suppose that set Z represents the alive state of all the cells on the planar grid,
i.e., the set of all the grids on the planar grid, set S0 the initial state of these alive
cells, i.e., the set of the grids in the initial state that become alive, and set Si
represents the set of the cells that become alive after i-th iteration, where i > 0.
Let set S(i) = ∪0≤j≤iSj represent all the cells, which had become alive after the i-th
iteration. The algorithm can be deﬁned as follows:
1. Establish the correspondence between the cells and pixels of a given image;
2. For the initial state S0 of a planar grid, arrange, in order of scan lines, the
pixels corresponding to the alive cells into the space of the coordinates of
scrambled image;
3. When reaching the i-th steps of iteration, arrange, in order of scan lines, the
pixels corresponding to the alive cells in the set S(i) −S(i−1) into the space of
the coordinates of scrambled image;
4. If the iteration stops at the n-th step, arrange, in order of scan lines, the pixels
corresponding to the cells in the set Z −S(N) into the space of the coordinates
of scrambled image.

Audio Scrambling
Since digital audio is described by signal amplitude, frequency, phase [58] and time.
Therefore, these parameters are employed for audio scrambling. The basic principle
of these approaches is that the bandwidth of the digital signal is not changed during
the audio scrambling process [59].
Audio scrambling aims to minimize the residual intelligibility of the original audio
and control the access to authorized users only. It is similar to but not a direct
application of normal cryptographic techniques. The main advantage is that scram-
bled audio ﬁles are still legal audio ﬁles which can be played by the corresponding
players.

Digital Scrambling
4.3.1
Audio Scrambling in the Temporal Domain
Audio scrambling based in the temporal domain usually segment audio signals into
many pieces, these pieces have been scrambled by using diﬀerent parameters based
on the temporal window. In each window, audio signals are scrambled in each frame.
This window based scrambling improved the redundancy of scrambled audio. This
approach can reach trade-oﬀbetween secure degree and quality.
Audio scrambling based in the temporal domain usually adopts the uniform scram-
bling transformation:
Tk1m1 = [tij](N−1)×(N−1), i, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N −1, k1 and N are prime numbers:
tij =
 1
j = (k1i + m1) mod N
0
otherwise
(4.14)
Its inverse transformation is:
Tk2m2 = T 1
k1m1, (k1m2 + m1) mod N = 0, (k1k2) mod N = 1
(4.15)
In practice, in order to enhance the key space, the following transformation is taken:
T =
N−1

m1=0
am1Tk1m1
(4.16)
Its inverse transformation is:
T −1 =
N−1

m2=0
am2Tk1m2
(4.17)
4.3.2
Scrambling in the Frequency Domain
Scrambling in the frequency domain is committed to the frequency. In audio scram-
bling, in order to prevent an increase in size of the audio spectrum, it normally
does not scramble the high frequency part of the signal. Therefore the following
transformation is taken:
M =

where I is N2 × N2 is unify matrix, X is the standard N1 × N1 swapping matrix, 0
is all zero N2 × N2 matrix, N = 2N1 + N2 + 1. The matrix is symmetric, it is useful
in encoding and decoding.
4.3.3
Joint Scrambling
Joint scrambling combines temporal scrambling and frequency scrambling together.
This is more powerful than only using one domain in scrambling. The following
segment introduces audio scrambling based on integer rings:
In the integer remain ring zm modeled with M, x(q) ∈Zm(q = 0, 1, . . . , N −1) the
transformation operates on the sequence x(0), x(1), x(2), . . . , x(N −1) is:
x(k) =
N−1

q=0
x(q)aqk; k = 0, 1, . . . , N −1; a ∈Zm
(4.19)
It inverse transformation is:
x(q) = N −1
N−1

k=0
x(k)a−qk; q = 0, 1, . . . , N −1; a ∈Zm
(4.20)
This transformation has the property of convolution.

Progressive MP3 Audio Scrambling
With the wide-spread use of the MP3 audio format, the need for developing a
new scrambling algorithm that can work in the compressed domain has become
important [60]. Past research is based on permutation in either the frequency or
time domain [61] for normal audio data. However, not much work has been done in
the compressed domain. MP3 is mainly used for online music distribution. There is
a need for allowing the music owners to have ﬂexible control over their music. An
algorithm that allows them to provide music of varying quality to diﬀerent users
and which, at same time, is able to protect the copyright for the MP3 ﬁles can be
very useful.
In this section, a progressive algorithm is introduced that does multiple rounds
of scrambling of MP3 audio. The MP3 outputs can be reconstructed at diﬀerent
levels of quality based on the number of keys provided and the rounds of scrambling
performed.

The idea behind this technique is to scramble the Huﬀman code words in the MP3
ﬁle. However, instead of directly shuﬄing the Huﬀman code word table, the actual
MP3 data is operated upon, this is to eliminate any repetitious values, i.e. one
value in the original audio will be shuﬄed to diﬀerent output values, which will
break the statistical correlation between the source audio and the output. This is
very important for thwarting statistical cryptanalysis.
Progressive quality levels are attained by conducting multiple scrambling. A few
rounds of scrambling are required and the quality degrades gradually with each
scrambling. By performing the inverse descrambling processes, audio with diﬀerent
qualities will be generated.

The procedure of MP3 audio scrambling/descrambling is explained in Figure 4.14.
Given an MP3 audio, the header frame is ignored and only the audio data is op-
erated upon, C = ci, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, n is the length of the audio stream. A sample
rate sγ needs to be predeﬁned before each round of scrambling. To make the qual-
ity degradation linear, the sampling rate sγ(l) needs to be set at an exponential
increment rate for diﬀerent rounds.

where l is the level number, l = 1, 2, . . . , L. L is the total number of rounds of
scrambling to conduct. Also a KT will be initialized; the format of KT is shown as
follows:
KT = (key(i, j))p×q
(4.22)
The key table generation can make use of special techniques to ensure the uniqueness
and randomness of the key tables generated. For the keys used in this scheme, the
Arnold matrix [62] is employed to generate random p × q matrix using an input
random generated seed, here p = q. The Arnold matrix is shown as follows:

ri,j = rand(range), i = 1, 2, . . . , p; j = 1, 2, . . . , q
(4.24)
where rand(·) is a function to generate random number sequence based on a seed
range. Then generate K′

The Arnold matrix is used to transform the keys in the table to the diﬀerent kinds
of choices for diﬀerent users. The transformation based on this matrix can ensure
the validity of the keys since they are bounded.
For the i-th data item ci in the original audio, a modulo division is performed of the
current position i with the row length p of the key table and the remainder decides
the row number j of the key to be used.
ji = mod(i, p) + 1
(4.26)
The column number ki will cyclically range from the ﬁrst column to the maximum
column number q.
ki = mod(ki−1, q) + 1
(4.27)
After the key ki = key(ji, ki) is selected, an XOR is performed with the MP3 audio
datum ci. XOR is chosen due to the speed and simplicity of implementation, since it
is its own inverse. The changed datum c′
i is written into the corresponding position
of the output stream:
c′
i = ci ⊕key(ji, ki)
(4.28)
where key(ji, ki) is the element in matrix KT, ⊕is the bit-wise XOR. This procedure
is repeated until the end of the data stream and the output data stream is also an
MP3 stream.
The keys used will be stored and they will be distributed to the
authorized consumers for descrambling.
The descrambling process is exactly similar to the scrambling procedure. For de-
scrambling level l, a MP3 ﬁle generated from descrambling level l −1 will be used
as an input. The same process is applied and using the same KT that has been used
in the scramble round l.
With the implementation of the scrambling process as described above, the quality
of the output MP3 ﬁle depends on how many levels of descrambling involved. For
example, during scrambling if an MP3 audio has been scrambled 5 times using 5
diﬀerent keys, a user needs to have all the 5 keys and perform 5 rounds of descram-
bling before they can perfectly restore the original audio. If the user has only 4 keys
or performs only 4 rounds of descrambling, he will get an audio of approximately
80% of the original quality.

Digital Surveillance
Due to the decreasing costs and sizes of video cameras, the use of digital video based surveil-
lance as a tool for real-time monitoring is rapidly increasing. In this chapter, the situation
of multiple surveillance cameras is taken into account and the experiential sampling tech-
nique is utilized to decide which surveillance video stream should be displayed on the main
monitor. This can help tremendously in reducing the amount of concentration required for
multiple monitor situations.
5.1
Overview
Surveillance is being increasingly used for traditional and non-traditional security
applications such as monitoring of shopping malls and ATMs as well as industrial
supervisory use and city road networks [63]. The decreasing costs coupled with rapid
miniaturization of the video camera have enabled its widespread use on highways,
airports, railway stations and on-board vehicles. The recent trend of coupling video
cameras to cell-phones will only accelerate this trend. Therefore, research in video
surveillance is moving into the mainstream with the focus on day-to-day applications
and uncontrolled outdoor scenarios. It is moving away from mere data collection
with manual observation to intelligent analysis of events and actions at a semantic
level without the intervention of humans.

security breaches. Video surveillance has applications in oﬃces, stores, public spaces
and homes [64, 65]. This chapter will provide an incite into experiential sampling
techniques in a feedback control system for automatic adjustment of the parameters
of a ﬁxed video camera. The panning and zooming parameters of a video camera
will be controlled during this setup.
Motivation for studying the automatic adjustment of camera parameters stems from
the fact that a camera for video surveillance is usually not manipulated after its
installation. Regular calibration of such cameras for object tracking is desirable but
not feasible if done manually. As a result surveillance videos often are of low quality
due to changing ambient conditions especially for outdoor settings. High quality
videos in focus with appropriate positions for monitoring moving objects require the
ﬁxed surveillance cameras to capture and track those moving objects at its optimal
framing position with correct zoom and pan settings. Thus the automatic setting
and control of such video cameras is a diﬃcult but extremely useful task. Manual
control of cameras via internet, wireless [66] or remote radio channels is a feasible
but tedious operation. The aim is to have precise control of surveillance cameras
via these channels automatically in order to obtain a superior quality surveillance
video.
Figure 5.1: Feedback Control System for Surveillance.
Figure 5.1 is the proposed framework to be discussed throughout this chapter. Sev-
eral techniques for the detection and tracking of moving objects have been inves-
tigated in the literature. The experiential sampling technique is used because it
eﬀectively takes advantage of the context information of surveillance videos. For
example, the future motion of moving objects can be predicted by using past knowl-
edge that has been learned by the system. Thus, the computation is performed
in an experiential environment which is captured by both the sensor and attention
samples. The number of attention samples used is therefore a function of the envi-
ronment as well as past experiences. Consequently, experiential sampling creates a
dynamical solution for real-time object detection and tracking.
In order to obtain robust and accurate results, video surveillance system should have
adaptability in order to respond to the changes in the monitored environment. There

can be potentially many variations in the monitored environment. These variations
mainly come from two aspects: geometric aspects (location, size) of the observed
objects and the visibility quality (lighting, contrast) of the monitored environment.
Currently available video cameras can be manipulated to track the observed object
of interest by performing panning and zooming operations. It is also possible to
adjust to the visibility of the environment by automatically controlling camera pa-
rameters such as brightness and contrast. Therefore, it would be extremely useful to
systematically manipulate these camera parameters so as to adapt to the changing
surveillance environment.
The adaptive monitoring method considers both geometric aspects (automatic pan-
ning and zooming) in order to follow the movements (position, size) of the monitored
object and visibility aspect. Since the adjustment of visibility parameters is similar
to previous work about automatic adjustment video quality for home video in [67].
The automatic adjustment of the visibility parameters are not experimented on, as
opposed to only including it within the framework.
As previously mentioned, in a surveillance system, there are two types of varia-
tions in the environment: geometric aspects of objects and the visibility. In order
to adaptively monitor the environment, the basic experiential sampling algorithm
should be embedded into a feedback control system. The “state” variables of this
feedback control system are precisely the two factors of the environment which im-
pact the surveillance task. Thus, the state vector of the feedback control system is
represented by:
X(t) = {Geom(t), V is(t)}
(5.1)
where Geom(t) captures the geometric aspects of the surveillance object of interest
and V is(t) represents the visibility aspects of the object in the ambient environment.
The state variables of this system (geometric aspects of object and the visibility of
the environment) have to be estimated based on the previous time-instant atten-
tion samples and sensor samples. After obtaining those two factors, the camera
parameters can be adjusted by providing the appropriate feedback According to:
Geom(t) = {zoom(t), pan(t)} ←{AS(t −1)}
(5.2)
V is(t) = {brig(t), contr(t)} ←{SS(t −1)}
(5.3)
where Geom(t), the geometric parameters at time slice t, this includes the zoom
parameter zoom(t) and pan parameter pan(t). V is(t), the visibility parameters to
be tuned includes brig(t) the brightness and contr(t) contrast parameters.

Having characterized the surveillance environment by these two state variables, the

Digital Surveillance
After the geometric parameters of the object at time t are obtained, the panning
and zooming parameters of the camera can be determined for the next time instant
t + 1, and thus can use them to control the video display. This operation is the
geometric processing operation. The procedure is quite similar to the adjustment of
the visibility parameters. The geometric aspect is described in detail now.
Geometric processing aims to obtain the optimal framing for the surveillance object
of interest. Attempts are made to frame a moving object (e.g. human face in this
implementation) based on the attention samples. The optimal zooming factor and
translation vector are obtained to provide the feedback to the surveillance camera.
The proportional feedback control strategy [68] is used for doing the corrective
feedback.
At ﬁrst, the desired state of the surveillance system is ﬁxed.
If the
objects of interest are not framed properly (which will be indicated by the attention
samples), the target state will be reached by appropriate modiﬁcation of the pan
and zoom parameters of the camera. For instance, if the tracked object is at the
bottom of the video frame, the pan parameter of the camera is controlled and the
frame is moved upwards. Similarly, if the tracked object is at the top of the video
frame, the frame is panned downwards. Simultaneously, if the objects are not at
the desired zoom level, the zoom parameter will be controlled to obtain the video
with the appropriate size of the objects. The system settles down to a steady state
after a period of transition when the feedback control system makes the appropriate
corrective actions.
For this system, the desired state of the system is ﬁxed as follows: (a) the centroid
of the object of interest should be located at the center of the video frame and (b)
The ratio of the sides of the bounding box of the object of interest to the sides of
the video frame should be 0.618. From a human visual system point of view, the
object of interest at this framing state will exhibit the best observability. Such a
video frame can then be suitably displayed on a monitor to be seen by a human
operator. Based on the attention samples in the previous time instance, the two
parameters are computed as follows:
Oc = {AS(t −1)}c
(5.4)
AR = Areai/Area{AS(t−1)}
(5.5)
where the object centroid Oc is approximated by the centroid of all attention samples
(denoted by {AS(t)}c) while AR represents the area ratio of the total image area
(Areai) to the area of attention samples (Area{AS(t)}).
The deﬁnition of pan(t) is the camera pan position at time t. Therefore the new
pan(t) in step 16 of the feedback control algorithm can be formalized as:

Digital Surveillance
pan(t) = pan(t −1) + α(Oc −pan(t −1))
(5.6)
where α is the factor to control the panning speed.
α = 0.3 was used in the
experiments. The deﬁnition of zoom(t) is the object size at time t.
Notice that the error between the desired state of the system and the actual observed
state of the system is used as the corrective stimulus to steer the system towards
the desired state. This is basically due to the proportional feedback control strategy
used.
5.3
Video surveillance using multiple cameras
Without appropriate management, the huge volume of ﬁled video data will be im-
possible to analyze for events of interest. Video surveillance chieﬂy deals with spatio-
temporal data which have the following attributes:
• They possess tremendous volumes;
• The data is dynamic with temporal variations with a resultant history;
• Some data can be live with real-time processing and ﬁltering requirements;
• It does not exist in isolation - it exists in its ambient context with other data.
If a video surveillance technique does not fully consider the above attributes, it can
lead to tremendous computational ineﬃciency as well inﬂexibility in the processing.
The ineﬃciency stems from the inability to ﬁlter out the relevant aspects of the
data and thus considerable resources are expended on superﬂuous computations on
redundant data. If the ambient context is ignored, the technique cannot react to
the changing environment. Thus, the surveillance processing cannot adapt itself to
the task at hand.
On the other hand, there is solid evidence that humans are superb at dealing with
large volumes of disparate data using their own senses. The human visual system
is particularly adept at understanding the surrounding environment at appropriate
accuracy quite eﬃciently. This is due to many factors: the excellence of the physical
visual system, the richness of fusion information from perception, implicit under-
standing of every visual object, and the common understanding of how the world
works. These attributes in the experiential environments [69, 70] play an important
role for the human visual perception in understanding the visual scene accurately
and quickly. Some of these strategies would be incorporated into the techniques for

video surveillance. The main idea in this chapter is to enable surveillance techniques
with an ability to “focus” precisely on the data of interest while being simultaneously
sensitive to the current context as well as the assimilated past experiences.
In order to achieve this, a novel technique called experiential sampling is utilized,
i.e., sampling the data in the experiential environment. The main theoretical tech-
nique has been introduced initially by Wang and Kankanhalli [71]. This experiential
sampling technique is applied to the problem of video surveillance and demonstrates
its usefulness for this problem. The basic idea is to sense the contextual information
in the experiential environment in order to build a sampling based dynamic atten-
tion model to maintain the focus towards the interest of the current surveillance
task. Only the relevant samples are considered for the surveillance analysis. These
samples succinctly capture the most important data. Moreover, the past samples
inﬂuence future sampling via feedback. This mechanism ensures that the analysis
task beneﬁts from past experience.
The experiential sampling technique can be utilized for many aspects of video surveil-
lance such as object (face or vehicle) detection, object recognition and object track-
ing. For example, intruders can enter only from the boundary of the scene. There-
fore, when there are no intruders in the scene, the analysis task for surveillance
should focus on the boundary. If there is an intruder, the focus of attention should
evolve to follow the person. These experiences can be easily modeled by using the
experiential sampling technique. The results of multiple cameras video surveillance
are presented.

Digital Surveillance
As a general analysis framework for video surveillance, this proposed approach can
be used for a variety of video surveillance tasks, especially real-time applications.
As a test case, a multiple camera surveillance scenario has been developed. This
scenario is described ﬁrst before presenting the experimental results.
In the real-world usage of video surveillance, multiple cameras are utilized in a
wide spectrum of applications for the purpose of monitoring. As a result, multiple
monitors are used to display the various output video streams. Manual monitoring
of multiple screens is indeed tedious and operators are prone to fatigue which can
have disastrous consequences. Thus, it would be extremely useful to reduce the
data from multiple screens into one main screen for monitoring. This is reasonable
since usually only one screen is of active interest which engages the attention of the
operator. Even if there is no manual observer, ﬁnding the most relevant camera
data stream is useful for automated analysis such as object detection. Thus in this
section, an algorithm is developed to analyze the importance of the video frames
from the multiple video cameras by using the experiential sampling technique.
Figure 5.2: The setup for multiple camera surveillance.
In this multiple camera surveillance scenario, there are p number of cameras Ck.
The experiential environment can be redeﬁned as:
et = {C1(t), C2(t), . . . , Cp(t)} and Ck(t) = {Sk(t), Ak(t)}
(5.7)
where Ak(t) and Sk(t) are the attention samples and sensor samples of the camera
Ck(t) at time slice t. By this deﬁnition, the algorithm introduced in the previous
section is used to acquire the attention saturation of the motion activity.
It is
assumed that the motion attention saturation precisely reﬂects the importance of
current video frame. At any point in time, the output of one camera is designated
as the relevant camera whose output is displayed on the main monitor. The actual
camera picked dynamically changes based on the data. The strategy is illustrated
in Figure 5.2. In Figure 5.2, several cameras are ﬁxed and their current frames are

extracted for analysis. The attention saturation of these frames are computed and
compared. Only the frame with the maximum attention saturation will be extracted
and displayed on the main monitor.
The algorithm for multiple camera video surveillance can be described as follows:
1. Collect all the video frames at this time instance;
2. Compute their attention saturation;
3. Find the most important frame;
4. Display the most important frame on the main monitor;
5. Continue till the end.
The advantage of this proposal is that the most important frame is extracted at any
given instance and rendered on the main monitor which greatly reduces the manual
monitoring eﬀorts. Note that this can be easily generalized for the n cameras and
m monitors situation where m < n.

Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.4 represent two types of experiment. Individual attention
saturation of each frame in these three videos is calculated. The important frames
are extracted, namely the ones with the highest attention saturation to compose a
new video, this new video will be displayed on the main monitor for the operators.
Figure 5.3(a) is a diagram for the positions of three video cameras. Each camera
covers only a limited ﬁeld of view, and these viewing regions have no overlap. Fig-
ure 5.3(b) is the resultant diagram for the attention saturations of the three video
streams. It can be clearly seen that the peaks occur at diﬀerent times in the diﬀerent
cameras. A peak corresponds to the fact that someone is detected to be walking past
that camera. Thus the main monitor can display the output of the camera which is
active at any instance of time (instead of constantly watching three monitors).
Figure 5.4 shows another group of results. The three cameras have some overlaps
in the ﬁeld of view as shown in Figure 5.4(a). In this case, the person walking can
be seen on many monitors simultaneously. In this case, it becomes very diﬃcult for
a manual operator to decide which monitor to watch. However, by using attention

saturation for experiential sampling, the peaks can be easily determined as shown
in Figure 5.4(b).
This information can be utilized to appropriately display the
information on the main monitor.
5.4
Multimedia Simpliﬁcation for Video Monitor-
ing
Multimedia simpliﬁcation is related to but is very diﬀerent from summarization.
It attempts to pick the semantically most salient aspects of the media streams.
Simpliﬁcation focuses on extracting the semantic saliency of the multimedia data
while summarization attempts maximal data reduction with minimal loss in seman-
tics. Thus, simpliﬁcation is always semantically lossy which preserves only the most
salient aspects for a given data size constraint. It helps obtain the most compact
representation to convey the semantic saliency. On the other hand, summarization
tries to minimize this semantic loss while maximizing the data compactness. In
other words, the summary tries to provide a gist of the entire content - the salient
aspects as well as some idea of the non-salient aspects. It must be noted that a
drastic amount of summarization will asymptotically reduce to simpliﬁcation since
the salient aspects will be preserved at the cost of the non-salient aspects.
However, there is another crucial diﬀerence between simpliﬁcation and summariza-
tion in the case of multimedia data. For multiple correlated streams, summarization
faithfully tries to preserve the individual stream semantics without trading oﬀone
against the other. On the other hand, simpliﬁcation on correlated streams can po-
tentially do cross-modal tradeoﬀs. For instance, the video stream could be totally
discarded if the audio stream can completely convey the salient aspect (e.g. the
current score of a live game).

Pictures are two-dimensional signals. Experiential sampling was ﬁrst used to reduce
the redundancy in surveillance video [72]. The experiential sampling technique is
employed on pictures to obtain the most salient region of the picture. With the
availability of high resolution cameras, images tend to be detailed and huge. It may
be possible to reduce the resolution via sub-sampling, which can however result in
the loss of details, which may not be desirable. Hence, it would be better to have a
cropped but detailed rendition of the most salient region of the image.
Simpliﬁcation of Still Pictures
First, the gradients of the image is calculated using [73]:
∂I =
∂I(x, y)
∂x
, ∂I(x, y)
∂y

= (Ix, Iy)
(5.8)
where I(x, y), x = 1, 2, . . . , W; y = 1, 2, . . . , H, W and H are width and height of the
image respectively. The intensity changes are computed to discard the low-gradient
regions.
∂I =
I(x + Δx, y) −I(x, y)
Δx
, I(x, y + Δy) −I(x, y)
Δy

(5.9)
Δx and Δy are the step lengths in the X and Y direction respectively. The sen-
sor samples of the ES algorithm are SS(t) = {∂I(x, y)} where Wt is a candidate
window. If |∂I(x, y)| > τ, then I(x, y) belongs to the salient region. The attention
saturation is Asat(x, y) = {I(x, y), |∂I(x, y)| > τ1, τ1 > 0}. The attention samples
are determined by the ratio between the salient regions and the non-salient regions,
namely:
AS(t) = {∂I(x, y), Nos(t)
NoN(t) > τ2, (x, y) ∈Wt}
(5.10)
where Nos(t) and NoN(t) are the numbers of salient and the non-salient regions. Only
the important region Ω = {Wt :
Nos
NoN > τ2, τ2 > 0} will be selected and presented
on the mobile device, Wt is t-th window on the picture. Basically, this technique
is based on image segmentation which utilizes image block fusion and multi-level
selection based on thresholds.

Simpliﬁcation of Motion Pictures
For the motion pictures, the salient portions need to be extracted from the important
frames. It is assumed that the entire set of full pictures for an event are obtained
[74]. The most important frames are selected from the entire sequence. For a single
picture, the earlier technique can be used to perform still picture simpliﬁcation.
However, this will lead to a problem. For a sequence of pictures in a video, diﬀerent
frames may be cropped in diﬀerent places with diﬀerent aspect ratios. So if a slide-
show of such a sequence is run, from individually simpliﬁed frames, it is likely that
some jitter can be observed.
Hence, for motion pictures, the entire sequence of
frames must be considered in order to eliminate jitter. For this purpose, the motion
trajectory is computed of the single-frame simpliﬁcation results with respect to the
original frames. Then a trajectory smoothing operation is performed based on either
the mean trajectory technique or the Bezier curve ﬁtting technique as in [67]. Given
a motion picture set Mp = {P1, P2, . . . , Pn},the gradient of the motion pictures is
given as follow:
∂Pt =
∂Pt(x, y)
∂t
, ∂Pt(x, y)
∂x
, ∂Pt(x, y)
∂y

(5.11)
For discrete frames, it reduces to:
∂Pt =
∂Pt+Δt(x, y)
Δt
, ∂Pt(x + Δx, y)
Δx
, ∂Pt(x, y + Δy)
Δy

(5.12)
where t = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n; Δt, Δx and Δy are the step length in diﬀerent directions.
For the salient regions of each picture Pi = {Oi1, Oi2, . . . , Oim} selected from Eq.
5.10, the importance of each object is |Oij|. The importance of that frame among
motion pictures is measured by Pi = max |Oij|.
Using this information, salient
frames can be picked as well as the salient regions of every picked frame.
The
motion trajectory can then be computed which is then smoothed. The ﬁnal set of
salient regions is then obtained.
Audio simpliﬁcation aims to ﬁnd the most salient content in an audio clip. The
saliency is determined by the energy and spectrum of the audio content.
It is
based on intra- and interframe analysis.
The experiential sampling technique is
used to discard the low attended audio frames.
Consider an audio clip:
γ =
{υi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} where υi are audio frames; for each frame, the samples are
υi = {Ψi,1,1, Ψi,1,1, . . . , Ψi,1,1, Ψi,j,m}, i is number of this frame, j is the number of
channels and m is number of samples per frame. The size of each frame in bytes is

Where τi > 0, i = 1, 2, 3 are the thresholds for determining the diﬀerent degrees of
salience.
In the scenario of family care, the sensors installed at home will transfer the visual
and audio signals to a home server.
Only the relevant simpliﬁed information is
integrated and transferred to the home server.
Once an alarm is triggered, the
home server sends the relevant data to the MMS server. The server processes the
multimedia data and sends the information to the mobile device. On the mobile
device, the important information will be shown. If the mobile users would like
to know in detail about the alarm, he can request the MMS server to send more
information.
Here a motion picture sequence is shown for infant care. For the motion pictures
corresponding to Figure 5.5(a), two pictures are obtained having high saliency among
the sequence. The obtained pictures in Figure 5.5(b) are useful in monitoring the
baby’s actions especially to check for face laceration with their ﬁngernails.
The
two important pictures appear at frame numbers 198 and 286 from the total of 366
pictures. Figure 5.5(c), Figure 5.5(d), Figure 5.5(e) and Figure 5.5(f) are the results
after simpliﬁcation at important degrees of 70%, 65%, 60%, and 55% respectively.

Chapter 6
Digital Multimedia Authentication
and Forensics
Multimedia authentication and forensics are most important recent research topics. With
the exponential increase of digital cameras, authentication and forensics problems become
more and more prominent. In this chapter, video authentication is discussed initially, the
problem of print authentication and context authentication are then taken into account,
ﬁnally some technologies used in photographic forensics are presented.
6.1
Video Authentication
Video authentication techniques have experienced a tremendous rise in interest over
the past few years. By deﬁnition, video authentication is a process that is used to
ascertain the trustworthiness of a digital video. In other words, a video authentica-
tion system ensures the integrity of digital video, and veriﬁes that the video taken
into use has not been tampered with. The need for authenticating a digital video is
shown by giving the following examples:
1. A video clip can be doctored to defame a person. On the other hand, criminals
get away from being punished because the video showing their crime can’t be
proved conclusively in the court of law.
2. In surveillance systems, it is hard to reassure that the digital video produced
as evidence is the one that was actually shot by the camera.
3. A journalist cannot prove that the video played by a news channel is trust-
worthy.

4. A video viewer who receives video through a communication channel can not
ensure that video being viewed is really the one that was transmitted. So there
is a compelling need for video, wherever it is and in whatever form it is, be
authenticated before use.
A typical video authentication system is shown in Figure 6.1, In the authentication
process (Figure 6.1 (a)), for a given video, the authentication algorithm processes
the features extracted from the video and outputs the authentication data which is
encrypted using the encryption key to form the signature. The video integrity is
veriﬁed by computing the new authentication data using the same authentication
algorithm and features. The new authentication data is compared with the original
authentication data as shown in Figure 6.1 (b). If both match, the video is treated
as authentic otherwise it is construed to be tampered with.
Figure 6.1: A typical video authentication system. (a) Authentication process (b)
Veriﬁcation process.
An ideal video authentication system, to be eﬀective, must adhere to the following
properties, such as sensitivity to alterations, localization and self-recovery of al-
tered regions, robustness to benign operations, tolerance to some loss of information
due to benign operations, compactness of authentication data, one-way property of
authentication data, sensitivity against false alarm and computational feasibility.

Printed Document Authentication
Research in the authentication of printed paper documents has been growing due
to its commercial potential. Although the problem has been tackled using crypto-
graphic techniques in the digital domain [75], solutions for protecting physical doc-
uments, especially paper documents, is much less advanced [76]. Paper documents
still form the basis of today’s business transactions and administrative processes,
and “will continue to occupy an important place in oﬃce life, but will increas-
ingly be used in conjunction with an array of electronic tools”[77]. For that reason,
authenticating printed paper documents, which is the link between electronic tools
and paper documents, becomes extremely important. In the traditional paper-based
world, when an authentic document is generated, it is usually signed / issued / ap-
proved by one or more authorized persons, with their signatures or seals to show
the authenticity. The document with original signatures is considered to be original,
authentic or legitimate. In the printed world, there are also requirements for such
signatures to show the authenticity and originality of a document. Eﬀorts towards
this can be categorized into four classes:
Use of Special Material: These solutions are based on either physical means or
chemical means, such as special high-resolution (> 4000dpi) printers not available in
the open market, special papers / inks that are very sensitive to reproduce [78, 79],
and hologram labels [78].
By controlling the availability of these materials, no
forgery or duplication of the document is possible. However, due to the high cost
of both the equipment and the eﬀorts for controlling their use, these solutions are
only used in applications which have strict security requirements, such as currency
notes or bank cheques.

Digital Multimedia Authentication and Forensics
Fingerprints: The idea of ﬁngerprinting is to make each copy of a document
unique so that illegal copies are identiﬁable, or the person who made illegal copies
is traceable. This idea was ﬁrst introduced by Wagner in [80], and then developed
for various applications. In [81], non-uniformities in disk medium are utilized as
ﬁngerprint to discourage illegal copying of ﬁles. In [82], the width of each strip cut
produced by a shredder is identiﬁed as the ﬁngerprint, which in turn is used to trace
the particular shredder that has been used. As for paper documents, Metois et al.
[83] have proposed an identiﬁcation system based on the naturally occurring inho-
mogeneities of the surface of paper. A special purpose imaging device is developed
to capture the texture and ﬁber pattern of the paper. The pattern is then registered
as a unique ﬁngerprint for later retrieval and comparison. Physical ﬁngerprints usu-
ally 145 oﬀer strong protection against duplication attempts. However, the medium
is not content-related. Therefore, the integrity of the contents is not protected. Fur-
thermore, the identiﬁcation of typically invisible ﬁngerprint often requires special
devices. This inevitably increases the cost of the system. As a result, these meth-
ods are only used in applications which emphasize more on medium security than
content integrity, such as bank cheques or printed tickets.
Digital Methods: Originating from traditional cryptography, these approaches
intend to transfer digital signature onto paper documents. Such approaches include
bar codes [84, 85] and information hiding (notably digital watermarking) [21, 86].
These methods add some machine readable information onto the document to serve
as a digital signature. Only authorized persons have access to the private key re-
quired to generate the digital signature, so the authenticity of the document is
protected. However, since the information is machine readable, it can also be copied
or scanned using photocopiers or scanners. The originality of the document is not
protected eﬀectively. Digital encoding methods have been widely used in applica-
tions which require machine based authentication, such as bills, ID cards, and so
on.
Visual Cryptography and Optical Watermarks: Visual cryptography utilizes
secret sharing to split a graphical pattern into diﬀerent pieces in a manner that the
pattern becomes visible if and only if the shares are stacked together [87, 88]. By
doing this, a paper document with one share printed can be validated visually using
the remaining shares. Optical watermarks is an improvement over visual cryptog-
raphy in terms of the ability to hide multiple layers of graphical information and
enhanced visual quality with easy alignment [3]. Both visual cryptography and op-
tical watermark have been designed for manual authentication of documents. They
are most suitable in applications where the convenience of veriﬁcation is impor-
tant like in brand protection and printed concert tickets. However, both of these
techniques cannot disprove the authenticity of a photocopy or scanned-copy of an
original document. Print signature is particularly suitable for applications that re-

quire documents to be protected against unauthorized duplications while allowing
the veriﬁcation of the document to be convenient as well. Such applications include
a shipping label, online tickets, lottery tickets and voting ballot paper.
As the laser printing technology improves, the printing resolution will become even
higher.
However, as long as the underlying mechanism is unchanged, it is still
expected to see the random phenomenon on each copy of printed paper. This will
only entail the use of microscopes of even higher resolution. This method can be
readily extended to other document types such as oﬀset-printed documents, ink-jet
printed documents, or manually signed documents. It basically reduces to the task
of ﬁnding unique random phenomenon in each copy of the document to be used as a
signature. For example, the ink trail for each manually signed document is unique.
As long as the uniqueness is found, a new document authentication method based
on the same principle can be developed.
To study the characteristics of print signatures, a representative test pattern was
created as shown in Figure 6.2(a). The pattern comprises of four rounded dots. The
diameter of the dots is
1
360 inches and the horizontal and vertical distance between
two adjacent dots is
1
240 inches. These two numbers are selected by taking both
the physical limitations of the printer and experimental results into consideration.
The size of the dots is larger than the theoretically smallest dots the printer can
print (in this case
1
600 inches for a 600 dpi printer), so that the dots are clearly
visible after printing. On the other hand, the dots are enough small for the random
misplacement of toner powder to be signiﬁcantly noticeable around their boundaries.
The distance between two adjacent dots and the conﬁguration of dots ensures that
the printed dots will not merge together, which is very useful for a segmentation
process. The number of dots balances the authentication performance and required
computational resources [2].

Figure 6.2 shows some experimental printouts and photocopies examined under a
200× microscope. Image (b) and (c) are the test pattern printed using HP2 LaserJet
8100 (600dpi) oﬃce printer. Image (d) is the same test pattern printed on a high
resolution HP LaserJet 4050 (1200 dpi) printer. Apparently, the dissimilarity among
these patterns is large. Even for the same printer, a large variance is obtained. Image

(e) is a photocopy of image (b) using a 600 × 600 dpi digital photocopier Minolta
Di152f3. It is quite obvious that the photocopied image is very diﬀerent from the
original one.
Besides the test pattern, occurrences of random toner powder misplacement can also
be noticed at boundaries of printed characters, as shown in Figure 6.3, where images
(a-e) are the source character, two test printouts on LaserJet 8100, one test printout
on LaserJet 4050, and a photocopy of (b) on the Minolta photocopier respectively.
The same phenomenon is noticed as with the previous experiment that the print
signature is random and non-repeatable for each print run.
Figure 6.3: Printouts and photocopies of character “p” [2] [3].
Many such experiments have been performed and have consistently observed this
occurrence for several types of laser printers.
The experiments demonstrate the
uniqueness and randomness of the proposed print signature. This method utilizes
some features of this phenomenon to authenticate the originality of printer paper
documents.
Without loss of generality, one proposed method is described based on the type
of print signature shown in Figure 6.3. The test pattern used in the experiment
is known as the secure pattern as it enables certain security features. With some
minor modiﬁcation, the method can also apply to the print signature detected on
printed characters as well as hand signatures.
As illustrated in Figure 6.4, this method contains two procedures: registration and
authentication.

Figure 6.4: System design.
Registration: Given a document to be protected, the secure pattern is printed
onto some blank area of the paper. Several auxiliary landmarks are also printed
around the pattern to facilitate alignment. The printed paper is then examined by
a microscope. Features describing the print signature such as the shape of the dots
are detected and extracted. The feature description, together with some critical
information about the document (such as the seat number in a concert ticket),
forms an unique identiﬁer for this speciﬁc document and speciﬁc print run.
A
digital signature is then generated for the identiﬁer. The digital signature and the
identiﬁer are printed onto the same document using digital encoding methods such
as bar codes or OCR fonts. These printed information and the secure pattern are
used for later authentication.
Authentication: In order to verify the authenticity and originality of a printed
document, feature extraction is performed, like in the registration process to get
the feature description of the print signature. Also, the encoded information is read
from the document using either a bar code or an OCR scanner. The digital sig-
nature is veriﬁed ﬁrst to ensure there has been no modiﬁcations to the document
identiﬁer. The extracted feature is compared with the decrypted one, and the de-
crypted critical document information with the contents on the paper, through a
decision process. If the results match, the document is considered to be authentic

and original. Otherwise it considered to be a fake or to have been tampered with.
As the laser printing technology improves, the printing resolution will become even
higher.
However, as long as the underlying mechanism is unchanged, it is still
expected to see the random phenomenon on each copy of printed paper.
This will only entail the use of microscopes of even higher resolution. This method

used as a signature. For example, the ink trail for each manually signed document is
unique. As long as the uniqueness is found, a new document authentication method
based on the same principle can be developed.
6.3
Document Authentication with RSE
RSE (Render Sequence Encoding) [89], as the name indicates, encodes hidden data
into the layout information of the formatted documents by modifying the display
sequences of words or characters, without changing the content or appearance of the
document. The encoding is achieved by speciﬁc permutation of display sequence,
and the speciﬁc permutation is further linked to a Hamiltonian tour in the Exact
Travel of Salesman Problem (XTSP). It needs a properly chosen cost matrix for
the XTSP, and then the cost of the tour is made modulo equal to the content of
digest.
Because of the hardness of XTSP, with published, one cannot forge the
signing process and attack the RSE authentication method.
Unlike the existing
digital watermarking methods which hide information into pure text documents or
image based documents, RSE hides information into formatted documents. Those
formatted documents contain both text data and layout information. Typical ones
are PostScript (PS®1), Portable Document Format (PDF), Printer Control Lan-
guage (PCL®2), and Device Independent Document (DVI). Formatted documents
combines the advantages of both a text document and an image based document.
They have small ﬁle sizes and platform-neutral page layout. It is widely used in
electronic publishing, business, and administrative processing. It has merits of both
digital signatures and digital watermarking: like digital signature, with veriﬁcation
key/information, one can perform veriﬁcation, but not (or with great diﬃculties to)
reverse engineer the signing process; it provides content protection, and survives
transcoding processes.
Based on the RSE watermarking scheme, RSE authentication method adopts mod-
ular XTSP to authenticate the document.
The security of RSE authentication
method is guaranteed by the intractability of XTSP. The advantage of RSE au-
thentication method over digital signature is its small authenticator size. With this

feature RSE authentication is adaptable to very short documents. Another feature
of RSE authentication is its compatibility with most popular document formats. It
can be integrated into existing systems with only minor changes at the creation and
rendering ends of the whole workﬂow. RSE authentication method facilitates the
“management of rights holders’ relationship” by establishing trust among parties
involved in document exchange. It can thus be a major building block in the whole
DRM system for electronic documents.
6.4
Passive Image Authentication: Passive-Blind
Image Forensics (PBIF)
However, for PBIF, no prior information is needed, as indicated by the image foren-
sics process [90]. There are various works on image forgery detection that are based
on the imaging process authenticity. For a digital camera, the scene radiance goes
through the camera lens before being captured by an array of imaging sensors. The
camera lens often has the optical low-pass eﬀect for anti-aliasing. The imaging sen-
sors are spatially allocated for measuring three types of colored light. To produce
a three-color image, the missing color needs to be interpolated by de-mosaicing.
In order to ensure that a white point in the image scene is rendered as white in
the ﬁnal image, the color is adjusted through white-balancing. The image may go
through enhancements such as the contrast, sharpness, and saturation adjustment.
Finally, gamma correction is applied for dynamic range compression and pleasing
visual eﬀects.
Natural image statistics (NIS) in the wavelet domain has been used for the forensic
veriﬁcation purpose. They show experiments for distinguishing authentic images
from a few other types of images, i.e. stego images (images containing hidden mes-
sages), computer graphics, and print-and-scan images. In ongoing work, there are
investigations of a number of other NIS, such as NIS in the power spectrum domain,
NIS in the spatial local image patch, and NIS in higher-order statistics, primarily for
distinguishing photographic images and computer graphics. To distinguish images
captured by diﬀerent cameras based on their physical device characteristics, one can
use camera response function and ﬁxed pattern noise. The former allows one to
distinguish diﬀerent models of camera and the latter diﬀerent cameras.
Image post-processing clues raise suspicion for image forgery and help image forgery
detection. Higher-order wavelets statistics are used for detecting image print-and-
scan and steganography. Image operations, such as resampling, JPEG compression,
and adding of noise, are modelled as linear operators and estimated by linear image
deconvolution. Double JPEG compression has been given special attention in the
PBIF literature. It is observed that double JPEG compression results in a periodic

pattern in the JPEG DCT coeﬃcient histogram.
Based on this observation, an
automatic system that performs image forensics is developed. It is also found that
the distribution of the ﬁrst digit of the JPEG DCT coeﬃcients can be used to
distinguish a singly JPEG compressed image from a doubly compressed one. JPEG
quantization tables for cameras and image editing software are shown to be diﬀerent
and may serve as a useful forensics clue. As in the case for an image, double MPEG
compression artifacts are also observed when a video sequence is modiﬁed and MPEG
re-encoded. Finally, there are also works on detecting duplicated image fragments
due to the copy and paste operation.
As it is the goal for a forger to fool the forensic system, a forger can gather infor-
mation on the forensic system and post-process the forgery so that it escapes the
forensic system. Such an action is identiﬁed as a forensic system attack. Studying
the potential forger’s attack on a forensic method is necessary before one can design
a counter-attack strategy. Apart from the counter-attack measure proposed for the
recaptured attack described, the current work is very limited in this aspect. Indeed,
there are many possible types of attacks on a forensic system. Below, three ma-
jor types are discussed, i.e., oracle attack, recapturing attack, and post-processing
attack.
Once a forgery creator has an unlimited access to a forgery detector, an oracle attack
can be launched. The forger can incrementally modify the forgery guided by the
detection results until it passes the detector with a minimal visual quality loss. In
order to make the task of estimating the detection boundary more diﬃcult, the work
proposes a method of converting a parametric decision boundary into a fractal (non-
parametric) one, so that an accurate estimation of the boundary requires a much
larger number of sample points on the decision boundary. The oracle attack issue is
addressed by modifying the temporal behavior of the detector such that the duration
for returning a decision is lengthened when observing a sequence of similar-content
input images, which is the hallmark of an oracle attack. The delay strategy can be
designed so that the total time needed for an oracle attack to succeed is painfully
long.

Digital Multimedia Authentication and Forensics
Apart from the protocol level attack, forgers could apply various post-processing
operations to mask image forgery artifacts. This problem can be addressed by the
post-processing detection techniques mentioned before. Furthermore, heavy post
processing is often needed to mask the forgery artifacts.
A more sophisticated post-processing approach would be to simulate the device
signature so that the forgery has a consistent device signature. However, such an
attack is diﬃcult to implement in practice as the simulated device signature has to
be strong enough to mask the inconsistency in the ﬁrst device signature, and thus
results in a tremendous image quality loss.
An attacker can also produce a seemingly authentic image or video by recapturing
the sound and sight produced from an image or a video. For example, an image can
be printed out and recaptured by a camera. However, such an attack is diﬃcult in
practice, as to produce a good quality recaptured duplicate, a subtle and complicated
setup for rendering the realistic sound and sight is needed, which not always feasible.
For example, a printed image may contain the perceivable halftoning artifacts and
its 2D fatness may lacks certain 3D visual eﬀects. Furthermore, recapturing does not
remove all the inconsistencies in an image or a video, which is particularly obvious
in the scene inconsistencies.
6.5
Multimedia Forensics
Undoubtedly, multimedia forensics has become an extremely hot research area, es-
pecially with the exponential growth of digital camera technology and rapid use of
the Internet. From the famous “ﬂat tiger” to the “scandal” due to photo leaking,
someone persuades the public to accept the photographs, someone hastens people
to ignore the widely spread photos. However, genius is not fake, everything is trace-
able. In this section, a focus is on the emerging issue of and identifying of imagery
from a computing point of view. The evidence is collected from the well known and
accepted collections in real situations and use the evidence to support the original
viewpoint. The multimedia materials are taken advantage of in a community or en-
vironment and encourage researchers from multiple disciplines to join in the study
of this emerging application problem.
In photo forensics, one of important evidences is the EXIF of a digital photo. Figure
6.5 provides the EXIF entities that can be extracted from the JPEG ﬁle header so
far.
Duplication detection is very helpful in image forensics. This is because the duplica-
tion points can not be removed from the images completely. The interesting points
for duplicate detection are computed by using a block-based correlation approach,

and incorporating a novel image area saliency measure in the computations. The
duplicate decision is largely based on the types of images that are being compared.
Therefore, in the third stage, the detection to change areas using class-speciﬁc sim-
ilarity metrics adopts three distinct approaches: (1) Direct comparison of visual
features extracted from the two images; (2) Classiﬁcation of changes into a limited
set of object areas; (3) Application of specialized object detectors. Finally, detectors
for image areas are learnt from the training using the visual appearance and the ﬁnal
duplicate decision is made through statistical inference based on the outputs of the
detectors, global image classiﬁers, and class-speciﬁc similarity metrics.
RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is an eﬀective data-driven alignment and
veriﬁcation technique, it only generates a limited number of hypotheses with a sam-
pling process guided by the matching of feature attributes, it has been used for
alignment based veriﬁcation for object recognition. The RANSAC techniques iter-
ate through all the models in the database and therefore are linear in the number
of models in the database.
The Harris corner detector is one of the main tools in interest points selection,
correspondence weighting function is employed to search for the most likely match
in the secondary image. For each candidate location, a local motion optimization
using the KLT method is performed [91]. After trying to improve each correspon-
dence, the algorithm re-computes the regression predictions and repeats the pair
wise correspondence optimization. Termination occurs when an interaction com-
pletes without making further improvement. After ﬁnding a set of high likelihood
correspondences, the local weighted regression method is used to interpolate the
oﬀset vectors, obtaining a dense corresponding ﬁeld.

invariant across a substantial range of aﬃne distortion. From SIFT, points can be
searched and matched in order to get a conﬁdence level between two images. These
detection points, m1 and m2, correspond to the salient points, the matching points
are m, thereafter, the conﬁdence between two photos are: p(m1, m2) = m1m2
m2 .

Media Forensics Using Biometrics
Another technique used within image forensics, speciﬁcally for palmprint recogni-
tion, employs Fisher Linear Discriminative Analysis (FLDA) and Gabor ﬁlter banks
[92]. This technique takes a palmprint and convolves it with a bank of Gabor ﬁlters
at diﬀerent scales and rotations in order to achieve robust palmprint feature ex-
traction. After extraction, FLDA is applied for dimensionality reduction and class
separability.
A general 2-D Gabor function g(x, y) is deﬁned as:
g(x, y) =

(6.1)
where the spatial coordinates (x, y) denote the centroid localization of an elliptical
Gaussian window and W is the frequency of a sinusoidal plane wave along the X-axis.
The parameters σx and σy are the space constants of the Gaussian envelop along
x and y axes, respectively. The Fourier transform G(u, v) of the Gabor function
g(x, y) can be written as:
G(u, v) = exp


(u −f)2

where f represents the frequency of the sinusoidal plane along the horizontal axis
and the frequency components in the x and y direction are denoted by the pair
(u, v), while σu =
1
2πσx and σv =
1
2πσy . By considering a non-orthogonal basis set
formed by Gabor functions, a localized frequency description can be obtained by
expanding a signal with this basis. Self-similar class functions, known as Gabor
Wavelets, can be generated by dilations and rotations of the mother wavelet g(x, y)
through the generating function:
gmn(x, y) = a−mg(x′, y′), a > 1
(6.3)
by considering m = 1, . . . , L and n = 1, . . . , K. L and K denote the total number
of dilations and orientations, respectively, and:

where θ = nπ
K is the angle. To ensure that the energy is independent of m, a scale
factor a−m is introduced. By considering the redundant information presented in
the ﬁltered images due to the non-orthogonality of the Gabor wavelets, Manjunath
[93] designed a strategy to reduce the redundancy of the GWFB. This strategy aims
to maintain the half-peak magnitude of the ﬁlter responses touches each other in
the frequency spectrum.
Let Ul and Uh denote the lower and the upper center frequencies of interest, respec-
tively. The design strategy results in the following equations for computing the ﬁlter
parameters σu and σv [93].

intensity values the real components of 2D Gabor ﬁlters are biased by adding a
constant to make them with zero mean.

As previously mentioned, Gabor representation of a palmprint image i(x, y) can be
obtained by convolving the image with the family of Gabor ﬁlter as follows:
Im,n(x, y) =

i(x, y)g∗
mn(x −x0, y −y0)dx0dy0
(6.8)
where Im,n(x, y) denotes the result corresponding to the Gabor ﬁlter at scale L and
orientation K and ∗indicate the complex conjugate.
The next problem that must be overcome involves localizing and segmenting a palm-
prints ROI (Region of Interest). A ROI should include all the important patterns
from a palmprint’s texture, such as principle lines and wrinkles.
Typically, this
method operates on a ﬁxed square region inside the palm. However, this region is
not proportional to the palm size and is thus unsuitable to extract all necessary
palmprint information from complete lines and wrinkles.
To address this problem, a number of image processing techniques are employed in
order to improve ROI extraction. The techniques include image binarization, which
involved a Gaussian low pass ﬁlter, which smoothes the image, the image then has a
thresholding method applied to it[94]. Alignment is another key point which must be
considered. Two robust key points are computed on the image and these are used to
determine the amount of rotation required. Finally, the image is at a stage whereby
it has been suitable processed so that the ROI can be determined or extracted.
After the ROI has been determined and extracted, processing can begin upon that
speciﬁc image. These regions of interest can be cross referenced against a database of
previous palmprints using techniques previously mentioned, such as SIFT, in order
to determine who the palmprints may belong to. This type of analysis can prove to
be very useful for many forensic applications, particularly at crime scenes.

Summary
This chapter, mainly discussed the hot issues about media authentication and foren-
sics that are currently being researched in this ﬁeld. Video authentication and gen-
eral document authentication was also discussed. Also discussed was the issues of
media forensics along with some solutions. This emerging area of media authentica-
tion and forensics is currently moving at a rapid pace with many researchers devoting
a lot of time and eﬀort into proving whether images and videos are authentic. Along
with this, forensics of a biometric nature were also discussed. Using diﬀerent tech-
niques to segment and analyze palmprints can be very important when it comes to
determining who left the prints. The majority of these techniques use many stan-
dard image processing methods which already have a wide variety of literature on
them.
