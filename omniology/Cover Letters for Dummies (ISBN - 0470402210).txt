Introduction
W
elcome to the newly retooled Cover Letters For Dummies, 3rd Edition. 
Compared to its last incarnation a decade ago, this revision is a dif-
ferent creature. Times change. Communications change. Job-clinching tech-
niques change.
Even if you’re an experienced job hunter, you’ll find in this book a wealth of 
fresh ideas about how to robustly present yourself online or on paper. And 
you’ll be surprised by the uncommonly wide scope of content that extends 
far beyond classic cover letters. In a nutshell, you haven’t read this book 
before.
As career management expert and writer Don Orlando commented upon seeing 
the updated manuscript — “It definitely is not the umpteenth edition of Miss 
Penelope Swain’s Letter Writing Guide for Young Ladies and Gentlemen.”
No, it isn’t. In the digital era, cover letters that deliver are vigorous and viva-
cious, assertive in asking for that all-important interview. What’s more, the 
new-style cover letters partner with a strike-up-the-band parade of creative, 
hard-hitting career management documents that are anything but sleepy let-
ters of transmittal.
Letters that have no higher ambition than merely to serve as wraps for 
resumes won’t move your hopes and dreams where you want to go in today’s 
fast-changing job market, one that seems to evolve with every sunrise.
In the spirit of providing something for everyone, both new-style and tradi-
tional letters are represented in the book’s 126 documents. This forward-
leaning edition is a milestone for cover letter books. I hope you enjoy reading 
it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
About This Book
The book you are about to read also marks a milestone in the 13 editions of 
For Dummies books that I’ve written: It’s the first one crafted with a wide col-
laboration by professional writers in the career management industry. The 57 
professionals whose work appears here are among the very best in the busi-
ness. Their names appear beneath their work and in the appendix.

2
Cover Letters For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
I’m a big believer in the Community of Intelligence, the school of “everyone’s 
better than anyone,” and so I’m immensely proud that this work features 
top cover letter writers whose samples show you how to know a great letter 
when you see one or write one.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book, I’ve established the following conventions:
 
✓ Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are 
defined.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.
 
✓ Sidebars, which are shaded boxes of text, consist of information that’s 
interesting and, while not necessarily critical to your understanding of 
the topic, add to your learning rewards in the book.
Further, in the sample documents throughout the book, I substitute a 
reminder to add the relevant dates in your document with the word date or 
dates enclosed in editorial brackets — [dates] — instead of actual years to 
keep your attention focused on key career marketing concepts. Similarly, 
I sometimes substitute such terms as inside address and salutation to con-
serve page space for the heart of the message.
Also in the interest of space, I left out handwritten signatures in the letters, 
but including a handwritten signature on paper or a cursive signature online 
is an important and highly recommended practice.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume you picked up this book for at least one of the following reasons:
 
✓ You’ve never written a cover letter — or any type of career management 
document — and you’d like to see how the pros do it. You’re thinking: 
“If they can do it, why not me? How hard can it be to string sentences 
together and sound smart?”
 
✓ You have written a cover letter, but it must not have lit up the sky (or else 
your resume was a goose) because you’re still waiting to hear back — four 
months later.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ You’re happily employed but worried about the economy. If you’re 
forced to pack up and leave on short notice, you want to be ready. You 
discovered that your resume is a teardown, and so you’re rebuilding it 
from the ground up but have the nagging feeling that your cover letter 
is a few tactics short of a strategy. You ask yourself: What is an action 
close? Why is a postscript a killer sales tactic? When should I be as 
subtle as an infomercial?
 
✓ You’re ready to move up in rank, and you’ve heard buzz about some 
new-style letters you can write to network for leads, or to follow up after 
an interview to make sure an employer comes back to you with an offer. 
And you heard that gasp! some audacious soul actually wrote a letter 
asking for a promotion.
 
✓ You’ve aware of blazing-fast, technology-based changes in the way 
people and jobs hook up, and how they post their profiles on social net-
working Web sites. You want to be sure your career marketing messages 
are working with you — not against you — in the newest technology 
sense. You don’t want the world to pass you by.
How This Book Is Organized
Being tapped for an interview or series of interviews — and being hired after 
that — depends on more than merely being qualified for the position you 
seek. Many talented people have figured that out and are improving their 
odds with robust cover letters and other career marketing documents. The 
following five parts give you an arsenal of written ammunition you can use 
to your advantage.
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More!
This part reviews the role cover letters play in a successful job search and 
introduces a dramatic and rich variety of other career marketing documents 
that may be unfamiliar to you. You also discover or refresh your memory 
about the impact of online social networking in communicating career-
 charging messages. More adventures: Almost a dozen uncommon docu-
ments, including six samples, help you make the margin of difference in a 
highly competitive contest for a great job.

Cover Letters For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part II: Creating Compelling 
Communications
These four chapters help you jump through the writing hoops to come up 
with Stand Out work. This part shows how your cover letters should look 
and read, with suggestions on image, content, and language. You get ideas 
on writing great opening lines and closes that keep your hands on the wheel. 
You also find tips on identifying and selling your marketable skills.
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best
Here’s the proof in the power-pudding: A collection of 86 samples — written 
by the best of America’s and Canada’s professional career management docu-
ment writers — show you how to apply the strategies I describe in this book. 
You see job ad replies and letters for prospecting, networking, and following 
up after interviews. I bet you’ll never look at job letters the same way again.
Part IV: Online Messages: Sample the Best
This part contains 34 more outstanding samples. These messages show you 
how to impress with branding statements, online profiles, and online cover 
notes. 
Part V: The Part of Tens
In these short chapters, I give you quick bits about job letters. I offer guid-
ance on avoiding unnecessary mistakes and tips on how to score at the top of 
the class when you’re writing online profiles.
Appendix
Here you find a directory of the professional writers whose work appears in 
this book. Following the directory, I explain what the initials after their names 
mean, as well as recognize the five professional cover letter and resume writ-
ers’ organizations whose members contributed to this work.

For Dummies signature icons are the little round pictures you see in the mar-
gins of the book. I use them to laser-guide your attention to key bits of infor-
mation. Here’s a list of the icons you find in this book and what they mean.
 
This icon directs your full attention to compelling messages that make you 
stand out from the crowd. 
 
Advice and information that can spark a difference in the outcome of your  
career message are flagged with this icon.
 
Some points in these pages are so useful that I hope you keep them in mind as 
you read. I make a big deal out of these ideas with this icon.
 No move or technique achieves the job letter-interview connection every 
single time. This icon reminds you to think through an issue and try to make 
the best choice for your situation.
 
Watch out for deep waters filled with things that bite. This icon signals there 
could be trouble ahead if you don’t make a good decision.
Where to Go from Here
Every author wishes you would start at the beginning and savor every word 
in lock step until you reach the end of the book. In real life, where you start 
depends upon your current needs:
 
✓ When you’ve just spotted an advertised job opening you want, immedi-
ately read Chapters 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
 
✓ When you want to do most of your searching online, hit your bull’s eye 
with Chapters 1, 2, 13, 14, and 16.
 
✓ When you’re at the starting gate and have a couple of weeks to learn your 
way around career management documents, grant the author’s wishes 
and read this book cover to cover. As I said in Job Interviews For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, practice recommended strategies, tactics, and techniques. 
“After you master the information in these pages, you own a special kind 
of insurance policy that pays off for as long as you want to work.”

O
nce upon a job-hunting time long ago, the term cover letters brought to 
mind drab documents like this one:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Please accept this letter and resume for the Payroll Manager position as refer-
enced in the Louisiana Times, Nov. 5. My work history and educational back-
ground make me an outstanding candidate. I am available for an 
interview at your earliest convenience. Thank you.
That style of transmittal letter has become a museum piece.
 
In this century’s brave new world of hypercompetitive job searches, cover 
letters have not only been reinvented, they’ve spawned a family of career 
management documents like these:
 
✓ Intrigue-inducing e-mail cover notes
 
✓ Deal-closing thank-you letters
 
✓ Interest-reviving follow-up messages 
 
✓ Star-power bios and branding statements
 
✓ Image-brightening reference blurbs 
 
✓ Qualifications-matching candidate checklists

Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
 
✓ Humanizing audio and video bites in profiles
 
✓ Eye-popping accomplishment sheets
And there’s much more in the new cover letter family. All together, today’s 
family of career management documents — which I also call job letters — 
delivers a spectacular array of self-marketing tools for people who want to be 
seen, noticed, and hired for the best jobs. That’s you, isn’t it? 
A New Age of Self-Promotion Is Here!
Looking for and landing the job you want is always a challenge, especially in 
uncertain times. But — lucky you — in one important way, your timing hits 
the jackpot!
 
You’re in the right century at the right time with the right tools to better 
manage your career than any generation before.
By seizing the opportunity to capitalize on 21st-century opportunities, you can
  
✓ Change to creative and high-impact letters that bring interviews
 
✓ Switch to gutsy but polite letters that generate hires
 
✓ Shift to persuasive and content-rich letters that position you to win 
career rewards that matter to you
You live in nothing less than a revolutionary age for career self-promotion. 
How did you get so lucky? This empowering new age is upon us for two main 
reasons: 
 
✓ Society’s changing expectations in message style. In this era of mass-
marketing and media overload, people are so accustomed to vivid, 
sparkling advertising and creative, clever marketing in every corner of 
their lives that they no longer pay much attention to feeble, uninteresting 
messages from job seekers who merely go through the motions. The 
family of new-style letters is hard to ignore in an atmosphere where 
HDTV gets attention, but black-and-white TV is ho-hum.
 
 The new-style letters vary in approach from elegant to elementary, but 
their missions are the same — picking up the cue from contemporary 
advertising and marketing, all the best ones are sales letters.
 
✓ Emergence of a technology-rich environment. In previous centuries, 
cover letters were joined at the hip with the post office. In this century, 
the Internet’s vast and powerful e-mail and social networking services 
supply unprecedentedly wide vistas to carry new-style messages.

 Chapter 1: News Flash: Cover Letters Are Grown Up and Have Kids
For clarity, I pause to emphasize that despite the loosening of collars in the 
new wave of job letters, conservatively styled cover letters aren’t dead. They 
continue to be preferred in certain buttoned-down industries, such as banking, 
medicine, and government service. Why? Because they’re persuasively and 
expertly written to satisfy the tastes of executives in those industries. (See for 
yourself the conservatively styled cover letters that appear in Parts 3 and 4.)
As creativity and technology turn new pages in recruiting circles, the cover 
letter has morphed into an extended family of hard-hitting messages that 
influence how the working world sees you and treats you.
Cover Letters Are Alive and Sell
Considering our digital world in which millions of people send their resumes 
off to online boarding schools without cover letter guardians, you may ask 
whether the cover letter model (new- or old-style) continues to lead the 
parade of written job docs. More bluntly, are cover letters still valuable?
The answer is a resounding yes! These resume sidekicks pack far too much 
firepower to be left on the sideline, according to two 2008 surveys:
 
✓ You leave interviews on the table when you skip cover letters: so con-
cluded a survey I developed with talent selection expert Alise Cortez, PhD. 
Three-fifths (60 percent) of a cross-section of 83 American employers, 
human resource specialists, and recruiters sampled say they read cover 
letters always, often, or sometimes. Two-fifths (40 percent) read resumes 
rarely or never. Dr. Cortez is a founding partner of ImprovedExperience.
com, a third-party research firm headquartered in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, 
that specializes in surveys for the human resource industry.
 
✓ Big company managers overwhelmingly prefer their resumes with cover 
letters. A poll of 150 executives in major U.S. companies reveals that a 
whopping 86 percent rate cover letters as valuable, with only 14 percent 
calling cover letters not valuable. Moreover, 80 percent of polled execu-
tives say cover letters accompany resumes they receive electronically. 
The poll was developed by OfficeTeam, a leading staffing company head-
quartered in Menlo Park, California.
In summing up widely held opinion among people in the employment busi-
ness, OfficeTeam executive director Dave Willmer explains why your resume 
should never leave home without a cover letter at its side:
Submitting a resume without a cover letter is like not shaking hands when 
meeting someone for the first time. Those who aren’t including cover letters 
with their resumes are missing an opportunity to make a good first impression 
and set themselves apart from other job applicants.

12
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
 
A Stand Out cover letter does much more than keep your resume warm during 
its long trip to a hiring manager. Cover letters done right can step up and 
accomplish a number of important getting-you-noticed purposes, which the 
following sections outline.
Looking good at first light
Use a cover letter to immediately position yourself as a most valuable 
person. First impressions are very hard to change. And your cover letter 
often is an employer’s first inkling that you’re on the planet and for hire. You 
can use your cover letter to show yourself to be alert and attentive by editing 
out all the typo goofs for which your high school English teacher would have 
given you a big fat F.
Targeting the employer’s needs
 
The resume focuses on you and the past. The cover letter focuses on the 
employer and the future. Tell the hiring professional what you can do to ben-
efit the organization in the future.
Failure to understand this simple principle is a critical mistake, advises 
career grand master John Lucht, CEO of RiteSite.com, a respected Web site 
for professionals seeking jobs at six figures and up. Lucht explains:
Will your cover letter save the day?
When a rookie recruiter, who hasn’t yet been 
taught the finer points of analyzing data-packed 
resumes, doesn’t know what to make of yours 
but doesn’t want the boss to know that he or 
she doesn’t know, your resume’s new address 
can be the reject pile.
A cover letter treatment is the recommended 
therapy to save your resume from certain 
candidate death merely because a rookie can’t 
measure its value. Why? Letters are easier to 
analyze than resumes. The rookie reads the 
letter and immediately knows what you bring 
to the table. Wanting to look like a savvy judge 
of talent, the rookie recruiter is now likely to 
pass your package of letter and resume up 
the line to a senior recruiter who does know 
how to evaluate resumes and who can extend 
interview invitations.
The takeaway: Attaching a cover letter that 
zings with your qualifications for the job can 
keep your resume (and job hopes) alive. 

13
 Chapter 1: News Flash: Cover Letters Are Grown Up and Have Kids
Lots of people figure that the cover letter is about them and what they want. 
Wrong! It should be about what the employer wants that they provide. Dump 
the ‘I’m looking for’ — both the attitude and the words. Instead say, ‘Do you 
need?’ And make the ‘need’ one that you — as your attached resume clearly 
spells out — are the ideal person to fill.
Showcasing your attractive personality
Your cover letter is a chance to bring more personality to your application 
than a resume can carry. It suggests, even subliminally, whether you’re open 
to new ideas, results driven, energetic, a people person, cheerful, agreeable, 
and cooperative, to name but a few premium employer-pleasing qualities.
Most chief executives say that employee turnover is one of their biggest 
headaches. Personality is a key ingredient (along with knowledge and skill) in 
being a good fit for a job, which is why some employers give personality tests 
to candidates. Your cover letter offers early clues to your personality fit for 
the job.
Closing gaps in your work record
Your cover letter is the ideal vehicle to explain — on your terms — any 
disruption in your work history. The basic strategy explains the gap as a pos-
itive achievement: You studied further, gained business-related transferrable 
skills while raising children, served in the military, undertook volunteer activ-
ities, moved to a new location for a good reason, or resolved a non-recurring 
health problem.
 
When your resume has time holes in it and you don’t explain how you 
productively filled the time and kept your skills current, yoking your past and 
your future is very difficult. In that case, entry-level offers are the most likely 
outcome. (Followed closely by no offers.)
Highlighting your skills 
and accomplishments
Your cover letter is the perfect place to emphasize the high-interest factors 
that whet a hiring authority’s interest in knowing more.

14
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
This is your chance to connect the dots for hiring authorities and recruiters, 
counsels Lynne Sarikas, director of the MBA career center at Northeastern 
University’s College of Business Administration:
Most likely you have not done this exact job in this exact industry before 
and don’t assume they will figure out how your experience is transferable. 
Show them how you meet their specific needs and the unique value you 
bring to the table.
By the way, don’t sabotage this purpose by merely repeating your resume 
using different words and mixing them up a bit. That’s a time waster, and you 
don’t want to be thought of as one of those.
Demonstrating your communication skills
Every survey of employers’ most-wanted skills seems to include the ability to 
communicate well. By a strange coincidence, almost every professional-level 
job seeker claims the ability to communicate well — without offering proof.
An impeccable and robust cover letter provides that proof. It’s your chance 
to show that you have the chops to communicate clearly, that you’re 
downright articulate.
Taking the wheel
 
An action close on a Stand Out cover letter tells the recipient that you’ll 
proactively call to set up an interview. It establishes that you have initiative 
and aren’t one to sit around and wait for interview manna to fall in your lap.
Of course, an action close isn’t always possible in a digital exchange when 
you don’t know to whom you’re applying. Or when you don’t know who’s 
in charge of a task force selection committee. In situations where you can’t 
take the interview initiative, maintain your image of a “person of action” by 
encouraging the hiring authority to quickly contact you.
Meet the Letters Family
Like all the best families, the job letter clan has its share of first and second 
cousins and an occasional odd uncle. The following sections show you how 
the relatives line up.

15
 Chapter 1: News Flash: Cover Letters Are Grown Up and Have Kids
Job ad reply letter
The head of the letters family is the category of cover letters written in 
reaction to a published job opening in print or online. Responding to 
published job openings is the most common job search letter activity. Pay 
the job ad reply letter the courtesy of customizing it to point out how you 
match the requirements of the position it addresses.
You find everything you want to know about writing job ad reply letters in 
Chapter 8.
Prospecting letter
Sent selectively to a relatively small number of potential employers with 
whom you have some sort of connection (same industry, personal meet-
ing, affinity group), these self-marketing, direct-mail messages are similar to 
broadcast letters and may overlap with networking letters. Call them pros-
pecting, broadcast, or networking letters: Whatever you call them, you need 
them. I dissect and illustrate prospecting letters in Chapter 9.
Broadcast letter
A type of self-marketing direct mail, the biggest differences between broadcast 
and prospecting letters are scale and relationships. You send broadcast letters 
to big numbers of potential employers with whom the sender has virtually no 
connection. In fact, job seekers often use commercial mailing lists to develop 
their broadcast letter address book. True believers in the pay-off for broadcast 
letters insist that their secret to success is the distribution by postal mail or 
online of large numbers of enticing letters (“a numbers game”), with persistent 
follow-up by phone or e-mail. Find out more in Chapter 9.
Networking letter 
Most networking letters ask for job leads, not for job interviews. They’re 
addressed to human networks, requesting that members respond by phone, 
e-mail or Twitter. (Twitter is a Web site and service that lets users send short 
text messages from their cell phones to a group of individuals.) Networking 
letters typically reach out to those with whom you have some kind of affinity — 
fellow alumni, members of your church, civic organization, or buddy group, and 
so on. Additionally, you may send a networking letter for other reasons — to a 
hiring authority with whom you’ve recently met, for example; in such situations, 
you do ask for a job interview. Find networking letters in Chapter 10.

16
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
Resume letter
An odd uncle in the letters family, this direct postal or online mail document 
doesn’t contain a separate resume per se. (However, you may attach a 
separate accomplishment sheet.) A storytelling approach weaves the facts 
of your work history into a narrative describing your objective. A resume 
letter is a good choice when your fundamental qualifications are sound but 
you need to gloss over gaps or other problems. When interestingly written, 
the letter pulls in readers because everyone likes a good story well told. A 
resume letter can be categorized as a subset of a broadcast or prospecting 
letter. Find samples in Chapter 11.
Job fair cover letter
Deciding in advance which companies you want to target at a job fair enables 
you to write attention-getting cover letters to leave with your resume at the 
land booth or send online to a virtual job fair. View a job fair sample letter in 
Chapter 9.
Try a twist by pairing a cover letter with an accomplishment sheet instead of 
a resume; see Chapter 11. 
 
The vast majority of fair visitors don’t make the extra research effort 
and instead just hand over generic documents, which gives you a huge 
opportunity to Stand Out from the crowd.
Thank-you letter
Think of a letter written ostensively to thank a hiring authority for an 
interview as what it really should be: another turn at bat to drive home your 
winning run, not merely an extension of your mother’s etiquette lessons to 
show your good manners. Focus on facts and comments that advance your 
candidacy for selection. Chapter 12 contains chapter and verse on thank-you 
letters and includes great samples, as well.
Follow-up letter
Also an after-interview communication, a follow-up letter is designed to spur 
decision action or even serve as a comeback effort to revive your candidacy 
after a period of thundering silence from the employer. Chapter 12 hosts 
super follow-up letters.

17
 Chapter 1: News Flash: Cover Letters Are Grown Up and Have Kids
Professional branding statement
How will prospective employers, clients, and customers perceive you 
professionally — as Sam Slacker or Sam Superstar? As Betty Boob or Betty 
Best? That’s what personal branding is all about — your image and your 
reputation. What you deliver for the money, you expect to be paid. Chapter 13 
is home base for crafting professional branding statements based on 
accomplishments and specializations that make you memorable in the job 
chase or on the consulting scene.
You can use a professional branding statement in letters, online profiles, 
accomplishment sheets, resumes, interviews, blog biographies, and elevator 
speeches. Even if you never get around to weaving a branding statement into 
a document, the mere act of writing one is a great way to concentrate your 
mind on what you’re selling.
Online profile
Growing more popular by the minute, this second cousin in the job letters 
family ranges from short and sweet (executive bio, described in Chapter 13) 
to a Yao-Ming-tall Web portfolio stuffed with links — photos, blogs, vlogs 
(video blogs), lists of publications, certifications, licenses, audio or video 
sound bites, and more. You name it, online profiles have it! Chapter 13 is 
your destination for online profiles.
How important are the quality of your online profile and other mentions 
of concern about you on social networking sites? Very! To cite a single 
but typical late 2008 survey of 3,169 hiring managers by online job site 
CareerBuilder.com, 22 percent screened potential staff members by using 
social networking profiles. This figure was up from 11 percent just two years 
earlier. An additional 9 percent said they plan to start using online profiles. In 
sum, almost a third of recruiting and staffing professionals are using or plan 
to use social networking sites to check up on potential hires.
 
About a third of hiring managers said that they had dismissed a candidate 
after what they discovered on social networking sites. Biggest offenses: 
information posted about drinking or using drugs, provocative subjects, or 
inappropriate photographs. More turnoffs: poor communication skills, lying 
about qualifications, candidates using discriminatory remarks related to race, 
gender or religion, and an unprofessional screen name.
The good news is that the survey found that 24 percent of hiring managers 
said that they found content on social network pages helped seal their 
decisions to hire candidates.

E-mail cover note
Cover notes, which you find aplenty in Chapter 14, are kid brothers and 
sisters to cover letters. They’re short and to the point. Typically, you send 
them in text in the body of an e-mail to introduce your attached resume, 
which usually is presented as an MS Word or PDF document.
Pulling Out the Stops with Special 
Marketing Messages
One of America’s iconic comedians, the late George Burns, told audiences 
how he defined happiness. “Happiness,” Burns said, “is having a large, loving, 
caring, close-knit family in another city.”
That quip works as a metaphor for an elite branch of career management 
documents. The documents in this group, described in Chapter 3, may as 
well be in another city because they come out only for special occasions, 
which are:
 
✓ When the job you want is master of the universe and you’re thinking “fat 
chance that will happen”
 
✓ When the job is exactly what you hope to find, and you can’t bear the 
thought of it slipping through your hands
 
✓ When the job is madly desired by so many competitors that you need to 
do something really special that makes you Stand Out
Special marketing messages generally are extra, load-bearing documents you 
take along to interviews, leaving them behind to remind decision-makers of 
your worthiness. Turn to Chapter 3 to find out what I’m talking about.
Sing, Cover Letter, Sing
Call upon your inner muse before desperately resorting to sending out a 
skimpy, generic cover letter that brings you neither glory nor notice. Pledge 
to write cover letters that employers actually read; inspire intrigue by 
creatively using the right words and sending the right facts. Although Part II 
contains this book’s mother lode of writing advice, here’s a digest of tips to 
paste on your copyholder.

19
 Chapter 1: News Flash: Cover Letters Are Grown Up and Have Kids
Customize and use names
Is your job search stalling after you submit a cover letter and resume 
package but before you’re offered an interview? If that’s your experience, 
why keep repeating failure?
Realize that, like the dearly departed all-purpose resume, the era of the 
generic cover letter is gone. Switch to a best practice of customizing each 
cover letter you send — not only in content, but addressed to the specific 
hiring manager instead of the threadbare approach of “Dear Employer ” or 
“Dear Sir/Madam.”
When you can’t discover the hiring manager’s name (by calling the company 
or through research), you’re stuck with using a generalized introduction 
that’s better than nothing but not as effective as “Dear Ms. Carmel,” or “Dear 
Mr. Alvarez.”
Speak the right language
Consider the recipient of your information. If the organization is conservative 
and traditional, keep the presentation of your information conservative and 
traditional. By contrast, when the targeted organization is creative and 
entrepreneurial, the addition of a splash of gifted words or a flourish in 
design tempts the doorkeeper to let you in.
 
I explain in Chapter 6 that the opening of your letter has to hook the reader, 
selling him or her on your abilities. One of many devices employed to hook 
readers is the use of a quotation. But here’s the danger: Don’t risk being 
perceived as a poet without a point by leading off with a nice but unrelated 
quotation that goes nowhere. Connect inspirational quotations with your 
strengths, or skip the quotation.
You can take more chances in approach and language when you really know 
your audience. To illustrate that principal, career coach Don Orlando in 
Montgomery, Alabama, passed along a high-risk real letter he wrote some 
years ago for a client who wanted to become chief of staff to a U.S. senator. 
She used her network to gain understanding of the senator’s personality and 
preferred standard operating procedures. Discovering that he was known 
for giving curt answers, had a short fuse, and preferred take-charge staffers, 
here’s the letter Orlando wrote for her:

20
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
Your job search for a chief of staff is over. Please tell your secretary to 
expect my call at 10:30 EDT, Monday, 28 July, to arrange an interview. 
I will need twelve minutes of your time on the day that is best for you.
During that short meeting, if I cannot convince you that I can arm you 
with bulletproof information that moves your agendas forward among 
all your constituencies, I will leave your office at once.
But if I can, I will start work the following Monday.
She was hired.
State the reason you’re writing
Always tell the reader why you’re writing, but be tactical about it. To reply 
to an advertised job, name the position title and where you saw the ad, 
but don’t squander valuable real estate doing so in the opening paragraph. 
Instead, accomplish the same thing by positioning that information in the 
upper right-hand corner in the subject line “regarding” space. Other ways to 
handle the reason you’re writing are presented in samples throughout this 
work.
Explain why you’re a top candidate
Your basic message should be: “Here are examples of work I’ve done and 
accomplishments I’ve achieved that match what you’re looking for.” Because 
you research the company online, you’re able to show why your skills and 
competencies are right for the job and can benefit the company. You explain 
any gaps in a positive way.
 
Accomplishments are job-offer magnets. Employers hire for results, not 
responsibilities. And they like numbers — percentages, dollar amounts, or 
other key measures wherever possible to quantify achievements and 
accomplishments.
Tell them why you admire them
You needn’t gush with insincere praise when explaining why you’d like to 
work for a company, but intelligent compliments are a staple of effective 
cover letters. You won’t be believable unless you get a line on the company 
before writing your letter. Why bother? Because your appreciation of the 
workplace where he or she toils makes the hiring manager feel important.

21
 Chapter 1: News Flash: Cover Letters Are Grown Up and Have Kids
Declare what’s next
In closing your letter, reprise your enthusiasm, confirm your desire for an 
interview, and state what the next step will be. Preferably, you use an action 
close, telling the recipient that you will follow up and when that will happen. 
In some instances, you will have to wait for them to contact you. Find out all 
about the action close in Chapter 6.
Read and reread 
Go beyond using your computer’s spell checker tool to review your job 
letters for typos and grammatical errors. Ask a friend or mentor to look over 
your letters as a backstop. Your words are going out into the hiring world as 
your only representative. If they don’t go out in first-rate order, you never 
get to show off your stuff in person. Chapters 4 and 5 give you writing tips 
that enable you to write with the skills of a grammar snoot without actually 
having to be one.
Be a savvy submitter
When you plan to send your application package of cover letter and resume 
online, bear in mind the advice I received from Susan P. Joyce, editor and 
Webmaster of Job-Hunt.Org.
Spam filters have been called into service seemingly everywhere because 
spam messages now comprise an estimated 78 percent of all e-mail received. 
That means that up to 10 percent of your messages won’t make it through to 
the intended recipient. Susan Joyce explains how to up your odds:
 
✓ Be very careful with the message subject. Be precise and concise, 
while avoiding the “unsafe” words below. When you’re responding to a 
specific posting, the job title is the safest, clearest, and most helpful 
subject for the recipient.
 
 Stay away from words like free, testing, money, urgent, payment, and 
investing. Look at the spam messages you get and avoid their terminology 
and methods. Find synonyms or use a completely different approach to 
the subject.
 
 Avoid using all caps and punctuation, particularly exclamation points 
and dollar signs. 
 
✓ Watch the words you use in the body of your message. Spam filters 
check the bodies of messages as well the subjects, so similar problems 
apply.

22
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
 
✓ Know that you are usually safest using unformatted text, rather than 
rich text or HTML. If you do use formatted text, be wary of using colored 
text and backgrounds, and avoid including fancy technology (Flash or 
other animation) unless the technology is related to a job requirement.
 
✓ For a really important message, you can add a line that requests 
confirmation of receipt. When confirmation doesn’t come through, you 
can follow up. This can be a good excuse to call. 
A Different Kind of Cover Letter Book
As this first chapter explains, career management docs are becoming important 
success drivers in a digital era. Cover letters now head up an entire family of 
new-style job letters, online profiles, and amazing self-marketing creations you

by 126 great new samples from professional cover letter writers.
Keeping everything straight
When you send resumes and cover letters in 
an MS Word document, send them to yourself 
first to be sure that they survive their electronic 
journey formatted the way they left home. You 
may find that some portions of the text slip 
and slide around, winding up in the strangest 
places. Here’s an easy solution: Send each 
Word doc as a PDF (portable document format) 
attachment. PDFs arrive looking identical to 
the way you send them. You can quickly con-
vert any document into a PDF for free at www.

post your comments for others to see. Frequencies of a blog’s publication 
vary from daily to weekly to occasional.
 
 Recruiters sometimes write blogs that job seekers can follow to pick 
up employment-opportunity intelligence. Additionally, recruiters may 
canvass blog writers for names of potential candidates who are tops in a 
field. Blog writers themselves may be experts in a field and become the 
object of a recruiter’s professional affections.
 
 A vlog is a blog that contains video content. A small but growing section 
of the blogosphere devoted to vlogs is called the vlogosphere.
 
✓ Instant messaging (IM): Real-time communication between two or more 
people. Job seekers IM for leads and company research with people on 
their buddy lists, and sometimes with recruiters. You can also receive 
new job postings by IM.
 
✓ Podcast: An audio message (file) sent over the Internet. Podcasts can 
be downloaded and played on portable media devices (iPhone or 
BlackBerry) anytime in any place. Typically, a podcast is sent from 
employer to candidate, not the other way around.
 
✓ RSS (Real Simple Syndication): Subscribers to these services, which are 
usually free in employment uses, receive content updates when available 
from selected Web sites. The RSS job agent feature is especially useful 
to job seekers wanting to discover new job openings that match the job 
seekers’ criteria.
 
✓ Search engine: Retrieves information — including company research 
and personnel — sought by specific search terms. A few general search 
engine examples are Google, Yahoo! And Ask.com.
 
 Job search engine (also called vertical job search engine or aggregator): 
Collects millions of job listings from thousands of job boards, newspapers, 
company Web sites, and other resources, making the search for jobs 
much easier for job hunters. A few job search engine examples are 
Indeed.com, SimplyHired.com, and GetTheJob.com.
 
✓ SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Technical and strategic maneuvers 
that increase the traffic driven by search engines to a Web site. Recruiters 
and employers use SEO to deliver job seekers to their Web sites. And 
technology-wise job seekers call upon SEO to drive traffic to their own 
Web sites, hoping to bring favorable mentions of themselves to page 1 or 
high on page 2.
 
 Additionally, job seekers use SEO techniques as a tool to clean up 
stains on their digital dignity. In stain removal, the core SEO idea is the 
crowding out bad news with good news, a process described in books 
and online articles. Find details on how to repair a stained online image 
by searching the Web for “Internet defamation.”

✓ Social media: An umbrella term for Web-based technology where the 
media can be easily shared by affinity groups; covers such technology 
as blogs, podcasts, video, RSS, and photo-sharing. Illustrations of those 
with varying degrees of career management significance include LinkedIn, 
YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, Ning, and Technorati.
 
✓ Social network services: Web-based services that give users a way to find 
people with similar interests. The services connect users by enabling them 
to join online communities and interact directly with each other. Some of 
the interactivity focuses on job search and recruiting. The services provide 
different methods for interaction, including discussion groups, messaging, 
e-mail, and commentary on blogs. The social media noted in the previous 
bullet point also are examples of social network services.
 
The difference between social media and social networking is observation 
and interaction. Social media enables social networking. That is, social media 
can exist without social networking, but social networking can’t exist without 
social media. Example: When a recruiter views an online profile posted on a 
professional social media Web site such as LinkedIn, the recruiter is observing. 
But when the recruiter is motivated to contact a person who is observed, the 
recruiter is interacting.
While all the tools described above may play a role in your travels to 
employment, social networks are the focal point of this chapter.
The Great Connecting: Online 
Networking Services
Connect. Communicate. Collaborate. Find jobs. Hire employees. All these good 
things are ascribed to the rising phenomenon of online professional social 
networking services, which some very smart people say is well on its way 
to changing the face of recruiting in the United States and other developed 
nations.
As an example of what experts are saying, globally recognized human capital 
guru Kevin Wheeler recently advised recruiters on the recruiting Web site www.
ere.net that both a personal and a corporate presence on a social network 
(such as Facebook or MySpace) is a top tool for success. Wheeler also ranks the 
participation in professional online networks (such as LinkedIn) as being right up 
at the top of essential tools that link business people and careerists who know 
each other together in a Web of interconnections.
First, a little background: Social networking services originally became 
popular in 2002 as fun things to do among teenagers and those in their 20s 
and 30s. MySpace and Facebook were the big winners. With LinkedIn’s 2005 
entry into the marketplace, the social networking services became business 

26
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
things to do. Facebook and MySpace now encourage professionals in 
business, as well as fun seekers in their original base, to post online profiles. 
But LinkedIn has captured the prestige and numbers in the professional and 
business market.
Valued at more than $1 billion, LinkedIn continues to expand its purpose-
driven franchise. In 2008, CNBC and LinkedIn sealed an alliance, in effect 
combining their business audiences. The deal followed an alliance months 
earlier between LinkedIn and The New York Times. Other newspapers such 
as the Chicago Sun-Times are using social networking to offer reader forums, 
blogs, and communities.
Why the race to pair up old and new media? Traditional content owners 
intend to hang on to their audiences and advertisers as they move to new 
media environments. Online social firms need to keep their sites compelling 
with relevant content. It looks as though the alliance between old and new 
media will continue to grow like Jack’s Beanstalk.
Downsides to social networking
Online networking clearly is too gigantic a sea change to be ignored in an 
increasingly hypercompetitive market for the economy’s best jobs, but I’m 
not saying that everything is peachy in online networking land. Here are 
some of the concerns that I see and hear expressed by networkers and 
critics:
 
✓ Networking fatigue. Some networkers have grown tired of what once 
was novel. The essential problem may be that they sign up for every new 
networking site in sight, and then find they’re spending too much time 
keeping up with their sign-ups.
 
✓ User frustration. Aggregating means combining and forming a whole; 
Web sites as Indeed.com and SimplyHired.com aggregate content to 
make it easy for job hunters to search for specific advertised jobs. 
Although a host of start-ups are aggregating social networking profiles, 
online videos, and more, no dominant aggregator has yet appeared for 
social networking.
 
 As countless social networks continue to pop up — especially those 
with a niche focus — the environment has become splintered and its 
bounty hard to harvest.
 
 To illustrate, an anonymous but obviously veteran networker on a 
reader forum laments the usage dilemma: “I have 225 first-degree 
connections, 17,200 second-degree connections, and 1.7 million third-
degree connections. By the numbers, this is a healthy network. But what 
do I do with it?”

27
 Chapter 2: Creating Images Online for Now and Tomorrow
 
✓ Eternal digital billboards. Like resumes, online profiles (See Chapters 
13 and 16) can be like the guest who came to dinner and stayed and 
stayed and stayed. Documents love it out there in cyberspace.
 
 Enshrined in time, resumes and profiles can pigeonhole a job seeker, 
putting the seeker into a particular category that may be too rigid. 
Examples: If a profile pigeonholes Josh as a photographer, he risks being 
overlooked for his work as a sculptor and painter. If a resume pigeonholes 
Jeanine as a public accountant, she risks being overlooked as a candidate 
for a senior internal accountant position. Candidates can’t be sure 
that sophisticated online research does not reveal chameleon-like 
presentations.
 
 So why not just try to say you’re a one-person-band in your online 
profile or resume? Except for micro-sized companies, employers usually 
prefer to hire a specialist, not a jack of all trades.
Reconnoitering resources
Shameless disclosure: Why do I mention only 
the biggies in this chapter? I do so to keep my 
sanity, as the virtual vendor world seems to 
grow by the minute. In the past 15 years I’ve 
observed virtual recruiting firms launch, hype, 
merge, acquire, fail, rebrand, and switch focus 
faster than most of us can track. That’s why I 
stick with the main online players, who are less 
likely than start-ups to bite the dust, or to quickly 
revamp their mission the day after this book is 
published. I do list a number of leading social 
networking services in Chapter 13, and I daily 
wish each of them good health and long life.
But I feel your pain and understand that you 
need more specifics to tackle social networking 
in all its glory — but that’s a different book. So 
try the following suggestions:
 ✓ If the history and the current composi-
tion of the social networking industry are 
important to you, jump on Wikipedia to 
search for Social Networking Services and 
List of Social Networking Websites.
 ✓ To review a list of current recruiting 
vendors with succinct descriptions of the 
services each offers, visit directory.
ere.net.
 ✓ For an easy guide to whistling while you’re 
working your way through social network-
ing know-how, refer to a how-to book, 
Seven Days to Online Networking by Ellen 
Sautter and Diane Crompton (2008, JIST 
Works).
 ✓ Grab a copy of Alison Doyle’s Internet Your 
Way to a New Job: How to Really Find a Job 
Online (2008, HappyAbout.com).
 ✓ Find many niche social networks with a 
search engine, such as FindASocialNetwork, 
www.findasocialnetwork.com. 
For search terms, use your industry, career 
field, geographic location, or just the word 
jobs.

✓ Employers’ legal risks. Employers fear legal exposure if, prior to meeting a 
candidate in person, they uncover information about the candidate’s 
characteristics that can lead to discrimination in hiring — such as gender, 
age, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. Even when a hiring decision is 
made without bias, the employer may have to defend the non-hiring choice 
to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or in a court of law.
 
✓ Recruiters’ time management woes. Recruiters may source (find) 
candidates themselves or subcontract the work to professional 
sourcers. Scouring social networking sites, blogs, and other Web 2.0 
resources eats up enormous amounts of time.
A secret garden of informal references
Although your online presence — including an online profile — increases 
your visibility to headhunters out shopping, it can also squash your chances 
of getting the job.
Formal reference checks are made just before or just after a job offer. But a 
kind of pre-reference check that can be called “informal reference checking” 
appears to be a growing practice.
Here’s what happens: Recruiters and hiring managers turn to Google or another 
search engine to get a heads-up on potential candidates and then move to such 
social networking sites as LinkedIn, Facebook, and VisualCV. When they like 
what they see, the headhunters decide whether an individual is worth talking to.
Three ways to win in social networking
As job seekers migrate to online profiles, how 
can you be sure that your wild party or frat days 
don’t put your online professional person in the 
dumpster? By bearing these tips in mind.
 ✓ Check yourself out. Google yourself period-
ically to see what’s being said about you on 
the Internet. If there’s a problem, see SEO 
tips earlier in this chapter.
 ✓ Make circumspect comments. Don’t let it 
all hang out about what you did last night 
or make statements such as “My boss is a 
boob” or “We should call in sick tomorrow 
and hit the beach.”
 ✓ Skip snippy talk. You take your reputa-
tion in your hands when you blog barbed 
or negative observations about employers 
and specific people, unless you are in the 
blogging business as a political commenta-
tor or entertainment critic. Otherwise, put 
an online smile on your face.

29
 Chapter 2: Creating Images Online for Now and Tomorrow
Even if the writings and photos you posted when you were young and fool-
ish are beyond professional criticism, remember the popularly held beliefs 
that “birds of a feather flock together” or “a man is known by the company 
he keeps.” Because your network is a reflection of you, be selective in keep-
ing your network filled with individuals you’d be proud to stand next to. Use 
good judgment in “friending” others and the groups you join. In a time of 
informal references, you want your online presence to be empowering, not 
handicapping.
Start Spinning Your Web
No one method of search has a lock on finding attractive employment. Yes, 
you can still find a good job without turning on a computer, or wearing out 
your thumb texting or twittering on wireless phones with nano-sized keys 
that you can barely read. At least for now you can, and if you’re 60 or older, 
you probably can outrun the relentless shift to technology-driven recruiting 
and job search.
But otherwise, if you’re over 40 but younger than 60, think twice before 
putting on your Andy Rooney mask and welding yourself to a metaphorical 
manual typewriter. In challenging economic times, merely being good at your 
job may not be enough.
Management seems always to be on the lookout for ways to cut costs, includ-
ing labor costs. If the budget-whacking agenda doesn’t take hiring for your 
job beyond your borders, it may take it domestically to younger workers 
who’ll toil for less pay than older-and-wiser individuals.
 
Get an edge by making sure you know how to use social networking technol-
ogy — even if you have to take a class in it — and practice writing Stand Out 
career management messages that show you can make or save money for an 
employer. 
P.S. As we stand between technologies and generations in these changing 
times, this book’s technical reviewer, Jim Lemke, wants me to remind you 
not to forget to integrate multiple approaches to produce a truly effective 
job-search strategy. Use everything from newspapers and job boards to tra-
ditional networking and job fairs, to headhunters and social networking sites. 
Consider yourself reminded.

Audio sound bites in your profile
A Stand Out online profile never sleeps. 
A routine online profile sleeps with the fishes.
Help your profile stay wide awake and totally 
dry by including an audio bite. Keep it short — 
perhaps 15 to 20 seconds. For a topic, you can 
give your branding statement — who you are 
and what you bring to an employer’s table. (See 
sample branding statements in Chapter 13.)
You can also insert a video bite into your profile, 
but an audio bite is easier to do well and is likely 
to be more acceptable to employers for several 
reasons, including these two:
 ✓ Employers are reluctant to accept video 
resumes for fear of bias claims from job 
seekers based on such visuals as age, 
ethnicity, or disability. Their reluctance 
presumably extends to short online profile 
video bites. With the exception of perform-
ing arts and other jobs where looks matter 
for business reasons, cautious employ-
ers don’t want to see what you look like 
in a video or even in a photo until you’ve 
walked in the door for your interview. The 
law isn’t settled yet about how visuals on 
social networking sites will be evaluated 
for potential bias.
 ✓ Most people aren’t great at public speak-
ing, and being in front of a camera is even 
harder. You may do yourself more harm 
than good if you’re not an accomplished 
presenter.
But if you’d like to enliven your online video with 
a dash of audio or video but are a little shaky on 
the technical side, here’s the step-by-step drill, 
according to reviewer Jim Lemke:
 1. Determine the type of audio or video file 
you must upload to the host site.
 
 The host site, not you, decides what it will 
accept. LinkedIn, for example, allows you 
to import to your profile only a JPG, BMP, 
or PNC file. But other profile hosting sites 
allow you to upload a WMV or Mac format 
video, or a WMA or MP3 or MP4 audio file. 
Huh?
 
 If you insist on knowing more — or anything 
at all — about the above files, look them up 
in Webopedia (www.webopedia.com).
 2. To find the type of file the host site will 
accept, look on the site’s profile edit page, 
or a subsequent page.
 
 When you’re not sure what’s acceptable, 
you can enter audio or video in the host’s 
content search box or help screen.
 3. Still puzzled? Befriend a geek.

In This Chapter
▶ Discovering new-style career marketing documents
▶ Discovering how to put special docs to work for you
▶ Sampling distinctive messages to remember and build on
A
s an adequate candidate, you get balcony privileges to watch the game. 
As a good candidate, you earn a chair at the interview table. As a Stand 
Out candidate, you deal a winning hand and collect the pot.
 
Are you interested in going all out to become a Stand Out winner? Don’t 
miss a word of this chapter even if your answer is filled with clap-your-hands 
enthusiasm — “Yes, I’ll do whatever it takes, even slave all day over a hot 
keyboard.” This information’s for ambitious you, especially if you’re in a 
professional or managerial career or hope to be in one before long.
In return for your commitment to take on extra career management work, this 
chapter rewards you with a round-up of extra good ideas you can use to deal a 
winning hand. Six ideas are illustrated with samples, and five others are noted 
in a sidebar. With the exception of the I-want-to-be-promoted letter (the second 
sample), the six sample documents can be used in a multitude of ways:
 
✓ Before an interview: Use them as a cheat sheet to prepare for interviews — 
as if you’re studying for a test. (Actually, you are.)
 
✓ During an interview: When shared with an interviewer, your marketing 
documents are a talking-point guide to focus conversation on the important 
agenda of why you’re the winning candidate.
 
✓ After an interview: As an interview leave-behind, these documents are a 
concrete reminder of why you are the ultimate choice.
 
✓ Way after an interview: Send a powerful memo (along with a letter; see 
Chapter 12) of your interest in the position — especially if you sense 
that, metaphorically, you’re stuck on a desert island and you need to 
amp up interest in your candidacy.

Running Through Extra-Credit 
Job Search Documents 
As you get serious about developing one of the following documents, you’ll 
be going the extra mile. Don’t worry; it won’t be crowded. Going the extra 
mile means that you do more than most competitors are willing to do and 
that you position yourself to win the prized job.
 
Most of these six document samples probably work best on paper, but they 
can be e-mailed as a MS Word or PDF attachment.
The first three documents were written by cover letter professionals. Their 
names appear beneath their samples and their contact information appears 
in the appendix. My associate, John S. Gill, and I wrote the last three.
Next up: My observations about each career marketing document illustrated 
by a sample.
Accomplishment sheet
Also called an accomplishment statement, proof of performance, and capability 
statement, the accomplishment sheet commonly takes a full page to detail the 
particulars of a candidate’s impressive qualifications. An accomplishment 
sheet can be packaged with a resume, handed out at job fairs or in network-
ing groups, or left behind after an interview.
This sample is built on an eye-catching design to lasso attention. It puts 
together branding statements, qualifications, skills, achievements, a quote 
from the candidate’s performance review, and honors.
Request-for-promotion letter
Surprise! This is a different kind of new-style career marketing tool, one by an 
internal candidate — a truck driver who believes he is ripe for a promotion 
and hoping to spur management to step up to the plate and give him one. But 
self-selecting yourself for a promotion is a difficult task.
Rather than ask verbally and risk a pat on the back before being sent on his 
way by a boss who may forget the conversation within ten minutes, the truck 
driver wants to go on record that he’s qualified to move up. Solution: A letter.

33
 Chapter 3: Special Marketing Messages Outrun Rivals
This kind of letter is not easy to write. The sample makes the candidate’s case 
by being respectful and not overly pushy but yet persuasive in requesting that 
the company recognize that he is a promotable candidate. 
Leadership addendum
Career marketing letters have always been balancing acts. The busy reader 
wants information fast. The accomplished job seeker wants credit for all 
she’s done. The leadership addendum, which professional Don Orlando mas-
terminded, solves this dilemma. The force behind the addendum, and the 
force behind a great resume, is the same: compelling proof that you can solve 
your target company’s problems.
In the resume, those proofs are concise. In the addendum, your skills come 
alive in story form — specifically a story about your value. The multiple 
headlines capture the reader’s interest. Your description of the problem you 
solved, the actions you took, and the payoffs you got make the reader think: 
“I need someone like that!”
Checklist comparison
Pow! No document more directly links a candidate’s desirability for a position 
than a thorough comparison of requirements and qualifications. Make your 
case by deconstructing a position statement, line by line, and then detailing 
how you fill the bill, again line by line. Some checklist comparisons can run 
many pages, but this sample is only two pages, plus a cover to add gravitas 
and identify its mission.
This sample and the next two document samples describe the same candi-
date, Amanda Duvall, and the nonprofit agency job she seeks.
First 90 days forecast
This sample is especially relevant for upper level management candidates 
but can be adapted for professionals and mid-level managers who have the 
authority to make important policy decisions. 
The critical period in a career move often is said to be the first 90 days, a 
honeymoon period that allows the new person to get a good start. Entire 
books have been written about how to forecast the first 90 days in a job, but 
the actual document tends to run between 5 and 25 pages, headed by an 
executive summary, such as the one shown here.

34
Part I: Cover Letters and So Much More! 
The purpose of preparing a projected early achievements paper is to show 
hiring decision-makers that the candidate truly understands the require-
ments of the job and the level of performance expected. 
Reference commentary
Reference dossiers are classic collections of full-length reference letters, each 
of which is customarily presented on the writer’s or company letterhead. 
With companies being merged, shuttered, and relocated faster than ever, 
former bosses and coworkers may be scattered to the four corners just when 
you need to reach them for references. That’s why you should collect a 
reference letter whenever you, a boss, or a coworker leaves a company.
By contrast, the reference commentary, a new format, is a two- to three-page — 
plus cover — document of short testimonials, each only one to five sentences. 
It is similar in style to signed blurbs that appear on book jackets.
You can present a reference commentary in an interview, using it as an ice-
breaker to kick off conversation and set up a favorable impression right from 
the start. Say something like this:
I’m assuming that at some point you may want to check my 
references. In the meantime, this commentary reflects a quick 
glance at the endorsements of people who know my work as it 
relates to this position.
The reference commentary is produced on a home computer, using standard 
PC or Mac software. A half-dozen blurbs — each of which focuses on a differ-
ent selling point about you — are scattered across pages that maximize white 
space for a clean, speed-reading design.
 
Speaking of speed, an efficient way to construct your reference commentary 
is to draft blurbs that produce a diversity of favorable comments. If you know 
the reference givers well, you can ask whether they’d like you to save their 
time by drafting the statement for them; busy people often are happy to praise 
you but appreciate your doing the writing for them. When you don’t know the 
reference giver all that well, tactfully ask if you can suggest a focus and offer 
examples of the short blurbs others have provided.
 
The reference commentary is a first-impression marketing tool; it supplements 
but does not replace full letters of reference from former employers and 
associates that you may need when hiring is imminent.
The sample, the last one in this chapter, illustrates a cover and the first page 
of a reference commentary.
Now — it’s sample time!

More documents to make you Stand Out
In this revolutionary age of self-marketing, 
strong qualifications and smart communica-
tions are a job-winning combination; milk it for 
all its worth. Along with the six career market-
ing document samples shown in this chapter, 
consider these other creative documents that 
your competition may not know about.
Reference sheet
Usually a one-page document, sometimes two 
pages, a reference sheet is delivered upon an 
employer’s request, and lists references and 
their contact information. It includes a sum-
mary of your relationship with each reference 
and the trait or qualifications the individual ref-
erence will address. 
Specialty profile
Typically a one-page document that is fastened 
to your resume and details a strength related 
to the position you seek. Examples of subject 
areas: technology, leadership, training, pre-
sentations, client lists, projects, and mini-case 
studies.
Expert report
Suggested as a networking tool by career coach 
Jack Chapman, this four- to ten-page report 
describes how to do a simple but essential 
task relevant to the job being sought. Example: 
“10 Proven Tips to Reduce Costly Employee 
Errors.”
Blog biography
If you write or contribute to a blog, consider 
your biography as a career management tool. 
Fuss over it until you come across as someone 
you’d like to hire to save the world. Example: 
Scot Herrick on www.cuberules.com. 
Other than blogs, you can also use a biographi-
cal sketch for speaking engagements and 
industry announcements.
Case history sketch
This interesting but rare document is intended 
to spark a free-flowing conversation between 
a candidate and an interviewer; several case 
history sketches may be shared with an inter-
viewer. The sketches, printed on good quality, 
white 8.5” x 11” paper should be in 12-point type 
with ample white space and short paragraphs. 
Each case history sketch is small — one to two 
pages. The sketch recounts an engaging true 
accomplishment experience of the candidate, 
familiar or exotic. 
As an example of the familiar, Chitra, an office 
products sales representative, was soaked in a 
sudden shower burst before an important pre-
sentation. Looking like a wet mop, Chitra joked 
about her experience and made the sale.
As an example of the exotic, Brad, a sales-
man of expensive private aircraft, was called 
to an interview with a private equity company 
executive. The company sought a special kind 
of sales rep who could handle the challenge of 
dealing with powerful customers around the 
globe. Brad described the time when he sold a 
multimillion-dollar jet to a South American chief 
of state. A few months later, Brad’s customer 
called to thank him because the jet was critical 
in his escape from rebels who were trying to 
kill him. “Brad,” the chief of state said, “If you 
hadn’t persuaded me to buy that jet, I wouldn’t 
be alive today.”
Sketches can also be delivered verbally, of 
course — if the right conversational open-
ing occurs. But it’s easy to slide a few papers 
across the desk and casually comment, “Here 
are a couple of true stories to give you a glimpse 
of how I operate.” And, of course, the case 
history sketch package is a good marketing 
reminder to leave behind at the interview.

Dear Mr. Marsh: 
 
At this time, I would like to take the opportunity to express my goals and aspirations to 
be considered for a position with more responsibility. I am confident in my ability to 
perform capably at a higher level.  Let me share the reasons why I feel this way.   
 
Five years ago, I came onboard at Health and Medical Care Solutions with a strong work 
history, a desire to succeed, and the confidence that I could make positive contributions to 
the Health and Medical Care Solutions team. Over the years, I demonstrated dedication to 
my work and consistently took on additional responsibilities. For example, I took the 
initiative to acquire my commercial driver’s license (CDL), not only for my personal 
benefit, but also for the success of the company, as I fill in for drivers when needed. Co-
workers recognize my skills and aptitude for solution-finding and demonstrate their 
confidence in my knowledge by coming to me for advice. Three years ago, my 
dependability, reliability, and knowledge were rewarded by advancement from level one 
pay scale to level two after only two years on the job. 
 
I feel ready for the next step, confident that I can handle more responsibility, and 
respectfully request a promotion and/or to be considered as a candidate for supervisor, 
should a position become available.  
  
 
Thank you, 
 
John Gordon 
Bio-Technician/CDL Driver

To: Mr. John Markwell, CEO, BizJet 
 
Leadership Addendum 
 
 
Please don’t look for any generalized list of “qualifications” here. I thought you deserved to see 
documented proof of performance, aligned closely with the values I laid out in my letter to you. I 
hope these condensed examples encourage you to explore how I might serve BizJet. 
 
Refocusing an established corporate culture by capitalizing on best 
technology and leadership practices: 
The problem: I inherited a business that had slowly changed its self-image from 
“successful” to “comfortable.” Our team thought we were in the business of just selling 
products and services. They saw each new sale as a discreet event, a number they 
hoped would grow. I just couldn’t stand seeing our good people not getting satisfaction 
from what they did. No wonder we couldn’t keep a stable sales staff. It bothered me 
that our customers often saw us as “order takers.” In short, doing business at arm’s 
length was shortchanging everyone. I knew our team and our customers deserved a lot 
more. 
The actions: First, I made sure every employee knew we sold productivity, not product. 
Then I reached out to our customers with the same message, but packaged in a way I 
knew would appeal to them: We wanted to be their success partners. Soon my staff was 
seeking out our customers to find all their wants and their needs. Our people became 
masters at what drove our customers’ businesses. 
We automated what we learned, instituted data mining, optimized inventory order 
points automatically—in short, I gave our people and our customers everything they 
needed to build mutual success.  
The results: Soon our sales force’s commissions were 300 percent greater than before. 
Market share doubled in just 18 months. Sales employee turnover dropped from 20 
percent a year to less than 5 percent. Most of all, employees wanted to come to work, 
our competitor’s top performers wanted to work for us, customers wanted to see our 
reps, and I couldn’t wait to reward excellence all through our firm. 
 
Getting ahead of customer perceptions to beat the competition: 
The problem: We almost became the victim of our own success. We convinced our 
customers that we sold productivity they had to have. But when our products needed 
service, most customers accepted the established industry standard that dictated an 
eight-hour delay before they were up and running well again. That may have been the 
industry standard, but it sure wasn’t mine. 

39
 Chapter 3: Special Marketing Messages Outrun Rivals
Carla L. Johnson _______________________________________________________  
The actions: I had all the expertise right in house: our service engineers. I asked them 
how we could cut the eight-hour down time in half. It might have been the first time 
management recognized them for their expertise.  
The results: Soon we were returning our customers to full operation in half the time. But 
by then, the relationship I built with our engineers, and they with our customers, had 
taken on a momentum all its own. Eventually, the time to return to service dropped from 8 
hours to less than 90 minutes. We rarely lost a customer to service concerns from then on. 
 
Motivating customers to help our cash flow: 
The problem: Over time, we allowed our customers to take a casual view of our 
payment terms. We were telling people we wanted to be paid in 30 days, but we were 
accepting most payments 45 days or more after we delivered our products. That’s why 
we could rarely forecast our cash flow well. That’s why our ability to invest in growth 
was crippled. 
The action: I knew our administrative staff felt somewhat underappreciated. Could I 
transform collections—a job most people disliked—into a motivator for this group? I 
found the key: having them share in the rewards through a bonus system based on the 
amount they collected. 
The results: Collection times soon fell to less than 30 days. I made sure everybody knew 
how our administrative staff had positioned us for better and faster growth. 
 
Expanding into an unknown market to meet very aggressive growth targets: 
The problem: The company that bought my firm demanded uncompromising growth: 
25 percent a year! They asked me to help them expand into a new market, some 250 
miles to the south, an area we knew very little about. 
The actions: We soon identified two likely acquisition targets: one barely making a 
profit and another in the red. Of course, we went beyond the usual, rigorous due 
diligence to find what our new customers would want. We not only uncovered their 
wants, they helped us identify the local sales “stars.” That’s all we needed to apply the 
best practices we had learned on our home ground to our new market. 
The results: We were up and running in just under 18 months. Revenue in this new 
growth market escalated from $1.8M to $6.0M in 9 years.

W
hen should a resume risk its reputation by going unescorted into the 
mean streets of the job search? Almost never. The exception is when 
your resume is parked on a job site database where you hope it’ll be the 
reason for a recruiter’s aha moment.
But when your resume is vigorously making the rounds of prospective 
employers, do yourself a favor and send along a bodyguard — a cover letter. 
As I explain in Chapter 1, a cover letter adds another pleasing dimension to 
your presentation by allowing an employer to glimpse your personality and 
notice your use of language. Done with flair, a cover letter adds spice to the 
somewhat impersonal record that is your resume.
A cover letter usually arrives on computer but occasionally on paper. However 
you send it, a cover letter — and its extended family of self-promotional 
materials — is a vital tool to grow your future.
Not so fast, you say. You can barely write your name, much less a letter 
that’ll snatch an employer’s racing eye. I’m betting you can do better than 
you think. The following pages show you the nuts and bolts of how to com-
municate effectively. At the very least, this guide will coach you to recognize 
a Stand Out communication when you see one.
Still feeling uncomfortable at the thought of putting pen to pixels? Maybe you 
can find a word-wealthy friend with whom to trade a few home-cooked meals 
or tickets to a hot event in exchange for well-chosen verbs and nouns.

Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
Advantages of Stand Out Cover Letters
When your cover letter attracts interest, employers read your resume to 
confirm a positive first impression. (Alternatively, other employers turn first 
to your resume and, when they like what they see, page back to your cover 
letter to glean other bright gems about you.) The trick is to make your letter 
qualify for the short stack of keepers, not the big pile that gets passed over. 
So what’s the trick?
 
Five hallmarks define a Stand Out cover letter, separating it from a one- or 
two-sentence yawner attached merely to restate the obvious — that your 
resume is attached. These hallmarks are
  
✓ Strong personalization
  
✓ High energy 
   
✓ Relevant information 
 
✓ Moderately informal
 
✓ Interesting to read
Admittedly, creating these works of job-hunting art takes time. But there are 
at least ten good reasons why a Stand Out cover letter is worth every minute 
you spend working it up.
 
✓ Making a good first impression: As your first knock on the door, a Stand 
Out letter grabs the attention of a hiring professional: “Hey honcho, 
stop, look at me! I have the qualifications that you need to make money 
for you or to save money for you. Here’s what I can do for you!”
 
✓ Putting focus on an employer: Psychologists are right — we all like to think 
about ourselves. That goes double for employers. The Stand Out letter 
focuses on the employer, in contrast to the resume, which focuses on you.
 
✓ Selling your benefits, not features: As sales aces know, customers buy 
benefits, not features. They buy the sizzle, not the steak. Your letter is a 
IF U R interested, plz . . .
Text-speak is a no on cover letters. Y? The tex-
ting made popular by cellphone-accessorized 
thumb jockeys is a different language, one not 
appropriate for business writing. The brevity of 
language demanded of text messaging doesn’t 
meet writing standards, as in “I’m applying for 
your GR8 job.” Yes, there are still standards, 
and they are enforced by people who read 
cover letters and resumes. Text-talk and they 
won’t CU later.

51
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Way to a Job
great chance to personalize your qualifications in terms of benefits. By 
correlating an employer’s requirements with your top competencies and 
skills, your knowledge, your work experience, and your achievements, 
you can believably claim that a specific organization is a perfect place 
for you to make a valuable contribution.
 
✓ Showing savvy without boasting: A Stand Out letter demonstrates your 
ability to understand and fulfill a company’s specific needs. It shows 
that you are smart enough — and committed enough — to scout the 
company’s products, services, markets, and employment needs.
 
✓ Warming up your audience: Somewhat like the built-in acceptance that 
occurs when a studio announcer warms up the audience before a TV 
star appears, a Stand Out cover letter presells your attractiveness as a 
candidate. It predisposes the hiring professional to like you, forming an 
image of you as qualified, personable, and superior among competitors 
in a high stack of applications.
 
✓ Keeping a measure of control: A Stand Out cover letter puts a degree of 
control in your hands. It sets up a reason for you to call an employer, if 
an employer doesn’t beat you to the phone. By promising to call within 
a given time frame, when you do call you can truthfully get past a gate-
keeper by saying that your call is expected. And when you’re blocked 
by voicemail, a good tactic is to leave another message saying when you 
will call again. And do it, showing that you are a candidate of your word.
 
✓ Indicating that you do good work: A Stand Out cover letter is evidence 
that you’re able, knowledgeable, talented, and that you take pride in 
your work. By contrast, a poor and boring letter suggests that your work 
will be poor and boring.
 
✓ Confirming critical thinking skills: A Stand Out cover letter shows the 
employer how your mind works — how you formulate ideas and pull 
them together into a rationale that makes sense. Moreover, your cover 
letter proves that you can communicate your thoughts in writing — a 
useful requirement for sales letters, memos, and reports.
 
✓ Taking years off your image: If you’re a job hunter more than 15 years 
out of school, make a point of showing that you don’t believe the way 
you worked yesterday is necessarily the best way to work today and 
tomorrow. Mention major changes a target industry is undergoing and 
explain what you’ve done to keep pace. A cover letter is an ideal place to 
convey that you’re on the curve as new business worlds stir.
 
✓ Knocking on new doors: When your most recent work experience is 
different from the career field you want to enter, use your cover letter 
to accent your skills that best match the new field. Should you mention 
why you want to switch? Generally, I wouldn’t; doing so just calls atten-
tion to your less-than-perfect match for the job. At times, though, it may 
be necessary. Suppose that you worked for four companies, each of 
which was sold. You might conclude your letter by saying

52
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
 I am well qualified for a small company where wearing many hats 
is useful. I gained broad experience in different environments during 
[dates] at four companies: A, B, C, and D. Each company was 
acquired, resulting in changes of management. Despite departures of 
key personnel, excellent references about my successful performance 
at each are available.
Disadvantages of Stand Out 
Cover Letters
There aren’t any.
Many Job Hunters Have Writer’s Block
When you find yourself struggling with writing a cover letter, the biggest 
reason may be that you haven’t thought through your career goals. You 
really can’t do your best writing about where you want to go until you know 
where that is.
Even when you’re certain of your direction, you may still be stuck at square 
one. This phenomenon is called writer’s block.
 
One cure writers use to break through writer’s block is called freewriting. 
Writing becomes a problem for some people when they try to start at the 
beginning. When you freewrite, take about 15 minutes to randomly scratch 
out your thoughts on paper or pound away at your computer keyboard. Do 
not slow down to organize or edit. After you’ve pushed your pen for the full 15 
minutes, read over your work. Mark ideas, words, and phrases that you can 
use in your letter. You may wish to freewrite several times until your thinking 
ink warms up.
Another technique to stop staring at a blank page is to answer the following 
questions. Find a friend to help you brainstorm, and make notes as you go.
 
✓ Whom do you picture reading your letter? What is that person wearing? 
In what environment is that person reading your letter — a well-ordered 
office or a room that looks like a teenager’s landfill?
 
✓ Which qualities do you want to emphasize in your letter?
 
✓ Why will your letter be interesting and important to the reader?
 
✓ What benefits do you bring to the reader’s company?
 
✓ What special skills or talents set you apart from the competition?

53
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Way to a Job
 
✓ Why do you think your employability (person-specific) skills will help 
you fit into a new company?
 
✓ How are your previous jobs similar to those you now seek? If the jobs 
are different, what skills are the same and transferable?
 
✓ What do you like about the company to which you are applying?
 
Here’s a tip for people who speak better than they write. Recruit a friend to 
engage in a recorded discussion about the target job. Tell the friend why you 
are a hot prospect to fill it. From that recording may come sound bites that lift 
your letter out of humdrum status.
Keep in mind as you embark on the process of learning to write Stand Out 
cover letters that your first draft is probably going to be shredder food, but 
your editing and refining can fix almost anything.
Ugly Typos, Ugly Letters, Fewer Offers
No self-respecting guide to job letters would dare omit a finger-wagging 
warning against sloppy word work. So here’s a stern but true lecture.
In my contacts over the years with thousands of people who hire people, 
never have I known even one hiring authority to preach the virtue of goofy 
grammar, bizarre punctuation, typing errors, wayward lowercase, texting 
abbreviations, or other crimes against accepted language usage. Everyone 
who reads jobs letters and resumes is against that sort of thing.
 
Watch out for these familiar missteps:
 
✓ UnAcxeptable spelling. No large academic studies have confirmed it, 
but anecdotally, it’s no surprise that spelling shockers are responsible 
for big numbers of rejections for blundering job seekers. My assessment 
comes from nearly constant reports of such blunders as managers who 
attempted to describe their previous “rolls” (they meant “roles”) and 
applicants who cannot even spell the word “error” correctly.
 
 If you’re writing too fast to be accurate, remember that simple mistakes 
can put your brand at risk. Fast is good but accurate sells.
 
✓ Grammar gaffes. Spell checkers can’t help letters that say things like 
“would of” known instead of “would have” known. For a crash course in 
good grammar, see handbooks published for administrative assistants 
and secretaries; otherwise, retake English 101.
 
✓ Poisoned proper nouns. Addressing a letter to “Mr. Michael R. Forest” 
when his name is correctly spelled “Mr. Michael R. Forrest” won’t win over 
an employer; it just convinces him that you have a short attention span.

54
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
The moral to this warning: Proofread until your eyes fall out of your head. 
Many hiring professionals blow off even a qualified candidate if even one typo 
appears in a cover letter or resume. Hiring is in the details.
Overcoming What-If Worries
What-if questions are legitimate worries when writing cover letters whose 
solutions may not be obvious. Here are answers to some of these common 
concerns:
 
✓ What if I’m responding to a recruitment ad? To whom should my 
cover letter be addressed?
 
 Send your Stand Out cover letter with a resume (See my book Resumes 
For Dummies, 5th Edition.) to the individual named in the ad. Follow 
instructions.
 
✓ What if the ad’s instructions say to send the letter and resume to the 
human resources department?
 
 Do it. The resume will likely be put into an electronic database and 
stored for a long time; you may be considered for a number of open 
positions. In addition to following instructions, send a Stand Out cover 
letter to the name of the department hiring manager (your prospective 
boss). Say that your resume is on file with HR. Get the hiring manager’s 
name by anonymously calling or use the social networking connections I 
describe in Chapter 2. 
 
✓ What if I don’t know enough about the position to write a Stand Out 
letter?
 
 Look up job descriptions for similar positions and read recruitment 
ads. Try to make online contact with people in the target career field or 
industry. You can also go after a long shot: Try to get through on the 
telephone to a person who does similar work for a competitor.
 
✓ What if I’m responding to an executive recruiter? Do I send the same 
materials?
 
 Yes, but mention that while you’re very interested in this position, you 
would like to be considered for other jobs if this one doesn’t pan out.
 
✓ What if I’m initiating a possible opening at a company that hasn’t 
advertised one?
 
 Research to determine who has the authority to hire you. Send your 
self-marketing materials to that person. Even more effective is to meet 
your target at a professional meeting or find a third party whose name 
you can use as an introduction.

The Anatomy of a Cover Letter
Every cover letter contains the same bones beneath its unique skin of 
qualifications and experience. The upcoming sections take you from head to 
toe of a cover letter. 
Contact information
Your mailing address, cell and home telephone numbers, e-mail address, and 
blog address (if you have a business-related blog, not a party blog) appear 
first on a job letter.
 
When you’re applying for an international position, spell out your state 
followed by a comma and USA (Mesa, Arizona, USA). Further, include a Skype 
address on the last line of the contact information (Skype: darrylroberts). 
For contact information layout ideas, look at the sample letters in Part III and 
Part IV.
Date line and inside address
Place the date two lines below your contact information and place the inside 
address two lines below the date. Aligned with the left margin of the page, 
enter the name of the person to whom you’re writing (with the correct prefix, 
such as Mr. or Mrs., Dr. or Rev.), followed on the next line by the company 
name, and followed on the next lines by the address. If you know the job title 
of the addressee, include that information on the same line as the addressee’s 
name or on the following line.
On the right side of the page, aligned with the inside address information, 
you can include a subject line labeled RE: (which is an abbreviation for 
Regarding) to highlight the reason for correspondence.
Salutation
Your salutation is like the eye contact that establishes a connection and 
begins the dialogue. Do your best to identify the person who will read your 
letter and address that person directly. Not only does your reader appreciate 
being addressed by name, but this personal bit separates your letter from the 
ones written by people who didn’t take the time to do a little research into 
the company. 

56
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
If you absolutely can’t uncover the name of the hiring manager, write Good 
Morning. It’s a cheerful way to begin. Because no one enjoys reading mail 
addressed to a generic person (remember all the junk mail you’ve trashed 
addressed to Dear Resident?), never address your letter to Dear Sir or 
Madam, or To Whom It May Concern.
 
Try, try, try to discover the name of your reader. It’s courteous, it takes 
initiative, and it indicates genuine interest in the company and, most 
importantly, in the job.
Introduction
Your introduction should grab your reader’s attention immediately. (See 
Chapters 5 and 6.) As the “head” of your letter, it appeals to the head of your 
reader, sparking interest that will compel a hiring authority to keep reading 
as it states the purpose of the letter.
 All sorts of rules are given for ways to start your cover letter. Some say, 
don’t start with “I.” Others advise shock value and creativity, a risky approach 
unless you’re a skilled writer. Still others suggest you begin with the name of 
a mutual acquaintance. The most important rule is to engage the reader’s 
interest. Period.
Body
The body of your letter provides essential information that the employer 
should know about you — competencies, skills, accomplishments, and 
quantified statements describing your past achievements. Remember to focus 
on the benefits you bring to the employer’s table. Work in a branding statement 
if you have one. (See Chapter 13.)
The body should include a very brief background summary of your relevant 
experience. This is information that the reader can get from your resume, 
so don’t spend too much space on it in your letter. But don’t be tempted to 
leave it out. Without this key selling point, your reader may never get to your 
resume.
Conclusion
The last segment of your letter expresses appreciation and explains what 
happens next. It says when you will call to set a time for an interview, or it 
motivates the hiring authority to call you before anyone else does.

57
 Chapter 4: Writing Your Way to a Job
Closing, signature, and enclosure line
The closing section is the handshake before parting, sincere and warm. 
Sincerely, Sincerely yours, and Very truly yours are the most popular, but other 
choices include Best regards and All the best or just All best. Don’t forget to 
put a comma after your closing line.
 
If your name doesn’t appear in your contact information at the top of your 
letter, type your name below your signature (four lines below the closing) so 
that there will be no confusion about spelling.
When your penmanship runs to chicken-scratch, try to make your signature 
legible. Any employer prefers to be able to read what someone handwrites 
instead of having to interpret it.
After you’ve motivated your reader, the enclosure line provides a direction. 
Indicate the item that you’ve sent with your cover letter, such as a resume or 
portfolio. This line directly follows your typed name or signature.
Get Ready to Write
When you want your career to take off, make your cover letters terrific! Take 
more risks, offer more surprises, and find fresh ways to sell your benefits and 
skills. Pledge to never send out a run-of-the-mill letter again. From now on, 
you’re in Stand Out mode!

In This Chapter
▶ Pepping up your words
▶ Selling yourself with style 
▶ Reaching into a grammar first-aid kit
A
s you work to get the right razzle dazzle into your cover letter, here’s 
a writing tip from the pros: Visualize your reader and write specifically 
for that reader. Speaking directly to your reader may seem obvious, but this 
tenet is said to be one of the most overlooked aspects of effective writing. 
Writing to a real person makes your letter more personable and interesting 
to read. It shows you have considered your reader and want that person to 
understand what you have to say.
 
If your blank sheet of paper is beginning to look like the place where you’ll 
spend eternity, rip a page from a magazine featuring a picture of someone who 
could be reading your letter, tape the picture to your computer, and write to 
that specific person. Who cares if you select a picture of a conservative middle-
aged man with gray hair when in reality the reader of your letter is a vivacious, 
young woman with bouncing red curls? No matter. The process — the visual-
ization allowing you to target a particular human being — is what counts.
Refreshing Your Language
I once asked a friend who writes and publishes career books whether he 
genuinely likes to write. “Well, no,” he responded, “I like to have written.”
That sentiment sums everything up for many who do almost anything to 
avoid writing but who know that they can’t escape this lifetime without 
learning to write certain things — self-promotional job letters are some of 
those things.
Make this task easier for yourself not only by reviewing a few rules of 
grammar, but also by reminding yourself to answer the big “So why?” and 
“So what?” questions in every letter.

60
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
So why are you writing?
Never assume the purpose of your letter is obvious to your reader. You are 
writing a cover letter — or another type of job letter — ultimately aimed at 
employment.
If you’re writing a cover letter, you want to land an interview. Say so. Try to 
maintain control by saying that you will be in touch at a specified time to see 
whether an interview is possible. When this approach seems impractical, like 
when you respond to a blind recruitment ad, close with a benefit you offer — 
“My former boss describes me as the best multimedia designer in the state. 
Can we talk?”
If you are writing another type of job letter, tell your reader exactly what you 
want. Leave no room for guessing.
So what? How does it matter?
For each sentence you write, ask yourself, “So what? What does this information 
mean to my reader — a benefit gained, a loss avoided, a promise of good 
things to come — what?” Don’t, for instance, merely list a bunch of skills and 
achievements — what good will those skills do for the person who reads your 
letter?
 Must you always interpret for the reader the benefit of your skills and 
achievements?
 
✓ Yes, if a ghost of an outside chance exists that the benefits of your skills 
and achievements will not be evident to the reader.
 
✓ No, if the listing of your skills and achievements is so strong that an 
eighth grader will get the message.
For more illustrations of when you must interpret your benefits, look over 
the sample cover letters in Part III.
 
Getting in the habit of asking yourself “So why?” and “So what?” boosts the 
power of your job letters by 100 percent.
Technical versus nontechnical language
Tailor your language to your reader. If you’re an engineer writing to another 
engineer, use technical language. If you’re an engineer writing to a director of 
human resources, your reader may not understand technical engineering 
language; explain any technical terms in simple, everyday language. 

61
 Chapter 5: Language That Snap-Crackle-Pops
Concise but thorough
Because your reader may be pressed for time, aim to write a concise but 
thorough cover letter. Tell your reader as much about yourself as you can, 
but don’t make your reader wade through extra words and unnecessary 
details. Consider the following example:
I am a person who believes that the values of fervent dedication, 
cooperative teamwork, dynamic leadership, and adaptive creativity 
really make up the cornerstones and are the crucial components of 
any totally successful sales venture.
Revised using concise but thorough language, the same sentence now reads:
Dedication, teamwork, leadership, and creativity are essential 
to successful sales.
Use short words, sentences, and paragraphs. Avoid cramming too many ideas 
into each paragraph. Logically break long paragraphs into several short ones.
Write in specific terms; avoid vague descriptions. Use numbers, measures, 
and facts — detailed information rather than unquantified generalities. 
Consider the following example:
I saved the company a fortune when I instituted a new system for 
scheduling.
Now read the same example revised for specifics:
I saved the company more than one million dollars in production 
when I instituted a new system for production scheduling.

Active voice versus passive voice
Passive voice indicates a state of existence with words like be, is, was, were, 
are, seem, has, and been — the 90-pound weaklings of verbs.
Rather than mucking up your cover letter with wimpy passive-voice verbs 
(“Production processes were reformed by my innovation and $12,000 per 
month was saved by the company.”), choose active-voice verbs to show off 
your accomplishments: “My innovation reformed production processes and 
saved the company $12,000 per month.”
Active voice does the heavy lifting you need in your cover letter; it’s strong, 
vibrant, and vigorous — qualities you want to show off to hiring managers 
yourself.
Past/present tense
For the most part, use present tense as you’re writing. After all, your letter 
is something you’re creating now. When you refer to accomplishments or 
achievements, use past tense.
 
When your resume says you are currently employed (20XX–Present), remember 
to use present tense if you refer to your current job in a cover letter. If you slip and 
use past tense, the reader may assume you’ve left the job and are pretending to be 
currently employed.

67
 Chapter 5: Language That Snap-Crackle-Pops
Fundamentals of Grammar 
and Punctuation
Grammar slips sink jobs. Many employers see language skills as an important 
aspect of potential job performance, and nothing says language skills like 
attention to grammar and punctuation. To help you over some areas that 
many job letter writers find tricky, here is a brief overview of frequently made 
mistakes and how to correct them.
Sentence fragments
Sentence fragments signal incomplete thoughts. They neglect essential 
components. For example,
Although I work in Detroit, making $200 an hour.
This fragment is missing the subsequent subject and verb needed to finish 
the “Although I work . . .”
Although I work in Detroit, making $200 an hour, I would prefer to 
work in Atlanta to be near my family.
To test your sentences, speak each one aloud, out of context. Imagine walking 
up to someone and saying that sentence. Would the sentence make sense, or is 
something missing? If so, add the missing information.
Run-on sentences
Run-on sentences are two complete sentences written as one. For example,
I finished writing my cover letter, it’s great!
This run-on should read:
I finished writing my cover letter. It’s great!
Each sentence contains a complete thought and should stand on its own.
Run-on sentences stand out as grammatical errors.

68
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
Dangling participles
Dangling participles are words ending in -ing that modify the wrong subject. 
For example,
Running across the water, we saw a huge water beetle.
This sentence literally means that we saw a water beetle while we were running 
across the water — a Guinness Book of Records feat! Try this instead:
We saw a huge water beetle running across the water.
Dangling participles are good for laughs, but they indicate imprecision or 
lack of care.
Misplaced modifiers
Like dangling participles, misplaced modifiers modify the wrong subject, 
often resulting in hilarious miscommunications. For example,
Ben taught the dog, an inveterate womanizer, to bark at all blonde 
women.
The dog is an inveterate womanizer? Probably not. Revised, this sentence 
makes more sense:
Ben, an inveterate womanizer, taught the dog to bark at all blonde 
women.
Semicolons
Semicolons can be tricky, and so you should probably avoid them if you 
don’t feel comfortable using them. In essence, semicolons are weak periods; 
they indicate a separation between two complete sentences that are so 
closely related they shouldn’t be separated by a period.
As you can see, this definition is not specific. You may simply use periods 
between every sentence. You won’t break any rules, and you’ll avoid using 
semicolons incorrectly.
The only rule for semicolons is as follows: When you introduce a list of com-
plete sentences by using a colon, separate each sentence with a semicolon. 
For example:

69
 Chapter 5: Language That Snap-Crackle-Pops
I accomplished the following: I networked all the computers, 
company-wide; I designed a new system for scheduling; and I broke 
the world’s record in typing speed.
Again, you can avoid this use of semicolons in your cover letter by placing 
each item on a separate line set off by bullets. No punctuation is necessary at 
the end of each line. For example,
I accomplished the following:
 
• I networked all the computers, company-wide
 
• I designed a new system for scheduling
 
• I broke the world’s record in typing speed
Punctuation in parenthetical expressions
If a parenthetical expression occurs in the middle or at the end of a sentence, 
place the punctuation outside the parentheses. Some examples include the 
following:
Cover letters are essential (see Chapter 5).
Cover letters (and resumes) are essential.
Cover letters (and resumes), essential to the job search, are important.
Question marks and exclamation points, when part of a parenthetical 
expression occurring in the middle of a sentence, are the exception to this 
rule. Some examples include the following:
The interview (or was it an inquisition?) was a disaster.
My cover letter (a masterpiece!) took four hours to write.
If a parenthetical expression stands alone as a sentence, place the punctuation 
inside the parentheses. For example,
(I will discuss these skills in a moment.)
Hyphenating words for clarity
When you use two words together as a description of another word, use a 
hyphen. Examples include
next-to-last job
long-range plan

70
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
To test whether you should use a hyphen, take out one of the descriptive 
terms and see if the description still makes sense. For example,
next-to-last job
without one descriptive term, becomes
to last job
Doesn’t make sense, does it? Because the three words “next to last” cannot 
be used individually as a description and still make sense, you need hyphens 
between them.
The same rule applies for two nouns used together to express a single idea. 
Examples include
light-year
life-cycle
For greatest accuracy, check a dictionary, such as www.Dictionary.com.
Abbreviations
Use abbreviations only if you have previously written out what the abbrevia-
tion stands for. For example, do not write UCSD if you have not previously 
written University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Never assume that your 
reader knows or will be able to figure out what an abbreviation stands for.
Abbreviations such as AIDS and DNA are so well known that they do not have 
to be defined. Also, some technical jargons commonly use abbreviations. In that 
case, write to your reader. If your reader will understand the abbreviation, use it.
Consecutive numbers
When you use two numbers in a row, avoid confusion by writing out the 
shorter of the two numbers:
six 9-person teams
Or revise your sentence to separate the numbers:
six teams of nine people

71
 Chapter 5: Language That Snap-Crackle-Pops
A number at the beginning of a sentence
Whenever a sentence begins with a number, write out the number rather 
than using numerals. Better yet, revise the sentence so that the number does 
not appear at the beginning.
Commas
In general, use commas anywhere you would pause if you read the sentence 
aloud. If you’re a person who pauses often while speaking, this suggestion 
probably won’t work for you. My advice is to ask several people to read your 
letter for punctuation and grammar and follow their suggestions. Or get a 
good punctuation guide and follow it.
Commas in a series
Whenever you have a series of terms separated by commas, use a comma 
after the next-to-last term for clarity. Some examples include the following:
Cover letters, resumes, and interviews make up part of the job search 
process.
Dear Mr. Barnes, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Schultz:
This technique is called the serial comma. Newspapers don’t use serial commas 
because they slow down reading. Be consistent in your use of commas. Don’t use 
a serial comma in one paragraph and no serial comma in another that calls for one.
Capitalization
Capitalize trade names, like Band-Aid, Kleenex, and Xerox. Avoid using these 
trade names to refer to a class of things or to an action. For example,
I need a Band-Aid.
Use bandage unless you specifically want the brand-name product.
I need to Xerox some papers
is also technically incorrect. Write
I need to photocopy some papers.

72
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
Resist the urge to Capitalize words to make them Stand out as Important. 
Doing so is not only wrong, it looks Contrived and Juvenile.
Capitalize titles of departments, 
companies, and agencies
Any official name of a company, department, agency, division, or organization 
should be capitalized. Examples include
U.S. Department of Labor
Department of Safety
Don’t capitalize words such as department, company, or organization when 
used as a general word rather than as part of a specific title. For example,
I work for a division of Toyota.

Formats for Organization
Following are several formats to suggest how your letter can be organized. 
You can use any organizational format with any occupation.
 
✓ Problem/solution: The problem/solution format starts with “Here’s the 
problem” and ends with “Here’s how I solved it.” Case histories and 
success stories blossom in this favorite format for cover letters and 
resumes.
 
✓ Inverted pyramid: News stories use this format. You start with a 
lead paragraph summarizing the story, with the following paragraphs 
presenting facts in order of decreasing importance. In your cover 
letter, you state a comprehensive goal, career desire, or position at 
the beginning and then provide specific examples in the following 
paragraphs to support your aim.
 
✓ Deductive order: Much like the inverted pyramid, the deductive order 
format starts with a generalization and ends with specific examples 
supporting the generalization. For example, you can start by making a 
general statement about a skill, and then support that statement with 
facts.
 
✓ Inductive order: Begin your letter with a story or anecdote and then 
lead the reader to the conclusion you want him or her to draw from the 
story or anecdote. Explain how that story or anecdote supports your 
ability to succeed at the job you’ve targeted.

74
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ List: Separate your letter into distinct points and set off the points with 
headings, bullets, or numbers. Put the most important point first. This 
format is especially effective for enumerating skills or achievements. 
Combine it with another format (such as the requirements-qualifications 
match letter that leads off Chapter 8) for extra punch.
Read for Smoothness
When you finish writing your letter, read it over just to check its organiza-
tion. When you read it, each line should fit into the other. You shouldn’t 
really notice that a new sentence has begun. You should feel “prepared” for 
everything that you’re about to read.
To avoid jarring the reader with an abrupt change of subject, ask yourself, 
“Why did I place this sentence or paragraph after the one before it?” If the 
answer isn’t obvious in your letter, the flow of your text is probably choppy 
and unclear to the reader. Analyze what’s not working and rewrite until the 
letter reads smoothly.
Three simple tips to improve your letters
 ✓ Highlight short sentences and lists with bul-
lets, asterisks, or em dashes. For example,
 • Won Orchid award for building
 * Won Orchid award for building
 — Won Orchid award for building
 ✓ Start with a short quote that reflects the 
employer’s policies or values.
 ✓ Reword portions of the employer’s mis-
sion statement or other documents, and 
work these phrases into your letter as 
you describe your skills, work ethic, and 
values.

As Muppet Kermit the Frog says, “Time’s fun when you’re having flies.”
That line is different. That line is funny. That line lassoes your attention, roping

I’m not suggesting that you start job letters with frog quotes or other whimsical 
statements. Instead, I am pointing out that you must work to grab immediate 
reader attention and then hold it tightly throughout the complete text of job 
search correspondence.
This chapter outlines strategies and words designed to do exactly that. 
You can use a variety of approaches, ranging from riding on the coattails of a 
personal connection, to responding to the requirements of a job ad, to creating 
drama with words that intrigue, words that excite, words that zing!

76
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
Starting Your Letter
 
The best information to pop in your opening line is a known name. A personal 
referral works wonders. In this approach, you begin with the name of a mutual 
connection. Someone whom the letter’s recipient likes or respects or, at least, 
has heard of. Name dropping virtually guarantees that your letter will be read. 
Additionally, you can score points by identifying yourself as a member of an 
affinity group, such as the alumni of a college or member of a civic organization. 
Name is the game!
In addition to names, here’s another high-octane approach: Launch your 
letter with a clear statement of what you want, quickly followed by the 
qualifying benefits you offer that directly relate to the requirements the 
hiring company seeks. Or turn it around — lead with the skills and benefits 
you offer before saying what you want.
Still another way to energize your opening: Create a narrative hook (Time’s fun 
when you’re having flies). In the broadest sense, a narrative hook is a literary 
technique in the opening of a story that “hooks” the reader’s attention to keep 
eyes scooting down the page. A cover letter hook often is a thematic statement, 
followed by a flashback to the history the reader needs to understand it.
Here’s an example of a thematic opening hook that was successfully used 
by a woman who, after a two-year absence, wanted to return to her original 
career in the automotive industry:
Any claim that the grass is greener outside the auto-industry fence is 
a myth! At least it is for me. After 20 years of rock-solid experience in 
our industry, a series of outside opportunities briefly tempted me to 
cast eyes elsewhere. But not for long.
My inner voice keeps shouting loud and clear that the auto side is 
where I belong, and that’s why I’m selectively contacting you. I hope 
you will see how adding me to your quality operation will be a big win 
for Standford Motors.
 
Don’t waste valuable opening-line real estate by focusing on the source of a 
job post — I saw your ad in the KoKoMo Express last Sunday. Handle sourcing 
head-on in the regarding (“RE:”) line in the upper, right-hand quadrant (cruise 
the sample cover letters in Part III). Example: RE: Your job ad in the KoKoMo 
Express, June 14.
 
Sell, don’t tell! As I mention in Chapter 1, cover letters in today’s marketplace 
are really sales letters. Rather than whispering through an old-school letter 
of transmission — Please find my resume attached, Your Royal Honor. — open 
with a strategic bang!

A Sampling of Grand Openers 
So what do contemporary openers look like? Review the following 27 Stand 
Out opening line examples that are sure to make a job letter jump out of the 
pack right from the start. Read and grow creative.
 
✓ I recently met with James Smith from your firm, and he strongly 
recommended that I send you my resume. Knowing the requirements 
of your open position for a financial analyst, he concludes that I am the 
ideal candidate. Your opening does seem to be tailor-made for my 
experience at CityWide Financial Services.
 
✓ During your visit to UCSB last fall, I had the pleasure of hearing you 
address the issue of FuelCO oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara. As a 
UCSB June graduate, I . . .
 
✓ My computer skills developed from childhood, plus my well-honed 
interest in technology advances, and my recently completed education 
in computer science make me a strong candidate for a position as an 
entry-level software engineer at your highly regarded company.
 
✓ I recently graduated with a 3.75 GPA from the University of California, 
where I was a research assistant to Dr. Joe Famous, engineering 
department chair.

I enclose my portfolio showing how ideal my background in photography 
and design is for your marketing strategies.
 
✓ Juliette Nagy mentioned your company has opened a division of sporting 
goods and suggested that I contact you. As a former high school coach 
for several sports, I believe I have the mix of skills and knowledge you’re 
looking for.
 
✓ Your speech was inspiring, Ms. Luna-Mendez. Soon I will have completed 
my master’s in physical therapy, just in time for your entry-level openings 
in the PT ward. 
 
✓ The breakthrough research being conducted at Hughes Medical Labs 
is too exciting to miss out on! I’m looking forward to following up our 
phone conversation with a sit-down meeting to explore how I can make 
a contribution as a member of the early warning symptoms task force. I 
provide a link to relevant information about exactly what I can add as a 
biology researcher who has managed several challenging projects.
 
✓ I enjoyed our meeting at the Rancho Santa Fe Garden Club and, as you 
suggested, am sending you this additional information to review before 
we get together.

Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ Chaim Isenberg of the Grenwich and Co. accounting firm suggested 
I contact you regarding opportunities in your warehouse division in 
Champagne. My background documents considerable success in the 
areas of loss prevention and asset recovery, which I understand are high 
on your list of requirements.
 
✓ Noting your posting for a civil engineer with environmental experience, 
here’s my question: Will your environmental services department reach 
its Green Acres corporate goal of providing a “turnkey” approach to 
environmental investigation and remediation, or will it always struggle 
with solving complicated projects, from engineering and design issues 
through remedial construction? You’ll never know without the best 
person for the job to follow through for you. Arguably, that’s me and 
here’s why: (bulleted highlights of achievements, experience, education, 
awards, and quotations from satisfied clients).
 
✓ I thrive on challenge. When I read your posting for a corporate fitness 
trainer, I thought lightning had struck and that you wrote about that 
opportunity hoping to find me. I have three years’ experience in freelance 
fitness training following my military service, and, IMHO, an opinion 
confirmed by clients, I’m fired up and ready to go!
 
✓ You mention several things in your posting for a reality show screener 
that make me think you’re looking for someone with my proven assets. 
Let me briefly explain.
 
✓ Terry Ann Torre, who supervised my work as an intern with your 
company, recommends that I apply to you for the position of assistant 
customer service manager. Here are some of the reasons Ms. Torre is 
recommending me: (bulleted list of reasons).
 
✓ Serendipity! As a graduating senior, I am delighted to learn that Wonderful 
Merchandising Magazine has just named Better Bargains Inc., a company 
I’ve long admired, one of the top ten best places to launch a career!
 
 After developing good skills in fashion merchandising, personnel practices, 
and salesmanship in my cooperative education program, I have begun to 
search for a position in retail marketing. I will graduate June 2 and am 
crossing my fingers that you’ll be one of my first interviews. 
 
✓ After working four years on The Hill as a legislative assistant on the 
House Rules Committee, I understand the inner workings of the political 
system and could prove to be a valuable asset to a firm such as yours. A 
few of my areas of expertise: (no more than six bulleted items).
 
✓ Are you in the market for a sales pro who has set sales records for four 
different companies and trained dozens of high-performance sales reps? 
 
✓ Congratulations on the opening of your new insurance branch. Watching 
your progress over several years, I’ve seen that A-123 Insurance 
Company has earned “street cred.” That leads me to believe that you 
and I see the insurance business through the same lens: excellent 
customer service!

 Chapter 6: Great Lines for Success
 
✓ I have a successful and reliable work history dealing with the public that 
would make me an excellent employee for your new store. Interested? 
My resume would like to meet you, and so would I. Here’s why:
 
✓ Velia Acevedo has suggested I forward my resume to you for consid-
eration for a current administrative assistant opening in the escrow 
department. Through conversations with Velia at a continuing education 
class, I learned what it takes to be a successful support professional at 
your firm. I am confident that I have the head for numbers and word pro-
cessing skills to make the grade.
 
✓  Road-tested but not battle-scarred, I offer the necessary qualifications 
and experience to deliver real revenue results during my first 30 days as 
a senior sales representative. Please allow me to document my abilities 
when we sit down and talk about my becoming part of your team.
 
✓ Preparing to respond to your ad in today’s Chicago Tribune, I did some 
research and discovered that we’re both Northwestern grads. Is this 
serendipity or what? I hope our mutual alma mater is a harbinger of 
good things to come and that we’ll be cheering on the same side in the 
workplace as well. As this letter very briefly outlines, my qualifications 
and your requirements for an industrial engineer are joined at the hip.
 
✓ Chances are excellent that I’m the multi-talented graphic designer you 
seek in your “multi-talented graphic designer” post on Job-Hunt.org. 
With extensive experience in multimedia, marketing, and print design, I 
work within budget to deliver world-class catalogs and brochures, logos, 
Web site design, Flash, video photomontages, and DVD cover design.
 
✓ As a new USC graduate, I’ve been hoping to find the kind of position 
you’re staffing because I have exactly the background you’re asking for. 
Specifically, the following columns match item for item: (The company’s 
requirements are listed in the left column, and in the right, your matching 
qualifications.)
 
✓ I understand that your firm is in search of individuals with (skills) and 
(qualifications). I think I’ve hit the jackpot, and maybe you have as well. 
Don’t you love finding the perfect match?
 
✓ In reviewing my resume, you will find that I possess all the attributes of a 
perfect match, from (skills) to (experience or attributes). I am excited to 
learn of your job opening because I have been searching for a company 
just like yours to make real use of my experience.
 
✓ (Mutual contact) thought my resume measures such achievement in the 
function you supervise that he assured me he would pass it on to you; in 
the event it hasn’t yet reached your desk, here’s a copy.
What makes these opening lines work?
 
✓ Some drop names.
 
✓ Some connect to a common experience.

80
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ Some reveal knowledge of the company involved.
 
✓ Some use a narrative hook.
 
✓ Some aim at alumni of a graduate’s college.
 
✓ Some ask a question.
 
✓ Some refer to the content of an employer’s ad.
All show that the person writing the letter is someone who goes an extra 
mile to do a superior job. A person who has just the kind of motivation that 
employers hope to hire.
But not everyone gets it.
Avoid Leadoff Losers 
 
This section shows you how not to open your letters. These leadoff losers are 
snatched from real correspondence supplied by recruiters and HR specialists. 
Comments in italics that follow each line colorfully express the employer’s 
silent point of view. Read and be warned!
 
✓ I was recently let go due to a reduction in force, which is why I wish to 
apply for your position in merchandising.
 
 Nothing like starting on an upbeat note.
 
✓ Having recently completed an assignment in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (the former Soviet Union), I am interested in 
pursuing and advancing my career opportunities into this arena.
 
 Arena? What arena? Here. . . . There. . . . Where?
 
✓ In most organizations, job performance, whether excellent or inept, doesn’t 
count, as long as you conform and play politics. I believe that performance 
does count! I have recently been notified by Dunnie Pharmaceuticals that 
my R&D position will be eliminated in the near future.
 
 Does this translate to: I wasn’t much of a team player? Is that why the job 
seeker’s position is being eliminated?
 
✓ I am currently in search of a job; I have no particular preference for 
any area, for as you can see from my included resume, my experience 
includes a broad range.
 
 One who will take anything masters nothing. As movie pioneer Sam 
Goldwyn once said, “Include me out.”
 
✓ I am writing in response to the advertised position for a production 
coordinator. I am very interested in advancing in my field and making a 
transition into the aspects of the communications profession described 
in your ad.

81
 Chapter 6: Great Lines for Success
 
 Do you want to advance in your field (which is what?), or do you want to 
make a transition, or do you want to do the work I need done?
 
✓ If you or someone you know could use a graphic designer, please pass 
my resume on to interested parties, or call me as soon as possible.
 
 If you’re asking me to be your agent, remember, agents get 15% off the top.
 
✓ My partner and I are dissolving our business after 15 years of working 
together. I am interested in a position at Fred & Associates and have 
enclosed a resume for your review.
 
 A business divorce is rarely just one person’s fault: Are you a pain in the 
back country? And what is it you want to do for me?
 
✓ When a customer calls for a quote, your firm’s future is in the hands of 
the sales staff. I have big hands.
 
 Huh? Close but no cigar. And keep your hands to yourself.
 
✓ To maintain solid growth, a company must have marketing and sales 
professionals who can jump on a market before the competition does. 
My background proves I can do that.
 
 Tell me something I don’t know. I’ve been in this business for 30 years.
Learn from your false starts. As the Japanese proverb has it: “Fall seven 
times, stand up eight.”
Skip Salutation Snoozers
Although not the dead-letter-walking mistakes of the leadoff losers in the 
preceding section, these salutation snoozers do have sedating effects:
 
✓ In response to your recent job posting for a hospital clown, please 
accept the enclosed copy of my credentials.
 
 Earth to bozo: The sick kids in this hospital need cheering up by an 
imaginative, funny clown who colors outside the lines. Next!
 
✓ In a recent edition of Craigslist, your ad for a television producer piqued 
my interest and I have therefore enclosed a copy of my resume.
 
 Yawn.
 
✓ Please accept this letter and resume for the product marketing manager 
position as referenced on your company’s Web site. I am sure that my work 
history and educational background will benefit the future endeavors of 
your company.
 
 Your letter is boring; you’re probably boring, too. About 500 people 
answered our ad, and most are just as mediocre as you seem to be.

82
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ I am very interested in opportunities within your company. Enclosed 
please find my resume for your review.
 
 Sure you are. You and hundreds of other unfocused job hunters who will 
take whatever jobs they can get.
Cover letters and resumes begin to blur after skimming a dozen or so of 
them. Just imagine the glazed-over eyes after a hiring professional reads 
hundreds of cover letters! Some letters jump out of the stack, enticing the 
reader to tackle the resume; in other words, they make the cut. Others may 
as well be stamped with invisible ink: Ignore me.
As your mom probably told you: You really don’t get a second chance to 
make a good first impression. Openers count!
Power Phrases to Use Anywhere
After you’ve punched out your openers, keep your cover-letter mojo going as 
you flesh out the middle with paragraphs and lines that strongly emphasize 
your belief in yourself and your strengths.
Should you use a template?
Has this frustration happened to you? Short on 
time, you scout the Web for one of those free 
cover letter templates, fill in the blanks, send it 
off to an employer with your resume, and watch 
your hair turn gray waiting to hear back? What 
went wrong?
Among many things that may have doomed 
your candidacy is the cover letter itself. When 
that happens, the cover letter you sent did not 
adequately distinguish you from the crowd as 
being worthy of the time and cost of interview-
ing you in the flesh.
Interview-generating cover letters are cus-
tomized and persuasive, not perfunctory and 
canned. The communications that open inter-
viewing doors in competitive job markets are 
really sales letters disguised as cover letters. 
The winning ones take time to add zest, energy, 
and marketing muscle.
No advocate of wheel-spinning, I can’t recom-
mend the use of the free cover letter templates 
that are widely available online. They simply 
don’t pack the wallop you need to stand out like 
the only red tulip in a field of yellow tulips.
Nonetheless, some job seekers just can’t get 
started on cover letters without a support 
system. If you’re raising your hand on that one, 
check out Susan Ireland’s Ready-Made Cover 
Letters, (www.susanireland.com). Her 
package of downloadable software is available 
for a fee, offering customizable cover letters for 
a wide range of job seekers. Ireland, a talented 
writer and author of several job search books, 
is a leading cover letter authority.

Don’t be shy about listing qualifications, skills, competencies, accomplishments, 
and achievements. Use numbers wherever you can. If you spot a concept you 
like in the 35 following examples, think of a way to adapt it to your situation. Or

✓ I am particularly well-qualified for your (job title) position, as the 
following highlights illustrate. I would enjoy the opportunity to meet 
with you to explore how I can contribute to your organization.
 
✓ For your convenience, I will keep this letter especially brief. The job

✓ Your position for (job title) strongly appeals to me because (tell why).
 
✓ If our meeting confirms my understanding of your open position for (job

✓ As my resume shows, I have substantial and successful experience in

virtually any employer. However, (company name) is of special interest to 
me because (explain why).

to show you some of the (skills or competencies) that I have developed.

leader in both ___ and ___. When I have the opportunity to meet with you, 
I believe you will agree that you want to use my skills and competencies 
on your watch.
 
✓ What you’re asking for and what I can deliver sound like a match!
 
✓ As one of six siblings, I was born in a team environment and understand 
the payoff of pulling together in an endeavor.
 
✓ During my three years in purchasing with Tidewater Productions, I’ve been 
credited with yearly savings in the $50,000 to $75,000 range. This resulted 
from a combination of skillful negotiation and replacing underperforming 
vendors. Wouldn’t you like me to save money for your company?
 
✓ My experience with women’s health issues, coupled with demonstrated 
successful performance in the offices of medical school clinics, suggests 
that I could make a significant contribution to your practice. Perhaps we 
could meet to more thoroughly explore this possibility.

Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ Because I haven’t yet notified my current employer of my intent to leave, 
I count on your treating this response to your posting with appropriate 
sensitivity. (Employers often prefer to hire employed candidates, rather 
than unemployed candidates.)
 
✓ I am happy with my job and am considered to be a high performer by my 
current employer. Unfortunately, I do not see a path to advancement in the 
foreseeable future. That is why I am contacting you about future openings 
in the (career field or functional area) at (name of organization).
 
✓ One of my friends, Salvador Rondavi, works for your company. He 
recommends that I contact you about a position as a management 
trainee. He is more than satisfied with his work and from what he says, 
I am sure I would like it as well and will do my utmost to win your 
professional praise.
 
✓ Please allow me to highlight some of my accomplishments that are 
relevant to your requirements.
 
✓ Staying current with new technologies and products, and applying those 
that offer improved profit results, is a point of pride for me.
 
✓ As a versatile IT trainer, I bring significant experience and fast-
moving flexibility as new products are introduced to your workforce. 
Additionally, my BA in psychology has given me a useful depth of 
knowledge in successful motivation practices.
 
✓ I am long on effort and enthusiasm, although short on experience. 
Examples of my passion for doing the job well are in references I gained 
as a student from my employers and customers, such as the following 
achievements: (list references).
 
✓ I completed a number of successful projects for the physics department 
in my capacity as student administrative monitor. I believe the knowl-
edge I acquired there would transfer extremely well to your engineering 
department.
 
✓ Jason Luo, my former manager, now retired, complimented me for being 
the hardest working and most reliable assistant he’d had in his 40 years 
in the casino business. He was especially impressed with my (name top 
achievement).
 
✓ As a member of The World Tomorrow Society’s Green Futures Committee, I 
focused on the impact of reusing and recycling waste on various industries, 
including ours. I’d be delighted to share that data with you when we meet 
to explore ways I could be useful to Command Construction.
 
✓ When my last fundraising goal went over the top, I was credited with a 
big slice of its success because I encouraged everyone’s input and buy-
in. My talent for inclusiveness brings in record contributions.
 
✓ I’m proud of a track record that’s tops with managers, clients, and 
coworkers, as this single example from Shelly Kornfield, my former 
supervisor illustrates: “Give the assignment to Pam and you won’t have 
to think about it anymore.”

✓ In my last position, managing an assisted-living facility, I saved 8% of the 
annual budget without compromising care; I would welcome sharing 
the details with you in a meeting to discuss the possibility of my joining 
your well-respected organization.
 
✓ After completing two baccalaureate degrees in just four years, I believe 
that my education, student employment experience, and dedication to 
hard work and problem-solving make me an A-list candidate to join your 
workforce.
 
✓ My senior year’s academic result: A 3.7 GPA with President’s Honors, 
despite my student job requiring 30 hours a week, illustrates that I know 
how to dig in and get the job done.
 
✓ Given my global supply chain experience, I’m confident that we may 
have mutual interests.
 
✓ My recent earnings reflect gains I brought to my employer; with your 
firm’s reputation for paying fair market rate, I’m wide open to discussing 
compensation when we sit down to talk.
 
✓ With my technical skills and understanding of your market, I can step 
into the position and be immediately productive.
 
✓ At my previous position on the East Coast, within two years I received 
praise for playing a key role in raising my branch’s basement ranking for 
customer service (#57 out of 60 stores) to top ranking customer service 
(#3 out of 60 stores) in the nationwide organization.
 
✓ Accustomed to doing more with fewer resources, I can help your firm 
ride out a financial storm in a tight economy. After meeting with me 
and assessing my ability to run a tight ship that sails upright, you may 
decide you can’t afford not to hire me.
 
✓ While I was the fundraising chair for my PTA organization, I planned the 
campaign, wrote the appeal to potential donors, and organized an e-mail 
solicitation tree. The result: We raised $27,000, a 130% increase over the 
previous year.
The power phrases in the preceding list are anchored with accomplishments, 
achievements, skills, the promise of a benefit, or personal characteristics 
that suggest you will be a likeable model of efficiency, making money or 
saving money for your lucky future employer.
 
For the record, I’ve always had trouble separating accomplishments from 
achievements. After looking it up for the zillionth time, I can report that 
accomplishments are extended events — for example, the act of John’s climb-
ing a mountain. Achievements are culminating, instantaneous events — the act 
of John’s reaching the top of the mountain. That’s the long and short of it. Go 
forth and craft statements alive with accomplishments and achievements and 
gain that interview.

Keep Control with an Action Close
After you write a great letter extolling your major match-up for the job you’re 
chasing, maintain momentum with a close that brings you closer to your 
goal: an interview. You have three basic choices: an action close, an action 
close plus, and a no-action close.
Action close
Close your letter by telling the reader when you will call for an interview. 
By setting the agenda, you assure your reader that you will follow up with 
an action step that brings together a competent candidate with a lucky 
employer. An action close says that you’re on the scene to help and will 
contact the employer at a specified time:

 Chapter 6: Great Lines for Success
I’m ready to make money for you and look forward to speaking with 
you personally. I will call you early next week.
Action close plus
Pump up an action close with a suggestion for action sooner rather than 
later — “I’ll call you, but if you’re ready to roll, you can call me right away.”
An action close plus is the best choice for many situations. Your enthusiasm 
suggests that you’re organized and vigorous, but adding a note of urgency by 
inviting an employer to call you may motivate the employer to prioritize the 
interview and move up the timetable for a meeting.
Turning an action close into an action close plus is simple, requiring merely 
one line at the end of the close. The line is “If you would like to meet with me 
sooner, you can reach me at (phone number).”
I’m eager to sit down with you to discuss the contribution I can make 
to ABC Organization as it works to create a regional planning group. 
I’ll follow up with a call next Wednesday. Or, you can reach me imme-
diately on my mobile phone at 888-888-8888. Thank you for your time 
and consideration.
No-action close
A no-action close hands control of the interviewing process over to the 
reader. It essentially says that you’ll sit tight and wait by the phone for an 
employer to call. This is the weakest way to close your cover letter.
A copy of my resume is enclosed for your review and consideration. 
If you have an interest in my background, I would be pleased to hear 
from you.
Letting the employer chase you
A-list job seekers with high-demand skills — 
a rare bunch — can make a case for using a 
no-action close to avoid looking too eager. The 
strategic merit of presenting yourself as so 
attractive a candidate that employers will bust 
their chops to hire you was straightforwardly 
expressed by master yogi Baba Hari Dass: If 
you chase the world, it runs from you. If you run 
from the world, it chases you.
Everybody else: Resume cover letters are a 
form of marketing. Hang onto control of your 
interviewing process by using an action close.

Examples of the Action Closes
You need a competitive edge to get ahead in a competitive market today. 
Here are 16 solid closes to help you score that interview.
 
✓ I look forward to our conversation. I’ll e-mail you in a few days to 
coordinate a time that’s convenient for you.
 
✓ Because e-mail can’t replace face-to-face discussion, I’ll call soon to set 
up an interview.

anticipate discussing my qualifications in an interview. I’ll e-mail you on 
Thursday to validate your interest.
 
✓ I look forward to speaking with you personally to discuss your specific 
needs and my ability to meet them. I’ll call your administrative assistant 
next week to see what time would be most convenient for you.
 
✓ I welcome a personal interview to discuss how my qualifications can 
augment your company’s excellent reputation for purchasing acumen. 
I’ll e-mail you on Tuesday to see whether we can meet.

I’ll contact you next week to talk about this job or other positions where

you may have and, I hope, set up a time convenient to meet in person.
 
✓ Recognizing that you may be difficult to reach, I’ll check with your secretary 
next week to set a convenient time for us to meet. Flexibility is my middle 
name, and I’ll be glad to meet during or outside normal business hours. 
Thanks, and I look forward to meeting with you personally.
 
✓ Thank you for calling me back today. I’m sorry I was not in but will 
telephone you tomorrow to find a convenient time to speak with you on 
the phone and meet you in person.

will allow us to meet. Meeting you will not only be a pleasure but offers 
profitable vistas for both of us. My thanks for your time.

in person? If you need additional facts before arranging an interview, call 
me at 888-888-8888. Otherwise, I’ll e-mail you next week to confirm your

✓ I would like to discuss with you why this position has my name on it, 
and I’ll call you at the beginning of next week to see what your schedule 
allows. Or if you need to reach me sooner, my number is listed above.
 
✓ Perhaps we could meet and jointly explore the many ways I could save 
your organization considerable time and money. I’m flexible on timing 
during business hours or afterwards. I’ll check your availability next 
week.
 
The purpose of your cover letter is to sell an employer on reading your 
resume and being motivated to take your call for an interview or to contact 
you for an interview. Without an interview, you’re unlikely to be offered 
employment. 
P.S. A Final Important Point
Your effort to write a Stand Out letter is time well invested in your future. 
And now for one last cover letter tip that direct marketing writers have 
known for light years — add a P.S. after your signature. And not because 
you’re forgetful.
Adding a P.S. (postscript) to your letter is a spotlighting technique that 
marketers advise. In this usage, the P.S. does not communicate a point that 
you overlooked; instead, it communicates a point that you want to stand out 
and be read. What information can you put in your P.S.? You have two basic 
choices. They are:
When an ad forbids you to call
How can you use an action close in responding 
to a job ad that says “No phone calls” or “Don’t 
call us; we’ll call you if you match a job open-
ing”? Here are a couple of moves to consider in 
writing your cover letter.
 ✓ Substitute e-mail. You can still use an 
action close by changing your promise from 
“I’ll call you” to “I’ll e-mail you.”
 ✓ Play the coincidence card. Send your cover 
letter (with an action close) and resume to 
the company president or hiring manager. 
Don’t mention the ad. The employer’s 
assumption will be that your timing is ser-
endipity — you just happened to apply at 
the same time the company needs some-
one with your assets. The company presi-
dent most likely will forward your material 
to the hiring manager or HR department 
with a note calling attention to you.

Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ Communicate the single most important thing you want an employer to 
remember about you. Dangle a benefit. Here’s an example of dangling a 
benefit:
 
P.S. I’m anxious to tell you how I increased the net profit by 12% for my 
employer in 2008. Let’s talk soon.
 
✓ After your action close (note: not an action close plus) and signature, say 
something to drive the employer to call you first. Here’s an example of 
urging an employer to pick up the phone and check you out:
 
P.S. I would work my heart out to be your best hire of the year. As men-
tioned, I will call you next week, but if you want to visit sooner, my 
cell phone is 999-999-9000.
Great Lines Woo Reluctant Readers
If your cover letter and resume duo fall in a noisy and crowded marketplace 
and no one is paying attention, will it make a sound? Make your words 
clear, concise, and interesting to read, and your message will wake up the 
neighborhood!
Letters that give something to get something
The following illustration of a graduating 
senior’s cover letter to the marketing manager 
of a large private student loan company is a bit 
of a tease. The letter’s promise of a substantial 
benefit — two unpublished survey data points 
and the hint of more later — speaks directly to 
the marketing manager’s need to identify crite-
ria that can attract potential customers to his 
product. All he has to do to gain this benefit is 
agree to meet with the job seeker.
Dear Mr.____:
Students on my campus are scrutinizing private 
education loans with a new intensity following a 
batch of high-profile bad press in recent years.
After becoming aware of their increased cau-
tion while working as an intern in my col-
lege’s financial aid office, I followed up with a 
personal research project surveying 300 stu-
dents about their criteria for choosing a student 
loan provider. The project was the basis of a term 
paper required for my degree in marketing.
Among the marketing conclusions I reached as 
a result of my research project are these two 
points:
(Use a paragraph to describe each of the two 
points).
I hope you will find this information useful, 
Mr. ___, and also will consider me for your 
next marketing associate position. To make 
that decision, you’ll need to know more about 
my background and abilities; my resume is 
attached. I’ll call you Thursday morning to set 
up an interview. Many thanks.

▶ Adding muscle to your cover letters with skills language 
▶ Highlighting skills that people will pay you to use
▶ Transferring crossover skills to ease job changing
A
re skills central to driving your workplace wins? Short answer: Don’t 
let your cover letters (and resumes) leave home without them. As you 
read this chapter, forget about being a grammar snoot; instead, laser your 
attention like a sci-fi ray gun on your developed abilities.
No matter which niche you occupy in the workplace — technician or green-
collar worker, professional or manager — mastering skills you can use, and 
skills that employers are willing to pay you to use, translates to a wonderful 
employment insurance policy, a giant umbrella to keep you from getting 
soaked when economic thunderstorms rain on your parade.
 
Learning how to identify your skills and to believably write and talk about 
them will be transformative to your job hunt. The payoff is moving from the 
crowd to the choice. This chapter shows you how to do that, beginning with 
the way skills are classified.
Decoding the Skills Lineup
I’m the first to admit that the classification of skills, like beauty, is in the eye 
of the beholder. But we have to start somewhere, so based on government 
and academic classification systems, here’s a no-frills framework that will 
guide you through the thicket of workplace skills.
 
One of the noun terms you often find in a discussion of job requirements is 
skill set. If you’ve wondered what it means, here’s a simple definition: A skill 
set means the skills needed to accomplish a specified task or perform a given 
function.

Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
Foundation skills
The foundation skills are appropriate for everyone’s skill DNA. They are 
organized into four groups: basic, people, thinking, and personal qualities.
Basic skills
When you have basic skills, you can read, write, perform arithmetic and 
mathematical operations, listen, and speak.
 
✓ Reading: You can locate, understand, and interpret written information 
such as manuals, graphs, and schedules.
 
✓ Writing: You can communicate thoughts, ideas, information, and 
messages in writing and create documents such as letters, directions, 
manuals, reports, graphs, and flow charts.
 
✓ Arithmetic/mathematics: You can perform basic computations and 
approach practical problems by choosing appropriately from a variety 
of mathematical techniques.
 
✓ Listening: You receive, attend to, interpret, and respond to verbal 
messages and other cues.
 
✓ Speaking: You organize ideas and communicate orally.
You have skills because . . .
Here are four springboards for writing and 
speaking of your skills. You can infer your skills 
based on history, simply assert your skills, refer 
to others who identified your skills, or be tested 
by professional bodies.
 ✓ Inference. Your prior education and experi-
ence suggest your skills.
 
 With my degree in civil engineering, I am 
competent to design bridges.
 ✓ Assertion. You claim you have skills.
 
 I can design and sell a program of services 
to the Spanish-speaking market.
 ✓ References. Others act on your behalf to 
claim skills.
 
 My former manager, Carlyle Sangi, says I 
put together a budget better than anyone 
she knows.
 ✓ Certification. Testing and peer evaluation 
document your skills.
 
 As a certified industrial ergonomist, I can 
evaluate your workplace and make required 
changes to conform to new OSHA rules.

93
 Chapter 7: Job Seeker’s Skills Finder
People skills
These are the skills that allow the “wonder of you” to mesh well with others. 
They include social, negotiation, leadership, teamwork, and cultural diversity.
 
✓ Social: You respect the feelings of others, assert yourself when 
appropriate, and take an interest in what others say and why they think 
and act as they do.
 
✓ Negotiation: You present the facts and arguments of your position and 
listen to and understand the other party’s position, create possible ways 
to resolve conflict, and make reasonable compromises.
 
✓ Leadership: You communicate thoughts and feelings to justify the 
position you champion, encourage or convince others, and motivate 
people to believe in and trust you.
 
✓ Teamwork: You work cooperatively with others, contribute ideas and 
effort, and do your share of the work. 
 
✓ Cultural diversity: You work well with people who have different ethnic, 
social, or educational backgrounds.
Thinking skills
These skills enable you to think creatively, make decisions, solve problems, 
visualize, and know how to learn and reason.
 
✓ Creative thinking: You generate new ideas.
 
✓ Decision making: You have the ability to specify goals and understand 
reasons not to do something.
 
✓ Problem solving: You can recognize a problem and devise a plan of 
action to deal with it.
 
✓ Visualizing: You can picture symbols and organize them in your 
mind’s eye.
 
✓ Knowing how to learn: You are able to use efficient learning techniques 
to acquire and apply new knowledge and skills.
 
✓ Reasoning: You concentrate on discovering a rule or principle underlying 
the relationship between two or more objects and then apply it to solve a 
problem.
Personal qualities
Classified as skills, these personal qualities include responsibility, self-
esteem, sociability, self-management, integrity, and honesty.

94
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
 
✓ Responsibility: You put forth a high level of effort and persevere toward 
reaching your goal.
 
✓ Self-esteem: You believe in your own self-worth and maintain a positive 
view of yourself.
 
✓ Sociability: You show understanding, friendliness, adaptability, 
empathy, and politeness in group settings.
 
✓ Self-management: You have a realistic view of your knowledge and skills, 
set realistic personal goals, and monitor progress toward those goals.
Where There’s a Skill, There’s a Way
The foundation skills group isn’t the end of the story. Other groups of skills 
are identified by whether they have market value to employers (marketable 
skills), can be carried around like a mobile phone from one employer to 
another (crossover skills), or are super-glued to a specific type of work or 
workplace (job-related skills). Still another term describes skills you’re really 
good at because you love using them (motivated skills).
 
✓ Marketable skills: Simply stated, marketable skills are those that an 
employer will pay you to use. They’re often identified in job ads. By 
contrast, unmarketable skills are those that no one is likely to pay you to 
use — the ability to bounce for a mile on a pogo stick, for example. Also 
unmarketable or barely marketable: obsolete skills.
 
✓ Crossover skills: You may have heard these skills referred to as transfer-
rable skills. To my ear, crossover is a more modern term. Crossover skills 
are portable skills that you can use in a wide variety of jobs.
 
 For example, employers value communications skills in positions ranging 
from apple grower to zookeeper. You can transfer these skills from job 
to job, industry to industry, or even from one career field to another. I 
illustrate with a checklist of selected crossover skills in the next section.
 
✓ Job-related skills: Job-related skills are also called technical or professional 
skills. Because they’re suitable for a particular type of job, they assure an 
employer that you can actually do the job. You can’t always move job-
related skills from one employer to another, but sometimes you can. (To 
gauge mobility, ask yourself: “Who would pay me to use this skill?”)
 
 Three examples of job-related skills: The ability to use a certain brand of 
mold-injection machine; the ability to perform cataract eye surgery; and 
the ability to spot cheating players in a casino.
 
✓ Motivated skills: “Do something you’d do for nothing” is the theme 
song of motivated skills. These are the developed abilities that you 
enjoy doing. Describing a motivated skill in a cover letter is a subtle way 
of saying you’ll excel at a specific assignment: One of my motivated skills 
is ____.

 Chapter 7: Job Seeker’s Skills Finder
Speaking Out about Your Skills
Because spelling out your skills adds substance to your claims of being able 
to put more money in a company’s bank account than it will spend to employ 
you, I’ve compiled a couple of checklists to help you claim those you own.
Read through the following checklist of foundation skills and the checklist 
of crossover skills. Mark the words and terms that truthfully apply to you. 
Include the terms as part of your skills language to use for job search docu-
ments and job interviews. 
 
Speaking of interviews, when you claim ownership of a specific skill, be pre-
pared in interviews to give a brief example of how you used that skill and its 
benefits. If you’re asked and all you can come up with on the spot is babble, 
the interviewer will think you’re an inventor, but not the good kind.
While these checklists aren’t exhaustive, they’re a good start; you may think 
of other words and terms to use as well. 
Understanding competencies versus skills
Competencies, which are also sometimes called 
success factors, key characteristics, or behav-
iors, go deeper than skills, according to one 
definition. A competency is a relatively endur-
ing characteristic that makes possible superior 
performance in a particular job or role.
In brief, a competency is the X-factor in why 
of two equally skilled employees in the same 
company, one hits a home run and another hits 
a double.
Competency recruiting is an evolving human 
resource management concept. Study corpo-
rate Web sites and determine whether com-
petency recruiting is the policy at your target 
company. If so, analyze the position you want 
and develop statements for each competency 
it requires. If a company is looking for a can-
didate who has shown “creative leadership,” 
for example, write examples of when you’ve 
demonstrated such behavior. Explain how 
you did it, distinguishing yourself as a top per-
former.
As I say in my book, Job Interviews For 
Dummies, 3rd Edition, in today’s world, “The 
operative words are skills (what you can do) 
and, increasingly a newer and broader employ-
ment concept termed competencies (how well 
you do what you do using natural talents). The 
competencies concept includes skills and such 
related characteristics and natural abilities as 
motivation, industriousness, and attitudes.”
The competency program looks at the whole 
package as it relates to the job the employer 
wants done. If a company’s Web site or recruit-
ment materials mention competencies, you 
mention competencies in your cover letter. If 
not, don’t refer to competencies but stick to 
skills.

You can track down more specific skill words in three main ways:
 
✓ Search job ads in print and online. Pay particular attention to each job’s 
requirements.
 
✓ Search online for “sample job descriptions.” You may have to surf a 
large number of sites because each typically offers only a half-dozen 
occupations.
 
✓ Go to a Department of Labor Web site, O’Net Code Connector, www.
onetcodeconnector.org, where you see the skills required for an 
occupation of interest. The skills are called “Detailed Work Activities.”
No frills, just skills
Define your skills and what you bring to a new 
job. When prospecting for your skills, review 
your last job or college post and think about 
these issues:
 ✓ What did you do?
 ✓ What did you direct others to do?
 ✓ What did you manage, create, approve, or 
instigate?
 ✓ What was the outcome of your actions?
 ✓ More profits? (How much?)
 ✓ More revenue? (How much?)
 ✓ More savings (how much can you claim?)
 ✓ More accounts (How many? What are they 
worth?)

Popular Skills that Employers Want
After pinpointing the skills that sell your value, how do you know which of 
those most help you stand out from the crowd?
 
A roundup of several surveys suggests skills and qualities that employers 
often admire. The following list is representative but not comprehensive.
 
✓ Effective communication: Employers seek candidates who can listen to 
instructions and act on those instructions with minimal guidance. They 
want employees who speak, write, and listen effectively, organize their 
thoughts logically, and explain everything clearly.
 
✓ Computer and technical literacy: Almost all jobs now require an 
understanding, ranging from basic to advanced, of computer software, 
word processing, e-mail, spreadsheets, and Internet navigation.
 
✓ Problem-solving/Creativity: Employers always want people who can 
get them out of a pickle. Problem-solving ability can aid you with making 
transactions, processing data, formulating a vision, and reaching a 
resolution. Employers need the assurance that you can conquer job 
challenges by thinking critically and creatively.
 
✓ Interpersonal abilities: Relationship-building and relationship-
management are high priorities with many employers. These skills 
confirm that a candidate can relate well to others, both co-workers and 
customers.
 
✓ Teamwork skills: The ability to work well with others while pursuing 
a common goal is a long-running favorite of employers. But so is the 
ability to work with minor supervision.
 
✓ Diversity sensitivity: In today’s world, cultural sensitivity and ability to 
build rapport with others in a multicultural environment is highly valued 
by employers.
 
✓ Planning and organizing: Workplace life requires prioritizing and 
organizing information. Employers value people who, metaphorically, 
dig a well before they’re thirsty.
 
✓ Leadership and management: Leadership consists of a strong sense 
of self, confidence, and a comprehensive knowledge of company goals. 
These are qualities that motivate and inspire, providing a solid foundation 
for teamwork.
Year after year, in survey after survey, employers continue to look for 
assurances that you can in some way either make money for them or save 
money for them. If the employer is a nonprofit organization, generally you 
should substitute the skills you can bring to bear on helping the organization 
fulfill its mission (unless the mission requires selling products to earn 
money). Skills useful in saving money are universally desired, including by 
the nonprofits.

107
 Chapter 7: Job Seeker’s Skills Finder
Personal Qualities That Employers Want
In the Great American Skills Sorting, some list-makers mix in personal values, 
personality traits, and personal characteristics with skills — and that’s okay 
with me. But I’ve made a second list focusing on a few personal qualities that 
employers rate highly.
 
✓ Adaptability and flexibility: Nearly half of employers in a recent survey 
gave a high rating to “openness to new ideas and concepts.” They also like 
candidates who can work independently or as part of a team, changing 
gears when required, whether multitasking or adapting working hours and 
locale.
 
✓ Professionalism and work ethic: Employers seek productive workers 
with positive work ethics who stick with challenges until they meet 
them.
 
✓ Positive attitude and energy: The last to be picked and promoted 
are candidates who show gloomy outlooks and emotional immaturity. 
Exhibit a sunny outlook and energetic, organized behavior.
 
Everyone wants to hire a paragon of virtue, a model of excellence and perfection. 
Don’t overlook adding your personal qualities — and the behaviors they drive — 
where appropriate when composing your job-search correspondence.
Give Serious Thought to Certifications
A professional certification can be a kind of passport, identifying you as 
a citizen of a career field with all its rank and privilege. In other words, 
professional credentialing is one way to document your ownership of the 
skills you claim.
Not all credentials are worthy. A credential is worth the effort only if it has 
industry recognition and respect.
Crash course on certification
Differences in certification exist, but for ease of communication, I include 
other terms of validation such as registered, accredited, chartered, qualified, 
and diplomate, as well as certified. Whether the professional designation 
carries statutory clout or is voluntary, common elements include professional 
experience, often between two and ten years, sometimes reduced by education. 
Education standards are included, which may call for minimum levels of both 
academic and professional education.

108
Part II: Creating Compelling Communications 
Certification examinations are uninviting to many professionals; generally, 
they require time-consuming study and may include both experience-based 
knowledge acquired working in the field, and curriculum-based knowledge 
gained by assigned learning texts.
What’s certification worth?
Is certification worth your effort?
Certification has strong appeal in your early career — say, the first 12 to 15 
years — as a technique to control your earnings environment. But in business, 
certifications lose their luster at the vice-presidential level and above. Why? 
Certifications zero in on specific skills, while top managers are more concerned 
with the big picture. For consulting, medicine, law, and technology careers, 
professional certifications never lose their punch, especially for those who 
hope to work internationally. Continuing education may be required to keep 
them updated and active.
The credential may be a license awarded by a state board, such as the familiar 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA), or a voluntary program sponsored by a 
professional organization, such as the Accredited in Public Relations (APR) 
designation awarded by the Public Relations Society of America.
 Because a given professional certification may not carry stripes for your 
sleeve, much less stars for your shoulder, investigate first! Clues to look for 
include the following: 
 
✓ Do recruitment ads call for the professional designation? Do trade 
publications mention it? What do practitioners in your field advise?
 
✓ As you change jobs more often, certification can be a kind of passport. It 
shows that you’re a player in your field’s global body of knowledge and 
that you have documented standards and achievements.
 
✓ Certification can be very helpful if you become sidetracked into too 
narrow a specialty or stagnate in a company with antiquated technologies 
or find yourself boxed in by a hostile boss. The boss can still claim that 
you lack interpersonal abilities, but a professional designation leaves little 
room to say you’re short on job-related technical skills.
 
✓ You may earn more money by going the certified route. A study of 
project managers reveals that those with a PMP (Project Management 
Professional) designation with seven years’ experience annually earn 
$7,000 more than non-certified project managers, a differential that adds 
up to serious money over the years.

Good Luck on the Great Skills Search
When you’re really stumped on naming specific skills that make you stand 
out and need more help than this chapter or your informal efforts provide, 
the Internet beckons: Call forth the genie of Google and type “discover your 
skills.” More than 625,000 resources are yours to command.
You can’t beg off identifying your skills when writing cover letters and other 
job search documents. Every employer looks for the skill sets a candidate 
offers.
Shopping for skills 
Small businesses are creating most of the 
new jobs. But small companies have fewer 
resources to use in training new hires. That 
means that for most jobs, you’re pretty much on 
your own to acquire the skills you need.
Large companies, although offering fewer 
jobs in the aggregate, are still the best places 
to work to acquire up-to-date skills you can 
market on future jobs.

nswering a print or online job ad is a nearly universal experience, but 
the right reply is far from universal. That’s why this chapter contains 
30 samples — more than any other chapter in this guide. All were written 
by successful professional cover letter writers who, of course, also write 
resumes and other outstanding job letter documents; this book’s appendix 
contains contact information for each writer.
These pages hold something for everyone — from new graduate to mid-
career professional to seasoned executive.
 
Read the excellent assortment of occupations and the interesting variety of 
styles with an eye toward mixing and matching design and marketing elements 
from one to another. Because the samples range from conservative to forward-
leaning, use your judgment in deciding which style best fits your target indus-
try and your personality.
Read all 30 samples and you find a wide range of techniques that snag an 
employer’s interest and hold it all the way to an interview.
Watch for Smooth Moves
The following sections give you the scoop on what’s great about the upcoming 
samples, as well as ideas for putting them to work in your own reply letters.

Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
Magic connectors
Candidates who document point for point their capacity to accomplish what 
the employer wants done are rewarded with interviews. Several samples 
illustrate the visual power of directly connecting job requirements with can-
didate qualifications:
 
✓ A satellite operations manager (Bell) jumps right in with a comment that 
she’s a match. The candidate calls attention to her status of qualified 
candidate in a vertical treatment. A “You require” list appears on the left 
side of the page. An “I offer” response appears directly across the page 
on the right.
 
✓ A diversity development director (Fuller) also uses the left/right design 
to good effect, concluding with a recommendation from an employer.
 
✓ Alternatively, an innovative quality control manager (Edwards) chose 
a horizontal requirements-qualifications matching design, using “Your 
Requirements” immediately followed by “My Supporting Qualifications.”
 
✓ A CPA (Kelham) answers an ad for a controller in a nonprofit organiza-
tion, citing a match between the organization’s requirements and his 
qualifications. He titles each of the six matches with a boldfaced head-
line and also bolds the position’s title in the Regarding space.
P.S. winners
Observe the use of a postscript to prod contact by directing attention to a 
super selling point or a potential benefit to an employer. This old marketing 
copywriter’s trick animates letters and hijacks attention, as you see in the fol-
lowing examples:
 
✓ A candidate who lacks gaming industry experience but is targeting a 
gaming position in Latin America (Dawson) uses a P.S. to keep him in the 
running. (Can you guess what it is?) 
 
✓ Using a postscript for emphasis, a collections coordinator hopeful 
(Johnson) offers employers insider knowledge when they call her.
Fast starters
Opening a letter with pizzazz (Chapter 6) contributes enormous value to its 
successful journey through screening activities.
For example, a Red Cross emergency manager (Horton) opens his cover 
letter with the intensity of a crime novel — “I don’t scare easily.” He names 
his areas of expertise and skills that make interviewing him essential.

115
 Chapter 8: Job Ad Reply Letters
Praise starters
Note how some samples presell the candidate by leading off with praise from 
others at the top of the letter or in a right-hand column. A part-time, tem-
porary instructor candidate (Young) uses quotations from previous perfor-
mance evaluations to great effect.
To a lesser degree, a potential assistant manager of visual merchandising 
(Lawrence) praises by saying she hopes to join a “successful, innovative, 
and best-in-class company.” What hiring manager doesn’t want to be part of 
a best-in-class company? What hiring manager doesn’t want to interview a 
person who has such obvious admiration for his team?
We like people who like us. When a candidate sets the stage with sincere 
expressions of regard and honor, employers are more likely to return the 
favor with an interview.
Design arts
Some applicant software systems have trouble handling creative formats (see 
Chapter 11). Even so, some designs are so attractive, they’re tough to ignore.
A sales manager (Shields) makes a wise choice of a design that virtually guar-
antees a stop-what-you’re-doing-and-read-this reaction. Using two columns 
and a vertical rule, the cover letter effectively overviews his value proposi-
tion: broad experience, commitment to excellence, excellent communica-
tions, and strategic planning.
Looks count in attracting attention in all media, including career management 
documents.
Chart champs
Notice the high impact of unexpected visual design features, such as charts 
and graphs:
 
✓ A sales professional (Morrison) dramatically uses a graph to illustrate 
how his sales nearly doubled in one quarter!
 
✓ Another sales professional (Botkin) uses a twist: He incorporates the 
Sales Skills Index, an independent evaluation of skills needed to succeed 
in the sales environment.

116
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
Charts most commonly are used to dramatize sales specialties, but they can 
be used in any occupation to highlight measurable accomplishments and 
achievements. 
Attention grabbers
Spot the samples’ use of bold typefaces, italics, and underscoring to highlight 
some combination of 
 
✓ The position sought
 
✓ Accomplishments and achievements
 
✓ Skills and personal characteristics
 
✓ Special benefits, such as security clearances and fluency in more than 
one language
Calling tasteful graphic attention to factors that cause employers to pay seri-
ous attention to you is a trend to consider. Look to the following examples 
for inspiration:
 
✓ An administrative assistant (Lake) uses a boldfaced headline to brand 
herself — “Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” — and 
then successfully ties the quote to her desire to enthusiastically do her 
very best.
 
✓ A senior executive (Connor) literally underscores his interest in becom-
ing a chief operating officer, following with a foxy quiz that asks yes or 
no questions (each yes answer describes one of the candidate’s attrac-
tive qualities). He states that he’ll consider relocation, an attitude that 
recruiters like.
 
✓ Applying to become the director of instructional technology 
(Huntington-Woods) for a school district, the candidate chooses bold-
face type to identify the position she seeks and her qualifying credential, 
a recently earned master’s degree in educational technology.
 
✓ A sales executive (Turner) hopes that an emphasis in boldface type 
sparks subliminal connecting (like coffee and cream) of the name of the 
company and the title she seeks, melding the two parts into one image 
describing her as “ABC Coffee Company Senior Account Executive.”
 
✓ A retail manager (Moran) pops three achievements into a simple ruled 
box where they can’t be missed, an eyes-on move.
 
✓ A sales representative (Masters) combines boldfaced type with a ruled 
box of his favorable ranking in the Sales Skills Index. His opening para-
graph also wins hearts and minds of hiring managers.

117
 Chapter 8: Job Ad Reply Letters
 
✓ An accomplished CEO and executive consultant (Luther) makes an end 
run around the human resources department by pretending not to know 
of a current search for a new chief executive when he writes directly to 
the prospective employing firm’s board chairman. After suggesting they 
talk, Luther’s letter throws out the bait in boldfaced type, positioning 
Luther as a visionary who has revolutionized an industry. 
 
✓ A teacher (Richards) used boldfaced type to identify exactly what she 
seeks — K-8 Teaching Position — in the Regarding space so that busy 
screeners place her paperwork in the right stack to be examined.
 
✓ An “unretirement” candidate (Simmons) responding to an ad for a main-
tenance technician adroitly puts his motto in italics: “You can count on 
me!” as well as his command of systems and equipment. Inspired!
 
✓ A candidate (Jackson) applying to return to federal service as a civilian 
Navy employee uses boldface to identify the lodging facility manage-
ment job and to clearly state that he knows how to operate a luxury 
brand hotel, which is what the job is about.
 
✓ A globally minded marketing executive (Smithson) lays out impressive 
credentials, scoring a direct benefit with boldfaced emphasis on his mul-
tilingual skills in Japanese and Italian. Smithson can be irresistible to an 
internationally focused corporation.
 
✓ A new graduate hoping to break into a money career as a financial ana-
lyst in the investment industry (Nelson) wisely boldfaces his key quali-
fications. (If the job market worsens in banking, investment, insurance, 
and financial services, cover letters for these industries are likely to 
become even more sales-oriented and less conservative.)
Memorable storytellers
Simply being remembered as a qualified individual among faceless hoards of 
applicants is a big threshold to cross. A memorable story helps employers 
recall individuals when deciding who to interview. Notice the humanizing 
touches that bring readers closer to good feelings about unknown candidates:
 
✓ A new graduate competing for a position as an occupational therapy 
assistant (Yates) begins her occupational story at the beginning when 
she was a Candy Striper. The reader thinks “What a nice, thoughtful 
person.” 
 
✓ A competitor for a manufacturing production supervisor position who 
is relocating to Florida (Jacobs) begins his letter with an unusual tale 
of an emergency repair of a professional race car. If the interviewer is a 
NASCAR fan, Jacobs is on track for an interview.

Blue standard-bearers
Job search documents, including cover letters and resumes, are increasingly 
welcomed by employers of installation, maintenance, repair, construction, 
and production workers. Plenty of people continue to get jobs without self-
marketing documents, but why not get an edge for the best jobs by using 
every available tool? 
An industrial electrician (Macdonald) offers a well-written, no-frills cover 
letter that cuts to the core of his competencies, skills, and experience for the 
job he seeks. He also helps the reader by identifying the position title, and 
where and when the job ad appeared.
Employers of blue-collar workers seek reliable workers, a trait to feature in 
addition to skills.
Internal achievers
Unless hiring for a position is predetermined (the fix is in), moving up or to 
a new location within the same organization requires the same level of excel-
lent self-marketing messaging as that of an application to a new firm. Take 
notice of how a good marketing letter flows to open new doors in the same 
organization.
A client turned case manager turned candidate for workshop specialist 
(Jones) explains with clarity and in detail why she qualifies for the new 
assignment.
Main points
Pay attention to samples that show the wisdom of getting to the heart of the 
matter. What is the one factor that, if missing, kills interest in the candidate? 
Look for the following examples:
 
✓ Pharmaceutical sales professional (Marquez) emphasizes in boldface 
and underscoring the most important element of the position: the can-
didate’s ability to promote drug products by effectively working with 
physicians.
 
✓ A social worker (Berry) makes a beeline for a program director position 
by emphasizing how she meets the job’s essential requirements: senior 
social work management experience, family dynamics experience, and a 
strong clinical and academic background. Spot on!
Always try to pinpoint the make-or-break factor in a hiring decision and nail it.

119
 Chapter 8: Job Ad Reply Letters
Feast Your Eyes
As a last reminder before you read the samples, take note that name is the 
game in tempting the intended to read your letter. Yes, there are exceptions 
when you must use a generic title (such as Dear Hiring Manager) because you 
simply can’t uncover the hiring names in a committee structure, or the name 
of the hiring authority is guarded like a state secret. In the sample letters that 
follow, I sometimes sacrifice the formal inside address with a name and per-
sonal salutation to devote adequate space to making the letter easy to read.
For a pool of some of the zippiest and most enterprising cover letters ever, 
turn the page and begin reading samples here and continue through Chapter 
12. A professional treat awaits you. In my opinion, communications like these 
promise to change the face of job letters forever, leaving old-school messages 
behind yesterday’s hill.
 
Maximum message readability is the presentation criterion for each sample 
cover letter in this chapter. To save space in some superb but lengthier 
samples, I had to chop the original boilerplate text leading into the letter — 
most often deleting the recipient’s name, title, company and address. So when 
you see a letter leading off with “[Date, inside address, salutation],” or some 
variation of that, the generic line is merely a reminder that you can’t just say 
“Hey you, read this!” If you’re not sure how to layout your cover letter, turn to 
Chapter 4.
Classy models and bell-ringing closes
Be aware of traditional samples that speak 
softly but carry a big carrot. Lacking graphic 
bells and whistles, such samples depend solely 
on strong writing and the market value of the 
candidate’s background. 
Don’t overlook samples that showcase an action 
close (See Chapter 6). A promise to follow up 
positions you to pursue the job on your timeta-
ble, rather than forcing you to merely bide your 
time and hope for the call.

Dear Mr. Simmons:
If you could design the best Chief Operating Officer for TopLine, would the following meet 
your toughest specs?
 A senior executive with a solid track record in industries from multinational advertising 
and staffing to specialty manufacturing to private equity management
 A recognized expert in the hard practicalities of harnessing advanced learning to lowered       
costs and better products simultaneously
 A mentor with a passion for having others think of his convincing suggestions as their 
own good ideas
 A leader known for skill in transforming mind-numbing cubicles into prosperous 
communities
You have just read the “Readers’ Digest” version of my resume. You’ll find the details on the next 
pages. That document may not look like others you’ve seen. I thought you deserved to see, right at 
the top of the first page, six profit-building capabilities I want to put at TopLine’s disposal at once. 
Backing them up are a dozen examples of companies revitalized, costs cut, profits expanded ⎯ all 
by inspiring people to use abilities they didn’t think they had.
My company values my contributions. And I love helping companies of all kinds reach sustainable 
success. Now, however, I want to make a longer commitment to just one company, free of 
distractions from other projects. 
I thrive when I can listen to CEOs’ specific concerns. Perhaps a good next step is to hear about 
TopLine’s special needs in your own words. May I call in a few days to arrange a time to do just 
that?
Sincerely,
Martin Conner

I put the bottom lines at the top of this letter because I think Arista deserves that kind of 
performance from your next Retail Manager. If you agree, I’d like to explore being that 
newest member of your team.
To make the hiring decision as easy as possible for you, I’ve tailored my resume to your

like to put at Arista’s disposal at once. Backing them up are 11 contributions I’ve made

beyond just solving problems in my store. I share what I learn with every store in our 
district.
But any resume, no matter how well customized to your needs, is no substitute for 
people speaking with people. That’s why I’d like to call in a few days to hear about 
your special retail store management requirements in your own words.

RE: K-8 Teaching Position
Director of Human Resources

Dear Mr. Simmons:
I am a recent graduate of Monmouth University and I am certified to teach Elementary School with a 
specialization in English for grades 5 through 8.
An educator at heart with a love for children, I worked at a cooperative learning center for special needs 
children years before entering Monmouth University.  It was there that I gained real world experience in 
teaching each individual child, tweaking and modifying lessons, projects, and classrooms however 
necessary to reach every student.  Most recently, I developed and implemented lesson plans using different 
learning and behavioral strategies to address all levels of learning readiness for grades first, second, and 
seventh during my Monmouth University teaching internships.  Through this experience, I have developed 
the skills not only to instruct, but also to motivate.
My most recent position as a Public Safety Dispatcher for the Marlboro Police Department speaks to my 
character, work ethic, and exceptional ability to communicate.  The school district can be assured of my 
morals and attention to safety and security, and I can be relied upon to handle any crisis in a level-headed, 
effective manner.  Furthermore, I am Red Cross–certified in CPR and first aid. 
In addition to my resume, I have enclosed letters of recommendation and a favorite lesson plan.  I hope that 
these documents will give you a sense of what I can offer East Brunswick Public Schools. 
I will call your office next week to confirm that I have completed all required application steps and to 
inquire about the selection and interview processes.  I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you to 
further discuss how I can contribute to East Brunswick schools and the education of your students.

between your requirements and my qualifications. Specifically, they are:
 Accounting degree. My Master’s courses (Business Law, Business Management, Federal

to 165,000 members.
 Experience in an organization with multiple entities. Financial management and 
controllership experience for up to 900 local affiliates (US, Canada, and Mexico) and

management and reporting with your organization. My salary requirements are negotiable; I would be happy 
to discuss them when interviewed. May we talk soon? I’ll call you next week. If you prefer to speak to me

Although I decided to retire at a young age, I have come to realize that I have too much

Therefore, your ad for a maintenance technician caught my attention, as I offer the 
key qualifications your company needs.
Specifically, I have an excellent performance record in the operation and maintenance of

pneumatic, electro-mechanical, and hydraulics. I am also knowledgeable of state building 
codes, safety, and other regulatory guidelines. 
My expertise encompasses multi-site facilities oversight, staff supervision, project 
management, and vendor relations. Examples of relevant accomplishments include 
reduction in annual maintenance costs and improved functional capabilities while 
consistently delivering quality service.
Equally important are my planning, organization, and communication strengths. 
Despite the challenges that can often be encountered, I have completed projects on time 
and under budget on a consistent basis. I would welcome a personal interview to 
discuss the value I would add to your company. My resume is enclosed.

Your request for a multi-lingual, Latin American expert to "build out"

It isn't often that that one has the opportunity to take years of

Dear Ms. Worth: 
I want you to get the credit for adding ROI to the TopLine sales team. Specifically, I’d 
like to become your newest sales professional. And, perhaps the best way to link those 
two ideas is with this graph that shows how I’m performing right now. 
What I do isn’t magic. I just work harder and 
smarter than my competition by finding some 
profitable way to say “yes” to every customer and 
potential customer.  
My focus on your sales needs starts on the next 
pages. I wanted you to see a resume that offers 
more than the usual recitations of job titles and 
responsibilities. That’s why you’ll find six 
capabilities I want to put at TopLine’s disposal at 
once. Backing them up are a dozen examples of 
those capabilities in action. 
My company values what I do. And, if I thought our market was growing as fast as
yours, I would stay with them. While I cannot control market conditions, I am 
interested in making even greater contributions to my employer. That’s why I’m 
“testing the waters” with this confidential application. 
I do best using the consultative approach to sales. So, as a first step, I’d like to hear 
about TopLine’s sales needs in your own words. May I call in a few days to arrange 
time to do that?

It is with great enthusiasm that I apply for your advertised position of Sales Representative.  Count 
me in because my skills are a finely tuned match for your requirements!
In fact, my combination of sales experience and relationship selling skills has given me the 
opportunity to exceed sales expectations, grow market share, outdistance the competition, and 
establish a strong foundation for future revenue growth. Two selected accomplishments 
documenting my qualifications are:
■ Trusting, win-win relationships with customers and suppliers, including Coca-Cola, 
Pepsi, McLane, Wal-Mart, Owens-Corning, and other partner companies
■ Consistent, year-over-year pattern of increasing revenues through robust and 
downturn economies, from $50,000 to $1.2 million as illustrated below:
Sales is about making connections ⎯ between customer and product, between product and its 
benefits, and between sales associates and customers. Because I position myself as a consultant to 
my customers, I am able to gain their trust, make these connections, and pave the way for 
increased sales as a result.
My resume provides you with specific details of my qualifications, but a personal interview will more 
fully reveal my positive attitude and potential to assist you in making your numbers ⎯ make that 
exceeding your numbers!
You may want to reach me first on my cell phone, 806-555-0112, but I plan to call you on Thursday 
afternoon to see if we can set a time to sit down and chat. I’ve done my research on your 
company, and it’s a beacon in the industry. Thank you, Mr. Rockford, for considering adding me to 
your sales wish team.
Sincerely,
Dan J. Botkin

Dear Mr. Burgess: 
 
From the time I was a Candy Striper back in high school, I’ve always been passionate 
about helping people. Just two years ago, I realized I could best be of service by pursuing a 
career in occupational therapy.     
 
I was awarded my Occupational Therapist Assistant degree this May at Keiser University 
where I was an “A” student, and on the honor role and dean’s list each quarter. 
 
Additionally, I gained valuable experience while interning at Medical South, LLC, and 
Health Consultants, Inc.      
 
Working my way through my occupational therapy training, I enjoyed my experiences as a 
swim instructor, waitress, and teacher. Whether someone is pre-school age, a senior 
citizen, or somewhere in between, I find I’m easily able to find common ground.   
 
Working with patients, I’ve learned the special importance of bringing someone out of a 
shell because “spirit equals outcome.”  
 
I’m very excited about starting my new career in occupational therapy and am completely 
focused on providing the best possible patient service. I’m known for being organized and 
always eager to learn.     
 
If you believe, like I do, that my qualifications and experiences are of value to Wellness 
Inc., I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you. I’m enclosing my resume and 
references for your review. 
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I will follow up next week. 
 
Sincerely yours,

The position of Workshop Specialist requires consummate skill in thinking on one’s feet, facilitating

appropriate) with diverse populations, and exercising resourceful time-management proficiency.  
 
I have these skills and more. As the Workshop Specialist at Careers R Us of Marblehead, I would

guidance, and resources to career center clients. This first-hand experience has given me the in-
depth opportunity to understand client needs and challenges, and to view their job search situations 
holistically. The knowledge and skills I've gained in this position I believe make me an ideal 
candidate for the Workshop Specialist position. 
 
My background includes:  
  Facilitating multiple workshops and counseling customers within a career  
center setting;  
  Designing and copyediting newsletters and books in a deadline-driven environment; 
  Counseling adults in a weight-loss clinic setting—a position requiring an abundant 
amount of tact and sensitivity; 
  Managing a thriving real estate agency where, among other tasks, I wrote weekly  
ad copy to get customers in the door; and  
  Teaching junior high school English in a diverse, urban setting.

Chapter 9
Broadcast and Prospecting Letters
In This Chapter
▶ Feasting on a bountiful bevy of topnotch direct-mail letters
▶ Understanding techniques that make specific letters perform
▶ Questioning whether to mail, e-mail, or hand deliver
B
roadcast and prospecting letters are direct mail that’s designed to 
uncover an opportunity in the hidden (unadvertised) job market; 
they’re high-class versions of advertising flyers. When these letters are 
boring, trite, or mediocre and sent indiscriminately to a generic mailing list, 
they’re treated as flyers and discarded without a thought.
On the other hand, direct mail done right can hit the jackpot, says John 
Lucht, career management guru and author of Rites of Passage at $100,000 
to $1 Million+ (Viceroy Press): “If you send a highly persuasive letter and 
resume that arrive with perfect (though accidental) timing, the decision 
maker will pay attention. Why would he or she not? On the other hand, if 
what you send is unpersuasive, even the neediest decision maker will pass.”
 
Arriving online or by postal mail — or even better, hand carried by a com-
pany’s employee to the company’s hiring authority — these letters absolutely 
must catch the reader’s eyes and then glue them open.
Prospecting letters and broadcast letters have much in common. Some argue 
that they’re really the same genus. Maybe so. But, in my viewpoint, the differ-
ence is a matter of scale and personal connection. Here’s a distinction:
 
✓ Broadcast letters are self-marketing letters sent to a large but carefully 
targeted roster of potential employers. You may draw your targets from 
commercial mailing lists.
 
 The list is king. Even with great writing, without verifying that the list 
you’re using is up to date and representative of the specific industry or 
career field you want to reach, you’re sending junk mail.

152
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
 
✓ Prospecting letters are self-marketing letters sent to a much smaller 
and even more selective number of potential employers. They may, 
for example, be addressed to a potential employer you met at an event 
or to a member of a small professional organization whose name you 
obtained from the group’s directory.
The 26 broadcast and prospecting letters in this chapter usually can be 
reshaped to use in either category — or adapted to become job reply letters 
(Chapter 8).
Send Postal Mail or E-Mail?
 Deciding which medium is most likely to get results for your letters is a toss-
up. Here are a few important considerations:
 
✓ E-mail is cheaper and quicker than postal mail, growing rapidly and pro-
ducing similar results in many circumstances, particularly with execu-
tive recruiters and venture capital firms.
 
✓ Recruiters like e-mail because they can punch a button and shoot your 
materials to clients with ease.
 
✓ Conducting an e-mail campaign to employers is risky even if you can 
find the decision-maker’s personal e-mail address. Why? Your letter and 
resume may disappear into the spam version of the Bermuda Triangle. 
Unless a company has advertised an HR (human resources) address, 
you have no assurance that your campaign will get to the right people.
 
✓ A persuasive mailing on quality paper is still the best way to forward an 
unsolicited letter and resume to top-level executives and other promi-
nent decision-makers.
When you’re facing an uphill search in a thin job market, a direct mail cam-
paign comprised of broadcast and prospecting letters riding herd on your 
resume can produce leads you may otherwise miss. The caveat: Research the 
best techniques to mail your letters (whether a commercial service or a do-it-
yourself effort) and follow up on leads generated by the campaign.
Techniques to Notice 
Smooth moves are self-evident in a number of the letters in this grouping. 
But here I comment on many underlying factors and related techniques that 
make them winners:

153
 Chapter 9: Broadcast and Prospecting Letters
 
✓ Stage setters. A social worker (Seligman) aiming for community services 
announces upfront what she’s about and what she offers.
 
 All fired up and ready to go, a business development executive (Adams) 
vividly banners her intent to take her next employer’s company to the 
next level.
 
 Both letters illustrate the value of using insights gained from profes-
sional branding activities (See Chapter 13) to convey a giant impression 
of who the candidate is and what the candidate offers.
 
✓ Rookie glad-handers. A new graduate and would-be trade support ana-
lyst (Braden) pulls out all the stops to include flattery, a reference from 
a mutual friend, and more honeyed words of praise, all the while framing 
himself within the letterhead’s contact information as the best financial 
candidate since, well, Warren Buffet. The kitchen-sink approach is a 
viable option for new graduates and well illustrated in this sample letter.
 
✓ Heads-up alerts. A senior staff analyst (Deeker) trumpets her search 
with a headlined talent alert and chalks up a smile with her corny but 
creative opening sentence. Starting a reaching-out letter with the name 
of the prospective employer draws interest.
 
✓ Global greats. A Russian ace software engineer (Milochev) concentrates 
on high-demand competencies and skills, noting a Skype address that 
facilitates free telephone interviews. Additionally, a Skype address sug-
gests the candidate has a contemporary outlook.
 
✓ Merger strategies. A process engineer (Moran) writes an unusual kind 
of prospecting letter to shore up his position in a merger of two compa-
nies. Seizing the initiative is smart in any situation where excess person-
nel results from a merger of two companies.
 
✓ Power profiles. A recent high school graduate and would-be customer 
service rep (Vincent) makes good use of an innovative profile designed 
to predict his behavior on the job he wants. This innovative approach 
addresses the ever-present question of personality fit for the job.
 
✓ Foodie thoughts. A culinary arts candidate (Cookin) offers another ver-
sion of personality disclosure and background. The job seeker gambles 
that if she doesn’t target a specific job, an employer will sort through 
her attractively presented qualifications and discover the perfect posi-
tion for her. This presentation, the equivalent of a resume’s qualifica-
tions summary, is an approach to consider when seeking virtually any 
good job in a specific industry or career field.
 
✓ Philosophical practicalities. A teaching professional (Woodman) 
expresses her loving perspective on the value of children — attention 
bait in the field of education. And she makes sure that the reader grasps 
her serious qualifications, such as certification to teach in her state’s 

154
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
schools by stating those facts in boldface type. This format works to 
hook the reader with clues to one’s inspirational inner person but sus-
tains interest by trumpeting the candidate’s practical qualifications.
 
✓ Home helpers. A communication by a seeker of a household manage-
ment position (Adamson) differs from the typical broadcast or prospect-
ing letter because it volunteers biographical information not found in 
typical job applications. This document, identified as a personal state-
ment, is limited in usage to jobs such as domestics and bodyguards, 
where personal histories are very important. It can be used in at least 
two ways: e-mailed with a cover note (see Chapter 14), or left behind 
in hard copy at job interviews as a reminder of a candidate’s personal 
background and qualifications.
 
✓ High flyers. An executive (Armstrong) applies for an upscale job in the 
consumer products industry. Grabbing the reader by the collar with a 
masterful accomplishment statement in boldface type at the top of the 
letter, he legitimizes his claims with Stand Out details and ends with an 
action close. (See Chapter 6.) An executive model, this letter is appropri-
ate for alpha candidates who are itching to move on and up.
 
✓ Quiet types. A financial executive (Montgomery) writing to a recruiter 
immediately says he comes recommended, an opening that’s likely to 
cause his letter to be among the first read in the crush of daily mail. He 
quickly sounds the alarm that his search is under the radar by marking 
it confidential in capital letters and underlined boldface type, and then 
placing the statement where the eye can’t miss it.
 
 In another recruiter-targeted letter, a business technology executive 
(Thompkins), also wants to keep his search quiet but places his under-
lined request for privacy at the end of the letter.
 
 Flagging confidentiality vastly improves the chances that a job seeker’s 
letter won’t inadvertently be sent to the seeker’s current boss. (Yes, that 
happens rarely, but it happens.)
 
✓ Employer pleasers. A candidate seeking to analyze business and technol-
ogy issues (Monroe) announces upfront that he’s a triple treat who can 
manage technology, money, and people. Such a strong combination of 
talents resonates with many employers, especially when the claims are 
backed up with numbers in a quantitative statement of accomplishments.
 
 Another letter from an executive/administrative assistant (Dempsey) 
immediately states that the job seeker’s objective is to make her boss’s 
job easier. She continues to explain why her strengths and abilities are 
right on the pulse of the position. The tone of her letter is perfect for a 
position as a right-hand assistant.
 
 Writing effective letters begins with thinking through what employers 
really want and writing them from the employer’s viewpoint.

155
 Chapter 9: Broadcast and Prospecting Letters
 
✓ Repetition rewards. A retailing executive (Lansing) chooses repetition — 
namely, the popular “Bottom-Line” term — and uses it three times to 
introduce three different accomplishments. The technique of repetitive 
phrasing slams home a candidate’s main message.
 
 Quick takes. A database manager (Dotreev) cuts to the chase with a 
brief but effective use of her career brand — efficiency while maintain-
ing quality, aided by tenacious problem-solving skills. Short, tastefully 
designed letters spiced with persuasive information earn attention.
 
✓ Down-times uppers. A broadcast letter from a former entrepreneur now 
seeking employment (Brown) opens with a direct appeal to economi-
cally threatened small business owners. This is a difficult sale, but the 
seeker does a good job of explaining that he beat adversity for years 
while others failed as he markets his survival skills. When facing the 
need to stay up in down times, employers fear taking on additional labor 
costs. Successful job seekers focus on ways to allay those fears in their 
reaching-out letters.
 
✓ Smart strategies. A real estate professional (Boudreaux) capitalizes 
on having done such a good job that he worked himself onto the job 
market! He follows his clever opening with knock-out statistics before 
closing with a time frame to talk about making money together. A time-
less tactic: Emphasizing — at first glance — impressive measurable suc-
cess as an inducement to meet.
 
✓ Recommendation vouchers. A business executive (Anderson) combines 
an attractive design, targeted positions, and accomplishment-based text 
with rousing endorsements from two former employers. What’s not to 
like about this Stand Out marketing letter?
 
✓ Self-referrals. An outdoors enthusiast and customer of a sports com-
pany (Abbott) seeks to morph from customer to employee. He writes 
of transferring his construction expertise to help build the company’s 
new sports facility and then of transitioning to the position of facili-
ties director for the completed structure. Promising to make contact 
at an upcoming job fair, the candidate gets a leg up on being welcomed 
at the company’s fair booth by establishing his bona fides in advance. 
Psychology experts believe that we like people who are like us; identifi-
cation as a customer creates instant readiness for acceptance.
 
✓ Bullet pointers. A CPA seeking employment as a controller or finance 
director (Kelham) makes smart use of five bulleted reasons to hire him.
 
 In a second sample with bullet points, a supervisor (Kowal) highlights 
his readiness to relocate to a region of Canada that has advertised its 
desire to attract talented immigrants, wisely noting that his family is 
on board with the prospective relocation. (In a buyer’s job market, 
employers typically resist out-of-area candidates because they don’t 
want to pay relocation costs when local talent is available; the situation 
described in this letter is an exception.)

156
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
 
 In a third sample, a sales executive (Borden) getting the word out about 
his availability shows how to attract attention with bullet points. In this 
case, the points are framed in a dotted-line rule like a theater marquee.
 
 Modern media has conditioned readers to be receptive to bulleted lists. 
A variation of bulleted lists, “Five Top Tips” and “Top Ten Reasons Why” 
lists are especially popular.
 
✓ Insider clues. A fitness expert (Martinez) opens his prospecting letter 
by revealing that he’s one of the fitness clan by writing, “But for those 
of us who are in the business . . .” By positioning himself as a fellow pro-
fessional, he creates a favorable climate for following up when he’s in 
the same city. Whether citing experience or leisure-time activities, any 
indication of being a good cultural fit reduces resistance to reading an 
unsolicited letter and considering the candidate for an interview.
 
✓ Sheherazade stories. A social worker who wants to become a pharma-
ceutical sales rep (Hoover) presents her qualifications in an interesting 
narrative that makes those qualifications come alive. She explains why 
her expertise as a licensed clinical social worker is a dynamite match for 
pharmaceutical sales, and ends with yet another compelling story. Savvy 
job seekers don’t underestimate the power of storytelling to get their let-
ters read, and they write as though they are speaking to one person.
On with the Letters!
The 26 letters that follow are a spectacular collection of broadcast letters 
(many recipients) and prospecting letters (fewer recipients). As in other 
chapters, the name of the professional writer of each letter appears beneath 
it. For more information about the writers, turn to the appendix. You’ll like 
these gems.
 
Maximum message readability is the presentation criterion for each sample 
cover letter in this chapter. To save space in some superb but lengthier 
samples, I had to chop the original boilerplate text leading into the letter — 
most often deleting the recipient’s name, title, company and address. So when 
you see a letter leading off with “[Date, inside address, salutation],” or some 
variation of that, the generic line is merely a reminder that you can’t just say 
“Hey you, read this!” If you’re not sure how to layout your cover letter, turn to 
Chapter 4.

Over the past few years I have followed the masterful expansion of International Stock & Trade, 
as well as your leadership in electronic trading. Until recently it was through publications that I 
followed your company; now, Marc Kertosh, an esteemed friend whom you also know, has

I am well versed in situations that require attention to detail, quick interpretation and interpolation 
of data and multi-tasking, as such qualities are indispensable to safely transcend the rigors of 
Atlanta’s Class B airspace.  
Mr. Martin, I am very interested in pursuing a career with your company and in particular the 
position of Trade Support Analyst. I would greatly appreciate an opportunity to meet with you 
and further discuss how my qualifications dovetail with your requirements for an A-list 
employee. I will contact you soon to schedule an appointment, and I thank you for your time and

Like you, I’ve been working to help resolve details of the upcoming partnership 
between Arista and my company, Carter Manufacturing. But after work, on the drive 
home, on the weekends, one measure of merit captures my attention: How soon, and 
how powerfully, can we use the strength of our new company to extend our ROI? How 
do we do that faster and more durably than our competition? I know I’d benefit from 
your reactions to my ideas.
Many are ready to dismiss cottonseed delinting as a potentially lucrative market 
segment. The market may be small, but there are opportunities that I think can 
generate $12M of new revenue in the first three years alone. In addition, 
demanding delinting process creates a follow on durable market for parts, supporting 
services, and replacement. 
In addition, these factors we help beat the competition early on:
 We have unique knowledge of processes and equipment. I’m not just thinking 
about mechanical specs. Our customers know, or soon find out, delinting is as 
much an art as a manufacturing process. If continuing customers’ dissatisfaction 
with our competition is a good indicator, we have mastered an art they haven’t.
 We have personal knowledge of our customers and their needs—something 
of extraordinary value among customers whose cultures value personal 
relationships differently than we do. They’ve invited Joann and me to their homes 
to share family meals: we’ve been fortunate to do the same. Said another way, 
we “speak” their business language to mutual benefit.
Leveraging all these advantages is very doable. But, as our customers from South 
America and Africa have told me often, words on paper are no substitute for people 
speaking with people. If what you’ve read appeals to you, I’d like to suggest a next 
step. May I call in a few days to see how well my thoughts align with yours?
Sincerely,
Charles W. Moran

PERSONAL STATEMENT FOR HOUSEHOLD MANAGER POSITION
My career goal is to secure a position as a Household Manager; to that end, I 
pledge to bring my unique skills in household management and child/animal/plant 
caretaking, along with the highest levels of trust and respect, to my future employer. 
I was born in Berlin, Germany, in October 2, 1960, and grew up in Houston, TX, 
following my family’s relocation. I have been married to Joseph for 12 years. We have 
one son, Christian, who is 21 years old. My father worked for 35 years as a railroad 
technician and operator, and my mother was a full-time housewife and caretaker until I 
turned 18; she then pursued a career in clerical work. I have one older brother.
 
Due to my mother’s physical condition, which required her to spend a great deal 
of time in bed while I was growing up, I found myself having to contribute to the 
running of the household at an early age, perhaps even more so than many other 
children my age. I discovered that I was a “natural” at organizing household affairs, and 
I enjoyed bringing my mom breakfast in bed, helping to take care of her, and ensuring 
that all the daily household chores were not neglected. As I developed my skills in 
helping to manage a household, I discovered that I could handle large-scale events, as 
well. When I was 16, I catered my relatives’ 25th anniversary party. I planned and 
organized all aspects of the event, and the party was subsequently a complete success! 
I proved that I could not only run a household, but that I could also coordinate special 
events and ensure their success.
What I would like to emphasize in this statement are characteristics and 
strengths that contribute to my abilities as an effective Household Manager. My 
communication style is open and direct; I am sensitive to the needs of others, yet I am 
able to be firm with staff when necessary. I have experience in medical care, and I have 
unlimited patience in dealing with those who are affected by physical and mental 
limitations. I pride myself on my ability to be resourceful and “wear many hats,” 
including household manager, caretaker, special events coordinator, staff supervisor, 
healthcare assistant, and construction supervisor.
My resume includes details of my work history; additionally, I have an 
impeccable list of references, which I will gladly provide upon request.

Building high-performance, high-profit consumer products companies is my expertise. Whether challenged to 
launch a new venture, facilitate a complete business transformation or accelerate growth throughout markets 
worldwide, I have consistently delivered multi-million-dollar gains in revenues and bottom-line profits. 
Most notably, I:
• 
Led development and launch of more than 800 new products throughout my career that 
have generated combined revenues in excess of $2 billion for major consumer products 
companies.
My career can be briefly summarized as follows:
• 
In my current position as COO/EVP with GXT Products and Gunner Industries, orchestrated the 
integration of two consumer products companies into one organization and delivered 28% revenue 
growth and 20% margin improvement in the first year. These achievements were realized through a 
series of operational changes (including transition to third-party manufacturing), an aggressive new 
product development effort (6 new patents pending), a massive upgrade of internal IT and 
e-commerce capabilities (resulting in a 53.5% increase in web traffic), and unprecedented gains in 
productivity, efficiency, and cost elimination.

Dear Mr. Pringle: 
 
Your firm has been recommended to me by Shad James as active in the recruitment of executives with 
strong operational and financial backgrounds. 
 
For the past 15 years, I have held positions of General Manager, Executive Vice President, and Chief 
Financial Officer of a mid-size manufacturing firm. I have been a key player in the execution of successful 
turnaround situations, the development and implementation of acquisitions/divestitures, and the design of 
operational strategies.

Planned and implemented the consolidation of businesses from four locations to one without the 
 
loss of any major customers. 
 
 Introduced two new breakthrough product lines, representing $7 million in sales. 
 
 
Profitably outsourced shipping, logistics, mail, document management, and network 
 
maintenance functions previously performed internally.  
 
 
Reduced inventory costs by 25% through cycle time improvements, fewer suppliers, and JIT 
 
raw materials ordering. 
 
At present I am conducting a confidential search, as my company has been targeted for takeover in the 
near future. I enjoy the challenge of creating, building, and growing an organization. Ideally, I would be 
interested in an executive position with a young company that has an entrepreneurial outlook and sales of 
less than $50 million. An opportunity to earn equity would be attractive. 
 
I am flexible on immediate compensation if there is adequate potential for growth, but for informational 
purposes, my annual salary and perks total approximately $170,000. My preference for geographic 
location is the New England area, where most of my family resides.  
 
Whether or not you presently have an appropriate search assignment, I would welcome a personal 
meeting with you or your representative for an appraisal interview. I will call you next week. 
 
Sincerely,

I am currently exploring opportunities in Information Management/Business Strategy 
Development at the Director-VP-AVP levels. My expertise is within the financial service industry, a 
discipline in which I am very qualified; however, I would also be interested in aligning my skills 
with opportunities in either the insurance field or medical technology industry.
As a business technology executive, the breadth of my experience in both the business service and 
IT sides of the organization uniquely combines an ability to understand and significantly help 
optimize business—from leveraging new business opportunities and helping the sales and 
marketing aspects of a business to controlling costs, improving productivity, and generating greater 
returns. Highlights of my experience include an ability to:
• 
Manage relationships (customers/clients, partners, staff, managers) exceptionally 
well—establishing rapport and critical trust.
• 
Identify and surround myself with exceptionally strong people—giving direct reports the 
support and tools to do their jobs.
• 
Effectively manage system/application issues post-acquisition—designing integration strategies 
that reduce redundancies, streamline operations, and provide properly aggregated information.
• 
Expertly direct integration and systems implementation teams and processes—while being able 
to consistently identify and eliminate obstacles to successful project achievement.
• 
Understand/manage within security and privacy regulations, being ultrasensitive to confidential 
data and business needs.
• 
Ensure a bottom-line emphasis on optimizing overall operations—defining short- and 
long-term strategies that deliver desired results; as an innovative business strategy/technology 
executive, I provide the creative leadership and targeted systems design solutions that help 
companies stay ahead of the curve and achieve their goals.
I would value the opportunity to discuss potential opportunities with client companies you 
represent and to determine if my skillset is the right fit with the challenges these organizations are 
facing. Please consider this communication in confidence. Thank you for your consideration.

processes that boosted productivity, efficiency, and profitability for both my employers and 
their top-priority clients. Whether leading projects in oil and gas, electric, manufacturing, or 
network services industries, I have consistently met the challenge of solving problems 
through a combination of technology innovation, project leadership, and client relationship 
management, illustrated by the following examples from my current position:
  99% uptime from transfer of entire IT infrastructure to Active Directory 
 
 environment;
  80% productivity gain from build-out of Help Desk function in the Western
 
 region;
  65% security increase for systems and 720 users through Disaster

 employees.
 
With a blended background that shines in management and technology, there’s every 
chance that I can bring genuine value to your future initiatives and, at the same time, 
integrate smoothly within your current IT management team. 
I hope you think we have lots to talk about in a meeting to discuss the benefits and 
strategies I can bring to your company table. I’ll make it a priority to call you next week to 
pin down a mutually convenient time. If you need information about my experience,

The theme of my career: To locate the most efficient route possible to achieve 
a goal within the shortest amount of time ⎯ without sacrifice to overall quality.
Case in point: While at Top Telecommunications, I participated on a 4-person 
I.T. team challenge to support a weekly subscriber base of 5 million customers 
spanning all of the U.S. and Puerto Rico.  Because of the sheer volumes of work, 
we uncovered new data sources as well as innovative processes and procedures 
that led to the drastic reduction of weekly report production times from 5 days 
to 1 day ⎯ a drop of 80%.  
In addition, new codes were being set up in response to different cable TV 
packages offering a variety of network bundles.  My team and I determined a 
way to interpret the data that improved overall staff productivity because this 
initiative reduced coding times and heightened accuracy levels.  
Successful employees are tenacious: A resourceful problem-solver, I

I resolve to take on tough challenges and aspire to succeed ⎯ even in the face of

Can your company benefit from the energy of a senior manager who’s a superman at dodging business 
bullets?  
 
When decades got tough, this tough businessman kept turning a profit. Despite a changing neighborhood 
that folded many small, less well-run businesses, my independent retail appliance and furniture store 
(Sansone-Blackmoor, Inc. in Berwyn, Illinois) made money despite all odds. That’s verifiable. 
 
But wisdom is in knowing when it’s time to transfer skills and knowledge to another venue and I’m now 
ready to make that career move. To help your organization grow and expand, I can bring to your table 
the following benefits: 
 
 Extensive knowledge of the major electronics and appliance brands as well as what most consumers 
want and expect. 
 Well-developed sales acumen; strong closing skills and talent for developing and retaining a productive 
sales team. 
 Excellent communication skills; ability to develop strong relationships with mass merchandisers, buyers, 
and sales representatives. 
 Skilled in establishing immediate, positive rapport with customers. 
 Awareness of how creative merchandising strategies can assure maximum inventory turns. 
 Sound bottom-line judgment. 
 
Thank you very much for your consideration. I will contact you next week to see if we can arrange a 
meeting at a mutually convenient day and time, so we can further discuss your needs and how I might be 
able to fulfill them. Should you have any questions in the interim, feel free to get in touch with me by phone

Re: Dream Job British Columbia
Dear Reader:
As your Web site challenges, “It’s one thing to talk about jobs in theory, and quite another 
to get out there and find a great job.” Not one to just talk, here I am. I am organized, have 
a positive attitude, and am willing to work hard. My resume provides solid proof of these 
attributes. I hope that there is a new role waiting for me in Canada’s arguably most beautiful 
province.
Your Web site gives 10 great reasons to move to B.C., and all of them are quite compelling. 
Because I have school-aged children, reason #4 is reason enough, but #10 ⎯ “B.C. promotes a 
flexible and healthy work environment” ⎯ is the best reason for wanting to work in B.C. You will 
read in my resume that as Supervisor, and previously as a Team Leader, I have found ways to 
improve staff morale and enjoyment of work life ⎯ essential for the health of the community and 
its businesses. 
May I draw your attention to a few of my strengths?
   Organization to get things done efficiently, saving time and money.
 Leadership to balance business needs and employee needs; a company’s sustained 
bottom line is interwoven with the health of its employees.
 Communications to relate in earnest — and with passion and enthusiasm — to people 
in everyday language a company’s “big picture,” correlating it to the small details that 
will create that vision. 
My family is 100% with me on this venture, and I sincerely hope that something in my 
resume will pique the interest of a quality B.C. employer. I will take the initiative, and will give 
you a call mid-week, [date]; I’m willing, ready, and able to join B.C.’s workforce.

for capital equipment and software in four consecutive years with previously 
underperforming 20-state region. Won President’s Club Regional Manager of the Year 
award (National Medical Processing & Systems Automated). 
 
  Regional Business Director:  Boosted historically sluggish sales record for Southern 
US region to near-quota (99.5%) levels within 6 months (Corp500Care). 
 
  Director of Marketing: Requested by CEO to step into interim national marketing role

those of us who are in the business, fitness is not only a way of life but life-giving.  
Fitness has been my passion and my career. I have thoroughly enjoyed every 
minute of teaching people how to understand their bodies and achieve personal 
fitness goals, and I am honored to have made a difference in the lives of my clients 
over the years.  
In September, I will be relocating to San Diego and would like to continue doing 
what I do best — teaching people about fitness and introducing them to the 
wonderful mental and physical benefits it can provide. From the enclosed resume 
you will see that my career has been both diverse and rewarding, affording me an 
opportunity to reach people of all ages and levels of fitness.  
I would sincerely appreciate an opportunity to meet with you and discuss how my 
background and experience can benefit your outstanding program. I will call your 
office to schedule a personal interview at your convenience. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Orlando Martinez

[Date, inside address to hiring authority at a pharmaceutical company, salutation]
RE:  Licensed Clinical Social Worker for Pharmaceutical Sales: A Great Idea!
Let me tell you a story. A patient of mine put herself in a bad situation and called me to rescue her. She 
had self-raised her antidepressant, and when she ran out early, her physician refused to prescribe more. 
The antidepressant is known for withdrawal effects. How would I advocate for my patient while 
communicating to a physician (whom I did not know well) that I understood her perspective? 
I immediately contacted the physician, listening closely to her viewpoint, and agreeing that the patient 
had made a mistake (the physician’s primary issue). I expressed my concern regarding withdrawal, and 
shut up. The doctor slowly took out her script pad and wrote what was needed. I thanked her, and 
asked for advice on how I could convince the client not to do this again. Not long after that the 
physician asked me to handle another case, which I did immediately, going above and beyond what she 
asked.
Can you use my communication and problem-solving skills on your pharmaceutical sales 
team?
As a licensed clinical social worker, I have been "selling" in the medical community for over 15 
years—negotiating diplomatically with patients for changes in living and habit, as well as with medical 
providers for services and supplies. I work independently and believe I am valued by physicians and 
medical staff. The medical director of New Beginnings thought enough of my clinical skills, insight, and 
strong customer service orientation to (almost) convince me to stay after I was offered a job at the 
Healthcare Center. 
I am ready for a new challenge. I enjoy exposure to the "hard science" of pharmaceutical chemistry and 
research, and I believe I would enjoy working with [company name].  
A final story: I was the youngest student ever accepted to the Texas University Advanced Standing 
Graduate Program — because I had a high GPA, good GRE scores (studied madly over the summer), 
excellent volunteer and extracurricular experience, a good personal narrative, and top recommendations 
by professors. I drove down to TU on my own initiative to interview key people at the School of Social 
Work to see if it was what I wanted ⎯ and to stand out as one of the best, I even bought a suit.
Thank you for your interest, time, and consideration. I look forward to an interview at your 
convenience.
With enthusiasm to match my skills,

Dear Ms. Manning:
As an experienced Executive/Administrative Assistant, my overall objective has always been 
to make my boss’s job easier, and I have successfully done that. I have been supporting 
senior-level management for more than 14 years and have acquired the skills necessary to 
ensure the highest level of competence.
I enjoy my current position as a Special Event Coordinator, but this job has taken me away from 
the executive support positions that I have held in the past and really liked. I miss the challenges 
and the multi-tasked responsibilities of a fast-paced and smooth-running office. My goal is to 
return to an office support position, and I am looking for an opportunity as an Executive or 
Administrative Assistant.  
As you can see from the attached resume, my previous experience in executive support and 
event planning has given me the overall skills, competencies, and knowledge needed to perform 
well in a high-level position where you are often called upon to plan meetings and events, as 
well as run a smooth and efficient office. My office skills are excellent, and I have outstanding 
time-management and organizational abilities.  
As a professional dedicated to service and excellence, I am a self-starter with excellent written 
and verbal communication skills and work well as a team leader and team player.  
I would welcome the opportunity to meet and discuss how my strengths and abilities could 
benefit you. I’ll call you Wednesday morning to see when we can meet. Thanks so much for 
reading.
Best regards,
Jacqueline Dempsey

Chapter 10
Networking Letters
In This Chapter
▶ Gaining insights from a wealth of networking letters
▶ Getting to the bottom of networking moves that really work
▶ Sampling simple tips to maintain your network
O
ne of the most overused words in contemporary language is network-
ing. You’re urged to network your way to new friends, network your 
way to better business opportunities, network your way to more sales, and 
network your way to an attractive new job.
Networking’s popularity is not undeserved: Whether pressing-the-flesh the 
traditional way on land — or meeting new people the newer way online 
(Chapters 2 and 13) — putting together a personal network is a work project 
highly recommended by virtually every career adviser I know. And most cite 
true stories to back up their convictions.
I particularly like the story of a newly unemployed technology executive 
who 20 years ago decided to give networking a go by writing to everyone 
he knew — friends, acquaintances, distant relatives, former employers, and 
former employees — 200 people in all.
Explaining that he’d become a freelancer, the tech exec said he was looking 
for work. He outlined his credentials in a letter; he did not attach a resume, 
presumably to avoid paralyzing readers with too much information. The 
newly-minted freelancer asked everyone to let him know if they had work 
or to introduce him to anyone they knew who might. The tech exec immedi-
ately received an offer of a temporary work project that turned into full-time 
employment — a networking touchdown that restarted his ultimately very 
successful career.
This chapter shows you what to say and how to say it when you launch a net-
working job project of your own.

184
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
 Short Key Points about Job Networking
Entire books are written about the ins and outs of job networking. But I cut 
to the chase in this chapter because the focus is on communicating better 
to allies who can spread your word or deliver interviews. To make your net-
working work, review these basics:
 
✓ The networking secret. Successful networkers invest in people over the 
years. They think about personal networking as making deposits into 
and withdrawals from a kind of favor bank. Networking is a way of life, 
not a life jacket you pull out as your ship goes down.
 
✓ The networking process. You already may be building promising con-
nections with people you meet in the normal course of your life. Keep a 
list of who they are and how to reach them. Refresh your memory with 
these examples of personal-network-rich activities:
 
• Attending professional association and alumni meetings
 
• Being helpful to your neighbors
 
• Exchanging pleasantries with people like letter carriers and sales reps
 
• Striking up conversations in dentists’ and veterinarians’ offices
 
• Chatting up other parents at your child’s school
 
• Getting to know other volunteers on a civic project
 
• Working on humane endeavors at your church
 
 Keep others in the picture of what you’re up to; don’t be the taker who calls 
only when he or she wants something. Use lunch hours to stay in touch. Send 
e-mail. Connect others. Take leadership positions in groups. Do good turns.
 
✓ The networking benefit. By building bridges to a group of individuals 
whom you are willing to help, and who are willing to help you in return, 
you create a safety-net infrastructure to mobilize when you’re on the 
road again in the job world.
Networking Letters to Note
The ten sample messages in this chapter demonstrate using the ripple effect 
in tapping into the personal networks of others. All the samples make it easy 
for recipients to help the job seeker, but some have surprising twists. My 
comments about each call your attention to specific tactics, circumstances, 
and advantages:
 
✓ Confident networkers. No Timid Tillie, a candidate (Stitel) follows up 
with a telephone call on a job lead she found on an online business 
networking site. The candidate’s letter boldly states on the upper-right 

185
 Chapter 10: Networking Letters
screen that she’s the Stand Out winner, backing up her assertion with 
impressive achievements.
 
 Going for a goal with all flags flying is a modern mindset to survive tur-
bulent times of change.
 
✓ Chance encounters. A Canadian airport executive (Callahan) turns a 
meeting at a pubic forum into an interview opportunity and follows up 
with a cover letter and resume that spell out exactly why he can be a 
leading candidate for an emergency services position at a larger airport.
 
 Being prepared to write a quality cover letter and to customize a core 
resume are skills that capitalize on unexpected opportunities.
 
✓ Postscript persuaders. A senior chemist (Paine) opens by naming one of her 
former employees as her connector, which in itself suggests that she’s a like-
able manager, or her former subordinate wouldn’t have referred her. A hard-
to-miss postscript implies that she’s a team player who believes in keeping 
managers in the loop with regular updates — an applause-line statement.
 
 Postscripts may be the first words read on a cover letter.
 
✓ Alumni endorsements. Applying to become a business solutions con-
sultant (Foster), a candidate connects quickly by stating that a former 
professor recommends the contact. Professors typically have their refer-
ral plates full with requests from current graduates. The candidate will 
be perceived as above average when a professor is willing to reach back 
five years to endorse an alumnus.
 
 A professor’s recommendation is a strong endorsement worth pursuing.
 
✓ Pitching recruiters. An aerospace executive seeking to bail out of a thin-
ning industry pulls out all the stops (Sloan). After mentioning a mutual 
connection, the job seeker praises the recruiter’s status. He makes a 
strong presentation of his crossover skills and, icing on the cake, prom-
ises to relocate if the job is good enough.
 
 Recruiters are weary of wasting time on candidates who, at the last 
minute, refuse to relocate when the job requires it.
 
✓ Informational interviews. A student seeking assistance with a class 
project (Forbart) not only mentions the person who referred her but 
explains that they met through volunteer work helping animals. If the 
recipient is also an animal lover, the letter could stop right there and the 
informational interview would be granted. But the student wisely goes 
on to include five questions described as representative of the type she 
would ask in an interview, an act that reassures the reader the student is 
organized and respectful of the reader’s time.
 
 Consider a possible extra benefit of writing a Stand Out letter: The 
interviewee, impressed by the student’s thoughtfulness, may choose to 
become an important member of the student’s personal network. 
 
✓ Entrepreneurial networking. An amusing subject line heralds a busi-
nessman’s new venture. The entrepreneur (Galloway) cuts it short to 

186
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
command attention. Additional networking e-mails are likely to follow as 
the business becomes established and grows.
 
 Marketing online through a network is a favorite way to bootstrap a 
business, especially during its start-up months. Although the business 
later may focus on e-mails selling products and services, career manage-
ment documents are needed at launch.
 
✓ Advance selling. A financial executive (Hankerd) with exceptional gov-
ernment contracting expertise breaks out on his own with a networking 
letter after originally being filtered through a network contact.
 
 Even when the employer doesn’t read the resume in advance, the letter 
quality suggests that the candidate knows how to handle himself in busi-
ness, confirming the mutual friend’s recommendation.
 
✓ Industry insiders. A vocational rehabilitation counselor (Smith) taps 
a colleague, including both a capsule and a resume. Unless the friend 
wants the job himself, it’s a good bet he’ll alert her to attractive job 
openings. Although a job search engine can uncover the same open jobs, 
fellow professionals can add endorsements and inside tips.
 
 Professional associations are fertile fields for networking letters. 
Nothing works better than a recommendation by a fellow professional.
 
✓ Networking postcards. A well-thought-out sample for a nonprofit execu-
tive (Gray) depicts the creative postcard model. Both sides of the post-
card pull their weight. This thrifty medium stands out from other mail 
and allows the job seeker to spread a message widely and quickly.
Watch Out — Samples Ahead
Conventional advice suggests that in networking letters you ask for advice 
and help — not for a job. A direct request for employment puts people on the 
spot, and most of us hate to say “no” to a friend or colleague.
But results for a job seeker who did ask for a job — contract work to be sure, 
but a job nonetheless — make me question that conventional advice. The 
freelance technology executive I describe at the beginning of this chapter 
asked for work or for introductions to people who have work, and it paid off 
for him. My observation: As with most practices in job search, there are no 
absolutes. Use common sense.
Reflecting on the samples that follow puts you steps ahead of others who haven’t 
learned to write enticing networking letters that don’t sound like ransom notes.
 
So what can you do if your message-return rate is disappointing? Assuming 
you’ve stayed connected and you’re not a fair-weather friend, rewrite your 
message, or engage a professional writer to do so, and try again.

My former professor, John Severnis, recommends that I contact you regarding 
your current opportunities for Business Solutions Consultants. With over 
five years of experience in IT business solutions roles, I strongly believe 
that my background meshes well with the needs of your organization.
In my current role at Compusource Limited, I conduct extensive IT audits and

 In just one year I created a ticket tracking system to 
minimize problem-resolution time, built operational scripts 
and flowcharts to streamline product delivery, and wrote 
inaugural company policies and procedures.
Prior to my position at Compusource, I was a technology consultant for IBM, 
where I project managed an Exchange migration program for 25,000 users. 
 At IBM I rolled out a 7,000-seat NT/Exchange and Outlook 
initiative, authored a “how to” repository for users, and 
significantly trimmed server down time and crashes by 
auditing server logs.
Excited by your opportunity and impressed by your company’s services, I

Reflecting on my highly successful professional experience within the aerospace industry, I’ve 
decided it’s time to pursue new challenges. 
 
My primary interest is in working as chief executive for a large corporation, possibly in a 
division-level capacity, or for a small company that’s poised for growth. Yes, I pledge to relocate 
for the right job. 
 
Why can I transition easily to another industry? My ability to quickly identify areas of concern, 
evaluate potential solutions, and, most importantly, make the changes necessary to turnaround 
situations are my greatest strengths. 
 
I’m savvy in the business world: My aerospace industry experience has tuned me into the 
relationship between sales, government regulations, and overall production and productivity. 
These areas are evidenced in my resume but here is a sampling of my notable accomplishments: 
Reorganized/restructured departments, processes, and operations resulting in annual sales 
growth from $5 million in [date] to $200 million today 
Maximized knowledge of and experience with government regulations resulting in the 
procurement of funds for training and  tax exemption for capital expenses totaling almost 
$200,000 
Developed and implemented daily performance reporting techniques that led to a 25% 
increase in production

The project is designed to help understand the role of Human Resource Development in 
an organization. The kinds of questions I have are: 
 
• 
What kinds of background do most people in the field have? 
• 
What are the most important skills needed? 
• 
What kinds of training and counseling are offered to clients? 
• 
How is a corporate training firm structured? 
• 
Is there data to support the success of corporate leadership training services?

Dear Jim: 
 
Since we’ve been unable to connect personally and have been speaking through Tony Mancini for the 
past week or so, I wanted to get my resume to you before our July 7 meeting for your review.  
 
With over 25 years of success in linking finance to business operations, the value I bring to US 
Connect extends far beyond that of a typical Chief Financial Officer. Not only am I effective in 
developing strategic plans, budgets, and forecasts, I know what it takes for operations, marketing 
sales to successfully execute them to deliver strong and sustainable revenue, profit, and performance 
results. 
 
My career has included CFO roles in $140 million base operations, with over 2,000 personnel. I 
provide a unique combination of tools and direction to continuously navigate financial, market, and 
operational success as measured by: 
 
• 
Best Practices Implementation to boost the value of employee productivity and process 
improvements. 
 
• 
Payroll and Travel Expense Management for US Army personnel and Joint Task Force in 
Baghdad, Iraq. 
 
• 
Project Management for Air Force Defense Team. As project manager, completed 135 sites on 
time and $750,000 under budget. 
 
I have built financial teams from the ground up, implementing financial systems and facilitating 
merger integration and change management initiatives that have directly impacted the top and 
bottom-line.  
 
Aware of the caliber and reputation US Connect holds in the marketplace, I look forward to our 
continued discussion next week as the first of many positive communications.

It was good to see you at the last conference. Since then, I’ve learned that change is in 
the air in my agency and I’ve decided to research my options sooner rather than later. 
Can you help me by letting me know of any attractive job openings you hear about that 
you think I’m qualified to fill? Here’s a capsule of my background:
As a quality-driven, visionary team member with more than 9 years of experience
providing rehabilitation services and managing caseloads in multiple locations in the
southern part of Alabama, I feel confident in my abilities to generate winning results.
I have 9 years of combined experience in providing career counseling and job
placement assistance to persons in career transition: displaced from disasters, high
school students, college students, retirees, persons who were being laid
off/downsized or losing jobs that were being off-shored.
My past roles ranged from Senior Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor, District
Supervisor, and Disaster Relief Counselor. A sample of my accomplishments:
• Honored with the Employee of Year distinction by the Department of
 
Rehabilitation.
• Wrote successful grant proposal that received funding to implement a 
 
technology showcase for persons with mild to severe hearing impairments 
 
to be able to test products to ascertain the effectiveness for their personal needs.
• Co-authored legislation with Senator Doe for Senate Joint Resolution No. 123 
 
that acknowledges American Sign Language as a true language to be recognized 
 
by the state of Anywhere, public schools, colleges, and universities.
• Quantifiable successes in job placements by placing over 40 clients in
 
competitive employment each fiscal year. 
Charlie, my resume is attached. I’d like to stay in the South. Please give me a call
if you hear about something, and I’ll get right back to your lead’s hiring authority.
You know I appreciate your efforts. Thanks so very much. 
All best,

Chapter 11
Resume Letters
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing the resume letter, a heckuva hybrid
▶ Fixing on the finer points of a resume letter
▶ Eyeing an exhibit of Stand Out samples
A
 resume letter is a self-marketing document that combines a cover letter 
and a resume. (The resume is not separate.) Also called a value proposi-
tion letter, a job letter, and a res-u-letter, a resume letter typically is two pages 
but sometimes only one page — or one page with a twist, which you see in a 
couple of the following samples.
Often overlooked and vastly underused, a resume letter works particularly 
well when a resume is riddled with hard-to-explain gaps and other problems.
 
Typically used in a targeted mailing campaign, a resume letter attracts notice 
because it reads more like a story than a document. Occasionally, a resume 
letter spills over into other document categories, such as job reply letters, 
when a formal resume doesn’t present the candidate in the best light.
Don’t Let Your Great Design 
Be Ambushed 
You can send your resume letters by back-to-the-future postal mail or by 
e-mail, but if your letter contains graphic design elements as do two in this 
chapter (Tremaine and Brohman), as well as samples in other chapters, 
postal mail is the safer choice. Here’s why:

198
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
Sending design-dependent letters online may create “very ugly cover letters,” 
Jim Lemke explains. Lemke, the technical reviewer for this book, reports that 
while most applicant tracking systems retain the native format (MS Word, for 
example) for both resumes and cover letters, others do not.
“Cover-letter formatting gets messed up in some systems because the system 
keeps only the resume in native format and converts cover letters to text,” 
Lemke says.
 
You can, of course, call the HR office at a target company where you plan to 
send a graphically-enriched cover letter and just ask: “Does your applicant 
tracking system retain cover letters in native format or convert them to text?” 
And to double check, ask the same question about resumes.
The resume letter that turned a casino 
man back into a chemist
The best resume-letter story I’ve ever heard is 
the happy ending to an extremely difficult chal-
lenge: finding a management job for a middle-
aged chemist who had nearly gambled away 
his career. The big win was pulled off by Paul A. 
Hawkinson, the legendary former publisher and 
editor of The Fordyce Letter, a gold-bar publica-
tion in the recruiting industry.
Hawkinson, himself a top recruiter before jour-
nalism struck, made an annual fact-checking 
pilgrimage back to the trenches where he 
served as an unpaid agent for a test-case job 
seeker who was wrestling with a really hard 
problem.
One of those years, a decade ago, Hawkinson 
took on the cause of a chemist who at age 50 
left his profession to take a fling dealing cards 
at a local casino. Five years later, at age 55, the 
chemist suffered career-changer’s remorse and 
desperately wanted to return as an executive 
to the chemistry workplace. But that workplace 
had changed during the five years the chem-
ist was away. Having missed half a decade’s 
technical advances, the chemist’s chances 
were slim to none.
Yet Hawkinson managed to pull victory out 
of nearly certain defeat. How did he do it? He 
chose the resume letter route. After sending a 
well-written resume letter by postal mail to a 
custom list of owners of small chemical com-
panies, Hawkinson was following up on the 
phone when he discovered a caretaker CEO 
job the chemist could fill while the owner took 
an extended two-year trip out of the country. 
Interviewed and hired, the chemist was back 
in the game.
And it all started with a resume letter.

199
 Chapter 11: Resume Letters
Keep an Eye Peeled for Good Writing
Among six resume letter samples in this chapter, you find a range of formality 
and presentations:
 
✓ Top qualities. A savvy lawyer (McKinney) seeking to relocate to a 
senior-level legal counsel position in a multinational corporation writes 
an elegant letter detailing his value proposition. The candidate uses no 
gimmicks, just hard-core competence to sell himself.
 
 A market-tested financial executive (Miller), aims high with a superbly 
constructed letter written in industry terms that confirm he is who he 
says he is.
 
 Busy executives can more easily read letters than study resumes. For 
that reason, supporters of resume letters believe that they are less 
likely than a cover-letter-and-resume package to be bucked down to the 
human resource department never to be seen again.
 
✓ Returning moms. By contrast to the formal and traditional letters, a 
mom (Baker) wants to re-enter the auto industry job market after a two-
year absence because of illness and a wish to consider other career 
fields. She begins with an informal “hook” approach that disarms the 
reader. Adding to that overlay of charm, the job seeker adds a summary 
of impressive experience, capping her letter with three powerful 
testimonials.
 
 Job market reentry issues are good reasons to let the resume letter 
carry the message.
 
✓ 1-2 twists. A blue-collar candidate (Tremaine) relocating to Toronto 
sends a one-page resume letter that politely asks if he may send his 
resume (to communicate the matched-pair concept, I also show you the 
resume in this chapter). But he initially sends only the Stand Out resume 
letter itself. This graphically-enhanced letter is a fusion of essential skill 
facts with testimonials and branding statements, a mixture that breathes 
life into a job application. 
 
 A job reply letter for a facilities director (Brohman) illustrates a different 
kind of a 1-2 twist. Starting with a persuasive first page, the candidate 
attaches an equally riveting accomplishment sheet. The beauty of an 
accomplishment sheet is that not only can it work as a second page of a 
resume letter, but it can also be used in additional ways; if the resume 
letter is sent online or incorporated in a Web portfolio, the categories 

200
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
on the accomplishment sheet can be hyperlinked for more information. 
Additionally, the accomplishment sheet in hard copy can be left behind 
at job interviews.
 
 The creativity displayed in the 1-2 twists of resume letters snares 
attention.
 
✓ Short sweets. A marketing director (Moran) uses a one-page job reply 
letter, a variation of the resume letter. He begins with a way-of-the-
world statement that works because he prefaces it with “As you know.” 
Otherwise such statements risk being perceived as overbearing. The 
rationale given for changing jobs — working closer to his home — 
seems reasonable in a time of record-high transportation costs.
 
 Responding to a job ad with a one-page resume letter is an option to 
mute age issues before an interview 
Unveiling the Resume Letter Samples
Resume letters are designed for targeted mail campaigns, postal or online. 
Should you use a resume letter to reply to an advertised job opening when 
the ad requests a resume? Probably not. But if your flawed resume is likely 
to kill your chances, you have little to lose by trying the resume letter in its 
place. Take pains to make it informative and persuasive.
As you read through the six resume letters in this chapter, notice how well 
each addresses the classic concerns of a harried employer:
 
✓ I don’t know who you are. 
 
✓ I don’t know your work and your reputation.
 
✓ I don’t know what you have that I want.
 
✓ I don’t know why I should read about you, wasting time I don’t have.
 
✓ I don’t know why I shouldn’t trash your letter right now.
 
Maximum message readability is the presentation criterion for each sample 
cover letter in this chapter. To save space in some superb but lengthier 
samples, I had to chop the original boilerplate text leading into the letter — 
most often deleting the recipient’s name, title, company and address. So when 
you see a letter leading off with “[Date, inside address, salutation],” or some 
variation of that, the generic line is merely a reminder that you can’t just say 
“Hey you, read this!” If you’re not sure how to layout your cover letter, turn to 
Chapter 4.

BMW Dealers, Escondido

Escondido, CA 12345
Dear Mr. Garcia:
Any claim that the grass is greener outside the auto-industry-fence is a myth! At least it is for 
me. 
After 20 years of rock-solid experience in our industry, a series of outside opportunities 
briefly tempted me to cast eyes elsewhere. But not for long. 
My inner voice keeps shouting loud and clear that the auto side is where I belong, and that’s 
why I’m selectively contacting you. Hopefully, you will see how adding me to your quality 
operation will be a big win for BMW Dealers.
My progressively responsible experience includes service management, service 
consulting, and service writing. Initiative, drive, and positive attitude teamed with customer 
satisfaction and product know-how have contributed to my documented success:
 
 
 Service Manager, Star Mercedes Benz, Carlsbad, CA: Managed all customer service 
operations. Hired, trained, and supervised a culturally-diverse workforce of 15. 
Additionally, as a member of a leadership management quartette, co-managed a 
separate department of 33 full-time workers. I drove a customer satisfaction winning 
score in the 90s, up from a failing score in the 70s, when I took responsibility. [dates]
 Service Manager, Star Honda, Carlsbad, CA: Managed all customer service operations, 
as well as oversight of equipment purchasing and building maintenance. Hired, 
trained, and supervised a staff of 44 employees. Initiated cross-skills training, attained 
State of California “Green Shop” certification. [dates]
 Service Manager/Service Advisor, Planet Acura, Porsche, & Audi, Carlsbad, CA: 
Maintained customer satisfaction score of 90% or higher for 10 years with increasing 
responsibilities, including managing all used-car reconditioning. Promoted to service 
manager position where I maintained customer service transactions for all three car 
lines. Utilized manufacturer marketing tools to create customer-satisfaction-
     measurement mailings, and management of “units in operation” reports. [dates]

What about dealership operation skills? I am up to speed and ready to roll in software skills, 
including Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint; as well as Visio, Publisher, and Project. 
What about interpersonal skills? How many references shall I provide? I think you’ll find 
that my brand in our industry is this: Susan is a thoroughly competent professional who 
understands that integrity and fair-dealing are essential to remaining viable in business for 
the long run. She’s liked by bosses, coworkers and direct reports for her ability to deal 
genuinely and without arrogance, or when things don’t go her way, without bias or pettiness.
I will contact you on Tuesday afternoon to see when we should meet, and to answer any 
questions you may have concerning my commitment to again water greener grass on a team 
providing great customer service and boosting profits.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely yours,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Susan L. Baker
Good words for Susan:
“Although I thought I should have been saving money on a lower priced car, I kept 
returning to the Porsche dealer because I was treated with such respect by Susan Baker. 
She really understands how to keep customers happy with their service. She once sent a 
car at four in the morning to pick me up when, rushing to the airport, I had an accident 
rolling across roadside brush and wound up with flat tires and tumbleweed and little 
purple flowers growing out of the grill. She’s an American treasure.” 
— Norma Luna, Porsche owner and customer
“When Susan was the handling the customer service ops at Honda, she hired me, a 
woman, giving me a chance to show I could do the work right along with the guys. I’ll 
never forget her fairness in opening an opportunity for me. I’m still here. Thanks, 
Susan.” 
— Leslie Lubinski, service writer
“Susan Baker is so good that if after 30 days on the job, anyone who hires her isn’t 
satisfied with her work, I’ll pay that salary out of my own pocket.” 
— Cory Miller, former Mercedes dealership owner.

Dear Ms. Erickson:
Track, measure, and monitor everything. That’s my moo. How else could I eﬀecvely manage a 400-acre 
commercial property?
For the past 8 years, my employer has beneﬁted from my drive towards eﬃciency in operaons, equipment 
maintenance, inventory control, and staﬀ management. Our facility’s producvity has increased 35% during 
my tenure, as has the commitment and loyalty of our employees who stay at their posts for at least 2-3 years 
from date of hire.
I can do the same for your organizaon.
Whether you’re seeking departmental restructurings, inventory liquidaon, materials usage analysis, internal 
training programs, or regulatory compliance iniaves, I will ﬁnd ways to increase margins and impact 
Excelsior’s boom line. My experse extends into technical project management as well, having coordinated 
the implementaon of an Access database to house ﬁnancial data across 7 departments. Following this 
implementaon, I took it upon myself to train our leadership team on building and generang customized 
reports and e-mail templates to beer serve our clientele.
The cherry on the sundae? My background is in construcon. As a carpenter, painter, plaster worker, and 
concrete worker, I’ve done the jobs of the people I’ll be managing at Excelsior, which means I can earn 
immediate respect from your vendors, contractors, and in-house staﬀ—respect that will most certainly yield 
consistent and exponenal producvity.
Thank you for taking the me to consider my candidacy for this excing opportunity that’s come about in your 
Facilies division. How soon can we talk? I’ll call you before Friday.

Mr. Harry Deiner, Managing Director
The Mellon Group
101 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10174
Dear Mr. Deiner:
A survey by Global Investors of 200 plan sponsors identified the top factors for 
choosing a transition manager. Trading capacity and the manager’s ability to find 
liquidity from diverse sources was number one, followed by cost containment; 
stellar project management skills; a keen ability to identify and deter portfolio, 
operational, and business risk; analysis and reporting capabilities; and 
unwavering integrity. 
With four years’ experience providing market structure expertise in institutional 
sales environments including Gemini Partners and Lisker Limited, and a 12-year 
track record of building and leading sales trading desks for such reputable firms 
as Bank of New York, Lehman Brothers, The Beck Fund, and Wachovia 
Securities, I have built a knowledge base that supports the key competencies of a 
successful transition manager and makes me a valuable asset to a firm seeking 
someone to fill this critical role.
 
Throughout my career, the companies I have been affiliated with experienced 
unprecedented change. Whether the change was precipitated by an inaugural 
desk, a new account, an expanding operation, or an organization in need of 
turnaround solutions, I was always able to embrace the change and deliver 
superior results in very short time frames. During my tenure at Gemini Partners, I 
identified the need for and orchestrated a comprehensive audit of the firm’s trade 
systems, resulting in a 450% reduction in monthly transaction fees and close to a 
25 basis point increase in fund performance. At Lisker, I streamlined a new 
system integration and eliminated project spillovers by leading prospective client 
consultations to qualify organizational risk management needs, articulate solution 
alternatives, and structure financial risk monitoring practices. Through the 
development of a proprietary ranking system at The Beck Fund, I changed the 
way order execution efficiency was measured to successfully mitigate risk and 
reduce costs.

209
 Chapter 11: Resume Letters
  
Each trading desk that I led experienced exponential growth. With that growth 
came enormous change and stress. Year after year I leveraged the positive 
aspects of change to mentor and motivate teams that contributed record-breaking 
earnings for the firms they supported. At Bank of New York, I expanded the 
customer base by 750% in 14 months and was credited with being the catalyst 
that led the nation’s largest biotechnology hedge fund, with $650M under 
management, to change their prime broker to Bank of New York. 
Lehman Brothers presented a different type of challenge that included a culture 
change and a shift to profitability which was evidenced by an 85% jump in 
non-syndicated sales trading credits over a one-year period. Wachovia Securities 
afforded me the opportunity to become the company’s first head trader, and I 
successfully led the firm through the acquisition of over $8B in new business.
In addition, I have held executive sales positions and marketed electronic trading, 
risk analysis and reconciliation software, and institutional market research 
services for Bener Technologies Inc., ERP Brokerage Systems, and Research 
Focus Ltd. My extensive knowledge of the tools available on the market to 
manage trades and risk would afford the firm that employs me a competitive 
advantage when choosing future trade management systems.
Confident that my skill set can be of significant value to your organization, I would 
like to have the opportunity to speak with you in person regarding my credentials 
and I will follow up with you next week to discuss the opportunity for a face-to-face 
meeting. 
Sincerely,
Jerry L. Miller

Senior Vice President, Legal Affairs

Niskayuna, New York 12309
Dear Mr. Jones:
Realizing you have the full view of GE’s legal landscape, I wanted to contact you 
directly (I have issued my resume and profile with human resources through your 
corporate website), and perhaps open a dialogue regarding the potential of my joining 
your company in a senior-level legal counsel role. My resume reflects my background 
and successes, and the following are highlights of what I believe represent my unique 
value to your team:
 Ten years of experience as a corporate officer and senior-level executive 
contributing to high-level strategic and tactical business and legal matters for a US 
Fortune 500 enterprise with worldwide brand recognition. 
 Seventeen-year legal career with specialization in corporate law, international 
business law, intellectual property rights/protection, licensing, patent enforcement, 
market access, export control, and other matters pertinent to a large, diverse 
business.
 Acuity to trade shifts and barriers — regulatory, licensing, competitive, geopolitical 
— business issues, legal matters, policies, ethics, and corporate responsibilities of 
conducting business internationally.
 Vast experience in corporate development, transactional, and commercial matters 
— financings, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, co-licensing agreements, 
domestic/international business startups, service/product rollouts, commercial 
negotiations, capital purchases, service purchase agreements, and leases.
 Superior 
business 
acumen, 
crisis 
management 
expertise, 
high-caliber 
cross-functional management qualifications, and proven leadership talents.

211
 Chapter 11: Resume Letters
  
With experience and an acute and continuing interest in the consumer electronics sector, 
I maintain a broad knowledge of the industry’s relevant and contemporary international 
business activities, commercial trends, regulatory matters, and legal affairs. I am 
confident that my skills and abilities will transfer immediate value to you in the 
following capacities:
 Weighing in on business strategies and legal initiatives that will steer the evolution 
of global positioning.
 Facilitating avoidance, relief, and remedy against intellectual property infringement, 
licensing validity/compliance, countervailing, importation safeguards (global- 
country- or region-specific), market disruption, or other unfair trade threats or 
injuries. 
 Advancing GE’s influence and protecting its interests by applying and/or developing 
in-depth knowledge of industry standards currently impacting the global 
marketplace. 
 Navigating — with financial sensibility — legacy IPR matters, conceiving and 
executing offensive strategies, and creating and implementing preemptive actions 
and policies. 
 Avoiding/mitigating risks and costs associated with corporate initiatives and 
international transactions.
 Contributing my strong network of global, political, and corporate contacts to 
execute winning lobbying strategies. 
 Furthering GE’s goals of continued growth through strong, and sustainable legal 
affairs governance.
Though secure in my current position, I am confidentially conducting a search for a new 
professional challenge within another global enterprise with considerable international 
business activities. The precise area of law I am involved with is not my primary concern 
— I am very well qualified for senior-level corporate counsel roles in a variety of 
capacities; what is crucial to me in joining another organization is that I serve in a 
position in which I can contribute to a team-based endeavor and make a positive impact 
on the larger organization.  
If you can free up a bit of time in the next two weeks, I welcome the opportunity to meet 
with you in person. In the meantime, thank you for your time and consideration; I look 
forward to speaking with you.

Chapter 12
Thank-You and Follow-Up Letters
In This Chapter
▶ Learning from a game-changing collection of post-interview letters
▶ Perceiving the true purpose of follow-up messages
▶ Taking advantage of your last chance to win the job 
T
he biggest self-defeating mistake that too many people make when writ-
ing thank-you letters is merely being polite. Politeness is a good thing, 
but good manners aren’t nearly enough to dramatically raise the odds of 
your getting the job you want in a competitive marketplace.
You need to write job clincher letters, as pro writer Don Orlando terms them. 
Follow-up messages really are sales letters!
In your resume and during your interview, you sold yourself on being a great 
fit for the job — superb qualifications, competencies, skills, experience, and 
interest — all punctuated with true and lively tales of accomplishments. 
Don’t stop the winning streak that got you this far. Instead, use what hap-
pened during the interview to build on it!
The Mechanics of Sales Power
One typical way to begin a follow-up letter is by expressing appreciation for 
the interviewer’s time and for giving you a fresh-from-the-front-lines update 
on the position. Other ideas:
 
✓ Think outside of yourself: Remind the interviewer of what you specifically 
can do for a company, not what a company can do for you. Draw verbal 
links between a company’s immediate needs and your qualifications — 
You want A, I offer A; you want B, I offer B. 

214
Part III: Job Letters: Sample the Best 
 
✓ Elaborate on your experience in handling concerns that were discussed 
during the interview. Write brief paragraphs about how you solved prob-
lems of interest to the company.
 
✓ After researching an issue that the company is wrestling with, include a 
brief but pertinent statement of your findings, perhaps even enclosing a 
relevant news clip about the matter.
 
✓ Add information to a question you didn’t fully answer during the interview.
 
✓ Overcome objections the interviewer expressed about offering you the job.
 
✓ Reaffirm your interest in the position and respect for the company. You 
need not dish enthusiasm with a shovel, but adding a couple of state-
ments about your zest for the company and for the position are basic 
requirements.
 
In this digital age, most people send e-mail thank-you letters. Doing so is usu-
ally fine for garden-variety jobs, especially when the hiring decision is going to 
be made within a few days or so. But for an important job, a typed dead-tree-
industry letter is more impressive and memorable; send it by postal mail, or 
if time is short, via an overnight delivery service. The letter can run two, even 
three pages, if it is flush with white space and easy to read.
Some people swear by handwritten notes, but even when the penmanship is 
good, a note doesn’t readily lend itself to a sales tool when you’re going for 
the win. Even when you’re addressing it to your old college roommate.
Letters to Remember You By
Although most jobs are won or lost during the interview, sometimes the final-
ists are so approximately equal in qualifications that the best-remembered 
candidate wins the position. Letters can revive memories.
Pay attention to the finer points in the following samples from professional 
writers credited at the bottom of each letter:
 
✓ Serious summaries. In an understated but highly effective online 
letter to a nonprofit organization’s selection committee, a candidate 
(Motneau) summarizes the three main concerns of the committee, both 
numbering and underscoring them.
 
 Another summary sample, this one from a contender for an emergency 
control management position (Scott), uses a version of the two-column 
“you want — I offer” formula. “Your Needs” and “My Qualifications” 
head up the matching language.

215
 Chapter 12: Thank-You and Follow-Up Letters
 
 An alternate version of the matching formula appears in the two-page 
sample for a hopeful (Cary) who seeks an unspecified human resource 
position. The candidate headlines key concerns by repeating the phrase 
“I have met the challenges of . . .”
 
 Yet another candidate competes for a position as a senior budget ana-
lyst (Woods) by listing six key competencies in bullet-bold statements.
 
 A letter that gets straight to the point by summarizing core job require-
ments represents an aspirant (Daniels) who seeks to become a national 
accounts manager in an industry in which he lacks experience.
 
 Thank-you letters are a contender’s last easy chance to cement a “best 
of the bunch” image. They are especially valuable to stimulate favorable 
memories when a candidate interviewed early in the selection process is 
followed by equally strong competitors.
 
✓ Human glimpses. A candidate for a teaching assistant position (Byers) at 
a school for the hearing-impaired refers to her nurturing personality — 
“Feeling empathy and relating well to others are in my DNA.”
 
 Another candidate (Phillips) shows her human dimension to nab a 
competitive slot in a physician assistant degree program. How? She 
describes her project to surgically assist two poor children from Bolivia. 
 
 Revealing admirable human characteristics and sharing an unusual story 
are other Stand Out techniques that make a candidate unforgettable.
 
✓ Combination competencies. A bidder (Scardino) for an industrial video 
maker’s production job doesn’t have the exact experience desired (but 
it would be a mistake to baldly state that fact). Instead, the candidate 
gamely asserts that a combination of facets in his background qualify 
him for the position.
 
 Zeroing in on the most important job requirements — those that specifi-
cally fit the candidate’s qualifications — makes a persuasive case for 
winning the offer.
 
✓ Postscript deal-sealers. A legal administrative assistant (Morris) 
reminds the interviewer of her mastery of the position’s required skills 
and comes across as a pleasant person to work with. Her P.S. assures 
the reader that she’s a quick and enthusiastic learner.
 
 A candidate seeking an IT solutions analyst position (Patel) uses a post-
script to call attention to one more impressive reason to hire him.
 
 A postscript is eye candy. Shrewd writers don’t waste this valuable 
space on “oops-I forgot” statements, but instead use it to impel the read-
er’s interest. (See Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Thoughtful enclosures. A new graduate (Anthony) reminds the inter-
viewer that he has a leg up on a human resources position because of 
his education and internship experiences. As a topper, he encloses a rel-
evant article about a topic discussed during the interview.

 Including a tidbit of information helpful to the employer — a print news 
clipping, a link to an online news clipping, an obscure but vital industry 
report, follow-up information on a topic discussed during the interview, 
useful Web site addresses — reinforces a candidate’s positive image.
 
✓ International flavors. A candidate (Danzig) wishing to become the 
director of an international programs center at a United Arab Emirates 
university expresses her interest with an online letter following a video-
conference meeting. Correspondence with potential employers out of 
country is more traditional and formal.
 
 Globalization, new technology, and shifting job markets mean that candi-
dates with a modern mindset go to the front of the line.
 
✓ Hard-selling pitches. A commercial real estate sales manager (Anderson) 
writes a strong and convincing letter explaining why he can deliver deals 
even in a city where he doesn’t know the real estate turf.
 
 Reinforcing an ability to bridge a divide — using rationales of crossover 
skills (see Chapter 7) and networking skills (see Chapter 10) — a moti-
vated job seeker can wind up on the right side of a hiring decision. 
 
✓ Resurrection letters. After two weeks of deafening silence, a competi-
tor (Chapman) for an employee relations coordinator reconnects with 
humor and subtlety.
 
 Any approach other than a whiney or accusative “Why haven’t you had 
the courtesy to get back to me?” is a good move when silence sucks up 
the oxygen in a job search. Humor is a winner.
Set Your Eyes on Stand Out Samples!
In the samples to come, you find Stand Out ways to market yourself with a 
thank-you or follow-up letter. As in other chapters, the name of the profes-
sional writer of each letter appears beneath it. For more information about 
the writers, turn to the appendix.
 
Maximum message readability is the presentation criterion for each sample 
cover letter in this chapter. To save space in some superb but lengthier 
samples, I had to chop the original boilerplate text leading into the letter — 
most often deleting the recipient’s name, title, company and address. So when 
you see a letter leading off with “[Date, inside address, salutation],” or some 
variation of that, the generic line is merely a reminder that you can’t just say 
“Hey you, read this!” If you’re not sure how to layout your cover letter, turn to 
Chapter 4.

Subject: VP, Marketing position; Selection Task Force
Dear [Name of Task Force Chair]:
Thank you and each of your task force members for taking the time to meet with me this 
week to discuss the position of Vice President, Marketing.  I enjoyed our discussion about 
your organization, its philosophy, and its goals and objectives for the years ahead.
I highlight again some of the key initiatives I would explore as vice president. The goals I 
would strive to meet are threefold:  (1) strategic growth and development; (2) brand consis-
tency and growth; and (3) appropriate uses of Internet technology.
With respect to strategy, I will create a roadmap for the organization’s growth which will 
include benchmarks for assessing goals. As you may recall, I created strategic plans of this 
nature in connection with my earlier leadership role for Fire Solutions America, which 
included creation of a blueprint document that I subsequently used in consulting activities 
with other companies. 
With respect to brand consistency, I will review all uses of the brand in print and online media 
to ensure that it is being accurately represented. In addition, I will conduct an internal audit of 
the brand among members and volunteers to get their perceptions of the brand.  This audit, 
together with an understanding of what competing organizations are doing, will assist in 
developing a platform to determine how far to grow, expand, and stretch the brand.
Finally, each of the above goals involves the use of Internet technology, particularly an 
assessment of the social media landscape. To meet the goal of effectively using Internet 
technology, I will conduct research to determine where members go for information on 
business issues, including their favorite blogs and online publications.  Information of this 
nature will help identify destination sites for the syndication of content to position the 
organization as a thought leader.
As you can see, I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further or answer any 
questions you may have. I hope “It’s a go!”
Sincerely,
Kevin Motneau

Dear Don:
I enjoyed meeting you and the team on June 13th and 21st and want to reiterate my 
strong interest in the Solutions Analyst position.  I understand that you are looking at 
additional candidates, and I’d like to take this opportunity to review what I can bring to 
this role for the ISMIBC Corporation.
My experience has been a combination of pre- and post-sales, always centered on the 
business aspects of IT.  My roles have involved exchanging knowledge between 
Sales/Marketing and Engineering/Services departments, with a strong customer focus.
I enjoy change and look forward to a role that constantly challenges me with something 
new. I have successfully worked independently and in groups. More specifically, I’ve 
gathered requirements from various experts and stakeholders, analyzed and synthesized 
the information and written functional, product, and technical specifications, in 
addition to being the primary responder to RFIs and RFPs.
While not an engineer from the information storage and management industry, I 
believe my years of varied experience in pre- and post-sales, customer focus, and 
people skills will bring the fresh perspective ISMIBC Corporation is seeking.
I look forward to hearing back from you.
Regards and best wishes,

Dear Mrs. Gumbo:
It was a pleasure to speak with you earlier today. I hope that you are even half as 
excited about my application materials and skills as I am about the opportunities for 
business graduates within your organization.  
As I detailed in our discussion, I graduated with honors and excelled in the business 
department through the creation of clubs and participation in internship experi-
ences. My career portfolio showcases my accomplishments. Although we did not 
have time to look through the portfolio today, just give me the word to set up a 
mutually convenient time to do so. 
To reiterate some of the things we spoke of, I would be able to immediately help 
the organization with the creation of a human resources/new employee manual 
because of my previous internship experience. I was encouraged because you 
mentioned this as an immediate need. Because of my skills and the rapport I 
developed with the staff during my group interview, I have reason to believe that I 
would be an excellent addition to your team. 
After leaving your office, I was fortunate enough to find the enclosed article in the

Mr. Steven Wexler, President  
Princeton Equity Services
190 Wabash Avenue, Suite 120 
Chicago, IL 60661
Dear Steve:
 
Since leaving our meeting on Thursday, I have thought at great length about our discussion, the 
tremendous opportunity that appears to be present in the Chicago market, and the value I bring to your 
organization.
 
First and foremost, I am a dealmaker and marketer, able to identify and capture opportunities 
that have driven strong revenue and asset performance. I tackle each new project with a two-pronged 
focus: (1) negotiate the best possible transaction that, as trite as it may sound, truly is a “win-win” deal 
for all partners; and (2) create strategic and tactical marketing programs that consistently create value, 
dominance, and earnings.
 
My efforts can easily be measured by gains in the value of real estate holdings and improved 
project cash flows. Full financial documentation can be disclosed (without conceding the confidentiality of 
Maxxen Properties). I have maximized the value of each asset under management and transitioned 
“average” properties into “top” performers. 
 
You’re right. I have never worked in the Chicago market. However, I have demonstrated my 
ability to build presence within other new markets nationwide (e.g., Atlanta, Southern California). Further, 
I have an extensive network of contacts across the country, many of whom are well connected in Chicago 
and will be of significant value in facilitating the start of my own regional network.
 
I have always been fortunate in that networking is a natural process for me. I am able to 
quickly ascertain who it is that I must establish a relationship with, identify the appropriate channels to do 
so, and quickly begin the process. In turn, despite often unfamiliar territories and personalities, I have 
quickly established myself in key markets nationwide. I am not daunted by challenge, but rather 
motivated to succeed and beat the odds.
 
I hope that you and I have the opportunity to continue our discussions and certainly appreciate 
the amount of time you spent with me last week. I guarantee that I can not only meet your expectations, 
but exceed them.
Sincerely,
Quincy Anderson

Director of Admissions
Emory University Physician Assistant Program
1400 Clifton Road, Suite 500
Atlanta, GA 30322
Dear Mr. Matthews:
Thank you and the Emory Admissions Committee for providing me the opportunity to interview for 
the Emory Physician Assistant Program. Emory's PA Program remains my first choice. My reason for 
writing to you is threefold: to emphasize my continued interest in your program, provide you with an 
updated resume, and to advise you of a recent opportunity that has arisen providing me with 
“real-world” experience helping the medically underserved. 
During a recent trip to Bolivia, a patient called our attention to two very poor young children who 
needed surgery. The patient asked Dr. Robert Mitchell, the orthopedic surgeon whom I support, if he 
could help. After reviewing the X-rays, Dr. Mitchell agreed that yes, indeed, the two kids are in dire 
need of surgery but said it would have to be done in the United States. That’s where I entered the 
scene: Dr. Mitchell asked me to serve as the primary fundraiser and liaison for this humanitarian 
project.
Over the next few weeks, I will reach out to such facilities as the Ronald McDonald House to house 
the children and their families while they are receiving treatment. (I’ve been a fund raiser for Ronald 
McDonald for several years while I was at Georgia Tech.) Additionally, Dr. Mitchell and I will be 
working to recruit surgeons and find a facility to take on these cases. It’s a great feeling to know that 
we can make a significant impact on the lives of these two little children.
The broad scope of the Emory PA Program provides me with all of the essential elements I seek in 
order to become a well-balanced Physician Assistant, and I want the opportunity to be a part of that 
community. Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

120 Robert Trent Avenue
Columbia, SC 27104
Dear Charles:
 
First of all, thank you. I really enjoyed our conversation the other day and am 
completely enamored with the tremendous success you have bought to PYD. There are but a 
handful of companies that have experienced such aggressive growth and can predict strong 
and sustained profitability over the years to come. 
 
I would like to be a part of the PYD team — in whatever capacity you feel most 
appropriate and of most value. I realize, of course, that you already have an HR Director who 
has successfully managed the function throughout the course of the company’s development. 
It is not my intention to compete with Leslie Smith, but rather to complement her efforts and 
bring new HR leadership to the organization.
 
Let me highlight what I consider to be my most valuable assets:
 
I have met the challenges of accelerated recruitment:
 
• In [date], I launched a recruitment initiative to replace 50% of the total workforce  
 
 
in a 900-person organization. This was accomplished within just six months and  
 
 
was the key driver in that organization’s successful repositioning.
 
• In [date], when hired as the first-ever HR executive for a growth organization, I  
 
 
created the entire recruitment, selection, and placement function. Over the next  
 
 
two years, I hired more than 50 employees to staff all core operating departments.
 
• Between [date] and [date], I spearheaded the recruitment and selection of  
 
 
technical, professional, and management personnel. This was a massive effort  
 
 
during which time I interviewed over 300 prospective candidates throughout the  
 
 
U.S. and Europe.
 
I have met the challenges of employee retention:
 
• During my employment with Helms Financial, we were staffing at an   
 
 
unprecedented rate. The faster an organization grows, the more critical the focus  
 
 
must become. Costs associated with recruitment can be significant and must be  
 
 
controlled. Following implementation of a market-based research study, I was  
 
 
able to reduce Helm’s turnover 35%, saving over $350,000 in annual costs.

I have met the challenges of international human resource leadership:
 
• Throughout my tenure with Laxton Data, I led the organization’s International  
 
 
 
Employment & Employee Relations function. This was a tremendous experience  
 
 
 
during which time I developed strong qualifications in both domestic and  
 
 
 
expatriate recruitment, compensation, benefits administration, and relocation.  
 
 
 
Further, I demonstrated my proficiency in cross-cultural communications and  
 
 
 
business management. I traveled extensively and am comfortable in diverse  
 
 
 
situations.
 
I have met the challenges of organizational change through development   
 
and acquisition:
 
• Each of the organizations in which I have been employed has faced unique  
 
 
 
operating and leadership challenges. These situations have been diverse and  
 
 
 
included high-growth, turnaround, and internal reorganization. Each has focused   
 
 
on improved performance and accelerated market/profit growth through  
 
 
 
development of its human resources and management competencies. To meet  
 
 
 
these challenges, I have created innovative, market-driven organizational  
 
 
 
structures integrating pioneering strategies in competency-based recruitment and   
 
 
performance.
 
• Most recently, I orchestrated the workforce integration of two acquisitions into 
 
 
core business operations. This required a comprehensive analysis of staffing  
 
 
 
requirements, evaluation of the skills and competencies of the acquired employees,  
 
 
and accurate placement throughout the organization. The integration was  
 
 
 
successful, and all personnel are now fully acclimated and at peak performance.
 
I hope that the above information demonstrates the value I bring to PYD — today and in

n an ancient legend that shows up in various cultures, blind men who had 
never seen an elephant decide that each would examine one small part 
by touch and, based on their own individual experience, figure out what an 
elephant looks like. Unsurprisingly, they each came up with a different per-
ception. The man who feels the elephant’s leg, for example, says an elephant 
is like a pillar, but the man who touches the elephant’s tail says an elephant 
is like a rope.
The take-away: Different people can have distinctly different perceptions of 
the same thing.
That thought perfectly describes what I found when I went looking for 
examples of professional branding statements and online profiles. Opinions 
vary among experts about everything from the length of the documents to 
whether they should be written in the first or third person. That’s why this 
chapter presents an assortment of sample styles on both branding state-
ments and online profiles.
Styling Your Professional Brand
 
Branding is a marketing concept and tool. It is a way to stand out from the 
teeming masses of competition for the best jobs. Without getting too philo-
sophical about professional branding statements — also called personal brand-
ing statements and branding briefs — here’s how I see a professional branding 
statement’s contribution to your job search.

236
Part IV: Online Messages: Sample the Best 
 
Your professional brand is the essence of who you are in the workplace. Your 
brand reflects your professional reputation — what you’re known for (or 
would like to be known for). When your reputation is a good one, it includes 
marketable distinctions like positive characteristics and achievements.
Breaking the concept into manageable pieces, professional branding state-
ments explain
 
✓ Your specialty — who you are
 
✓ Your service — what you do
 
✓ Your audience — who you do it for
 
✓ Your best characteristic — what you’re known for
Put all the pieces together, and you end up with something a little like this:
I’m a Computer Technology Manager and Biomedical Engineer keep-
ing the machines running smoothly from desktop to the treatment 
room. Not for my health, for yours. — Chris Welch
As Alison Doyle, the Job Search guide for About.com, explains, “There may 
not be much difference between personal and professional branding, but 
from my perspective, your professional brand is what matters to a potential 
employer, networking contact, or anyone who can help you find a job or grow 
your career.”
You can use professional branding statements in many ways, including the 
following:
 
✓ Incorporated into cover letters, online profiles, and other job search 
messages
 
✓ Printed on the back of business cards
 
✓ Incorporated in elevator speeches (really quick pitches)
 
✓ Spoken in job interviews (“Tell me about yourself”)
 
✓ Used in networking connections
An extra benefit of writing a professional branding statement is that doing so 
wonderfully concentrates your mind in answering the questions, “Who am I 
and why am I in this workplace?”
Professional branding for the little guy
We easily get that Tiger Woods’ brand is golf excellence and Angelina Jolie’s 
brand is movie stardom. But what about mere mortals who can’t make such 
distinctive claims?

237
 Chapter 13: Branding Statements and Online Profiles
Joe Turner and Sue Swenson have suggestions. Authors of Paycheck 911: 
Don’t Panic . . . Power Your Job Search! (Swenson Turner Publications, 2008), 
they recommend that you begin to think about your professional brand by 
first deciding how you are accountable to the bottom line. Does your job 
make or save money for an employer? You may directly make money for the 
company through production or sales. Or, realizing that time is money, you 
may be an administrative assistant who routinely spares a boss untold mun-
dane minutia each day, saving the company time and money it can invest to 
make more money elsewhere.
Capitalizing on your status as a maker or saver of money, move on to flesh out 
a professional branding statement that recognizes the skills and benefits you 
bring to a lucky new employer. Among many examples of professional brand-
ing statements given by Turner and Swenson in their book are these two:
I am a seasoned administrative assistant whose specialty is client-
phone relationship building, creating a solid bond with our clients that 
strengthens the sales link with my company.
I am a safety coordinator with a strength in training and program 
implementation that helped reduce workers’ compensation claims by 
37 percent over a four-year period for my current employer.
Take thoughtful moments to craft your professional branding statement and 
be inspired by how others did it.
Bringing on the branding samples
The dozen professional branding statements that follow were created by free-
agent writers whose names appear beneath their work.
A Whiz of a Sales Executive
I was born knowing about selling the sizzle, not the steak. An executive 
risk taker, I drive business to the next level. Application of enthusiastic 
confidence generates new customers and competitively positions prod-
ucts. I consistently overcome obstacles and generate product loyalty 
while increasing company’s profits and global market recognition.
Kathleen Marshall, NRWA — Medford, N.J.
A Teacher Who Uses Appealing Learning Technique
As a dedicated educator, I stimulate curiosity and make learning 
approachable and rewarding for all students. I implement a unique 
teaching technique that successfully addresses individualized learning

variables by incorporating sight, written, and hearing applications in all 
material presentations. I get good outcomes: Improved test results by

Kathleen Marshall, NRWA — Medford, N.J.
A Turnaround Ace
I rescue troubled companies. I have a documented track record of busi-
ness development, operational planning, and leadership.
My ability to find solutions that lead to success, foster team cohesion, 
pursue excellence, and work with a high degree of integrity has become 
my brand. In one case, I led a company through unparalleled growth and 
success, increasing revenue from $30 million to $60 million. In another, 
guided a company through a downturn, shifting from a privately owned 
company to a public company. In still another, managed significant soft-
ware changeover/upgrade for more accurate and timely processing of 
accounting functions, inventory reports, and financial statements.
Sheri K. Czar, CPRW — Lake Oswego, Ore.
A Helpful Career Coach
I leverage my avid love of learning and mastery of online technology to 
facilitate career management for trend-setting professionals who strive to 
be dynamic and high achieving in their business.
Kristen A. Jacoway, CRC, CPRW, CCC, CPBS — Seneca, S.C.
A Career Management Natural
Before I moved into the trenches of actually experiencing the workplace 
or studying its dynamics, I successfully — but informally — advised 
legions of friends on their career choices.
Now, after gaining HR generalist employment in the allied health field 
and completing the HR certificate program at the University of Lowell, I 
realize that the ability to guide individuals in career management issues 
comes naturally to me.
Gail Frank, NCRW, CPRW, JCTC, CEIP — Tampa, Fla. 
A Change Agent in Human Affairs
As a catalyst for positive change, I have a history of engaging board and 
staff members to generate new ideas and increase overall performance. 
I am adept at establishing policies, procedures, and technologies to 
enhance efficiency, financial health, and service to organize constituents. 
I enjoy building and strengthening strategic alliances. My passion is to 
guide nonprofits, specifically those focused on youth empowerment, to 
achieve new heights.

IT is me, Tracy Hammond.
With more than 10 years of interesting experience in Information 
Technology, it’s been my work and my pleasure to contribute to major 
initiatives that increased revenue, brought repeat business, and fueled 
company growth. I feel good every time I deliver challenging projects 
on time and under budget. Some little girls play with dolls; I played with 
computers. I grew up to become an accomplished Senior Consultant in 
my career field.
Michelle Penn, CPRW — Granite City, Ill.
A Woman Who Speaks “Solutions”
One of the costliest and most painful points in any project is when fail-
ures in communication regarding scope and requirements cause delays, 
functional gaps, and scope creep.
Analysis is primarily about communication: asking the right questions, 
listening to the answers. It’s about documenting and communicating 
capabilities, expectations, and outcomes. It’s about speaking everyone’s 
language.
I have contributed to the success of a variety of projects in analysis and 
IT roles for over eight years. I’m all about timely execution, clean and 
clear communication, and consistent leadership.
I speak business. I speak technology. I speak solutions. My fluency will 
save you time, frustration, and money.
I’m listening.

can be an impact contributor at the outset.

 Chapter 13: Branding Statements and Online Profiles
Creating Your Online Profile
Online profiles are creatures of many hues. They range from (short) keyword-
driven text messages, to (long) documents with Hollywood production values 
and reams of descriptive writing. Here’s the short and long of crafting an 
online profile.
Short stories
The online executive bio — also called online executive summary and online 
executive brief — is used to advance employment or business objectives. The 
profiles are searchable: Employers can search for the profiles they want, such as 
financial manager, pipefitter, and so on. Nourished by keywords, a short  
profile — about 200 words or fewer — is found on social networking sites and 
job boards. The short profile includes a link to a full resume (or more — see the 
“Long stories” section that follows) but omits a photo. When an online executive 
bio captures interest, the recruiter clicks through to a candidate’s resume.
 
What can you do when you’re filing a resume in a large bureaucratic system 
and fear it won’t be seen by the right decision-maker? Federal job expert 
Kathryn Troutman encourages her clients to e-mail a short executive bio as an 
introduction letter to an agency hiring manager, and to confirm by postscript 
that a full resume is available in the official federal system.
Long stories
The online profile originally developed as an instrument of social engagement on 
such social networking sites as MySpace and Facebook. The early expressions 
of online identity mentioned or linked to many personal factors — pictures, 
gender, home town, occupation, alma mater, and taste in music and romantic 
The B words: Boasting versus branding
To claim that you are the best swimmer in the 
world is bragging. But to back such a claim 
by winning eight gold medals while setting 
seven world records as did Michael Phelps in 
the Beijing Olympic Games is — drum roll — 
branding.
Bragging is boasting, often in an obvious or 
arrogant manner to make oneself seem more 
important. Branding, on the other hand, is based 
on more than empty rhetoric any copywriter 
can dream up. Believable branding must stand 
up to inspection in the glare of bright light: Do 
you walk the walk when you talk the talk?

242
Part IV: Online Messages: Sample the Best 
relationships. Socially focused pages have evolved into social marketing presen-
tations for commerce and careers.
In contrast to online executive bios, online profiles are multi-link creations 
that appear on Internet networking sites like LinkedIn and Visual CV.
Long online profiles present some combination of features from a wide range 
of digitally-based options: 
 
✓ Professional branding statements
 
✓ Qualifications summaries 
 
✓ Accomplishment sheets 
 
✓ Blogs
 
✓ RSS (Real Simple Syndication) feeds
 
✓ Reports and press releases
 
✓ Publications, books, newsletters
 
✓ Videos, videoclips, audio bites 
 
✓ Recommendations, testimonials
 
✓ Association memberships, affinity groups
 
✓ Honors
 
✓ Interests, hobbies
 
✓ Connections to other people
 
✓ Photos
 
✓ Resumes available in three variations — PDF, MS Word, and text
Elaborate online profiles with flashy graphics and serial links (like a nest of 
boxes, each of which fits into the next larger box) are updated and slicker 
versions of earlier Web portfolios. The high end of the long online profiles 
are usually professionally produced for high-achieving professionals who are 
always open to employment offers they can’t refuse and for entrepreneurs 
who use the profiles as an advertising medium to attract business.
For more information about online profiles, check out Chapters 2 and 16.
 
Never in history has so much information been available about so many 
people. And the information is for all eyes on publically accessible Web pages. 
Hundreds of millions of people worldwide have expressed their likes and 
dislikes — and sometimes their innermost feelings. Corporations use profile 
information to specifically market products to you. Identity thieves use profile 
information to rob you. Think before posting.
Online profiles are yet another facet of the expanding body of job search mes-
sage tools and are represented by the following eight samples that follow.

W
hen you’re rushed for time and need to move fast to get your 
resume out and about quickly, consider using an e-mail cover note 
to introduce it.
E-mail cover notes — kid siblings to cover letters — have grown in use by 
orders of magnitude in just the past decade. By comparison to cover letters, 
the cover note kids are very short — usually one to three brief paragraphs. 
You typically send an e-mail cover note in text, not as an attachment. Your 
resume may follow in text or be attached in an MS Word or PDF document.
When you need to do a more persuasive job of self-marketing than a few 
brief paragraphs allow, follow a cover note with a cover letter and a resume 
attached in a single Word or PDF doc, or in separate docs. When you do send 
two attachments, one for your cover letter and the second for your resume, 
add a message like this:
Two documents are attached — my cover letter and my resume. 
Please review. Thank you.
This request, although terse, may put pressure on recruiters to open and 
look at the e-mail’s attachments.
Here are a few tips for writing your cover notes:
 
✓ The subject line of your e-mail sparks a reading of your cover note, 
which sparks a reading of your resume. Power each one with a sales 
message that causes the reviewer to keep on scrolling.

250
Part IV: Online Messages: Sample the Best 
 
✓ Use names of mutual friends or other connections, list matching quali-
fications to job requirements, and try for fresh, eye-catching phrasing, 
unless you’re applying for seriously serious work like buttoned-down 
banking or brain surgeon jobs.
 
✓ Practice writing the long story short until you get the hang of it. Send 
your finished work to yourself and read it over the next day to judge 
whether it’s still as brilliant as it was the day you wrote it.
Cover Notes Offer Spanking Smart Start
The 18 cover notes that begin on the next page are examples of the kind of 
message you can send online to introduce your digital resume. Generally, 
cover notes are more informal than cover letters. The names of their writers 
are printed beneath each sample; a directory of all writers appears in this 
book’s appendix. I comment on each cover note:
 
✓ Nurse Uses Top 10 Lure. Employers are impressed with candidates who 
are in the top 10 percent of their class. Even in a talent-short category, 
such as RNs with a bachelor’s degree, the candidate, leaving little to 
chance, mentions other positive points as well.
 
✓ Assistant Headlines Industry Experience. A candidate for a job on the 
plant floor adds references from previous employers to establish his 
ability to do the job that he wants.
 
✓ Executive Features Big Name Background. Employers may use “Fortune 
100” and the names of premier brands as keywords. Keywords are search 
terms that recruiters search for to choose the most qualified candidates.
 
✓ Paralegal Scores in Talent-Short Specialty. A paralegal uses the subject 
to banner herself as careful, specialized in trademarks, and profession-
ally trained.
 
✓ Multilingual Consultant Fits International Desk. The candidate makes 
clear that he can work in the global marketplace and speaks several 
languages.
 
✓ Designer Stands Out with Skills, Education. Using bullet points to flag 
qualifications, a candidate spreads out a cover note to take advantage of 
white space and openness for easy reading.
 
✓ Events Director Shines with Achievements. Quantitative achievements 
(measuring with numbers) are effectively used in this cover note.

251
 Chapter 14: E-Mail Cover Notes
 
✓ HR Manager Stresses Experience, Excellence. In a field where manag-
ers often are conservative, a candidate plays it safe with a traditional 
approach. Experience and reliability (“rock-solid”) are positive attributes.
 
✓ Young Banker Asks for Short Phone Interview. A candidate who 
posted his resume on a specific Web site was advised that a given 
employer had reviewed it. Immediately the candidate followed up 
expressing interest in continued exchanges.
 
✓ Professional Confirms Group Insider Status. “Ask the man who owns 
one” was a classic slogan for an automobile line suggesting that custom-
ers are the ultimate authority on the value of a product. Echoing that 
theme, a candidate applies for a job at a social networking service she 
regularly uses.
 
✓ Adjuster Concisely States Expertise. A thoroughly seasoned claims 
adjuster responds to a posting on a company’s Web site in a straightfor-
ward manner. Creativity may not be appreciated so much in insurance 
payment processing occupations.
 
✓ Retail Manager Covers Key Points. A manager who has been around 
long enough to know all the verses in the retail repertoire bags attention 
with an offer to make money for a new employer, cites frequent promo-
tion to back up his claims, and interjects a smile at the end.
 
✓ Unusual Networking to Social Agency. The candidate uses editorial 
rather than advertising content to spot an individual who can influence 
her future and makes a bold move to meet her potential benefactor. This 
sample can also be considered a networking cover note. By any classifi-
cation, the uncommon strategy paid off in real life with a new job.
 
✓ Networker Follows Up Job Lead. The seeker of an office manager posi-
tion puts the mutual contact in the subject where it can’t be missed.
 
✓ Law Graduate Offers to Travel to Interview. The new graduate not only 
mentions his contact in the subject but also compliments the employer 
and offers to travel back home to interview on the Fall break.
 
✓ From Friend to Friend: Help! This cover note is a classic way to tap into 
a personal network to line up a referral. 
 
✓ Transitioning Marine Sells His Skills. A military service member, who 
may be on board ship or overseas, suggests immediate contact by tele-
phone or online as a means of encouraging the employer not to hire 
anyone before interviewing him.
 
✓ Hot Shot Learns from Mistakes. No shrinking violet, the assertive sales 
manager also shows humility and willingness to learn new things.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
D
ig into short chapters rife with quick bits about job 
letters. In them, I offer guidance on avoiding unnec-
essary mistakes and ways to best represent who you are 
when you’re writing online profiles. Cozying up to the 
chapters in this part is a directory of the professional 
writers whose work appears in this book.

Chapter 15
 Ten Urban Legends to Toss
In This Chapter
▶ Myths that undermine your chances to book interviews
▶ Mistakes and misconceptions that keep you unemployed
C
over letters live in the misty atmosphere of urban legends. Many people 
think they’re an optional exercise in the job-finding game, evaluating 
cover letters as baggage that no one pays attention to. (Chapter 1 discusses 
that point in detail.)
People for whom cover letters are off the radar may cut corners in a variety 
of ways. For instance, they use canned pitches or address their correspon-
dence to a title rather than to a human. Or they softly mumble hopes that 
employers will find it in their hearts to call them for interviews.
They accept on face value cover-letter urban legends, such as the ones that 
follow. But, after reading this book, you know better, right?
It’s Okay to Send Your Resume 
without a Cover Letter
False! That is, unless you like sending your resume into other people’s dump-
sters. Make sure that a results-oriented cover letter is a sidekick to your 
resume.
When your letter — or other job-finding document — opens up with a com-
pelling first paragraph (see Chapter 6), readers ask “What happens next?” 
or say “Tell me more.” Sales points confirming your benefits for a specific 
employer follow, concluding with your promise to follow up. Your cover 
letter stamps a personality on your resume — a personality that the reader 
may find tough to reject out of hand.

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Your Cover Letter Summarizes 
Your Resume
False! A summary of your resume and your resume with a summary seem a 
little repetitive, don’t you agree? Use a cover letter to add a warm handshake 
to your resume and to concentrate on why the employer should be inter-
ested in you and why time interviewing you would be well invested.
Your cover letter puts your resume in context, drawing attention to your ben-
efits and presenting non-resume material that can make the difference between 
you and your closest competitor when the interviewing decision is made.
A Cover Letter Merely Transmits 
Your Resume
False! Your cover letter is much more than a routing slip for your resume. 
Your letter is also ultimately a silent force, enticing the reader to scour your 
resume. A number of employers believe cover letters are more important 
than resumes when choosing candidates to interview. If your cover letter 
doesn’t flesh out the person presented in your resume, you may never get to 
meet its reader.
You Can Routinely Use a Generic 
Greeting — “Dear Employer”
False! Put yourself on the other side of the desk. Imagine that your job is to 
screen applicants, and that every letter you read begins with “Dear Sir” or 
“Dear Gentlepeople” or “Dear Job Application Screener” or, worse, “To Whom 
It May Concern.” In effect, you’re saying “Dear Nobody.” How would you feel 
if you were that nobody? Aim for respect, respect, and respect.
Research your target organization (see Chapter 4) until you have the name 
and gender of the person who will make the hiring decision (usually the line 
manager) or the interviewing decision (usually a company in-house screener 
or outside third-party screener). Double-check for correct spelling and 
proper titles. (See Chapter 4 for more information about the anatomy of a 
cover letter.)

267
 Chapter 15: Ten Urban Legends to Toss
Admittedly, despite your best efforts, sometimes you simply cannot uncover 
the name of the decision-maker or the screener reading your letter. When 
you can’t uncover the correct name and must rely on a generic greeting, the 
salutations “Dear Employer” or “Dear Hiring Authority” are as good as any.
 
What can you do to properly address blind online job postings when you have 
no clue to the employer’s identity? Usually very little, but if the address of a 
Web site is in the posting (other than that of a job board), take a flyer and visit 
Allwhois (www.allwhois.com) to uncover the name of the Web site’s owner 
and contact information. Allwhois automatically locates the appropriate 
“whois” database server for a particular domain name, queries that database 
for information about the domain name, and returns all available data.
Keep Your Cover Letter 
Really, Really Short
False! The length of your cover letter depends not upon absolute rules of 
measurement, but upon the amount of content you must convey to show why 
you should be interviewed.
After advising flexibility over page count, here are my personal preferences: 
When the letter escorts a resume, I suggest limiting the letter to one page; 
when the letter substitutes for a resume (see Chapter 11), two pages is an 
appropriate length — unless you’re that rare master of long-copy advertising 
pitches, in which case you can go on as long as the reader doesn’t sink into 
slumber.
 
Devote one paragraph to each salient point. The short-paragraph technique 
maintains your letter’s richness even when skimmed in the blink of an eye. 
Make your Stand Out cover letter just long enough to accommodate all your 
main-selling-point benefits and to motivate the reader to review your resume 
and meet with you.
A Handwritten Cover Letter 
Is Best — It’s Personal
False! Although the vast majority of cover letters and resumes are transmit-
ted over the Internet today, a small number still travel by paper.
For those job letters on paper, handwriting is certainly personal, but the 
downside is two-fold:

268
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Employers may assume you’re in a time warp and costume yourself in 
cobwebs if you don’t use a computer’s word processor.
 
✓ They may be unable to read your penmanship.
If an employer wants a sample of your handwriting for analysis, the employer 
will request one. Your only handwriting in a cover letter should be your sig-
nature at the end, written in black or blue ink.
If You Can’t Find a Job, 
the Letter Is at Fault
False! Your marketing materials, such as a cover letter or resume, can 
become an easy focus for your anxieties about a job search. Many of the 
moving parts of the employment process are frustratingly placed beyond 
your control — voicemail keeps you from reaching a preferred employer, job 
openings for your target seem to go underground, and interviews fail to spark 
job offers.
By contrast, the preparation of a cover letter and resume is entirely under 
your control. When things go wrong, blaming the marketing materials is con-
venient but justified only when you aren’t being given interviews.
Job seekers often think that if only they can whip their marketing materials 
into perfect shape, the other parts of the search will turn out favorably. Not 
really. The truth is, all parts of your search must be up and running.
The Letter Is Your Chance to Discuss 
Your Personal Life and Feelings
False! Your resume talks about you; your cover letter talks about your 
intended employer — and how your employer can benefit from the splendid 
assets you offer.
Rambling on about personal feelings, situations, and long-term ambitions in 
an employment letter is a monument to self-interest, but worse — it’s boring. 
An exception can be made when you’re seeking to relocate (provided you 
offer to pay for the relocation). Many employers appreciate the desire to be 
near family as a reason to relocate. No need to go into your uncle’s stint in 
the nursing home; having family in the area is enough.

269
 Chapter 15: Ten Urban Legends to Toss
Include Salary History and Expectations 
in Your Cover Letter
False! Save the salary discussion for the interview. You can be eliminated at 
this stage if your salary history is considered too high, too low, or too static. 
My advice is not to get into it in advance because it’s not in your best inter-
ests to do so.
If a job posting requests such information, write that your salary is negotia-
ble. When the employer’s application software won’t accept the word nego-
tiable, use a wide pay range for the job that you research on www.salary.
com, www.payscale.com, or www.indeed.com. Add that you’ll be happy to 
discuss the issue during an interview.
Yes, you will be excluded from consideration by employers who are ticked 
off that you didn’t follow their directions to reveal your pay history, expecta-
tions, or both in advance. Unless you’re desperate, it’s a chance worth taking.
After You Send a Letter, the Ball 
Is in the Employer’s Court
False! No matter how terrific you are, unless they need you right this very 
second, most employers have no time for hunting you down. If you don’t get 
an automated acknowledgment that your letter and resume arrived, call or 
e-mail to confirm receipt.
But when you do receive confirmation, you don’t show genius by calling and 
asking, “Did you get my resume?”
Another situation: Suppose you have faithfully followed up with phone calls 
as promised, but the clock is ticking and nothing is happening. One tactic is 
nudging the employer with e-mail. Here’s a sample campaign:
 
1. Send the following message:
 
 I hope you’ve had a chance to review my resume (sent 9/3/XX), which 
shows my experience and education in convention management. I’ll be 
glad to fill in any blanks — what else would you like to know?
 
2. If radio silence is your answer, try again.

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 Since my last note, I’ve uncovered two recent articles about your organiza-
tion that make me even more certain that my communications skills and 
bilingual competencies would be valuable in your operations department. 
If you haven’t seen the articles (identify by name), I’ll be happy to pass 
them along if that would be useful. Would you like to receive them?
 
3. Ugh. Still no answer. Keep trying.
 
 Since we haven’t been able to make contact, I’ll check back with you next 
week — unless another time would be better. What do you think?
Most people would rather take a punch in the gut than undertake an appar-
ently unrequited job chase; they challenge whether e-mail campaigns work. 
Sometimes yes; sometimes no.
Even when a serial e-mail follow-up does work, success may not arrive over-
night. A newly graduated MBA used e-mail to find employment as a product 
manager for a Web site. He got to know the brass at the site by doing what he 
termed “the e-mail slow dance” for nine months before the offer came. Even 
then, the MBA, who describes e-mail as “less threatening than a phone call,” 
had to call and tell the hiring manager that it was time to step up and make 
an offer.
How many times should you keep banging your head on a wall of silence? 
Until you get an e-mail or phone conversation going, or until the employer 
threatens to call security.
Tony Beshara of Dallas, Texas, is a high performer who runs one of America’s 
ultra successful job placement firms. As I mention in my book Resumes For 
Dummies, 5th Edition, I asked Beshara how many times he follows up on an 
employer before calling it quits.
His succinct answer: “I move on after about 15 calls spread out over two 
months.”

Ten Tips for Top-Rated 
Online Profiles
In This Chapter
▶ Root causes why many online profiles are passed over
▶ Being smart about what you reveal to the world
▶ Better looking; better reading; better profiles for you
O
nline networking for a job search, which I describe in Chapter 2, has 
opened the floodgates for professional online profiles — the kind you 
place on such networking sites as LinkedIn or Facebook.
Think of a professional online profile as a kind of digital billboard used for 
passive networking that never sleeps. You put yourself out there, hoping 
employers will find you and like you for their jobs. When your profile looks 
like a match for a job they want to fill, you hope they’ll invite you to join them 
for a face-to-face interview — an interview that can lead to big things in your 
future.
 
You want an edge over countless competitors who are taking the leap to 
posting their profiles online. Here are ten ways to gain a competitive edge. 
I compiled these tips with the invaluable and expert help of Debbie Ellis, 
an award-winning Master Resume Writer (MRW) and Certified Professional 
Resume Writer (CPRW). Houston-based Ellis is president of the Phoenix 
Career Group (www.phoenixcareergroup.com), a consortium of top pro-
fessional job document writers and coaches.
Do Establish Your Expertise
Pay homage to your online profile as you would to the information in your 
resume. Focus the content on your professional expertise, benefits, and 
accomplishments.
Be sure to include your current and past employment, education, and industry.

 What about adding a photo of yourself? There are two schools of thought 
on this issue: (1) Some advisers say a photo’s a must to attract attention. (2) 
Others, particularly those with wide experience in hiring issues, oppose the 
inclusion of a profile photo partly because employers fear exposure to failure-
to-hire lawsuits based on such things as race, age, and gender. What’s more, a 
potential employer may decide you remind her of a much unloved relative and 
you’re toasted to a crisp. (The same pros and cons apply to linking your video 
resume to your profile.)
Add links on your profile to other sites that show your work portfolio.
You know this, but I’ll say it anyway: Double-check for typos and 
grammatical flubs. 
Do Captivate Your Audience
Start out with a bang by creating an opening summary that sells hard. 
Remember that online profiles are digital billboards that readers whiz by if a 
message doesn’t grab attention, much as motorists zoom by flabby highway 
billboards. Size up what’s important to employers in your sights by studying 
job ads, and then write a list of your matching experience, competencies, 
skills, and education; load them into your summary.
Do Write Outside the Box
 
Start reading online profiles and you’ll marvel at how many “results-driven, 
people-oriented, problem-solvers” there are out there skating across the Web 
wonderland. Good clichés, but clichés they are. As an aspiring Stand Out 
writer, you’ll work hard to paint fresh word pictures that help readers under-
stand your specialness.

273
 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for Top-Rated Online Profiles
Use specifics. Be authentic (the opposite of phony). And within the bounds of 
business communication, write like you talk. 
Do Rightsize, Not Supersize
Set your sights on making your profile neither too long nor too short.
There’s no rule about exact profile length. The litmus test is: Does including 
this information enhance my perceived qualifications for the type of job I seek? 
Will it help me land an interview? Have I omitted information critical to landing 
an interview? Make every word sell you.
One tip to save space and construct a concise communication is to eliminate 
mentions of I and minimize the use of articles. For example, this:
I developed a solar-energy lighting fixture that increased the 
company’s profits by 11%.
. . . is better like this:
Developed solar-energy lighting fixture that increased profits by 11%.
Chapter 5 gives you the details about choosing the right words for selling 
your qualifications.
Do Write Robust Headlines
Another secret to successful profile writing is the power headline! Move 
to the other side of the desk for a moment and put on your recruiting hat: 
Suppose you’re staring at a pool of 300 profiles that match your keyword 
search; which ones do you read all the way though? It’s the headline that 
pulls you into the profile.
As an example, pretend you’re one of the recruiters at Netshare.com, a sub-
scription service for professionals and executives seeking six-figure jobs. 
They initially see only the first six lines but can click to read an entire profile 
if its headline pulls them in. Which kind of headline would excite your inter-
est to read further?

Thought so.

274
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Oversell Your Versatility
In an effort to appeal to the largest number of potential employers, some 
people make the mistake of cobbling together their qualifications and come 
off looking like jacks of all trades (but masters of none). Employers usually 
look for specialists, not generalists. (An exception is the mini-business where 
the workforce must wear more than one hat.)
If you cannot resist broadening your professional niche, at least stick to occu-
pations in the same job family (see www.onetcodeconnector.org), the 
same career field (such as accounting, urban planning, or insurance under-
writing), or the same industry (such as aerospace or retailing).
Even when an employer is interested in you as a candidate, unnecessary occu-
pational spread can dim your appeal. Suppose your profile says that you’re an 
award-winning Web designer and also notes that you’re available for employ-
ment as a restaurant room manager in the evening. The employer may think 
technology design and foodie gigs are odd-couple talents and prefer that you 
spend your evenings thinking great design thoughts. An inappropriate fact on 
a canned profile can cause second thoughts about your value.
Most effective: Be very specific about who you are professionally and what 
you offer and don’t keep adding bells and whistles to show that you can be 
everything to everyone.
Don’t Overdo Overused Self-Praise
Hold back on empty adjectives like superior, exclusive, outstanding, and so 
forth when you describe your skills or qualities. Without backing up your 
claims, no one believes them anyway. Factually explain how you made 
or saved money for the company. How you delivered on a goal. How you 
received top marks for performance.
You’re more likely to be believed when you include comments on your work 
from others, such as coworkers, bosses, and customers. (Read about refer-
ence commentaries in Chapter 3).
Don’t Regurgitate Your Resume
Your resume is a core part of your online profile but remember that, as the 
infomercials say, wait — there’s more. Flesh out your profile with data that 
will help you be chosen for an interview. A cultural fit with the employer is 

275
 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for Top-Rated Online Profiles
a key factor; add such information as your participation in amateur sports 
(competitiveness), five favorite books (thinking quality); and civic service 
organizations (community-orientation), for instance.
Politics? No, unless you’re applying to a political party. Religious affiliation? 
No, unless you’re applying to a church or ministry.
You won’t always have the option of giving the reader a glimpse of you as 
a person as well as a professional. When a site’s requirements limit you to 
two or three paragraphs, make them keyword-rich and stick to function and 
industry, as illustrated in the following profile written by professional cover 
letter writer Debbie Ellis.
Senior-level IT executive (CTO, VP/IT) Fortune 1000 
Consummate management professional, passionate leader, and high-
performance individual. 20+ years’ experience in executive-level IT 
management roles. Expert in partnering IT with enterprise strategies, 
initiatives, and multi-site, cross-functional operations. Technically 
proficient in contemporary / emerging technologies, project manage-
ment approaches, best practices, benchmarks. Successful in meeting 
time, budget, and quality goals. Qualifications: IT Strategy; Systems & 
Network Architecture; Large-Scale Implementations & Conversions; 
IT Optimization; Project Planning, Budgeting, Scheduling & Lifecycle 
Management; Project & Application Portfolio Management; Internet 
& Web; Help Desk & Technical Support; Vendor Contracts; Technical 
Training & Skills / Career Development; IT Team Leadership; Department / 
Operations; P&L; Due Diligence; Post-M&A Integration / Transition; 
Change Management; Budget & Resource; Risk Management; Internal & 
External Customer Service.

Don’t Be a Victim to Perilous Posting
Don’t post anything you don’t want an employer to see. Instead, control your 
“label” for those times that hiring managers go shopping. Treat a Facebook or 
LinkedIn page with the care you give a resume. Use privacy settings thought-
fully and make sure that pubic messages or images you post don’t cheapen 
your professional image.
 
Try not to post anything an identity thief can use to steal from you. Treat all 
personal identity information like a classified document. Do not put your home 
address, social security number, driver’s or professional license numbers, or 

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 
family information in your profile. Restrict contact information to your phone 
number and e-mail, and, if you have one, a box address at a post office or pack-
age mailing store.
A Web of opportunity is also a Web of risks. Take good care of yourself as 
you network even after you have a job.
Don’t Play Hide and Seek
In choosing where to park your profile, be visible and be selective. Start with 
one or two sites, adding others only when you see a clear and present pay-
back for the considerable time you spend actively networking.
Quality and quantity are the big questions when you’re picking sites. Who’s 
using the site? How many are using the site? A network is most useful when 
it’s gained a critical mass of people who can do you some good. LinkedIn, for 
example, has more than 23 million users, including executives from all the 
Fortune 500 companies. Facebook has more than 80 million active users glob-
ally. But LinkedIn has a professional and business focus, while Facebook has 
a much larger social component.
As you explore your options among online sites that post profiles — such as 
ZoomInfo, a business directory; Spoke, a business directory and social net-
work; and Jigsaw, a business directory and social network — be wary about 
biting off more than you can manage.
Internet job search expert and publisher Peter Weddle (www.weddles.com) 
sums up my thoughts about time management and expectations for online 
networking:
As helpful as online networking can be, it is a supplement to, not a 
replacement, for traditional networking. Despite what technophiles 
and Internet enthusiasts will tell you, landing a dream job still requires 
human interaction. That interaction can begin on the Web and even 
be enriched there, but it cannot occur exclusively online for one 
simple reason: Real people, not virtual ones, fill jobs.

Cover Letters For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
A Glossary of Professional Certifications
Ever wonder what the letters behind someone’s name mean? Initials behind 
the sample writers’ names designate certifications each has voluntarily 
earned. Designations are awarded by a professional organization. They are 
awarded based on a candidate’s professional evaluation, usually measured 
by formal testing, of the candidate’s level of expertise in a specific skill area.
The certification examination process generally requires time-consuming 
study and may include both experience-based knowledge acquired in the field, 
and curriculum-based knowledge gained by study of assigned learning texts.
Certification is an indication that the certified professional is a player in a 
field’s large body of knowledge and that the professional meets documented 
standards and achievement requirements.
Many — but not all — of the certifications accorded to this book’s sample 
writers were awarded by one of the professional organizations listed in the 
following section.
 
Certification evaluations are voluntary for professional writers. For their own 
reasons, not all of those whose excellent work appears in these pages have 
sought credentialing. 
If you do not find the initials behind a sample writer’s name on the following 
list, the initials may refer to membership in one of the professional organiza-
tions in the next section.
