Editorial
I
Commodore you may ﬁnd a few subtle (and a couple
of blatantly obvious) changes. This is because the
editorial team, upon my arrival to the fold, has decided
to offer a brighter future for VC, one that we can all enjoy
together.
My ﬁrst major decision was to revolve this issue around
Batman, and I  hope you all agree that this was a wise
move. Apparently the movie grossed over $40,000,000 in
its ﬁrst weekend, and seeing as it cost SIOm less to make
it has more than dispelled any fears from Warner Brothers
that it was to ﬂop, and this is before it reaches British
shores. Further on in this issue you can read about the
reasons the ﬁlm was undertaken, and a preview of the game.
Other features of note are on Licence to Kill t h e  new
Bond ﬁlm, Greenpeace and Lone Wolf, so make sure you've
got your asbestos gloves on, they are HOT!
Although there are many entertainment based articles
we haven't left out the usual listings, or the machine based
columns. The programs can now be found in a section of
with their own, so you can keep them separate from the
rest.
I hope you enjoy this issue as much as we've enjoyed
putting it together and that leaves me to say, welcome to
the beginning...

EA's Horror Story.
Electronic Arts is to bring
the horriﬁc world o f H P
Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos
onto Amiga and PC screens
in September. The Hound of
the Shadow is a role playing
game set in the roaring 20s,
in which the player must use
investigative research i n
order to unravel the secrets
of arcane lore and discover
many odious horrors lurking
beneath seemingly normal
life.
The game system that
was developed b y board
game designers and ﬁction
writers, Eldritch Games,
allows the player to create
a character by selecting sex,
nationality, one of six pro-
fessions, and proﬁciency in
over 50 skills. These will
directly affect the outcome
and his success in the game.
The H o u n d  o f  t h e
Shadow will appear ﬁrst on
the PC in early September
and later on the Amiga. Both
versions will cost £24.99

Trendy Lefties in
Fun School
Controversy
Fun School 2, Database's
excellent teaching software,
has been rejected for use in
schools by 'Trendy' author-
ities, who believe that i t
emphasises the 3Rs to o
much.
The 3Rs (Reading, 'Rit-
ing, and 'Rithmatic) are
currently being weedled out
of the national curriculum
by such left-wing education-
alists for the 'old fashion'
methods o f teaching used.
Peter Davidson, one of the
co-authors of the software,
states "What they don't like
about it - apart from it being
based on the 3Rs -  is that
it involves an element o f
competition, with a  tick
coming up if the question is
answered correctly".
Shelly Gibson, a teacher
who has been using Fun
School 2  i n  her class a t
Poplar Stre e t Pri ma ry
School, Audenshaw, has
written to the Minister o f
Education Kenneth Baker,
to urge him to explore mat-
ters further.

the action as you attempt to
drive your Ferrari to victory.

cost E29.99. Available on
both 3.5 and 5.25 disks it will
support both C GA  and
EGA graphics.

Only the Lonely
T
new series o f  books by Joe
Dever, who hopes to emulate
the success o f previous efforts. Co-
written with John Grant -  whose
credits to  date include Dreamers,
Earthdootn (co-written with David
ford) and, strange as it may seem,
The Lone Wolf bandwagon continues to roll along the
road of success. Rik Henderson hitches a ride and
prepares for a one-way trip to fantasy land.
The Encyclopedia o f  Walt Disney:c
Animated characters -  they are not
short of technical brilliance, although
one wonders whether the fantasy
orientated plot is a mite too cliched.
Eclipse o f the Kai is the ﬁrst in
the indeterminable number of books.
It deals with the origin of Lone Wolf

plus the downfall o f  the Kai, the
warrior elite o f Sommerlund (as i t
quotes on the back). Although i t
contains many good fantastical ideas,
there is always a feeling o f deja-vu
connected.
The Dark Door Opens is not much
better in theory, but perhaps a more
enjoyable read. Now that the Kai have
been eliminated, Lone Wolf is born
and the plot follows his quest to reach
King Ulnar and warn him of impend-
ing doom.
Audiogenic Software has now
sussed the effect o f Lone Wolf, and
thus released a new computer game
based on his exploits.
Entitled simply The Mirror o f
Death, the game places Lone Wolf in
an arcade-adventure. Although one
could be forgiven for thinking that it
has more than a smidgen of hack-and-
slash action more usual in a beat-em-
up.
The plot follows Lone Wolf as he
tries to recover a stolen gem, once
belonging to his mentors, the Kai. This
is no easy task as the tower in which
it is imprisoned is full of ﬁre-spitting
gargoyles, demons and countless other
atal dangers, Once all these have been
egotiated, Wolf comes face-to-face
with the Mirror of Death itself, which
is not termed such for nothing. It has
many properties, but its most famous,
and arguably its most lethal, is the fact
that it can produce carbon-copies of
its enemies. Not just any old repro-
duction mind you, but one that has
evil intentions. It will take more than
a quick slash to vanquish this fellow.
Lone Wolf - The Mirror of Death
boasts great graphics and good action.
The only reservation that I have is that
the play may not be varied enough,
thus giving it a short life.
It is available for the PC, Amiga,
and CM at varying prices.
Other news comes our way that
Mirror o f Death will not be the last
Lone Wolf excursion into the world
of home computers. Audiogenic has
many more adventures planned for

1990.
Last, but certainly not least, in the
new Lone Wolf releases is the inter-
active telephone line, written by Joe
Dever. This is surely in direct com-
petition with Steve Jackson's Fist.
The company involved, Broadsys-
tem, has invented a new label under
which they hope to release many games
of this kind, Fortress of Doom being
just the ﬁrst. Phonequest (TM) games
will all use the same system of oper-
ation, although at this stage it is hard
to determine whether they'll just be
sticking with Lone Wolf, or if they may
branch into other areas of interactive
'quests'.
Unlike Fist, which uses a  tone
method to determine actions, FOD
breaks new ground w i th  voice-
interactive technology. This allows the
caller to  make 'real-time' decisions
during play, and increases the tension
created by the stunning sound-effects.
The way in which this works is
simple. When at a point in the game
where a passive decision is to be made,
you will be given a number of options
(like the Lone Wolf gamebooks), each
separate option carries a  different
number which must be quoted after
a bleep, thus choosing the action to
he performed. Aggressive moves are
similar, although they must be quoted
when in battle, else a sticky end is
almost a certainty.
The sound-track was recorded at
a top London studio using a very able
Learn of professional actors, with many
other effects added to make the game
an all-round fantasy experience.
Separate sections of the adventure are
narrated by different voices (male and
female) and they all do a great job in
the atmosphere stakes.
One regret I have of any game like
FEATURE
this is the prices which must be
charged. Off peak rate is 25p •per
minute, whilst peak is 38p per minute,
costing a mammoth £15 for a hour's
play (off peak), which will add up to
E105 per week, i f it is played for an
hour a day, quite a sum of money.
This is most worrying fo r the
younger children w h o  become
addicted to  such things (hence the
reason fo r Chatline's demise). M y
advice to anybody worried about the
costs, buy one of those gamebooks,
at around £2.50. and get a  friend
around to read it out to you, it's not
that much different and certainly a lot
cheaper.
I'm not here to condemn the line,
I think it's rather good fun, and i f
played i n  moderation it's a  very
worthwhile venture.
All the Lone Wolf products have
something going for them, and the fact
is that they'll be popular for a long
while yet, thanks to  Joe Dever's
persistence, and Beaver Books money,
for when both are ﬂowing legends can
be born.

the lookout for new programs,
hints, tips, articles and even
regular series. I n  fact, i f you have
something that you think could be of
use to other Commodore owners, we
want to hear about it.
Below you will ﬁnd a  list o f
guidelines that will help us to deal with
any item you send in. We don't expect
everybody to  be budding William
Shakespeares, although i f  you do
follow these simple rules it will make
our job a lot easier. (And speedier).
We are constantly striving to make
our magazines more professional in
their approach. Therefore, it is to this
end that we are making some alter-
ations to  how programs should be
submitted with a view to publication.
In future, whenever you submit
programs o r  articles fo r possible
publication, we ask you to ensure it
is submitted according to the guide-
lines set out below. Please note:-
Any programs N OT submitted
along these guidelines will automati-
cally be rejected.

So you have written a program? You want it published?
Follow these guidelines when you send it in to us!
Submission Guidelines
I) If possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced,
ie: there should be a blank line between
each line of text, There should be a
margin of at least 10 characters around
the text.
3) The very ﬁrst page should consist
of' the following:
Name of the article program
Machine that it is for
Any extras needed - drive/ printer, etc.
Your name, address and telephone
number.
4) The top of every page should have
the following information on it:
Program title
Your name
Page number
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
12
For example:
R asters/ A. Bloggs/ Page I
5) Do not make additional marks on
your text, especially underlining.
6) On the bottom of each page put
the word MORE i f there are more
pages or END if it is the last one.
7) If possible enclose a listing of your
program. If written in machine code,
then a listing of the source code would
be appreciated.
8) Programs should be on either tape
or disk with TWO copies included. If
problems appear then we have more
chance o f  successful loads. I f  the
program is less than 10 lines it can
be included in the text.
9) If your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be a
ﬁrst class artist but we do need to see
what is required.

10) Photographs, if necessary, must be
either black and white prints or colour
slides. We can take shots ourselves so
don't worry about this too much.

11) Submissions can be of any length.
If you have a ﬁve line routine or a
full six part series, both will be
welcome.
12) Payments are normally made 3 to
4 weeks following publication. Pay-
ment varies quite a lot and depends
on quite a number of factors, such as
complexity of program, presentation
and number of pages it uses. Payments
vary from £10.00 to E80(i00 for series.
13) If we ﬁnd your submission suitable
for publication we will write giving you
details of terms and payments. Prompt
return of the acceptance will ensure
the minimum of delay in seeing your
article' program appear in print.
14) If you want your material returned,
should we ﬁnd i t  unsuitable fo r
publication, then a stamped addressed
envelope sh o u l d  b e  included.

IF THIS IS NOT INCLUDED.
That just about sums u p  our
requirements fo r your submissions.
One ﬁnal word_ Get writing!!
To Recap - Follow These
Guidelines
1) A brief introduction to your pro-
gram. What it is, what it does and why
everyone should use it. Make it sound
interesting enough for people to read.
2) A breakdown on how the program
works. Included in this general head-
ing will be your program ﬂow. Why
you are doing speciﬁc tasks. If you are
using M / C ,  follow each routine
through, (Not line by line.). Explain
your sub-routines i f using Basic. In
short, we require an indepth explana-
tion on how your code works, be it
Basic or M/ C.
3) Instructions on using the program.
We need clear, concise instructions.
For example, i f you have written an
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
13
extended basic, examples need to be
shown. If it is an art package, again
examples are needed.
4) A getting it in section. If you have
written a multiple part program. Or
if Basic needs to be shifted around.
Indeed if there are any oddities at all,
make sure that you give clear instruc-
tions on how to input it.
The above sections should be
presented either on TYPED plain
paper or as a text ﬁle using a suitable
wordprocessor_ Each page should be
numbered. The necessary headings
and footings should be included, and
the documents should have double line
spacing. We require two copies of your
program. (This is essential when
sending programs on disk, they can
and do get damaged in transit),
In order to make our magazines
more appealing, we feel it is necessary
to insist on these guidelines. After all,
it is you, the user that will gain most
from this. The less work we have to
do in preparing your submission, the
better the ﬁnal product will appear,

Mark Everingham reveals the inner workings of his
Plus I 4
I
printing many articles and programs which need a basic
understanding of Machine Language programming. For
this reason, over the next few months Four Ground presents
a brief beginners course to machine language. It is obviously
not possible to present a full discussion of the subject within
the limited space of the magazine, but the course aims to
provide a foundation on which to build more advanced
.knowledge.
For most people, the phrase "machine-code" has horrible
images attached to it - strings of binary, incomprehensible
listings and degree level mathematics. However, the fears
the majority have about machine-code are totally unfounded
- the language can be easy and extremely rewarding to
use. I f  you have tried to learn machine-code before and
given up in frustration, don't run off now, most books on
the subject tend to be extremely badly written, full of jargon
and irrelevant information. This short course has been
written to be compact and easy to understand while retaining
all the essential information. For those who can already
program in machine language, it should serve as a useful
reference work.
What Is Machine-Code?
"Machine-code', "Machine Language" o r "Assembly
Language" is a computer language just like any other -
Basic, PASCAL or C. Machine Language is the native
language of the Plus/ 4 and in fact the computer at its most
basic level cannot understand anything else. Basic may seem
like the computers natural language, but is really nothing
more than a program written in machine language. At the
heart of your Plus/4 is a silicon chip called the 7501 Central
Processing Unit (CPU). When you write programs in
machine language, you are sending instructions directly to
this chip. When you write in Basic, your Basic programs
have to be converted into machine-code as they are run,
because the 7501 cannot understand them in their Basic
form.
So why program in machine language? The reason most
people use Basic is because it is so easy to learn. For example,
to draw a circle in Basic takes just one command. in machine
language, hundreds of individual commands are needed.
FOUR GROUND
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989

This might make Basic seem far more attractive, but the
problem with Basic is that it runs incredibly slowly. Machine
language runs commands at up to a million instructions
per second, whereas with Basic you're lucky if you achieve
60 per second. Another advantage of machine language is
that because you're working at such close proximity to the
actual hardware of the machine, you have the ultimate in
power over every individual function that the Plus/4
hardware can perform. Once you have begun programming
in machine language, Basic will, I can assure you, seem
horribly inefﬁcient.
Number Bases - Decimal, Binary, and
the Dreaded Hex!
Computers are number machines - Your Plus/4 computer
knows nothing about anything but numbers. Everything
it does concerns numbers, even the commands it executes
are stored as numbers. We human-beings tend to use the
number base called decimal or denary, simply because we
happen to have ten ﬁngers on our hands, but computers
don't like decimal, so instead they use "Hexadecimal" or
"Binary".
The concept of number bases is really simple. Think
of a decimal number, say 12345. The key to understanding
the magnitude of the number is column headings. Look
at the number 12345 written under column headings below.
In order to work out what number is written down,
we just add up the products of the values and headings:
lx10000+2x1000+3x100+4x10+5. Each column heading is a
power of 10, so the ﬁrst one is 1, (10 AO), the second one
10x10, the third 10x10x10 and so on. The principle for
hex and binary is identical, except that for hex, the base
is 16 and for binary it is 2. This means that the column
headings are I, 16, 16x16x16 etc. for hex, and 1, 2, 2x2,
2x2x2 etc. for binary. To convert a number to decimal,
just repeat the process above using the new column headings.
For binary, this is easy, as each column can only hold a
number 0 or 1. The number 170 is shown here:-

The ﬁnal value is calculated as 1x128+ 1x32 + I x8 +
I x2. The same method is applied for hexadecimal, except
that if the base is 16, each column needs to hold a number
between 0 and 15, whereas in decimal only between 0 and
9. This means we need 6 more digits. For these we use
the ﬁrst six letters of the alphabet, A=10, B=11, C=12...
F=15. The number 4660 is shown below:-
Heading 4 0 9 6  2 5 6

Of course, if in a program we used some numbers which
were binary, some decimal and some hex, we couldn't tell
the difference -  the number 101 could be 101 decimal, 5
binary or 257 hex. The answer is that binary numbers are
preceded by a "%" (percent) sign, hex by a "$" (String/
Dollar) sign, and decimal numbers have no preﬁx. This
avoids all possibility of confusion. For most of the time,
however, you will ﬁnd you use hexadecimal, so the problem
need not arise.
So why do we use hex and binary instead of decimal?
Computers are electronic devices, made up o f banks o f
transistor switches. A switch can only be On or Off, and
these settings can be effectively represented by 1 and O.
These l's or O's are called bits - Binary Digits referred to
by their column headings 0-7 (right-left), and collections
of eight of them (255 decimal) are called Bytes. Hexadecimal
is used because it is much shorter to write down, while
retaining a similarity to binary. The number 255 in decimal
needs three digits, in binary, 8, but in hex it needs only
two.
The Importance Of Numbers
So far we have only talked about numbers for numbers
sake, and this is the criminal error which most machine-
code tutors make. I n  machine language, nothing but
numbers are used, but the important thing to remember
is that a number can mean anything. In real life, numbers
can be house numbers, telephone numbers, prices, times,
or a host of other things. Machine language is identical,
numbers can be colours, sounds, commands, speeds or
anything you wish. All of the commands discussed in the
section "The Instruction Set" perform operations on
numbers. If you can remember that these numbers can be
of any signiﬁcance, machine-code programming will be
elementary!
The Memory Machine
Your Plus; 4 is described as a 64K computer. This means
that it has enough memory chips to store 65535 byte long
binary numbers. You might expect 64x1000, but 65535 is
equivalent to 64x1024, 1000 being near enough to 1024
which is a nicer binary number. Because of the binary
system, each of these 65535 "locations" can hold a number
in the range 0-255, and each location is referenced by an
"address". This is simply a number between 0 and 65535
which points to a byte of memory. In addition, your Plus/
4 has two types of memory: ROM (Read Only Memory)
and RAM (Random Access Memory). The ROM holds
the machine-code program from BASIC. It lives at address
$8000-$FFFF, and cannot be changed. The address space
S0000-$7FFF is the RAM, although the extra 32k is found
at $8000-SFFFF, under the ROM. For the moment we
will only consider the lower 32k.
Each byte of RAM can be put to a different use. To
ﬁnd out which byte of RAM is used for what, you should
FOUR GROUND
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
15
consult a manual such as ANCO's "C16-PLUS/4 REF-
ERENCE BOOK" which has a full list. Many locations
are used for things like the screen, Basic calculations or
Basic programs. When you write a program in Basic, the
Basic program in ROM ﬁnds a place in RAM to store
the program and puts it there. In machine language, you
have to tell the Plus/4 where to put the program, and you
must take care not to put it in a place which is used by
another part of the computer!
The Tedmon Machine-Code Monitor
On almost all computers, writing a program in machine-
code means that you have to go out and buy a piece of
software called an Assembler, luckily for you, the Plus/
4 has a simple one built in, called TEDMOM
Machine-code programs are written like Basic as a series
of text commands, such as "TXA", "LDA $8000,X" and
"BRK". Each command is represented by a three-letter
mnemonic, o r  abbreviation. To  actually run these
commands, they must be converted into a series of numbers
and stored in RAM. This process is called Assembling.
The TEDMON program on ROM in your Plus/ 4 will
carry out the simple assembly process for you to save you
doing all the work. T o  assemble a  program, type
"MONITOR" from Basic. In order to assemble a program,
you have to tell Basic where to put the program. Consult
a memory map if you have one to ﬁnd a suitable place,
but for most of the time, a good place to put programs
is at $6000. This location in memory leaves you with 8k
free for Basic even with a graphics screen in operation,
leaving 8k for your machine-code program -  an amount
you are not likely to use up for a long, long time! The
TEDMON assemble command takes the below form:
A Saaaa xxx operand
The "A" is the actual assemble command, and can be
replaced by a (period) if you prefer. "Saaaa" is the address
at which you wish the line of machine-code to be stored.
It should always be expressed in hex and preceded by a
dollar symbol. "xxx" is the three-character mnemonic of
the command you wish to be assembled, and "operand"
is the operand or parameters the command takes. When
you enter a line and push (Return), the line is stored in
memory, and a new address is printed, allowing you to
enter the next line. All numbers entered into TEDMON
should be hexadecimal, and preceded by a dollar symbol.
When you have ﬁnished entering a program, delete the
address on the screen. You can exit to Basic by pushing
"X" and (Return) for exit, or you can run your program
by typing "G" plus the hex start address of your program.
The dollar symbol should not be entered.
Once your program is in memory, you can look at it
or edit it by typing "D ” plus the address at which you
want to start looking. A  series of lines will be displayed
on the screen. This is called Disassembly, and the lines
on the screen can then be edited and re-entered using the
normal Screen Editor functions.
We have not covered here every function of TEDMON,
but only the most important ones. Full coverage of the
TEDMON monitor can be found in your Plus/4 manual.
7501 Processor Registers
As I have said, all of machine-code's commands operate

on numbers. These numbers can be held in three places
- in a memory location, in the memory directly after the
machine-code command, or in one of the 7501 registers,
which are like fast, internal bytes of memory.
The Program Counter
The program counter (PC) is the only 7501 I6-bit register.
In it is stored the address where the next command to be
executed can be found. When an instruction is executed,
the PC is automatically incremented so that it points to
the address of the next instruction. When you direct control
to another location using a JMP, JSR or branch instruction
(see "The 7501 Instruction Set"), the address in the PC
is changed accordingly, so you don't have to worry about
It.
The Status Register
The status register (SR) is an 8-bit (byte) register which
is used to indicate the states of various options of the 7501
CPU. In fact, only seven of the eight bits are actually used,
and the functions of these bigs are discussed below. Each
bit is known as a "ﬂag".
Bit 7 - The N (Negative) Flag. The negative or N bit is
set to 1 when the last numeric result had bit 7 set, and
is set to 0 when the number had bit 7 cleared. Effectively,
numbers over 127 set the N bit, and those below clear it.
If bit 7 is used to show the sign of the number, the N
bit reﬂects this sign accordingly.
Bit 6 -  The V (Overﬂow) Flag. The Overﬂow (V) bit is
set to 1 when the last operation resulted in what is known
as a two's complement overﬂow. This is only of use in
signed arithmetic, where bit 7 represents the sign (I=-, 0=-0.
Overﬂow is set when the status of bit seven has changed
incorrectly, in such cases as two numbers yielding a result
greater than will ﬁt in one sighed byte.
Bit 4 - The B (Break) Flag. The Break bit is set to I when
the last operation was a "BRK", or is cleared if the operation
was anything else.
Bit 3 - The D (Decimal) Flag. Setting the decimal bit enters
the decimal mode of the 7501 processor. Clearing it resorts
to binary arithmetic. For information on the decimal mode,
see the SED instruction.
Bit 2 -  The I (Interrupt) Flag. Setting the interrupt (I) bit
to one causes interrupts to be disabled, or clearing enables
interrupts. The function only works with IRQ (Interrupt
ReQuest) interrupts, and is covered fully in the section on
interrupts.
Bit I -  The Z (Zerp) Flag. The zero bit is set to I when
the result of the last operation was zero, for instance when
subtracting a number from itself. I f  the result was any
number but zero, the zero bit is cleared.
Bit 0 - The C (Carry) Flag. The carry bit is set to I when
the last addition gave a result which could not be expressed
in 8 bits. When subtracting, it is cleared if a borrow out

YOUR COMMODORE september 1989

of eight bits was required. The bit is also used by the shift
and rotate instructions, where the last bit is shifted into
the carry ﬂag.
The Accumulator (.A)
The accumulator, or I t  register is the most important of
the 7501 registers. It is an 8-bit register which is used for
all arithmetic and bit manipulation operations, as well as
being used for most data transfer functions.
The X Index Register (A)
The .X register is one of a pair of "index" registers. It is
like the accumulator, in that it is an 8-bit register, but only
the most simple operations can be carried out on .X. Its
primary use is as an index for indexed addressing modes
- See the section on addressing modes.
The Y Index Register (.Y)
The 1 ' register is identical to the .X register, also being
used mainly as an index.
The Stack Pointer (SP)
The stack pointer is another 8-bit register, which contains
a pointer to the current byte on the 7501 machine stack.
See the section which follows on the stack for an outline
of its use.
The 7501 Processor Stack
In Basic, you have two instructions to alter the ﬂow of
a program - GOTO and GOSUB is simple - it just performs
an absolute, unconditional jump to a line. GOSUB does
the same thing except that before the jump is performed,
the statement to which the program should return is ﬁrst
pushed into an area of memory called the Basic stack. Then,
when a RETURN statement is encountered, the program
pulls the return statement back off the Basic stack and jumps
to it. machine language works in the same way using its
own machine stack, except that the GOSUB command is
replaced by JSR (Jump to Sub-Routine), When JSR is
executed, the address of the next command is pushed onto
the stack so that when a subsequent RTS (ReTurn from
Subroutine) is found, the address can be pulled back off
the stck and transferred to the PC to continue program
execution. The process of pushing and pulling is automatic
and controlled by the Stack Pointer. The machine stack
is in fact a 256-byte (I page) area of memory located at
$0100 onwards.
In addition to being used for sub-routines, the stack
can also be used as a temporary store for numbers, avoiding
the need to use a speciﬁc area of memory. The PHA, PLA,
PHP, PLP instructions push numbers onto the stack and
pull them back of it again. When a number is pushed or
pulled, the stack pointer is decremented or incremented
accordingly. You can however control the stack pointer
contents directly using the TXS and TSX instructions. The
stack pointer is a single 8-bit index into the stack area at
$0100.
Note that when using the stack, you must o f course
match every JSR with an equivalent RTS, and push with
equivalent pull. The stack can accomodate 256 bytes, so
upto 128 levels o f nested sub-routines are theoretically
possible. It is extremely unlikely that you will ever need
more than this.
We've had to cut Matt short here, but you'll
ﬁnd more in the second installment.

27 years the iorld's best kpown secret agent - James

"This time he o u t  for revenge".

/
icence to Kill is the 16th ofﬁcial
Bond movie (not counting
4Casino Royale and Never Say
Never Again) and the second for new
boy Timothy Dalton (not the last as
some television networks would have
us believe!) Dalton himself is very
pleased with licence'. "It's much
closer to the original character in the
books" he enthused a t the recent
premier in London's Leicester Square
Theatre. "It's tough, tense, exciting,
everything a Bond ﬁlm should be". It's
. certainly a lot tougher than previous
1ms which has been the main reason
for Licence to Kill's 15 certiﬁcate (the
ﬁrst time a Bond ﬁlm has received
• anything other than a 'PG' or equi-
valent). This was only obtained after
over a  minute o f the more violent
moments were cut.
However, this doesn't detract from
the ﬁlm's enjoyment, which is the main
thing really. It's just a shame that our
ﬁlm censors in this country aren't a
little more like their counterparts on
the other side of the Atlantic who have
given i t a  PG 13, this means that

on your own. Seems reasonable
enough to me!
The Film itself centres around the
twilight world of Drugs Baron Frank
Sanchez a n  unsavoury character who
escapes imprisonment and gets his own
back on those that caught him (Bond
and Felix Leiter). Now Bond becomes
a vigilante to get Sanchez back for
what he's done, but he must do i t
without the backing of her Majesty's
Secret Service. This time he's on his
own.
All the familiar elements are there;
Evil baddies, Beautiful Girls, spectac-
ular stunt sequences and o f course
those ingenious gadgets courtesy o f
'Q', played for the 14th time (he wasn't
in D r No or Live and Let Die) by
Desmond Llewellyn. However all
these elements have a much harder
edge. One could almost be mistaken
for thinking this was a Dirty Harry

FEATURE
ﬁlm, particularly if one is used to the
Roger Moore style of Bondry. If that's
what you've been brought up on then
prepare yourself for a shock... for this
is a Bond for the 90's. The action is
that bit more violent, the villains are
that much more realistic (which makes
them all the more sinister) and the
Bond girls aren't just the stereotypical
Bimbos o f the past, they now have
quite an effect over the action. Is it
welcome? Most certainly. As Dalton
puts it "this is an Action, Adventure
Thriller for adults that kids can also
enjoy". A  well written plot from the
pens o f  Michael G. Wilson and
Richard Maibaum, competently
directed by John G l e n n a
Directorship), makes for an excellent
entertainment.
It is nice to see Domark has pulled
out all the stops to release the game
to coincide with the general release of
the ﬁlm. This will be Domark's fourth
game based on a Bond ﬁlm. The ﬁrst
was View to a Kill back in '85, followed
by The Living Daylights and Live and
Let Die. It'll be launched across all
formats, including the Commodore 64,
Amiga and PC formats, simultane-
ously. All three versions of interest to
Commodore owners look and play
really well, particularly the Amiga
version.
The game comprises six parts, split
up among three scenes from the ﬁlm.

The ﬁrst involves James and Felix
ﬂying a helicopter at low level over
Cray Cay. Avoiding tall buildings and
gun emplacements a  little like
Thunder Blade. Once through that,
you (as Bond) set off on foot after
Sanchez but you have to get through
plenty of his henchmen ﬁrst. Weaving
your way through a dangerous maze
of exploding oil barrels and bullets,
you must get back to Felix in one piece.
Then it's back in the air to capture
Sanchez's plane. Here you are lowered
onto the back of the plane where you
must attach a  towrope and bring
Sanchez in.
In Scene Two 007 must foil a
narcotics drop, but ﬁrst he must
survive i n  the water armed with
nothing but a knife against divers and
armoured boats. Bonuses are added
for destroying the Drugs caches as well
as escaping with your life. Next, you
attach yourself, via Harpoon to  a
seaplane's pontoons for a high speed,
barefoot waterski chase, avoiding
catamarans whilst you work your way
to the seaplane and gain control.
In the ﬁnal scenes you are in hot
pursuit of Sanchez having just obli-

I
terated his processing plant. He's taken
to the winding mountain paths as part
of a convoy of 18 wheel juggernauts.
The end is near, the focus o f your
vengeance is just around that bend.
You just have to destroy each of the
tankers one at a time until you get to
the one at the front of the convoy with
you know who in it, but beware: he's
packing some serious heat in the form
of Stinger missiles.
The whole game takes the form of
a vertically scrolling, birds-eye view
shoot 'em up and works very well as
a game. Which as a movie tie-in is rare
indeed.

128 Corner
Dear 128 Corner
Yes,! own a Commodore 128 and have
done since I upgraded from the good
old '64 back in 1986, I  was pleased
to see that you have decided to provide
a forum in your magazine for this
excellent machine.
1 agree with your views regarding
the poor availability o f software. 1
suppose the reason for this is that the
machine is too small to be a fully
ﬂedged business machine and too large
to be a game machine. However, by
scouring the magazines it is possible
to get hold o f  some magniﬁcent
software th a t i s speciﬁc t o  the
computer.
was surprised that you missed out
the Cl28 version o f  GEO WRITE
WORKSHOP as an example o f a
reasonable word-processor. I  was
initially put off by the GEOS system
because it did not allow printing in
NI..Q mode. The fonts that were
provided were too 'dotty' on my Star
SGIO-C for serious letters. This has
been so l ve d  i n  G E O  WRITE
WORKSHOP.
The biggest advantage o f  the
program is that you can take large
sections of ﬁgures from GEOCALC
128 and paste them into letters without
having to write them out again.
For straightforward w o r d -
processing I would think that Super-
script 128 is best. Its sister program
Superbase 128 is another program
worth seeking out if you want to create
a database for any reason. The Basic
like programming language, included
in the program, allows you to manip-
ulate the data in your own applications
programs and adds a new dimension
to using a database.
The hype surrounding the Amiga
makes everyone wonder i f  they
shouldn't part with their old compu-
ters and buy a new one. I like playing
C64 games on the 128 and am happy
with spreadsheet, database and word-
processor applications that I have for
the machine. I n  the words o f  the
Americans, i f it isn't bust, don't ﬁx
it.
Colin Mercer, Bolton, Lanes
Have you tried Font Master 128 or
Paperclip II, both are very excellent
applications. I  totally agree with your
sentiments about the 128. 1 too would
like my own personal Amiga, but why
but. a Bentley to learn to drive when
a Morris Minor will do the trick???
Dear 128 Corner,
It's good to  see that you intend to
continue covering the C128 computer.
I've had one for a few years now and
use it quite regularly for wordprocess-
ing and ﬁling. I must say that I prefer
using the Cl28 over the 'real' compu-
ters that we have in the ofﬁce, it's a

lot easier to use and more friendly (1
can also play games on it when I'm
bored).
When I ﬁrst purchased my C128
1 was very disappointed to ﬁnd that
I couldn't use the 80-column video
mode without purchasing an expensive
colour monitor, which I  couldn't
afford. I was intrigued however when
I saw people advertising switches that
allowed you to use 80 column mode
on a cheap monochrome monitor - not
as good as colour but certainly better
than using 40-columns all of the time.
I investigated this further and careful
examination of the 80 column video
socket in the manual revealed that
there is an 80 column composite video
output on pin 7  o f the connector.
Connecting a suitable plug to this pin
and the earth (pins I  and 2) means
that the computer can be plugged into
a suitable composite monitor.
If you want to  use the same
monitor to display 40 column video
then this can also be achieved. Pin 4
on the 40-column video connector is

But which ones?
Every week millions of advertisements
appear in print, on posters or in the cinema.
Most of them comply with the rules
contained in the British Code of Advertising
Practice.
But some of them break the rules and
warrant your complaints.
If you're not sure about which ones they
are, however, drop us a line and we'll send you
an abridged copy of the Advertising Code.
Then, if an advertisement bothers
you, you'll be justiﬁed in bothering us.

the video out and pin 2 is ground.
Connect the video and ground to a
suitable connector as before and you
can use the monitor to display 40
columns as well.
I know of a number of other people
who use a composite monitor with a
lead as described above, in some cases
they use pin 1 (LUM/ SYNC) instead
of pin 4 though on my monitor the
results aren't as good.
I have taken my lead even further
and placed a double throw switch in
to the lead. One pole of the switch goes
to the 80-column video pin, the other
pole the 40-column video pin. The
central pin of the switch is wired to
the video plug for my monitor and all
of the earth pins are connected
together. Switching between 40 and 80
columns is now a simple matter of
pressing the 40180 switch on my
monitor and ﬂicking my new switch.
One further advantage of using a
video lead such as the one described
above is that you can, contrary to
popular belief, get 80 columns on your

television, as long as you have a video
recorder anyway. M o s t  vi d e o
recorders have an input for a video
camera. This input is a  composite
video one. Plug the lead into this
socket, make sure that your TV and
video are set up to display from the
camera input and you can use your
C128 in 80-column mode on your TV.
The quality may not be as good as
a monitor, but at least it's 80-columns!

T
the Caped Crusader - call him
what you will, his ﬁctional
presence has played a major role in
our subculture since his conception in
a 1939 issue of Detective Comics. Fifty
years on the masked vigilante, cloaked
and hidden in the dark shadows of a
fake New York metropolis known as
Gotham City, is about to embark on
his second big screen adventure. And
this time it's for real.
It is ten years since Warner Broth-
ers, movie-making parent company of
Batman's publisher DC Comics, ﬁrst
considered the idea of a new Batman
feature ﬁlm. Since that time, comics
like Watchmen and The Dark Knight
Returns have brought a new era to the
graphic story genre, adding political,
racial, sexual and social issues to a ﬁeld
previously associated with muscle-
bound, costume-clad freaks of nature.
And Batman: The Movie is suddenly
big business. Unlike the Caped Cru-
sader's previous screen image, Sam
Hamm's original 1986 screenplay
concentrated on keeping Batman
to the comics l i k e  Bob K
original character, he is a dark br
ing vigilante forever seeking vengeance
for his dead parents, rather than the
ever-so-nice Adam West/ Burt Ward
team of the camp mid-Sixties spoof
series. This time, POW! and ZAP! are
left redundant by a movie that pulls
no punches.
For this movie, Batman trades in
his blue-and-grey leotard for a matt
black rubber outﬁt redolent more of
Frank Miller's Batman than Adam
West's. This time, no-one will be left
smiling at the pranks of his arch-enemy
the Joker. And we all know that
Batman's boyish sidekick Robin isn't
even in the picture -  due mainly to
the expansion of the part of the Joker
which followed Jack Nicholson's
reluctant acceptance of the role ("It's
like God created him for the role"
producer Mike !Alan is quoted as
saying). Beetlejuice director Ti m

a Dark Knight
Burton directs, and Beetlejuice him-
self, actor Michael Keaton, ﬁlls the
Batman's rubber-clad shoes. Aside
from Jack Nicholson, Jerry Hall and
Kim Basinger both appear, but Robin
the Boy Wonder is not set to appear
until BATMAN  2  (already being
scripted), about which movie rumours
are already ﬂying, including the
possible casting of Robin Williams as
rhyming rival the Riddler... Originally,
however, Sylvester Stallone and
Arnold Schwarzenegger were consi-
dered for the title role, both being
rejected because they did not ﬁt the
image of Batman's millionaire alter-
ego Bruce Wayne. Also, as Tim Burton
says, "the idea of Arnold Schwarze-
Inger in a Batman costume is frankly
ridiculous!". Instead, Michael Keaton
wears built-up shoes, a latex chin and
false hair inside his padded suit, further
enhancing his transformation from
playboy Wayne to Dark Knight...
The plot, like the cast list, has also
undergone ma j o r surgery. Sa m
Hamm's ﬁrst draft featured The Flying
Graysons and their young offspring
(Robin) who, like the young Bruce
Wayne, witnesses his parents' murder,
this time at the white gloved hands of
the Joker. The friendly Sixties image
of the Batmobile has been replaced by
a Gothic monstrosity which wields a
machine gun and is powered by a jet
turbine - a fast and powerful reminder
of the Batman's might. Gotham City,
depicted in the new ﬁlm at its bicen-
tennial celebrations, is a  grimier,
darker vision of New York: Commis-
sioner Gordon is ﬁghting police
corruption as well as the Joker-
dominated underworld collaboration,
and the street is ﬁlled with the dark
and sinister images of wrecked cars,
air vents and drug pushers, invading
the well-to-do areas and making for
a violent and dark base for Batman's
comeback.
The Joker is depicted as a rictus-
grinning madman, driven insane by his
own disﬁgurement following a chem-
ical accident, and wreaking his ven-
geance on humanity. Batman is the
only thing that stands between him and
his evil destiny, and the ﬁlm follows
the interaction between two society
misﬁts, each infatuated with his role
and each closer to the other than either
FEATURE
would care to admit - a plotline linked
closely with British writer Alan
Moore's recent novelette The Killing
Joke. Closer still to the movie's plot
is Frank Miller's highly-acclaimed The
Dark Knight Returns, but a crucial
scene was (in true Hollywood style)
cut from the movie following news that
Warner had agreed to a sequel: in the
climactic confrontation o f  Frank
Miller's story, Batman only just stops
short of throttling the Joker to death,
at which the Joker, in his last and best
punchline, breaks his own neck so that
Batman will take the rap for his death:
this scene was written out following
Jack Nicholson's agreement to appear
in a sequel... The hugh Gotham City
set•- the largest ﬁlm set since Cleopatra
- stands empty at Pinewood Studios
in Buckinghamshire, waiting for the
crew to return in February for more
adventures of the caped crusader. The
movie's success is already secured.
At the time of writing BATMAN
is two k s  away from its U.S.
release, but already scores of people
have gotten bat-fever. Fans have been
reported as seeing THE DEAD POOL
just to catch the ninety-second trailer
for BATMAN shown along with it.
Despite Jack Nicholson's opinion that
the movie is "doomed", the media
coverage and the secrecy in which the
movie has been shrouded have made
a sure-ﬁre winner for Warner. The
Batman comic series The Cult has
rocketed to 2,500% of its cover price
virtually overnight. Illegal stills, scripts
and unfeasibly shoddy pirate video
copies are changing hands at massive
prices. The merchandising from the
series is likely to cover the cost of the
$30 million movie in a  matter o f
months, with Warner mounting the
biggest merchandising campaign since
STAR WARS, with novels, action
ﬁgures, masks, model kits and even
credit cards aping the Batmania of the
Sixties.
So what is it about this masked
hero that demands such slavish devo-

it is that, unlike irradiated or miracle-
endowed superheroes from other
comics. Batman is one o f us -  an

who spends ten years o f  his life
building himself up to ﬁght crime and
avenge the violent deaths o f  his

parents, swearing to stamp out injus-
tice to  the best o f his ability'. The
simplicity o f the character's origins
make him easy to identify with, and
more believable in a fantasy universe
where an orphan from space wears his
underpants outside his tights, and
where the mere bite o f  a spider

transforms a man into a superhuman...
He is fallible; a haunted, emotional
loner constantly a t odds with his
hidden identity, and the ﬁlm follows
his inner torment and endless bereave-
ment for his lost childhood.
After all, at ﬁfty, it's about time
Batman came of age...

the ﬁrst track on the sound

ﬁtting and apt lyric to kick
off the Batman bandwagon.
Although there are nine
individual songs on the
album, only four were to be
written, and this record
only encompasses half of
the music in the ﬁlm -
Danny Elfman (noted for
his scores iii Beetle/vice and
Pee Wee's Big A(tventure)
provided the 'mood' music
throughout. Prince doesn't
seem to mind though. his
presence was requested by
Jack Nicholson (the Joker),

Warner record label meant
he was the obvious choice
anyway. It seems as though
Prince has made this his
album for 1989. putting
more effort into each song
than you would expect
from a normal soundtrack
composer.
The songs are well
constructed, the album is
cunningly arranged, with a
mix of several different
tastes, and the ﬂavour of
each track is unmistakably
Prince._ With one
exception. Bat dance is
probably the weakest track,
not being altogether funky
nor oorinir, with Sex - as
many Prince songs before it
just settling for plain old
dance music. But, as Prince

its release, and who

about in the tabloids. But
now, upon its release in

little alternative to
congratulating the e r e

superb as both Bruce
Wayne and the Dark
Knight Detective, and
words fail to explain Jack
Nicholson's performance as
the cranky, but always
dangerous, Joker. Even
Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale)
offers one of her best roles.
On its American
premiere 10,000 dedicated
Batmaniacs appeared to see

pooling their resources, and
pulling a major licence
miracle out of the bag.
There can be no better
licences to deliver than
Batman -- the movie, and
we are to be sure that it is a
winner all the way to the
bank.
The game is split into
four sections, all based
upon scenes in the ﬁlm. The
ﬁrst is based in a Gotham
City chemical factory
(where the Joker is
conceived) which scrolls
eight-ways, and is viewed
from a side perspective.
One feature in this arcade-
action adventure is
Batman's rope which he can
use to swing between levels
- something akin to Bionic
Commando.
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989

The second subgame
revolves around the
Batmobile, which Batman
must drive in order to ﬁnd
the Joker's van. Not only
must you avoid other
trafﬁc, but you can use
your batrope to turn
corners at a high velocity.
Section three also
features one of Bruce
Wayne's modes of
transport, this time the
Batwing is called for. The
Joker plans to wipe out
Gotham using balloons full
of deadly gas. As Batman,
you must ﬁy along and cut
the wires keeping the
balloons afﬁxed to the
ground, thus eliminating
the danger.
The fourth section is
very similar to the ﬁrst
except the Dark Knight
detective has to visit a
church, for the ﬁnal
confrontation with the
Joker.
Ocean predict that the
game will be released at the
same time as the ﬁlm in this
country - August 11 th - so
it should prove to be
another step in the
merchandising boom this
autumn and almost
certainly the biggest licence
in the software industry,
ever.

ters a great deal in the course of
my day to day life. I have three

different manufacturers, all are 'clones'
of the IBM PC design and none of

of the IBM PC
their ﬂexibility,
this is in part due to the availability
of a great number of different com-
puters and expansion cards and the
sheer volume o f software available.
The immense number of manufactur-
ers in P C  market means that there
ad in the price and power
of the hardware. The wide range of
expansion cards available means that
you can use a PC to perform almost
any task by simply adding a relatively
simple (and therefore cheap) printed
circuit board to the computer. As with
the hardware, having lots of software
for the machine gives you the advan-
tages that competition within any ﬁeld
will give you - quality and diversity
of products.
Another important aspect o f the

Words for the Whys
The IBM PC is basically a 'vanilla'
computer, it doesn't have the design
compromises that are a feature of a
lot of home computers. H o w  com-
puters have been traditionally &signed
with a particular goal in mind, this
means that they tend to be hot on
graphics, or extremely low cost or have
some special feature.
The upshot of this is that the basic
PC doesn't perform any particular task
exceedingly well, but can perform
most tasks competently. The success
o t the PC  design is really quit
obvious. Just look at the large numbe
of relatively cheap expansion carditm
the market; while a lot these are aimed
at the business or industrial market
there are a  few which are aimed
speciﬁcally a t the non-business o r
'home' user o r  can be used fo r
amusement.

Possibly one reason for this success
is the mechanical integrity of the PC
system, While there is nothing partic-
ularly novel about the idea of having
additional cards for a personal/ home
computer, the allowing of space inside
the case fo r them means that the
expanded system is robust enough to
stand hostile environments (for exam-
ple those involving pets and small
children). The inclusion of the expan-
sion bus in the PC's design also gives
us an insight into the antecedents of
the PC which in turn explains just why
there is so much essential and public
domain software available for the PC.
The History Bits
The disk operating system (or DOS)
used by the PC is based on one of
the earliest systems designed for 8 bit
microcomputer systems. This DOS
was called CP/ M, which stands for
Control Program for Microcompu-
ters, the major feature of this software
was that i t wasn't tied to  any one
computer. This meant that manufac-
turers -  and even hobbyists c o u l d
build a computer for which there was
a large amount of common software
available. A  number of popular PC
packages were originally written for
CP/ M such as Wordstar, dBase Il and
Super Cale.
The main problem with CP/ M was
that it was plagued by the fact that
there was no standard disk format, the
main UK CP/ M user group provides
disks from its software library in over
120 different disk formats!
The Public Domain
The hobbyist involvement meant that
there were a lot of dedicated technical
people writing programs for their own
use and/or amusement: these people
got together in computer clubs in the
USA and other parts of the world and
released their software in the 'Public
Domain' (or PD). These programmers
were quite happy to let other people
their software and would even
p ovide limited support, as long as the
software wasn't sold commercially.
Incidentally, the C P/ M operating
system isn't dead yet, the Amstrad
PC W series uses a version of CP/ M
version 3.0.
The original IBM PC's operating
system was very closely related to an
earlyversion of CF.'M , which had two
results, the ﬁrst was that people who
wanted to upgrade their computer to
a 16 bit processor could move to a
COMMODORE PC
fairly familiar operating and software
environment. The second result was
that existing commercial packages
could be easily converted (or ported)
to the new machine, and since Micro-
soft, the suppliers of the PC's operating
system, also released the DOS soft-
ware as a  separate product, other
manufacturers could also build it in
to their computers.
The User Groups that distributed
the CP/ M public domain software
now also have MS-DOS programs in
their catalogues which range from
word-processors, games and C AD
systems to  the entire King James
version of the Bible (6 disks). The sort
of software available from the user
groups can be very variable in quality,
some of it is very good, some obviously
not ﬁnished. 1 use a public domain
communication pacakge called Pro-
comm, since i t is superior to most
commercial terminal emulation pro-
grams I've seen.
to get the PC to do various things,
some of which it was not designed to
do. I shall also look at some speciﬁc
programs and expansion cards that I
have come across and actually used,
not so much as a review, but as a user's
comment and as solutions to speciﬁc
problems which I might have come
across.

Operating System
Enhancements
Mind you, you don't have to put up
with the MS-DOS operating system,
if you don't want to, there are various
ways of 'improving' it. Like the PC
hardware, the operating system can be
enhanced by adding on what is some-
times called a 'front-end'. Examples of
front ends used to improve the user
interface of MS-DOS are the graphic
environment managers such as Digital
Research!c GEM or Microsoft Win-
dows and the menu driven systems
such as Xtree and I
These programs alter the look and
feel of the operating system to make
it easier to use, either by implementing
the WIMP standard (Windows, Icons,
Mouse Pointing device) or by display-
ing the disk ﬁles i n  your current
directory on the screen with a menu
of standard commands. Microsoft
Windows also falls into the category

computers. The ﬁrst is temporal
distortion, and the second is
human fallibility. If you are thinking
to yourself "What the hell does that
mean?" then don't worry - it's really
very simple.
Temporal Distortion is the pheno-
menon by which time seems to become
compressed i n  the prescence o f  a
computer. What this means in practice
is that when you pop up to your Plus/
4 for "ﬁve minutes before tea", you
ﬁnd that tea has long gone and that
it's about time you were thinking about
some breakfast. The answer to this is,
of course, a competent alarm-clock, so
OOPS! includes such a  clock with
advanced user-deﬁnable alarms and
reminders so that you don't forget
lunch or that vital doctor's appoint-
ment this afternoon.
The other problem with compu-

recorders and disk-drives are relatively
reliable (Commodore's are notorious
for being very reliable but equally
slow), human beings are sadly not so
dependable. It is all too easy to crash
your Plus/4 or NEW the one and only
copy of your latest million-seller arcade
masterpiece. This event will send most
rational human beings into a cry of
OOPS! (Or similar four letter words).
In order to protect you from these
awkward circumstances, OOPS! has
an unNEW-type command and a
unique automatic program-backup
facility making it as difﬁcult as possible
to erase or lose an important program.
The features that OOPS! offers are
now becoming more and more com-
mon as parts o f programming lan-
guages on the latest generation of 16-
bit micros such as the Commodore
amiga, but have not until now been
available for the BASIC users of 8-
hit b home-computers like the Com-

The OOPS! Basic
Commands
OOPS! i n  practice consists o f  a
program which adds thirty new com-
mands to  the normal Commodore
Basic Operating-System. This may
seem a bit of a daunting prospect at
ﬁrst, but they are all easy to use, and
give an idea of how comprehensive the
OOPS! system is. The commands can
be split into six sections, namely Clock
Commands, Alarm Commands, Event
Commands, Saving Commands,
Information Commands and Miscel-
laneous other commands. in a moment
I'll demonstrate the use o f each o f
these, but ﬁrst a short explanation of
command syntax.
Each of the OOPS! commands is
used in exactly the same way as any
standard Commodore Basic com-
mands. Each can be used in Basic
Direct mode or in a Basic program,
and all can be abbreviated as explained
later. Because the commands behave
like normal Basic commands, any
syntax they have can be replaced with
a string variable, for example both the
below have exactly the same meaning
(to set the 24-hour clock to 23:59:59).
SETCLOCK "23:59:59"
CL$= "23:59:59": SETCLOCK CLS
This property of the commands is
useful when writing your own pro-
grams, fo r  instance i f  you can't
remember how to  work the SET-
CLOCK command, you could write
a program which would ask you for
the Hours, Minutes and Seconds, and
then set the clock fo r you using
something like SETCLOCK HS+"
"+ M $ + "  : “+S$ with the hours, min-
utes and seconds stored in H$, MS and
S$ respectively. This facility o f the
command means that you are not just
limited to direct literal commands.
The OOPS! Clock
Commands
The OOPS! system includes a 24-Hour
clock which does not interfere with the
normal Basic 11S clock and can be
made to appear on-screen all the time,
whatever else you are doing with your
Plus/4 so that you can run programs,
print documents, display the disk-
directory or whatever you want - the
clock will keep running. Below are the
commands used to operate the clock.
SEICLOCK "HH:MM:SS"

The SETCLOCK command is used to
set the initial time of the 24-hour clock,
as you will obviously not always start
using the OOPS! clock at the same
time of the day. It's syntax is the time
enclosed within inverted commas. HH
is the time under the 24-Hour system.
MM is the number of minutes and SS
the number of seconds. Each should
be separated using a single colon. The
command can yield the error messages
shown below which can all be trapped
using the normal Basic TRAP corn-
mand, and are displayed as normal.
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted the time from the command.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR- You
have typed a  numeric paramater
instead of the time string,
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR
You have entered a time string which
is either not of the form ''HH:MM:SS"
or has a number in it outside the valid
range 0-23 fo r hours o r  0-59 fo r
minutes and seconds,
CLOCK ON/OFF
Once you have set the time on the 24-
hour clock using the SETCLOCK
command, you will want to be able
to see what time the clock is showing
all the time like a normal alarm clock.
To do this just type CLOCK ON.
From then on the clock is always
displayed in the top-right corner of the
screen. Note that the OOPS! system
cannot b e  used w i th  th e  high-
resolution graphics screen, so the clock
is always visible whatever you are
doing. However, there may be times
when you don't want the clock display
to be visible, for example when writing
a program that makes use of the full
screen. To remove it from the screen
type C L OC K  O F F .  N o te  th a t
although the clock will now be invis-
ible, i t is still running and will still
display the correct time when a
subsequent CLOCK ON command is
executed. The CLOCK command
gives only one error message - SYN-
TAX ERROR indicating that you
have left out, or invalidly replaced the
ON/OFF argument.
CSTART and CSTOP
The CSTA RI' and CSTOP commands
are used to respectively start and stop
the OOPS! clock. Their main use is
for accurate setting of the clock. For
example if the time were coming up
PLUS4 PROGRAM
to 10 o'clock you could use the
program below to set the clock very
accurately:
10 CSTOP
20 SETCLOCK "10:00:00"
30 PRINT "PRESS A KEY WHEN
TIME IS 10 O'CLOCK"
40 GETKEY K$
50 CSTART
Although it is not necessary to stop
the clock while setting it, these com-
mands are useful for setting the clock
very accurately or using the clock as
a timer started by pressing a key like
the button on a stopwatch.
The CSTART and CSTOP com-
mands require no arguments and so
produce no error messages,
The OOPS! Alarm
Commands
If you have anything important that
you don't want to forget to do during
the day, you can use the OOPS! alarm
section of the clock to remind you to
do this. As well as giving an alerting
audible warning, the alarm can also
be made to  display a  message to
remind you exactly what the alarm is
set for.
SETALARM "HH:MM"
The SETAI,ARM command is used
to set up the time at which the alarm
will sound. It works in the same way
as the SETCLOCK command but the
alarm time is expressed in only hours
and minutes and not also seconds. The
error messages the command gives are
identical to those for the SETCLOCK
command.
WARNING "Alarm Warning Mes-
sage"
I have mentioned before that as well
as making a noise when the alarm time
is reached, OOPS! can be made to
display a message as a reminder. This
message appears inverted and ﬂashing
in the top-left corner of the screen to
draw attention to itself. The WARN-
ING command is used to set up this
message for when the alarm goes off.
the message should be enclosed i n
inverted commas and be not more than
25 characters in length. The message
may be made up of all alphanumeric
characters except control codes such
as RVSON and RVSOFF. The error
messsages that the WARNING com-
mand yields are shown below.
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
30
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have left
out the warning message.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have entered a numeric argument in
place of the warning message.
?STRING TOO LONG ERROR -
You have entered a warning message
that is more than 25 characters in
length.
ALARM ON/OFF
Now that you have set up the alarm
time and message, you can switch the
alarm on using ALARM ON. If you
wish to turn the alarm off to reset the
time and message, use the ALARM
OFF command. When the alarm time
is reached, a warning sound is made
and the warning message displayed on
the screen. There are three ways of
turning the alarm off. The ﬁrst way
is by typing ALARM OFF. The other
two methods are described in the OK
command section listed under Events.
The AL AR M command gives one
error message:-
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted the ON/OFF argument.
The OOPS! Event
Commands
What are events? Well they are just
what they sound like -  events, occu-
rences or happenings during the day.
Still none the wiser? Well, most of us
ﬁnd that we have more than one thing
that we want to remember to do on
one day, so a single alarm is of limited
use. For this reason, OOPS! has eight
'Event Alarms'. Each of these events
works in the same way as the main
OOPS! alarm and may be pro-
grammed with an event time and
associated message. Within a single
day you can get your Plus/ 4 to remind
you of up to eight events, enough for
those of y o u with the most densely
packed social diaries!
SETE VENT EVENT # , "HH:MM"
The SETEVENT command works in
the same way as the SETALARM
command, but is used to set the time
at which an event alarm will sound
instead of the main OOPS! alarm. Its
syntax consists of the number of the
event you wish to set, in the range I-
8, followed by the event time enclosed
in inverted commas and separated
using a comma. The time is entered
in an identical format to the SETA-

LARM command. The command
gives similar error messages, which are
shown below:
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted the event number, event time
or separating comma.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have entered a string instead o f the
event number or a number instead of
the event time.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -
Either the event number you have
speciﬁed is beyond the range 1-8, or
you have entered an illegal event time.
MESSAGE E V E N T  # , " Ev e nt
Messa
As mentioned before, each event alarm
can be setup with a  corresponding
warning message in the same way as
the OOPS! main alarm. The MES-
SAGE command is used to setup one
of these messsages_ I t  takes as its
arguments the event number in the
range 1-8 and the message that you
want to be displayed when the event
time is reached. The message may be
up to 25 characters long and should
be enclosed in double-quotes and pre-
ceded with a comma as shown above.
An event messsage is displayed ﬂash-
ing and inverted in the top-left of the
screen in the same manner as the alarm
warning set using the WARNING
command. The MESSAGE command
gives the error messages that follow:
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted the event number, event
message or separating comma.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have replaced the event number with
a string or the event message with a
number.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -
The event number you have entered
is outside the range 1-8.
?STRING TOO LONG ERROR -
The event message you have entered
is longer th a n  th e  allowed 2 5
characters,
ENABLE EV # 1,EV 
E
V
 # 8
Once you have setup an event with
both event time and event message,
you need some way of switching-on
or enabling the event, so that when
the event time is reached the correct
sound is made and message displayed.
PLUS4 PROGRAM
This is done by means of the ENABLE
command.
The ENABLE command has a
ﬂexible syntax in that it can take one
or more parameters rather like the
Commodore Basic graphic com-
mands. The basic argument is the
number of the event that you wish to
switch on, or enable. Thus to enable
event number 4, just type ENABLE
4. If you want to enable more than
one event, for instance events 14, it
is a bit o f a pain to have to type
ENABLE 1: ENABLE 2: ENABLE 3
etc. so instead you can simply type
ENABLE 1,2,3,4 cutting down the
amount of typing needed vastly. Each
of the event numbers should be
separated from each other using a
comma, and be in the normal range
1-8. Note that the event numbers can
be speciﬁed in any order, so ENABLE
1,2,3 has the same effect as ENABLE
3,2,1.
When an event has been enabled,
at the speciﬁed time, the event message
will be displayed in the top-left of the
screen as explained before, and an
alarm will sound, The event alarms are
much less harsh, and gentler than the
main alarm sound as they are for
reminders that are not going to be such
a matter of life and death as the main
alarm. So i f you are o f a nervous
disposition -  use the event alarms
instead of the main alarm as they are
less of a strain on the heart! The error
message that the ENABLE command
yields are shown below.
?SYNTAX ERROR - You have either
left out all the event numbers, o r
ﬁnished the line with an unneccesary
comma.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have replaced at least one of the event
number with a  string instead o f a
number.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -
At least one of the event numbers you
have entered is beyond the allowed
range 1-8.
DISABLE EV # 1, EV# 2 „ E V #  8
The DISABLE command performs
exactly the same function as the
ENABLE command, but has the effect
of switching-off or disabling an event.
Its syntax is identical to that of the
ENABLE command and the error
messages i t  gives have the same
meanings a s  f o r  th e  EN ABL E
command.

Alarm Priorities and
"Shutting Them Up!"
Some of you will have realized while
reading the explanations of the OOPS!
alarm and events commands that it is
perfectly possible to set up all eight
events and the main alarm to go off
at the same time. What would happen
if you did this? After all you can't make
9 noises and display 9 messages all at
once, can you? The answer is NO, of
course not, so a solution is reached
in the form of alarm priorities.
Each event and the main alarm has
a priority over the others, The alarm
comes ﬁrst, followed b y the eight
events i n  numeric order 1-8. To
understand this, imagine that you had
setup the alarm and events 1,3,5,7 all
to sound at 10 o'clock. Because the
main alarm has the highest priority,
the alarm noise will be made and the
alarm message displayed instead of all
the others. "OK" you say, but if I can
only hear and see the alarm, then what
about events 1,3,5 and 7 - they might
be important, too! To ﬁnd out, read
on...
OK (CTRL-0)
When an alarm or event goes off, there
are several ways you can turn it off:
(a) I f  it is the alarm, you can type
ALARM OFF
(b) If you know which event is occuring
you can type DISABLE EVENT #
(c) The OK command
Methods (a) and (b) are all right,
but a bit messy and, if you don't know
which event is sounding, then you will
have to try each one of the eight in
turn to ﬁnd out. The solution to this
is the OK command. This command
simply switches off whatever is occur-
ing at the moment -  the main alarm
or the current event. Using this
command, you don't have to know
which event is occuring, and it also
saves you quite a bit of typing.
I discussed earlier the question of
what happens when more than one
alarm or event is occuring. meaning
that you can only see the one with the
highest priority -  What about the
others? Well, when you enter OK, it
switches-off the event which is cur-
rently displayed on screen, and then
displays the next one down the priority
scale. For instance imagine that the
alarm and all the events were set for
the same time. When that time was

reached, you would see the alarm
message. Wh e n  y o u  ty p e  O K
return the alarm is switched off and
then event I  is displayed. I f  you
type OK re tu rn  a g a i n  then event
2 is displayed and so on until all
the events have been acknowledged,
whereupon the message in the top-left
of the screen is erased and the sound
turned off again. If you only wanted
one alarm, you could use each of the
eight events to give you a message of
up to 225 characters, using the OK
command to read the next section of
message, with all events set for the
same time.
For those of you who ﬁnd typing
two characters a n d  pressing
RETURN a  bit arduous, you can
achieve the same effect tis typing OK
by pushing C T R  I,-0
OOPS! Saving Commands
The third important section of OOPS!
is its automatic saving facility. Using
this function, you can get your Plus
4 to automatically save a backup copy
of the current program onto disk, so
that you don't have to retrace your
steps too far if you make a disastrous
mistake. You can also make OOPS!
mark each ﬁle it saves so that you have
running log o f different versions o f
your program on disk.
SETSAVING MINUTE
As mentioned before, OOPS! can be
made to automatically save backup
copies of the program that you are
working on, so you need to  tells
OOPS! when it is to save these backup
copies. For instance, if you are writing
an important program, you may want
it saved every ﬁve minutes just to make
sure that you don't lose it, but, if you
are writing a long program, the saving
takes a long time so you may want
it to be saved every ﬁfteen minutes or
half an hour instead. The SETSAV-
ING command is used to specify how
often OOPS! should save backup
copies. Its only argument is the period
of time between successive savings.
expressed in minutes. So, if you want
your program saved every ten minutes,
SETSAVING 10 will set this up. You
can use any time period between every
one minute and every hour (60 min-
utes). The SETSAVING error mes-
sages are as follows:
?SYNTA ERROR- You have omitted
the MINUTE argument.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
PLUS4 PROGRAM
have replaced the MINUTE a r g u -
ment with a string.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -
The time period you have speciﬁed in
minutes is beyond the range 1-60.
DEVICE DEV #
For those of you lucky enough to have
more than one disk-drive attached to
your Plus/ 4, OOPS! includes the
ability to cope with this. When you
are writing a program, you might want
to have a utility disk containing an
Assembler or Font Editor etc. in disk-
drive 8, and an OOPS! backup disk
in disk-drive 9. To do this, you would
simply type DEVICE 9 - The DEV#
argument being the device number of
the disk-drive on which OOPS! could
save backup ﬁles. The device-number
can be in the range 8-11 for four disk-
drives, but you cannot use device 1
(The Datasette) as this is really too
slow fo r  automatic saving. Th e
DEVICE error messages are shown
below.
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted the device number argument.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have replaced the device number with
a string instead of a number.
?ILLEGAL D E V IC E  NUMBER
ERROR -  The device number you
have speciﬁed is outside the valid range
8-11.
FILENAME "Filename"
When a backup copy is saved onto
disk, it will obviously need to be given
a name on the disk, and the FILE-
NAME command is used to specify
this name. The name argument should
be enclosed in inverted commas and
may be o f up to ten characters in
length. I t  may be made up o f any
alphanumeric characters but may not
include spaces. I f  you do include a
space in the name, the actual name
will be truncated by the space char-
acter. For instance, entering FILE-
NAME "HALLO THERE!" results in
a ﬁle-name of "HALLO". The FILE-
NAME error messages are as follows:
?SYNTAX ERROR- You have failed
to enter a ﬁle-name.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have either replaced the ﬁle-name
argument with a numeric argument or
have not enclosed the name in inverted
commas.

?STRING TOO LONG ERROR -
The ﬁle-name you have entered is
longer than ten characters.
OOPS! Backup File
Marking
It is a little pointless to keep on saving
backup copies of a program onto disk
unless you know what each ﬁle
contains. For example, i f you were
saving backup copies every two min-
utes and each o f them were called
simply "PROG RAM", you might have
some ﬁles which were saved two hours
ago when you were just starting the
program, and some which had only
just been saved. Obviously you need
to know which is which! OOPS! offers
several ways o f marking your pro-
grams. or you can just choose for the
last backup copy to be erased every
time a new copy is saved. This section
discusses the various commands for
using the ﬁlt-marking facility.
VERSION VER
The ﬁrst way o f marking a backup
copy saved by OOPS! is with a version
number indicating at what stage o f
development that backup copy is, You
can tell OOPS! which version number
of the program you want the ﬁrst
backup copy to be marked with by
using the VERSION command with
VER # being the version number.
Thus if you want to start with version
number 45, enter VERSION 45.
OOPS! can cope with version numbers
in the range 0-999, and this should be
quite sufﬁcient unless you are in the
habit of saving 10000 backup copies
of program! The VERSION command
gives the following error messages:
?SYNTAX ERROR- You have omitted
out the VER # argument.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have replaced the version number
argument with a string.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -
The version number you have speciﬁed
is outside the valid range 0-9999.
NUMBERMARK
This is the ﬁrst of the commands to
tell OOPS! how to mark backup copies
of a program. The NUMBERMARK
command makes OOPS! add the
current version number to the end of
the ﬁle-name. For example if the ﬁle-
name were set to "BACKUP" and the
version number to 59, the ﬁles saved
on disk would be under these names:

•
i
1
1
"BACKUP V50"... "BACKUP V5I"...
"BACKUP V52"...
As you can see. OOPS! automatically
increments the version number each
time it saves a backup copy. In the
unlikely event that the version number
should exceed 9999, it is reset to zero.
The N U MBER MAR K command
takes no arguments, so needs no error
messages.
TIMEMARK
As an alternative to marking backup
copies with a version number, you can
add the current clock time to the ﬁle-
name instead. This allows you to
pinpoint the exact version of a pro-
gram you want, to the nearest minute.
For instance, i f  you had entered
SETSAVING 1 0 :  F I L E N A M E
"TEST": TIMEMARK, the backup
copies saved would have been the
names shown below, assuming that
saving started at two o'clock in the
afternoon.
"TEST 14:00"... "TEST 14:10"...
"TEST 14:20"...
This function of OOPS! is most useful
when you are making frequent changes
to a  program. The TIMEMAR K
command gives no error messages.
UNMARKED
If you don't want the backup copies
of your program to be marked with
version number or time, you can enter
the command UNMARKED to dis-
able these facilities. From then on,
backup copies will have the name given
to them in the FILENAME command,
with no sufﬁx. However, there is a
fallacy in this - You cannot have more
than one ﬁle with the same name on
a disk, so after the ﬁrst backup copy
has been saved, all subsequent saves
will not result in a ﬁle being saved Onto
the disk. To overcome this problem,
see the next section on the REPLAC-
ING command.
REPLACING ON/OFF
As more and more backup copies of
a program are saved on a disk, so the
amount of free space remaining gets
smaller and smaller until the disk
overﬂows. If you are working on a long
program there may not be room for
more than three copies or so on one
disk. The answer to this problem and
also to saving backups with no sufﬁx
is to erase the last backup copy before
you save the new one. In this way the
PLUS4 PROGRAM
amount of room left on a disk will
only decrease by the amount you add
to a  program between saves. Fo r
instance if you had entered VERSION
I: NUMBERMARK: FILENAME
"OOPS": REPLACING ON , the
following process would take place:
Save "OOPS" VI"...Erase "OOPS—
Vl" and Save "OOPS!" 1/2"...
As you can see, this saves a large
amount of space on a disk, but also
means that your ﬁles are not quite so
secure because the last copy has to be
erased, and it is also slower than just
saving new copies. When the ﬁrst copy
of a program is saved with Replacing
On, OOPS! senses that this is the ﬁrst
save, and so does not attempt to erase
a nonexistent previous ﬁle! REPLAC-
ING gives only the SYNTAX ERROR
message, if you omit ON & OFF.
SAVING ON/OFF
When you have decided what to call
your backup copies, how to mark them
and whether or not to erase the last
one etc. you can enable the OOPS!
saving function using SAVING ON.
To switch it off again just use SAVING
OFF. Once saving is switched on,
when it is time to save a backup copy
(as dictated using SETSAVING) the
following happens:-
I. The line you are entering is erased.
2. The messages below are displayed
and their corresponding actions car-
ried out.
ERASING "L a s t File-name" i f
REPLACING ON
Last backup copy i s  erased i f
REPLACING ON
SAVING "0: New File-name"
3. Your BASIC program is saved.
4. The Computer returns to Direct
mode.
As you can see from the above,
each time a program is saved the line
that you are entering at that time has
to be erased. This may seem a bit
inconvenient, but when you think
about it, the most you can lose is 80
characters of program, whereas if you
hadn't saved your program you could
have lost all n kilobytes of it!
The saving function of OOPS! only
works from Basic Direct mode (When
entering programs). If it is time to save
a backup copy while a program is
running, OOPS! simply waits for the
next time and then tries again. In this
way i t does not interfere with the
Y
O
U
R
COMMODOREseptember1989
33
running of the program.
SAVING gives the SYN TAX
ERROR message i f the ON & OFF
argument is left out.
STORE (crilL-X)
Sometimes, you may want to  save
extra backup copies o f a program
separately from the timed saving
function. It is annoying to have to wait
ten minutes (or whatever) for the next
automatic backup, but you may still
want the program to be saved with a
version number or the time etc. To save
a program at any time, using the
marking etc., you can simply type
STORE. This has the same effect as
if it were time to save a backup copy
automatically. Additionally, th e
STORE command can be used even
when automatic saving has been
disabled using SAVING OFF.
Again, fo r those who consider
typing ﬁve characters a major under-
taking, you can achieve the same effect
as typing STORE by simply pressing
CTRL-X Y e s ,  I would have liked
to use CTRL-S too, but Commodore
beat us to it, for stopping printing!
OOPS! Information
Commands
As you can see, OOPS! has a large
number of functions which, when you
ﬁrst use the system, can be more than
a little confusing. To help you when
you are just starting to use OOPS! I
have included i n  the program ﬁve
commands to give you information on
all aspects o f OOPS! from its com-
mands to the current settings of the
alarm or the automatic saving. 111 now
discuss each of these in turn.
COMMANDS
OOPS! has thirty commands in all,
and you may ﬁnd it hard to remember
all of them. If this is the situation, just
type COMMANDS. This results in a
heading and a list of all thirty com-
mands as reference. You should then
not ﬁnd it too hard to remember which
command does what.
CLINFO
Apart from the COMMANDS com-
mand, there are also four specialized
information commands which cover
the clock, alarm, events and saving
functions of OOPS! The ﬁrst of these
is CLINFO.
On entering CLINFO, a  list o f
information about the OOPS! clock
is printed on-screen, which is as
follows:-

TIME: HH:MM:SS
DISPLAY: ON" OFF
STATUS: STARTED/
STOPPED
M I N H )
The M I M I )  command is similar to
the CLINFO command, but is used
to print information about the OOPS!
alarm instead of the clock. It gives the
information shown below.
TIME: HH:MM
STATUS: ON/OFF
MESSAGE: "Warning"
EVINFO
The EVINFO command displays a list
of information about the current
settings fo r each o f  OOPS's eight
events. All are listed under a set of
headings which may be explained as
follows:-
PLUS4 PROGRAM
The current time of the clock.
- Whether the clock display is on or off as set up
by the CLOCK ON/OFF command.
- Whether the clock is running or not, as dictated
using the CSTART and CSTOP commands.
-The time at which the alarm is set to go off.
- Whether the alarm is enabled or disabled using the
ALARM ON/OFF command,
- The warning message to be displayed when the alarm
time is reached, as deﬁned using the WARNING
command.
- The event number to which this line of information refers.
TIME 
-
 The time at which this event will occur,
STS 
-
 The status of this event -  whether or not it is on or off as
deﬁned using the ENABLE and DISABLE commands.
MESSAGE T h e  event message assigned to this event using the MESSAGE
command.
Each line shows the same informa-
tion, but for event number a s  shown
on the left of the line.
SVINFO
The last of the OOPS! information
commands is the SVINFO command
which is used to display the current
settings fo r  the automatic saving
function in OOPS! The list of infor-
mation the command gives is shown
below.
TIMING: MM 
-
 Period between subsequent saves in minutes as
deﬁned by the SETSAVING command.
STATUS: ON/ OFF 
-
 Whether or not the automatic saving is on or off,
as set up using SAVING ONIFF.
MODE: UNMARKED/
NU MBERMAR K / -  The current method for marking backup copies.
T1MEMARK
REPLACING: ON/ OFF- Whether or not the replacing or erasing function
is enabled by the REPLACING command.
VERSION: VVVV 
-
 The current version number set up using the
VERSION command.
DEVICE: DD 
-
 The current saving device-number, as set up using
the DEVICE command.
FILENAME: "Filename"- The current save ﬁle-name deﬁned with the
FILENAME command.

Miscellaneous Commands
As well as the speciﬁc function
commands and information com-
mands, I have provided OOPS! with
a few extra commands to make life
a bit easier when using the system. This
section deals with these three remain-
ing commands, namely WINDOW.
RECOVER and RESET.
WINDOW WDW n
You may have noticed that when the
clock display is enabled, scrolling the
screen causes the clock to blink in an
annoying way. You may also have seen
that some strange effects can be
achieved using the Delete and Insert
keys on the top two lines of the screen.
It would be better if all work took place
in an area of the screen not affected
by the clock display o r  ﬂashing
messages, which would remedy the
problems outlined above. The answer
is the WINDOW command.
The WINDOW command is used
to reduce the usable area of the screen
to an area below the clock display so
that it does not interfere with any work
you're doing. It is the equivalent of
moving the cursor to the corners of
the area and pressing ESC-T and ESC-
8. Two windows are available which
are similar to the ESC-N screens, but
with the top edge below the clock
display, The WIN D OW command
takes only one argument - WINDOW
0 enables the ESC-N equivalent
window, and WINDOW I the ESC-
R equivalent, These are best explained
by trying them out yourselves. The
edge coordinates fo r the respective
windows are as follows:
WINDOW 0: Top-left Corner: (0 ,2 )
Bottom-Left
Corner: ( 3 9 , 2 4 )
WINDOW I: Top-Left Corner: (1,3)
Bottom-Left
Corner: ( 3 8 , 2 3 )
The WINDOW command gives the
error messages shown below.
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted t h e  w i n d o w  n u m b e r
argument.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR- You
have mistakenly replaced the window
number with a string.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -

The window number you have spec-
iﬁed is neither 0 or 1 as it should be.
RECOVER
In addition to the automatic backup
facility of OOPS! to stop you losing
valuable programs, OOPS! also has an
unNEW-type command RECOVER.
If you enter a program and then erase
it fro m memory using the N EW
command, you can get i t back by
typing RECOVER. The command will
of course not work after you press the
RESET button on your Plus/ 4, doing
this erases the OOPS! program code.
Some of the time you may be able to
get your program back in this situation
by reloading the OOPS! program then
typing RECOVER. You should not try
to use the command when you've just
switched your computer on, because
it will give some funny results with no
program data present
The RECOVER command has no
arguments so i t  yields n o  error
messages.
RESET
The ﬁnal OOPS! command, RESET,
is used to reset the OOPS! data to its
default values. This turns the clock on,
resets all the events and saving etc. to
the values that they have when you
ﬁrst use OOPS! These default values
are setup as typical values such as you
might frequently use. These default
settings are shown here.
OOPS! Abbreviations
Like the normal Commodore Basic
commands, OOPS! commands can be
typed abbreviated to save on typing.
When typed into a program abbre-
viated, they are converted into their
full form on listing so are just as easy
to understand as typing them in fully.
A list of the OOPS! command abbre-
viations is provided here. All abbre-
viations take exactly the same syntax
as the full command.
OOPS! Kickstart File
Generator
You should now have sufﬁcient knowl-
edge to be able to use all of the OOPS!
commands competently. I'l l  now
discuss the OOPS! Kickstart File
Generator program (Listing ts 2).
Most o f  the time when using
OOPS! you will ﬁnd that you always
use the same saving setup, or the same
event times and messages, so it is a

bit of a waste of time to keep on typing
the list of SETEVENT commands or
whatever to see these values every time
you use OOPS! or every time you reset
your Plus/ 4. It would be much easier
to just write a  short "Kickstart"
program to set up the OOPS! func-
tions so that all you need to  do
whenever you use OOPS! is to load
and RUN this program. This is o f
course possible, and you can write such
a program like any other Basic pro-
gram using the OOPS! commands, but
as an alternative, I have included the
OOPS! Kickstart File Generator
which can write such a program itself
A program writing another program!
When you run the Kickstart File
Generator (Henceforth referred to as
KICKGEN), it will ask you a series
of questions. When it has done this,
it will create a Kickstart program and
then save it to disk or cassette. In this
section I'll discuss all the questions
KICKGEN asks, with the expected
replies shown within parentheses.
(1) WINDOW (0/I) Enter which of
the windows you wish to start using
OOPS1 within: The ESC-N type
window 0, or the ESC-R window
(2) CLOCK TIM E  (HH/MM/SS)
Enter the time you wish the OOPS!
clock to be set to when you ﬁrst start
using OOPS! Note that when you are
entering times into KICKGEN, you
mus separate the Hours, Minutes and
Seconds with any character EXCEPT
a colon. For example 10/00/00, 10-
00-00 and 10 0 0  0 0  are all valid, but
10:00:00 will not work as the BASIC
input routine cannot cope with it.
(3) CLOCK DISPLAY (ON/OFF)
Enter whether or not you want the
clock display switched ON or OFF
when you start using OOPS!
(4) DO YOU WANT TO SET THE
ALARM? (YES/NO) I f  you don't
want to bother with setting the OOPS!
alarm, just enter NO and go on to
section (8). If you do want to set the
alarm, follow the steps below.
(5) ALARM TIME (HH:MM) Enter
the time you want to set the alarm to.
(6) ALARM WARNING (Message)
Enter the message that you want to
be displayed on-screen when the alarm
time is reached.
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
35

(7) ALARM STATUS (ON/OFF)
Enter whether or not you want the
alarm to be switched ON or OFF when
you start using OOPS!
(8) DO YOU WANT TO SET ANY
EVENTS? (YES/NO) I f  you don't
want any events set up when you start
using OOPS! enter NO and go to step
(12). Otherwise, enter YES and follow
the steps below.
(9) EVENT X  T I M E  ( H H / MM)
When you have answered that you do
want to set some of the OOPS! events,
you will be asked a series of questions
for each of the events 1-8. The prompts
displayed are of the same form for each
event, with X being the event number
to which the query refers. E.g.
"EVENT 5 TIM E " or "EVENT 7
STATUS". The ﬁrst entry, EVENT
TIME is the time you want this
particlar event to be set to, but if you
don't want to set this event, just press
RETURN w i th o u t entering any-
thing and go on to the next event.
(10) EVENT X MESSAGE (Message)
Enter the message you wish to be
displayed when the time for event X
is reached.
(11) EVENT X STATUS (ON/OFF)
Enter whether or not you want event
number X  to  be enabled (ON) o r
disabled (OFF).
(12) DO YOU WANT TO SET THE
SAVING? (YES/NO) If you want to
set up the automatic saving facility of
OOPS! enter YES and follow the steps
below. I f  not, enter NO and skip to
the end of this section.
(13) SAVE TIMING (1-60) Enter the
period o f time (in minutes) between
subsequent automatic saves.
(14) DEVICE NUMBER (8-11) Enter
the device-number of the disk-drive on
which you wish OOPS! to save its
automatic backup copies.
(15) FILENAME (Name) Enter the
ﬁlename under which you want
backup copies o f a program to be
saved.
(16) VERSION NUMBER (0-9999)
Enter the version number that you
wish the ﬁrst backup copy to  be
marked with when VERSIONM ARK
is executed.
(17) MARKING M OD E (N,T,U)
Enter the ﬁrst character of the mode
PLUS 4 PROGRAM
by which you wish backup copies to
be marked. This should be one o f
(N)umbermark, (T)imemark o r
(U)nmarked.
(18) REPLACING (ON/OFF) Enter
whether or not you wish the previous
backup copy to be erased when a new
backup copy is saved.
(19) SAVING STATUS (ON/OFF)
Enter whether or not you want the
automatic saving function of OOPS!
to be switched ON or OFF when you
ﬁrst start using the system.
When you have answered all the
questions the screen window will clear
and th e  message "C OMPIL IN G
KICKSTART FILE..." will be dis-
played. After this, program lines will
gradually be displayed which set up
all the OOPS! functions as you have
speciﬁed by answering KICKGEN's
questions. When KICKGEN is dis-
playing program lines, what it is doing
is actually building a BASIC program
into another area o f memory from
itself. When it has ﬁnished this process,
KICKGEN displays the message
"COMPILING C OM P L E TE  -
TAPE/ DISK (T/ D)?" If you want to
save the Kickstart program to Tape,
press "T" or i f to Disk, press "D".
KICKGEN then asks you to insert a
disk or tape, and then when you press
RETURN i t  will save the Kick-
start program onto the tape or disk..
When KICKGEN has saved the
Kickstart program, from that time you
can set up your preferred OOPS!
functions simply b y  typing th e
following.
DLOAD "KICKSTART" if you are
using a disk-drive.
LOAD "KICKSTART" if you are
using a Datasette as a more secure
media.
When the program has loaded,
simply t y p e  R U N  a n d  h i t
RETURN O f  course, don't forget
to load the OOPS! main program
before!
That completes our discussion of
the OOPS! coomands and KICKGEN
program. I'll now discuss the most
important aspect of OOPS! - Getting
the thing started!
The OOPS! system comes in two
parts which are the OOPS! Basic
Loader (Listing # 1) and the OOPS!
Kickstart File Generator (Listing # 2).
The Basic Loader is simply used to
create the machine-code OOPS! pro-
gram, and is used as follows:
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
36
Enter Lising I  and RUN. The
program will give messages to allow
you to correct the data lines. Note that
you should start the section of data
with line 1000. To help you, you can
use the line below to set up automatic
line numbering, and function key I to
produce the D ATA command with
one keypress:-
KEY 1, "DATA": AUTO 10
When you have entered Listing # 1
and corrected all your mistakes, the
program will ask you whether you
want to save the OOPS! programs to
disk or tape. Press " D "  or "T" to
choose which and then insert a diskette
or tape and press R E T U R N  t o
save the programs, The programs
saved are: (a) BASIC Loader and (b)
OOPS! Machine-Code Program.
When these programs have been saved,
to use the OOPS! system just reset
your Plus/ 4 and type the following:
For Tape Users: L OAD  "OOPS!"
RETURN R U N  R E TU R N
For Disk Users: DLOAD "OOPS!"
RETURN R U N  R E TU R N
When you type RUN, the OOPS!
commands are enabled, a title screen
displayed and the clock switched on.
You can then write programs or use
OOPS! commands. I f  you use the
RUN/STOP-RESET combination to
escape from a machine-code program,
typing X R E T U R N  f r o m  TED-
MON will get you back into Basic and
re-enable the OOPS! functions.
As mentioned before, the saving
facility of OOPS! cannot be used with
a Datasette, but all the clock, alarm
and event functions may be used with
either disk or tape.
The KICKGEN program (Listing
# 2) can be entered just like any other
normal BASIC program. I t  can be
saved as shown below.
For Tape Users: SAVE "OOPS!
KICKGEN" R E TU R N
For Disk USers: DSAVE "OOPS!
KICKGEN" R E TU R N
The OOPS! KICKGEN program
may be used either with or without
OOPS! resident in memory.
Believe it or not, that concludes this
article about OOPS! Now then, j u s t
format that disk... there we go... hang
on, what does that disk-label say?
"OOPS! Master disk"... Oh ****!

C64 PROGRAM
Logically Speaking
I
have dabbled with the game of
Chess at one time or another, or
perhaps a simpler game of Draughts
on the same board. The complexities
of Chess can be bafﬂing for the
beginner, the rules of Draughts are
more easily understood, but neverthe-
less both of them remain fascinating
games for expert and novice alike. The
topic under discussion now revolves
around the board rather than the
pieces on it, so, if you have such a
board, you may care to get it out and
study it. If not, you will just have to
imagine an eight by eight board: don't
worry about black and white squares,
just stick to the eight by eight board,
and we can continue.
After a quick calculation you might
say that there are 64 squares on the
board, and indeed there are 64 squares
that are just one square in width and
height. But what about the squares
that are two squares in width and
height, or three squares, or even eight

squares? Of course, there is only one
of the latter, but there are many more
of the other sizes and all the interme-
diate ones. How many are there in
total?
As i f  that were not puzzling
enoughrticonsider also that there are
many, many more rectangles formed
than there are squares. Rectangles can
be two squares by one, or four squares
by ﬁ e, and there are far more of them
* tha n the more conventional squares.
So how many rectangles can be
formed on a standard Chess board?
and having discorered that one, what
Is the ﬁnal total for the combined
number of rectangles and squares?
Fortunately for  us there are
mathematical formulae for solving
these particular riddles. However, if I
were 'to simply tell you the answer for
a square the size of a chess board, that
would not tell you the solution for a
nine by nine board, or an even greater
fourteen by fourteen one. Rescue is at
hand once more in the form of the
accompanying program. This will
allow you to solve the riddle of how
many squares and rectangles there are
for a whole range of squares from the
simple two by two to the much more

complex twenty by twenty.
Of course, you could use even
larger numbers, although the square
itself would not be drawn on the screen
and the listing would need amending
accordingly.
First, let us consider the formulae.
If we have a variable 'A' equal to the
size of the square (and thus 'A' would
equal 8 for our Chess board problem),
then the combined total of squares an
rectangles that can be formed is given
by the formula ((a*a+a) * (a*a+a))14.
This gives us the total number, and
the individual number of squares is
given b y  t h e  for m ula  ( 2 * a *
a*a+3*a*a+a),/ 6, F
course work out the number
rectangles easily enough, but just fot
the sake of completeness the formula
that itself gives us the number of
rectangles not including squares is
(3*a*a*a*a+ 2*a*a*a- 3*a*a- 2*a) ./ 12.
A complicated one!
That brings us to the program
listing, and a simple enough one it is
too once we know the relevant for-
mulae. Lines 10 and 20 serve to identify
it, while lines 30 and 40 select our
colour scheme and clear the screen for
neatness. Lines 50 to 60 then allow the

user to input a number in the range
2 to 20, and could be amended if bigger
squares were required, although you
'would then be advised not to attempt
drawing them and skip straight to line
140.
Line 70 clears the screen again,
lines 80 to 130 deﬁne and draw the
square in its entirety, before we get
to the actual calculations. After a brief
statement in line 140, line 150 then
works out the total number of squares
and rectangles using the formula given
earlier. Line 160 calculates the number
of squares and the number of rectan-
gles not including squares. That these
formulae d o  actually give us the
correct answer can soon be veriﬁed by
drawing a trivial square two by two,
for instance, which is easily calculated
.116 the eye.
The answers are displayed by lines
170 to  190, and line 200 rounds
everything off and prevents the pro-
gram falling through to line 210 and
producing a  RETURN WITHOUT
GOS U B error.
That is the program, those are the
formulae, and an interesting little
mathematical diversion they form as
well. However, an article of this nature
would not be complete without giving
you some work to do as well. As we
have seen, there are formulae fo r
squares, but what about triangles?
Imagine an equilateral triangle that is
divided into eight smaller triangles
along its base, eight along its two
remaining sides, and the interior ﬁlled
in with triangles o f the same size.
Rather like an eight by eight Chess
board, we might be said to have an
eight b y  eight b y eight triangle.
Remembering that triangles can be
formed upside down as well as the right
way up, what is the total number of
triangles contained within the big
triangle, noting that the big triangle
as a whole adds one to the total, just
as the entire Chess board adds one to
the number o f squares. Easy i f you

Switching The Bases
As human beings we are accustomed
to counting in a numerical system that
uses ten as its base, hence we arrive
at what is called a decimal system. This
is not particularly convenient fo r
computers which are ideally suited to
the so-called binary system.
As far as computers are concerned
an electronic circuit can be either
C64 PROGRAM
turned on o r off, i t only has two
possible values associated with it, and,
if we give those values the numerical
associations of zero and one, we have
the basis for this binary system.
Binary and decimal do not mix
happily though, and so a third count-
ing system comes into the reckoning.
This is known as hexadecimal, using
the number 16 as its base. Unfortu-
nately the Arabic numerals from which
our own derive only ascend as far as
9, using the symbols 0, 1, 2 and so
on. Rather than inventing new sym-
bols, hexadecimal uses letters of the
alphabet. These letters are A, B, C,
D, E and F, and this gives us hex-
adecimal numbers of the form 12FE
for example.
In order to convert numbers from
one numerical system to another, we
need only know the base that is being
used. Fo r  instance, the decimal
number 1234 is easily translated as 4
plus 3 times 10 plus 2 times 10 to the
power 2 plus I times 10 to the power
of 3. The further left we go in the
number, the greater the power of ten
that is being used. To take our earlier
hexadecimal example of IN F, know-
ing that E is equivalent to the decimal
number 14 and F is equivalent to the
decimal number 15, we arrive at 14
plus 15 times 16 plus 2 times 16 to
the power of 2 plus 1 times 16 to the
power o f 3, o r 1790 in our more
familiar decimal systern
rhus the basis for all counting
systems rests in the base being used,
and by multiplying that base num
raised to the appropriate power by t
number concerned, we can easily
convert from one numerical base to
another, To give another example, let
us assume a numerical system that uses
the base 7. An unusual choice, per-
haps, hut an interesting one nonethe-
less. If we look at a number of 1234
which was expressed using this base
of 7, to convert it back into our own
decimal system we have 4 plus 3 times
7 plus 2 times 7 to power 2 plus 1
times 7 to power 3. This equates to
a decimal number of 466.
Now we arrive at the mathematical
diversions. To begin with, we will be
using a base of 8, a base of 5, and
a base o f 7. In  other words, three
different bases. What we want to ﬁnd
is a solution to the following equation,
assuming the variable 'A' to be the
number we are looking for: A  (base
8) minus A (base 5) equals A  (base
7). The A n u m b e r ,  but using a

different numerical base for each time
that it is expressed. What is more. we
want to ﬁnd a four digit number that
will obey the equation, and, to com-
plicate matters still further, we would
like to ﬁnd a number which has its
second and third digits equal. A
number like 1221, fo r  example,
although that is not the answer.
Many such problems can be
devised, and I shall leave you with one
to ponder on at the end of this article.
For now, let us consider the problem
as it stands and the program listing
that enables us to solve it. With the
rules of the problem clearly expressed,
and the method of translating numbers
from one base to  another already
deﬁned, the listing should pose no
problems.
Line 10 serves to  identify the
program and its author before line 20
Ssit
' t i r  colour scheme, while line 30
ars the screen. The loop in line 40
s et up to cover all possible four digit
numbers, and with lines 50 and 60 we
set up a string variable so that we can
check for the presence of two equal
digits in the second and third positions
within those four digit numbers.
Ali

to continue the search, ultimately
concluding with that line i f no such
number is found. However, i f  the
second and third digits are the same
then we go in turn to lines 110, 130,
150 and 170 in order to convert that
number to base 8, 5, 7 and 10 respec-
tvely, before going to line 190 and
displaying the numbers on the screen
to inform the user of the progress being
made.
If the equation now holds true then
line 90 tells us of the relevant number
before halting the program with an
END statement, otherwise we carry on
with the loop in line 100.
The ﬁrst number that conforms
with our equation is the decimal
number 1332. That is, 1332 in base 8
minus 1332 in base 5 equals 1332 in
base 7. The decimal number 2664 also
obeys the rules.
That is a simple example of the
kind of problem that can be set when
using a mixture of bases for counting
purposes. Now consider a different
sort of problem using the equation A
(base it) equals A (base y) plus A (bak
z). I f  the numeric variable 'A ' is
representing the decimal number 1171,
what are the values of x, y and z? In
other c i s ,  what bases are we using??

I
we introduced you to the idea of
a simple expert system, from now
on, we will look at the more sophis-
ticated knowledge base which I intro-
duced i n  that article. This system
comprises of three programmes:
EDR -  the source program editor
KBDEN 
-
 the knowledge base
compiler
INQUIRE -  the inference engine
Why three programs? The most
important consideration is space
available for data, which is increased
by keeping the programs small. Speed
of operation is also improved, as once
the application has been debugged, it
is only necessary to use the INQUIRE
program which reads in the data in
a compressed and preprocessed for-
mat. I n  this section, we will be
concerned mainly with the editor, but
ﬁrst a quick overview of the whole
system.
Deﬁning a knowledge
base
To create the knowledge base for the
reason program, we ﬁrst processed all
the data that we had on the subject
in question and arranged it into a tree
structure. In the case of the very simple
chemical analysis example, we ended
up with a nice simple symetric tree,
which therefore took an efﬁcient path
to any of the solutions. If we were to
extend this, we would have to start
using tests to  identify particular
chemicals and so the tree would •no
longer by symetric. This is similar to
the car maintenance example, where
128 P R O G R A MMI N G
Reasoning On
The 128
We continue with our expert system for the 128
computer
By Paul Schoﬁeld
it was suggested that the ﬁrst questions
might be:
fuel tank is empty?
battery is ﬂat?
In this case, we pick these as
starting questions, because they are
easy to check and the produce a simple
solution.
In terms o f our expert system
however, they represent a fundamen-
tally different approach. We pick a
solution to the problem, namely, put
petrol in fuel tank and ask a set of
questions to support it. If the answers
are afﬁrmative we have an answer,
otherwise we take the next possible
solution and test that.
This is the approach that our new
knowledge base system will adopt. It
is probably the most widely used in
this type o f application and has a
number o f  advantages. There are,
however, attendant disadvantages,
and so the system must endeavour to
take account of these.
Incomplete data
One of the ﬁrst rules one learns as a
programmer is, garbage i n  means
garbage out, and this is particularly
true of this type of expert system. To
deﬁne your knowledge base, i t is
necessary to deﬁne your targets (the
possible solution) and the conditions
which must be satisﬁed for a particular
target to be the solution. The order
in which you deﬁne the targets also
implicitly deﬁnes the order in which
they are evaluated. This is good,
because at the outset you can start by
just entering conditions, which you
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
46
know to be true about a target. The
disadvantage is easily shown by an
example. Suppose you write a knowl-
edge base for animal identiﬁcation.
The ﬁrst target is cat and the condi-
tions are:
Has four legs?
Has a tail?
In use, the knowledge base will tell
you that a wide variety of animals are
cats. The real message is 'according to
the supplied criteria a possible solution
is a cat'. For the expert system to be
useful it's not sufﬁcient for it simply
to stop at the ﬁrst solution, i t must
provide to additional options:
Why - A justiﬁcation of the solution,
More -  Continue to look for other
solutions.
With the aid o f these tools it is
possible to  identify sections o f the
knowledge base, which are incomplete
and identify suitable conditions to
apply. We will consider such problems
in a little more detail when we consider
the source deﬁnition language and the
inference engine, but this should
sufﬁce as a general introduction to the
system.
EDR - The source ﬁle
editor
The obvious question is why not use
the Basic editor? One reason of course
is that the Basic editor produces
tokenized program ﬁles, but in general
it is more convenient to use either a
general purpose text editor or one
speciﬁc to the particular application.
EDR is speciﬁc to this application, but

would not require much modiﬁcation
to make a general purpose text editor.
To run the editor, simply enter: run
•EDR' The editor initialises various
variables and then displays the main
options menu. Most of these are self
explanatory, so we will just consider
option 1, create/ edit RAL source ﬁle.
When this option is selected, a help
bar is displayed at the top of the screen
showing the functions assigned to the
function keys. The remainder of the
screen is either blank (create) o r
displays the start o f  the currently
loaded ﬁle. The ﬁles produced are
sequential ﬁles, so no line numbers are
needed, just enter the text you require.
The following special function keys are
also supported:

: Move csr to top left of
screen
: Move up 20 lines or to
top of ﬁle
: Move down 20 lines or
to end of ﬁle
: exit from edit mode
One automatic function o f  the
editor is that when the bottom of the
screen is reached, the text is scrolled
up 10 lines.
Modyfying The Editor
The functions supported by the editor
are all that you are likely to need for
entering knowledge base deﬁnitions.
For more general use a few modiﬁ-
cations are likely to be needed. New
edit functions can be added very easily.
Add a  test for the key in question
between line 10300 and line 10500 and
insert the corresponding subroutine
somewhere between line 2000 and line
4999.
Two additional modiﬁcations may
also be required:
128 P R O G R A M M I N G
1) Currently the number of lines of
text is written at the start of the disk
ﬁles. If this is considered undesirable,
the disk read/ write routines must be
changed to detect ed.
2) Commodore Basic has trouble with
commas when writing text to disk ﬁles
unless special precautions are taken.
As the knowledge base deﬁnition
language does not use commas, this
has not been done.
We shall now look at the deﬁnition
language R A L  and the compiler
program KBGEN.
Having experimented with the
REASON program, and typing in the
EDR Editor. We will now look at the
knowledge base deﬁnation. Later, we
will look at the compiler program,
KBGEN. First of all though, we will
look at the deﬁnation language. As
these 3 programs together represent
the package Reason Version 3, I have
called the language, Reason Applica-
tion Language (RAL).
Before going into details though,
a quick look at some of the objectives.
Although KBGEN is technically a
compiler, I prefer to think of it as a
simple preprocessor. I t  does not
generate machine code, but simply
takes a description of data structures
in a readable format and translates
them into a set of arrays suitable for
driving an inference engine. It was also
considered important, that the com-
piler should be able to  output the
processed knowledge base on a differ-
ent disk to the source ﬁle. This is
adminstratively very convenient, but,
if tedious disk swapping is to  be
avoided, requires that the entire source
ﬁle is read before attempting to write
the output ﬁle. This in turn dictates
that large string storage requirements
are provided and i n  order not to
unduly restrict the size of applications
the language becomes a little cryptic
in places.
It i s possible t o  change this
approach, but I  would recommend
trying the existing system ﬁrst, it's not
really that difﬁcult.
Structure of RAI,
RAL is a block structured language
like Pascal or C, but the syntax of the
individual blocks is a bit more rigid.
Outside any of the blocks comment
lines are permitted, so the basic
structure of a RAL program is:
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
47
comments
RAL BLOCK
comments
comments
RAL BLOCK
comments
There are 5 types of RAL block:-
HELP - Initial instructions displayed
to user of base.
TARGETS -  Deﬁne the set of target
solutions.
CONDITIONS -  Deﬁne the set o f
questions the user is asked.
RELATIONS - Deﬁne set of rules for
evaluating targets.
IMPLIES -  Deﬁnes how additional
conditions may be inferred from a
users response.
The structure of each block is as
follows:
BLOCK-HEADER
block statements
END [comment]
The square brackets [ ]  indicate
optional elements.
Comments
As mentioned previously, comments
may be included anywhere outside a
block, they have the format:
; [any text string]
It is important that the i s  the
ﬁrst character on comment lines and
these are simply ignored b y the
compiler. It would not be difﬁcult to
permit comments within blocks, but
it would greatly slow down the com-
piler and is not very useful.
Help Section
The help section i s optional, but
should normally be included i n all
RAL deﬁnitions. It simply deﬁnes a
number of lines o f explanatory text
that will be displayed to the user before
any questions are asked. I t  may
typically be used to display a title, take
credit for creating the knowledge base
and providing any necessary back-
ground information. It is not necessary
to include any information on how to
respond to reason questions as this is
automatically o u t p u t  b y  t h e
INQUIRE program. The format of the
help section is:

HELP integer
help-text-lines
end [HELP]
where:
integer deﬁnes the number of lines of
help information following,
help-text-lines are the help informa-
tion in the format to be displayed.
Targets Section
The targets section deﬁnes the text
strings describing the target solutions
and i s obviously mandatory. The
format of the targets section is:
TA RGETS integer
target-lines
END [TA RGETS]
where:
'integer' deﬁnes the number of entries
to be reserved for targets.
and target-lines have the format:
[index] target-text
where:
index is an optional target number
reference (1,2,3 etc..)
target-text is the text that will be
displayed to describe the solution.
Note
The purpose o f integer is to deﬁne
internal storage requirements and so
must be the same as or greater than
the number of following targets. The
index is purely a comment, a bit like
a Basic line number. It is used in later
sections to identify speciﬁc targets and
is therefore useful in large knowledge
bases. The ﬁrst index is always I and
they are allocated consecutively.
Conditions Section
The conditions section deﬁnes the
questions which will be asked to the
user and is obviously mandatory. The
format of the conditions section is:
CONDITIONS integer
condition-lines
END [CONDITIONS]
where:
integer deﬁnes the number of entries
to be reserved for conditions.
condition-lines have the format:
[index] condition-text
where:
index is an optional condition number
128 P R O G R A M M I N G
reference (1,2,3 etc..)
condition-text i s the text o f  the
questions displayed to the user.
integer and index are treated as for
targets.
Relations Section
The relations section deﬁnes the rules
for evaluating targets according to the
answers to the condition questions.
The results of the various conditions
may be either
irrelevant
(must be true fo r target to  be a
solution) or relevant (must be false for
target to be a solution).
By default, all conditions are
considered irrelevant unless mentioned
explicitly within a rule in the relations
section. The format of the relations
section is:
RELATIONS
relation-rules
END [RELATIONS]
where:
relation-rules have the format: target-
index operator condition-index-list
where:
operator is '+' following conditions
must be ture, or following conditions
must be false.
condition-index-list is a number o f
condition indices separated by spaces.
Implies Section
The implies section is optional. I t
deﬁnes the results o f further condi-
tions, which may be determined from
the result of the current condition. The
object of this section is to avoid asking
questions whose results should already
be known and to a lesser extent, avoid
investigating impossible targets as
quickly as possible. For example, i f
during the investigation of one target
the question is asked "IS OBJECT
BLUE?" and the answer is true, it is
quite obvious that a later question "IS
OBJECT RED?" must have the
answer false. The implies section
allows upto three aditional results to
be implied for both a true or false
answer to a particular condition. Its
format is:
IMPLIES
PLIES
implication-rules
END [IMPLIES]
where the format o f implication
rules is:
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
48
result-condition implied-condition
[implied-condition [implied-con-
dition]]
and th e  format o f  both result-
condition and implied condition is:
I - 'condition-index
As with relation rules + = true and
- = false.
If that sounds a little confusing,
then have a  look at the example
program in ﬁgure I. Yes we are back
with our mixed up chemical bottles
again! With only 5  targets and 4
conditions this is very simple and i t
is easy to see how the relations and
implies sections are used.
It is always best to work through
the targets in the order they are deﬁned
as this is also the order in which they
will be tested. In this case we check
ﬁrstly for a strong acid. For this to
be the case, blue litmus must be turned
strongly red. This is a rather subjective
question, so the simpler condition Blue
Litmus Turned Red is considered ﬁrst.
In the relations section, we see to rules
deﬁned, the ﬁrst saying that conditions
I and 2 must be true and a second
requiring conditions 3 and 4 to be false.
It is quite obvious in fact that if I and
2 are true that 3 and 4 will be false,
but this is deﬁned in the implies section
instead. The reason for doing it this
way is that at some time the future
it could be decided to reorganise to
test targets in a different order. This
becomes difﬁcult i f the rules o f the
relations section are incomplete.
KBGEN program
The structure of this program is quite
simple. The main program reads in the
RAL source ﬁle line by line and looks
for the sections in the expected order.
Within each section the lines are
validated according to  the deﬁned
syntax. Any errors encountered are
reported and i f the error is fatal the
processing aborted. Standard subrou-
tines are used for skipping spaces and
ﬁnding and extracting various ele-
ments in the source lines. It should not
be that difﬁcult to make changes to
the program if desired.
The most obvious change to con-
sider is to open the output ﬁle on the
same disk at the start of the program.
As the format of the help, targets and
condition sections is very simple, these
can be written directly to the output
ﬁle after being validated so the large
string arrays are avoided. This saving

can then be used to allow targets and
conditions to  be referenced b y an
identiﬁer rather than an index. This
has the advantage of making it simpler
to reorganise a knowledge base, but
searching the look-up tables needed
will make compilation much slower.
128 P R O G R A M M I N G
It also makes the relations section
longer and the lines o f the implies
section more difﬁcult to  parse. I n
principle there is no limit to the length
of such identiﬁers, but in practice the
longer the identiﬁers the shorter are
the corresponding target and condi-

Dos
We put everything you have learned in this series to
some practicle use
By Fergal Moane
T
presents a complete disk oper-
ating system, which puts into
practice some o f the theory already
learned. If you are interested, disas-
sembly o f  the code fro m SC26B
onwards should be useful.
Dos 6_1 - The Utility
T
as DOS 5.1 on the demo disk.
DOS 5.1 i s  the most used
Commodore utility in America. This
system outstrips i t in a  number o f
ways:
1) DOS 6.1 actually tokenises it's new
commands. Tokens are one byte values
representing commands, and are used
by ordinary Basic for all commands.
This ensures compatibility, space
economy, and no need for a preﬁxing
character.
2) The above feature means that DOS
6.1 commands can be used in program
mode, unlike most normal extensions.
3) DOS 6.1 provides more comprehen-
sive commands in an easily understood
form.
4) You are left around 3K free in the
4K block o f memory from $C000-
D000
5) Loading is under ten seconds,
providing you save out the code
seperately, and the program is easily
copied to your own disks.
Users Guide
DISK ERROR STATUS
DERR displays the status of the disk
drive at the current position on the
screen. See your manual for a full
explanation of error messages.
Syntax: DERR
DOSS COMMAND
DOS sends a command to the disk
drive, opening up a range of around
50 disk commands. Again, see a
manual for details o f standard disk
commands. If DOS is used without a
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
command, the error status will be
returned.
Syntax: DOS"command"
DIRECTORY
Displays the directory of drive 0 or
I (Usually drive 0) without loading it
into memory.
Syntax: DIR, drive number
MEMORY SAVE
Saves memory from start address to
end address to the speciﬁed device.
This is very useful with graphics or
machine code data.
Syntax: MSAVE, start, end, "ﬁle-
name", dev
DEFAULT TO DISK
This sets device 8 as the default device
for all SAVE and LOAD operations.
LOAD"ﬁlename will now have the
same effect as LOAD“ﬁlename",8
Syntax: DISK
DEFAULT TO TAPE
Tape is now the default device for
SAVing and LOAding.
Syntax: TAPE
NORMAL DEVICE NUMBERS
This returns to the normal Commo-
dore device numbering system. Use
this if you need to load with ,8,1
Syntax: NORMAL
LIST BASIC PROGRAM
DLIST allows you to  list a  Basic
program directly o ff disk without
loading it into memory. This is useful
in checking a program, or grabbing
lines from another program. RUN/
STOP will stop the listing at any time.
If you try to list a non-basic program,
you will get the expected garbage.
Press RUN/STOP RESTORE fol-
lowed by CLOSE2 to recover.
Syntax: DLIST,"ﬁlename"
LEAVE DOS 6.1
Leaves the DOS 6.1 system without
disturbing Basic o r any memory.
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
54
SYS49152: SYS49676 will return you
to the DOS 6.1 system.
Syntax: QUIT
MEMORY USAGE
A memory map of the system could
be useful:
C000 - C120
Program for adding
new tokens
C150 - CIB1 T a b l e  o f  j u m p
addresses fo r new
commands
C2000 - C53A N e w  Dos routines
D538 - CEFF Free RAM for user
programs
Some low memory and zero page
locations are also altered during the
command processing, but this has no
effect on Basic and the area around
the tape buffer is untouched.
Loading DOS 6.1
T
program. When run, you will
be presented wth a screen o f
instructions. The machine code is
being POKed into memory at this
stage. On completion of the program
NEWs itself and you are into the DOS
system. Obviously, you will not want
to keep having to load the basic loader
each time you wish to use it. Therefore,
I suggest you use the MSAVE com-
mand to save out the relevant two
portions of memory.
USING DOS 6.1 IN  YOUR OWN
PROGRAM
As the commands can be used in your
own programs, it would be inconve-
nient to have to load DOS 6.1 in every
time, expecially if your program is seen
by others. Follow the following proce-
dure to include it in your program.
Load the two machine code ﬁles
that you have saved at the start of your
program. Immediately afterwards
SYS49152: SYS49676 to initialise the
commands.
Program Notes
W
modiﬁed environment, C64
Basic insists that you now
have to enter colons after a THEN
statement. There seems to be no way
to overide this, but it does not effect
programs saved in the normal envi
These will work normally.
EG:- 10 GET A8: IF A$= "" THEN:
GOTO 10

It began in 1971 in Canada, with
a protest voyage into a nuclear test

disrupted and the area is now a bird
sanctuary. In 1977 Greenpeace opened
its ﬁrst branch in Britain where, to
date, i t has over 250,000 members.
Today there are over 3

of these coming from the USA. This

many objectives still to be reached.
Why do we need Organisations like
Greenpeace? What is so harmful with
dumping waste? The wastes are con-
coctions o f  poisonous substances:
metals like Copper, Lead, Zinc,
Chlorine. Mercury and Arsenic. These
build u p  i n  the environment and
poison food sources. For example: In
Wood Spring, North Devon people
were warned not to eat more than lib
of Shrimps or 4oz of shellﬁsh due to
the excess o f cadmium (a harmful
poison) therein. Two million tonnes
per year of such waste is dumped in
the Irish sea.
Although a direct connection has
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989

not been established between waste-
dumping and the virus that killed
17,000 seals last year (and appears to
; be re-emerging amongst the remaining
Common Seal population), the pos-
sibility that pollution was the cause
cannot be overlooked and emphasises
the urgency for action. There are many
more examples o f  such atrocities
caused by "Man's inhumanity to man",
including Chernobyl, the Alaska oil
spillage, the plight o f  the whales,
elephants; too numerous to list, but
what of the successes?
7.1 I n  the past few years Greenpeace
has: Stopped hunts o f  seal pups;
helped bring about an end in commer-
cial whaling; stopped the burning of
hazardous waste in the North Sea, US
waters a n d  th e  Mediterranean;
stopped the dumping o f radioactive
wastes at sea, helped persuade the
British Government to spend millions
of pounds cleaning the beaches i n
Britain and ﬁltering the waste from
coal-ﬁred power stations.
The majority of these achievements
are brought about by sheer bravery.
Greenpeace activists went o u t i n
dinghyies and positioned themselves
between the harpoons of the whaling
boats and the ﬂeeing whales. As a
result Commercial whaling is now
banned. In the North Atlantic, Green-
peace drove its inﬂatable dinghyies
under barrels o f radioactive waste,
therefore dumping of such waste at sea
has now been stopped. Volunteers
physically prevented baby seals being
killed in the Orkney Isles and New-
foundland b y  throwing themselves
between the hunters and the pups.
The level of the danger in which
these people place themselves became
apparent when one man was killed on
the Rainbow Warrior when i t was
destroyed whilst trying to  stop the
testing o f nuclear weapons o ff the
coast of New Zealand. These people
are risking their lives? What can you

ENTITLED 'Rainbow
Warrior', the Greenpeace
game is set to raise a few
eyebrows. It has already
provoked a Conservative
MP to condemn it,
believing that many
computer garners may set
about industrial pipelines
and use other forms of
violence in order to
'practise' the Greenpeace
methods shown in the
game.
The gameplay is split
into several sections. all of
which are based on separate
ecological problems. You
play a Greenpeace
supporter who is
determined to protect
wildlife and stop pollution
of the natural world, and
each section is a mini-game
all in itself. Among other
tasks you have to prevent
whaling ships from catching
their prey by manoeuvring
the Greenpeace boat
between the whale and the
ship, save penguins from
straying into a beam that
has broken through the
ozone layer, and you must
stop seal culling by ruining
the pelts of cubs, this is
done by spraying them with
green paint.
Although the game
features very strong
opinions, Microprose has
made the graphics slightly
humorous in tone, so as to
appeal to a wider market.
74 _IP 1 7
The sprites are enormous
and the animation as
smooth as baby's bottom,
they have even been
described as Python-esque.
Rainbow Warrior
should now be available on
Amiga and C64, and it is to
coincide with the new
Greenpeace album,
Rainbow Warners, which
features such artists as U2
and Simple Minds.

THERE have been ma
cult shows from television.
By 'cult' I mean shows
which have seen more
repeats than a particularly
bad curry. Examples are
The Wooden Tops, Bill and
Ben - The Flowerpot men,
Andy Pandy and
Thunderbirds. All of these
have something rather
signiﬁcant in common,
their actors were more
wooden than the cast of
Neighbours, and have more
strings than all of
Hitchcock's ﬁnest thrillers
put together. They all
featured puppets.
The latter of these
reputable shows is the one
which we are to spotlight
here, mainly due to the fact
that International Rescue
see their ﬁrst pixelised
exploits, thanks to software
company Grandslam,
whose previous credits
include Pacland, Pacmania
and The Running Man, as
well as the forthcoming
Liverpool - The Computer
Football Game (which has
been widely acclaimed).
Thunderbirds is its ﬁrst
venture into the world of
Gerry Anderson, although
contacts have it that it will
not be the last (look out
Mysterons...!).
Released in the early
sixties, Thunderbirds
gained popularity at an
alarming rate, due mainly
to Anderson's previous
successes - Captain Scarlet,
Fireball XL5, and Stingray
to name a few - but. there
was something rather
special about the Tracy
family that enthralled
viewers everywhere, and the
plots were far more detailed
than the simple rescue
missions that they seemed
to portray.
The characters created
were not as shallow as one
may expect. Each one had a
more complex background
and history than many at
the forefront of soap
operas, thus making for a
slightly more involving
program. The personnel of
of International Rescue •
runs as follows:
Jeff Tracy - Founder of
International Rescue, and
father of ﬁve sons (who are
also in the 'family
business).
Scott Tracy - Eldest of the
brothers, pilot of
Thunderbird 1, and second
in command if anything
happens to his father.
-
Virgil Tracy - Pilot of
Thunderbird 2, also
deputises on Thunderbird 3
when Alan is not available.
Alan Tracy - Pilot of
Thunderbird 3, also
alternates with John on
tours of duty on
Thunderbird 5. Is
romantically involved with
TinTin.

Gordon Tracy - Pilot of
Thunderbird 4.
John Tracy - Spends most
of his time on Thunderbird
5, due to his days as a radio
ham. Occasionally replaces
Alan on Thunderbird 3.
Brains - Designer of the
Thunderbird equipment
and technical genius. Has a
tendency to stutter.
Kyrano Th e  Tracy Island
cook. Is half-brother of the
villainous Hood.
Tin Tin - Kyrano's daughter
is in love with Alan, and

repair the Thunderbird
equipment.
Lady Penelope - Ex-British
agent, famous for her
unique pink Rolls Royce
FAB 1.
Parker - Failed safe-
cracker who was caught by
Lady Penelope. Acts as her
butler as 'cover'.
All of these except Lady
Penelope and Parker were
based on Tracy Island,
which wowed audiences
with its great technical
sequences when the
Thunderbirds lifted into the
air, most memorable of
which was the swimming
pool which slid back to
allow Thunderbird I to
soar from it's underground
launching pad. The craft
themselves were superbly
designed, thus encouraging
kiddies everywhere to
request a home version of
Thunderbird 2 - the most
ingenious of them all-
courtesy of Dinky toys.
Thunderbird 2 was popular
because of it's ability to
store other pieces of
equipment - namely
Thunderbird 4 i n  its
stomach.
It is this depth,
characterisation, gripping
plots and technical
brilliance that made
Thunderbirds the most
successful of Gerry
Anderson's productions,
and it is for this reason that
the computer game should
not go without notice. The
game has many of its own
merits, being the best
arcade adventure to see

these shores for many
months is just the ﬁrst.
The game features four
different missions. You
must control two characters
in each and perform certain
actions in order to come
out unscathed (although
Thunderbirds can never die,
and so sayeth the lord
Anderson) and acclaimed
as a hero. The ﬁrst - Mine
Menace - involves Alan
and Brains who have to
rescue some trapped
miners. This is not a simple
operation as priority lies in
shutting off the mine's
pumping station before it
ﬂoods the whole mine, thus
rendering all to be rescued
by a rival team, causing
embarrassment and clients
to seek other help - like I
said, Thunderbirds cannot
die.
The other three levels -
Sub Crash, Bank Job and
Countdown to Terror
respectively - are all in a
similar vein, although time
limits in which to complete
your task get progressively
more restrictive, and the
problems connected to the
mission become harder to
ﬁgure out.
Graphics throughout
are very pretty and true to
Anderson's original ideas.
Presentation throughout is
of a very high quality, for
instance, before each
mission there is a small
digitised animation
sequence from the old
episodes, for the four
sections are all based on
existing, single shows,

will ﬁnd no favours in

theme tune - 5... 4... 3... 2...
Thunderbirds are Go!...
Born... Born... Born_
Born_ etc. - has been
reworked to a rather good
house version, which
accompanies the title
sequences but leaves the
game itself to sampled
sound effects.
Another small thing
that I think helps sway my
attitude about this game is
the small animated
sequences which the
graphics go through at
certain stages (similar to
Little Computer People)
giving the game more
character. Each mission has
a password which once
discovered allows passage
straight into the section
without the earlier messy

GILBERT - ESCAPE
ROM DRILL
gain Again - n.99/114.99
Follow Gilbert on his snotty escapades as
he explores the planet Drill, whilst
searching for the missing parts to the
Millenium Dustbin.
THE cute but snotty alien,
Gilbert, is hankering once
again for the bright lights
of ITV. He has the
contract, and the ego, now
all he needs to do is ﬁnd the
missing parts of the
Milleniurn Dustbin and
sign on the dotted line.
Gilbert has twenty four
hours to ﬁnd the ﬁve
missing parts, hidden by the
discerning TV watchers of
the planet, before some
other, hopefully more
talented, star signs the
contract. No Drillian
possesses a full set of
faculties and these would-
be saboteurs have actually
left clues in various video
games, which should help
Gilbert fulﬁll his quest in
snottifying the minds of the
Earthly young.
Gilbert starts his
adventure in the middle of
his home town, though why
someone would wish to
build a town in such a
hostile place is beyond me.
As you slither - yes Gilbert
has no feet - across town
you are assaulted by all
manner of beasts.
Fortunately Gilbert can
dispatch these creatures
with a ﬂick of the head and
a globule of snot. This
formidable method of
defence is ﬁnite but fresh
supplies of the sticky green
stuff can be found in milk
bars, along with the video
games which gave the
missing parts. If Gilbert
manages to shoot an entire
wave of creatures, a ﬂying
plate of wobbling jelly
gyrates its way onto the
screen. Shooting this either
liberates nothing, a can of
beans, or a piece of cake.
Of which four of these
items can be carried at any
one time. If the beans are
eaten Gilbert bloats and
ﬂoats, enabling him to
reach the upper levels of the
forest and change levels
when in the sewer system.
Eating the cake brings
Gilbert back to Drill with a
bump, obviously made with
the wrong brand of ﬂour.
The ﬁve video games
which Gilbert must
complete offer a welcome
break from the more
mundane pleasures of
snotting monsters in the
street. Some of the better
games include Earth
Invaders - in which a one
eyed monster blasts at rows
of descending humans.
Brain Drain - play against
the computer to see who
can match the most tiles.
And Snotﬁght at the OK
Corral - snot *ern cowboy.
Failure to complete a video
game produces a loss of one
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
64
hour of time.
Unlike other games the
attacking creatures never
cease to amaze as they
come forth in a never
ending variety of guises.
The playing area is not that
small, and not only is there
a cityscape to contend with,
but a jungle, sewer, tree top
and underwater adventures
to occupy the mind.
Snotting good fun even if
the gameplay is a little too
repetitive.

Enigma Variations, headed

what Jim that was.

I
SCRAMBLERS, in my
opinion, could be so called
because a couple of hours
on the back of one of these
things it's scrambled brains
for tea, dear. The only
advantage posed here is one
of less excitement coupled
with even less pain than the
real thing.
Fifteen tracks of pure
frustration lie before you,
and failure to complete one
within the time limit means
a trip all the way back to
the beginning. You start
with the three dirt tracks
beginning with the ever so
easy track A. which is
designed to allow you to
save face by letting you
complete at least one of the
ﬁfteen tracks. To complete
the ﬁrst track you simply
have to ensure that the gear
you are currently in (out of
three) is correct for the
slope you are travelling on.
And that the bike you have
the pretence of controlling
does not exceed one of the
two extremes of speed -
stalling, or going so fast
you end up ﬂying over the
handlebars.
On the second dirt track
you hit your ﬁrst real
obstacles, and ﬁnd a use for
the other controllable
movements, the raising of
the front and back wheels -
not at the same time I
hasten to add. This track
also teaches you the
premise upon which this
game is based, precise
control over the bike's
speed. When travelling over
stumps and rubble you
must ensure that your speed
does not exceed a narrow
set of limits. Failure to do
so results in the action
freezing and a message
informing you whether you
went too fast or too slow.
You may note that you do
not even have the
satisfaction of seeing your
biker bite the dust.
Gremlin - E9.99/114.99
Mount up and pit your sanity against the
latest game to bring you all the thrills and
spills of high risk sport without the risks
and without the thrills and even less of
the sport.
GAMES UPDATE
By the time you have
reached the third track you
must have mastered the
raising and lowering of the
wheels - if not you might as
well turn your computer off
and start again. Here the
main obstacle comes in the
form of small holes, which
require you to raise your
bike wheels whilst passing
over them. Next come three
tracks with Beetles, the car
variety, skips and watery
pits. On these courses the
control over your speed
becomes too critical for
your joystick to handle with
any degree of accuracy, and
you inevitably crash.
If speed and gear
selections were all you had
to worry about, then life
might even approach
something like simple, but
you also have to ensure that
you stay on the course as
indicated on a small strip of
the screen which shows
sideways movement.

RED STORM
RISING
Microprose - PC - ,C34.99
Tom Clancy S' novel of World War III
submarine warfare comes to life as you
take the helm of a US Attack submarine.
Sooner or later, it had to happen.
WHEN Islamic
fundamentalists destroyed
the Russian oilﬁelds, war
looked inevitable as the
Great Bear set its sights on
the Middle East. The
combat that followed as the
super powers clashed would
be partially decided by
naval actions in the crucial
North Atlantic. As a
submarine commander
your strategy and skill will
be vital in hunting and
destroying enemy subs, task
forces and troop carriers,
Before you take on such
responsibilities you can test
your skills in a series of
training missions, during
which time you can learn
how to use the sea's thermal
layer to avoid enemy
detection, the importance
of keeping your speed low
and a reasonable depth to
ensure your propeller
doesn't eavate in the water
(and attract enemy sonar),
and how and when to use
the weapon systems. The
toughest part of submarine
warfare is tracking down
your enemy without him
ﬁnding you. This means
you can't use active sonar,
which would give away
your position. You must
ﬁnd a quiet part of the
ocean and listen for the
signs that your passive
sonar can ﬁnd. Once you
have a good sonar contact
(above 90% - many
torpedoes are ﬁred in haste
41111111
at poor contacts) you can
ﬁre your torpedoes at a
submarine, or missiles at
the surface contact.
Although you can play
individual scenarios, the
real challenge is when you
play the Red Storm Rising
Scenario and play your part
in World War III. Here
your missions are carried
out and directly affect the
backdrop of the war.
Graphic sequences set the
scene as Nato battles
against the Soviet
onslaught. An example of
this is when you're sent in
to intercept a task force
carrying troops. Not only
do you have to track down
and attack the convoy, your
success at sinking the troop
carriers will decide the
success or failure of the
Soviet attack. If you do
badly, the map will rapidly
turn red.
As an idea, Red Storm
Rising can't be faulted. It's
based on a best selling book
by a bestselling author and
the computer
implementation provides all
the options and problems
that face a modern
submarine commander,
who must do his best to win
battles that effect the
Outcome of the war.
Unfortunately, the game
falls down on presentation.
Although the clips showing
the progress of the war are
good, the actual screens
G A ME S  U P D A T E
used in the battles (most of
the game) are dull. In fact,
there's no comparison to
games such as Silent
Service or 688 Attack sub.
As a result this will deter
many garners from a
challenging and fascinating
game.
Tony Hetherington
Red Storm Rising was
written, in conjunction with
Tom Clancy, by Sid Meir
who was the author of F-I5
Strike Eagle and Silent
Service, He was also the co-
founder of Microprose.

STORMLORD
1
AN evil Queen dominates
the once beautiful and
peaceful land. It was a land
where fairies frolicked and
butch heroes lay around
being butch. It was also
incredibly dull, so it's just
as well that the Queen
arrived with her evil
minions. Hideous creatures
roam the land, man-eating
plants have taken root, and
frolicking fairies lie
captured in cages. Now
Stormlord must rescue the
fairies and liberate the land
by destroying the Queen.
The land is represented
on screen by a series of
levels, each consisting of a
number of sideways
scrolling screens.
Docile plants, statues,
steps, and boulders form
the platforms on which our
hero can walk and jump.
Control is somewhat
Limited although you can
build up power for a bigger
leap by holding down the
ﬁre button. The screens
also contain a very useful
but inexplicable network of
springboards that can
hurtle our hero quite
remarkable distances, and
quite often land him by a
damsel in distress. You can
also be sure that there will
be another springboard
strategically placed for the
return journey.
While Stormlord is
running, jumping and
leaping about the land
various nasties are out to
get him. Huge worms want
to nibble him. Dragons
want to fry him, ﬂies want
to swat him and Venus ﬂy
traps want to chomp him.
However, he can hit back
with a self loading, ﬂying
sword, but it's so ineffective
that it's best to get out of
the way.
Hewson - E14.99 Disc,E9.99 tape.
Fairy folk and foul creatures clash in a
game that aims to take your screen by
storm, as the heroic Stormlord rouses
rebellion against a malevolent monarch.
There are also a number
of traps such as boulders
and acid which drop down
from above and doors
which block your path
throughout the game.
Luckily, there are useful
objects scattered around the
landscape, but our brave
and incredibly butch hero
can only carry one at a
time, which I suppose isn't
that surprising when you
consider that a key is
almost as big as the door it
opens! Apart from the keys,
there are other objects
whose function is less
obvious, which can make it
difﬁcult to always carry the
one you need next,
resulting in quite a bit of
backtracking. This can be
reduced by leaving them
near springboards.
The result of all this is a
game that's a cross between
a sideways scrolling shoot-
em-up and a platform
game. Although I doubt
this will appeal to either
game's supporters as it is
Freakout man! Not only is that chick frolicking naked, but
check out the size of these magic mushrooms!

Stormlord was originally
written by Raffealle Cecco
(C64 conversion by Nick
Jones), who also produced
Cybemoid, Cybernoid
and Exolon.

WITH all the sweat and toil
of making it to the top,
Rockstar Ate My Hamster
provides a gritty insight
into the topsy turvy world
of rock 'n' roll
management Through the
eyes of a somewhat slimy
lump of no-talent
arrogance, called Cecil Pitt,
you act as a manager,
ducking and diving and
calling the shots on the
bands's future plans. But
getting to the top is not so
simple.
The ultimate goal of
Rockstar, which has the
intriguing feeling of a board
game, is to go Platinum by
Lopping the charts, the
world and elsewhere. With
your loutish sidekick Clive,
who insists on using groovy
talk, your ﬁrst task is to
choose the band. You are
allowed up to four
members and can select
from a list of about 50 stars
who appear one by one on
a video screen in front of
you. it is probably best to
choose the maximum of
four band members as
somewhere along the road
tantrums creep in and the
odd terrorist attack tends to
deplete the ranks. As for
selecting stars, which are
loaded from a data cassette,
it varies from player to
player depending on who
can handle the big money
stars and bigtime budgets.
Each star bears a
distinct likeness to some of
che'big names in the pop
world - including Bimbo
Baggins (Kylie Mynogue),
Dross (Bros) and many
more. With your band
together it's time to buy the
gear. New equipment costs
money but it's one step to
true professionalism, with
ampliﬁers that go to eleven
for that extra push over the
cliff. However, being one
louder is not to everyone's

taste so there is the option
of second-hand gear, or
even lower to the dodgy
knock-offs.
This is where your
climb to the top or low-life
stroll into the wilderness
begins. To start with, you
have four options; practice,
gig, publicity or gifts. It is
probably advisable to lock
them away for a bit of a
jam, give them some
publicity and then hit the
road. The practice sessions
cost money, so you have to
choose your studio time
wisely. The publicity, which
is dubiously handled by the
sycophant Clive, involves
the aptly named Stun
Newspaper and includes a
subtle reworking of that
infamous headline
concerning a certain Starr
eating a hamster. Publicity
stunts, however, do not
always get covered by the
press, but that's a chance
you have to take.
If you decide to gig you
have to select a venue from
the list of pubs, clubs,
Universities, Concert Halls
and stadiums. For the ﬁrst
time out it is probably best
to play to cheap and easy-
to-ﬁll venues. A decision on
the ticket price has to be
reached and the number of
nights playing. After each
gig Clive informs you of the
number of tickets that were
sold and consequently the
amount of money made. At
the start of the game money
is the key to success

chosen band members with
high salaries, they have to

be paid on a weekly basis.
If gigs are going well
and you have succeeded in
front page gutter news, the
phone will start to ring with
offers of record contracts,
charity gigs and potential
sponsorships. When a
satisfactory record deal is
reached you have the
option of cutting the vinyl
and shooting a promo to
begin your claim on the
record sales market and a
position in the national
charts. The prospect of
shooting a video means
more decisions on
producers, locations and
image details with every
decision being of
paramount importance for
the band's future. With
some suspiciously
recognisable tunes the band
under your guidance will
enter the realm of the
weekly charts and face the
problem of staying at the
top, paying taxes and
sueing bootleggers.

ULTIMA TRILOGY
Origin Systems (Microprose) P C  0E29.95.
C64124.95 disk only.
More than one million global garners
have delved into the Ultima series of role
playing games. Now the ﬁrst three are
available in a special edition.
THE Ultima Trilogy is a
special edition of the
infamous Ultima games in
which you must confront a
Triad of Evil who threatens
the land ruled by Lord
British. Both Ultima I and
III have been available in
the UK before but this is
the debut for Ultima II,
which will provide many
more hours of role playing
whilst ﬁlling some of the
gaps and answering some
questions that were left
open with its omission.
The content of the box
is impressive and
immediately gives the
impression that this is a
game to play. Alongside the
game disks (3 for CM, 4 for
PC) there is a quickstart
guide, a player reference
guide that outlines the
keyboard controls and
available spells, and a
massive 100 page
instruction manual that
covers everything from the
book of the amber runes to
a guide to the monsters and
critters you will face. It also
contains three full colour
maps of the lands you must
save.
In the games you play a
brave adventurer who may
be of human, elf, dwarf or
hobbit stock, and be
trained in the art of a
ﬁghter, cleric, thief or
wizard. Throughout the
games your hero is
controlled through a series
of single key presses that
correspond to commands.
For example, 0 lets you
offer gold as a bribe. U
unlocks doors if you have
the key, and I ignites a
torch. Although you begin
alone with a number of
points to distribute between
your role playing
characteristics, you will
soon ﬁnd others that will
join you in your quest.
Ultima I is the ﬁrst age
of darkness and features a
desperate battle against
hordes of nightmarish
creatures spawned by the
Wizard Mondain_ The
defenceless people of
Sosaria ﬂee in vain to the
ancient strongholds and all
will be lost if a hero is not
found.
The same heroic
abilities will be put to the
test in Ultima II when
Minax, the young
apprentice of Mondain,
seeks to avenge her father's
death. Such is the power of
this Enchantress that her
efforts to ﬁnd her father's
slayer have torn rifts in the
fabric of time. This has
opened doors through
which a brave adventurer
might bring about her
doom.
In Ultima HI the third
part of the Triad of evil is
revealed, as fragments of a
manuscript hint at an
unholy alliance between
Mondain and Minax and
of a demonspawn that their
union had produced. This is
the ultimate test for a hero
as evil openly stalks the
land and your foe is
unknown apart from the
power it possesses.
The games look a little
dated now compared to the
more recent Ultima IV and
V, and other games such as

Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long

TERRAMEX
Grand Slam - £2.99 Tape
High in the icy vastness of space, something
is headed our way. A giant asteroid is on
collision course with Earth and only you
can save the world.
WELL actually the only
person who can save the
world is Professor
Eyestrain, who predicted
the asteroid's coming some
20 years ago. The trouble
was that no-one believed
him, so he went off to a
dark and dingy continent to
sulk.
Taking the part of one
of ﬁve stereotyped
explorers you must search
out the lager of Lamot, and
then search out Professor
Eyestrain so he can build
an asteroid deﬂector.
Although if the world is
saved then Grand Slam will
be able to write more
programs like this.... Hmm,
total destruction might not
be so bad an idea after all.
When Terramex ﬁrst
appeared on the ST and
Amiga it had the feel of an
average 8-bit game, and
now we see it in budget 8-
bit form, which is better
value for money. It doesn't
make the game any more
interesting though.
Having selected your
character and waited for
the rest of the game to load,
you set off into the dark
continent followed by your
invisible bearers, in
undramatic 2-D arcade
adventure style. An
irritating piece of music will
have your teeth grating by
now, so go for the volume
switch whilst concentrating
on the smallish but
colourful characters, and
the generally dull
landscapes.
One of the ﬁrst objects
encountered, and this game
is object intensive, is a
vacuum cleaner, which
endows the power of ﬂight.
Yes, you'll believe a hoover
can ﬂy, but not everywhere.
One of the failings of
Terramex then becomes
obvious, you can hoover
along a certain distance and
suddenly because it would
make the game too easy,
you stop in mid air, unable
to progress further. There
isn't actually anything there
stopping you from going
on, you just can't. One of
the next objects needed is
an umbrella which acts as a
parachute. One good point
is that you can ask your
character for an idea when
faced with a problem. If
you're lucky the right object
will ﬂash up, and then it's
down to you to use it
properly.
Besides the object
manipulation part, there's
also the challenge of having
to leap over snakes,
crevices, and other
obstructions, in an Indy
Jones like manner. Should
all efforts fail, then a quite
humorous sequence follows
whereby the asteroid
ploughs into the Earth. For
sheer awfulness this takes
some beating,
For aﬁcionados of the
arcade adventure, E2.99
represents good value, if
unspectacular
entertainment, but for those
not converted to the cause,
there is nothing here to
convince that an expedition
to ﬁnd Professor Eyestrain
is a better idea than waiting
at a bar for disaster to fall.

THE land has always been
ruled by one of the four
elemental magi. At the time
of the great conclave, the
Fire Wizard happened to be
king, but news soon spread
through the town that he
has been horribly
murdered. The Earth Mage
has ﬂed, the Water Mage
has disappeared and the
Wind Mage has been
grievously wounded.
Rumours of an enormous
magical beast abound as
food supplies start to run
dangerously low. In
desperation, the mayor
sends forth a hero who
promptly disappears. Now,
you have been summoned
to help.
You have the choice to
play one of six characters,
each differing in their
strength, armour and
magical abilities. These
attributes can be altered
temporarily with the help of
magic or permanently by
ﬁnding relics - something
that you will have to do if
you are to get very far in
the game.
Fire King follows the
usual role playing ideas in
so much as you have to.
wander round ﬁghting
monsters and ﬁnding key
objects. There are books
scattered around containing
clues, although some
information, especially in
the Thieves Guild, has to Ix'
paid for.
The key to the game lies
in manipulating the objects
that you ﬁnd and/or
purchase. You have seven
pockets each of which can
contain up to nine similar
objects, eg. keys, death
spells, etc. The problem is
that there are usually more
than seven types of objects
to carry, so you will need tc,

there is food to buy which
will help to top up any
energy lost in battle,

Graphically, the game
looks and plays a lot like
Gauntlet with the top down
view and monster
producing vortexes. On top
of that, there is more of a
feeling of adventure to the
game rather than just one
large shoot-em-up.
The problem with Fire
King is the manipulation of
objects. The pocket system
is very cumbersome to use,
especially in a 'real time'
situation. The monsters are
everywhere and I suspect
that fans of role playing
games will ﬁnd this too
much of an arcade game for
their liking. I must confess
that knowing their previous
track record, I expected
something a bit more
cerebral from this
company.

oping extended Basic routines, we
have already dealt, several times,
with the way Basic stores its variables.
Therefore, the next logical step is to
write a  routine which gives us a
printout of the variables created by a
Basic program and what they contain
at any given time.
This is a very easy thing to do,
because all that's required is that we
loop through the Basic variable areas
and print each variable name and
content.
I wanted to  make this facility
possible as a direct command and in
connection with the trace facility which
we developed in the last article. I am
including this in this instalment for all
you people who didn't buy last month's

you!).
As a direct command, you simply

enter VARS, and all variables of the
Basic program which you have just run
are printed out. O f  course, i f  you
haven't run a Basic program or have
given the direct CLR command, which
clears all Basic variables, nothing will
be printed out. The same is true if you
have changed the Basic textﬁle. As you
know, the moment you enter a Basic
line by pressing return all variables are
discarded.
In connection with the trace facility
which we developed last month, you
can call a printout of all variables after
each line has been executed and the
trace routine has reprinted the line at
the top o f  the screen. You will
remember, that after each tracing step,
the computer waits until you press any
key. To get a printout of the variables
simply press 'V'. If you want program
execution to continue press any other
key.

How Basic Stores Its
Variables
Before we look closer at the program
itself, let's brieﬂy recapture how Basic
stores its variables.
All Basic variables are stored
directly after the end o f  the Basic
textﬁle. To ﬁnd the start of the variable
area you have to peek the zero page
variable decimal 45/ 46, Hex 2 D
Each variable takes up seven bytes of
memory.
The ﬁrst two bytes contain the
variable name. The way the variable
name is entered shows what type of
variable we are dealing with:
A ﬂoating point variable has both
bytes o f its name entered in simple
ASCII. If the name consists of only
one letter, the second byte contains
zero.
An integer variable has 128 added

to both its name characters, and i f
there is only one character (which, as
you remember, always has to be a
letter!), the second byte contains 128.
(All this means, that in each case, bit
seven of the eight binary bits is set.)
A string variable is distinguished
by having the letter of its name entered
in simple ASCII, while the second
character has 128 added to the ASCII
value, or 128, i f there isn't a second
character.
Finally, a function deﬁnition has
128 added to the ﬁrst letter of its name,
while the second character is simple
ASCII or zero, (Incidentally, in the
program given I have ignored function
deﬁnitions. As always, this is partly
due to my laziness and partly in order
to encourage you to add this to the
routine yourself...)
, The ﬁnal ﬁve bytes of each variable
contain the contents of the variable
itself. This is easiest in the case of the
string variable: Here, the third byte
contains the length of the string and
the fourth and the ﬁfth byte contain
the base address of the string in the
Basic textﬁle.
This is quite a clever way of going
about things. Instead o f storing the
string itself in the variable area, which
would o f course take up oodles o f
memory and make the whole variable
area pretty difﬁcult to  manage, a
pointer address which takes up only
two bytes is stored in the variable area.
The disadvantage with this method is
of course, that the Basic textﬁle must
not be changed. The moment i t is
changed, the pointer to a certain string
in the variable area might not be
correct any more. This is one of the
reasons why you can't continue run-
ning a Basic program after you have
changed the textﬁle.
The storage of an integer variable
is also pretty straightforward. The
value of the variable is stored in the
third and fourth byte after the name,
whereby the third byte contains the
high byte o f the value, plus the so
called sign bit, and fourth byte con-
tains the low byte. You assign an
integer variable by entering '%' after
it, e.g. X%.
An integer ranges from -32768 to
+32767. If you add those two numbers
up you get 65535, which is 65536 short
of one, because the zero is included
as a valid number. And 65536 is the
PROGRAMMING
maximum range of a I6-bit address.
If bit seven, or the sign bit, of the high
byte is set, the number is considered
to be negative, if it is clear, the number
is considered to  be positive. Fo r
example, high 0 and low 100 represent
+WO, while high 255 and low 156
represent -100.
The most complicated variables of
all are the ﬂoating point variables. This
is a pretty long subject which I do not
want to enter at this point. There is
also n o  need to , because i n  o u r
program we are using ROM-routines
to convert the ﬂoating point number
as it is stored in the variable area into
an ASCII string which we then simply
print out.
But, f o r  th e  mathematician
amongst you, here is how a ﬂoating
point number is stored in the Basic
variable area: The byte after the
variable name contains the exponent,
the byte after that contains the ﬁrst
mantissa, plus the sign bit, and the ﬁnal
three bytes contain mantissa two to
four.
Printing the Variables
The routine which prints each variable
name and the contents of the variable,
is so straightforward, that it needs very
little explanation.
The main loop, which I call \JARS-
LOOP, ﬁrst of all prints the variable
name and decides at the same time
what type of variable has to be dealt
with (lines 4180-4310). According to
those tests the program ﬂow then
jumps to  the appropriate routine:
FLPOINT, i f it is a  ﬂoating point
variable, INTEGER, if it is an integer
variable, and STRING, if it is a string
variable.
Before the value of each type of
variable is printed, some spaces and
an equal sign are printed, as well as
the 
i
n
 case of a string, and
the '%'-sign, in case of an integer. This
makes the printout more presentable.
In the case o f a ﬂoating point
variable, A is pointed at the low byte
of the ﬁrst byte of the ﬂoating point
value and Y is pointed at the high byte
(lines 4470-4540).
Then the ROM-routine at $13BA2
is called to put the value into the ﬁrst
of the two ﬂoating point accumulators.
Next, t h e  ROM-routine a t
SBDDD converts the contents of the
YOUR COMMODORE september 1989
77
ﬂoating point accumulator into a
printable ASCII string. On exit from
that routine, A and Y point to the base
of that string.
Finally, the string is printed in the
usual fashion, with SABI E, which
prints any string point at by A/ Y and
terminated with a zero.
An integer variable is printed by
loading its high byte into A  and its
low byte into X. The ROM-routine at
$13DCD, which prints any number
contained in A/ X, prints the integer
value out.
To print a string variable, we ﬁrst
get the length of the string and store
it in 255 (line 5450-5470). Then we
transfer the address which points at
the string in the textﬁle into zero page
253/ 254 (lines 5510-5560),
Finally, we use indirect-Y to print
the string, letter by letter. This is done
with a loop which is limited by the
length value contained in 255 (lines
5600-5650).
After a  variable has been dealt
with, VARSLOOP ends by increment-
ing the pointer address by seven (lines
4770-4830). The vital loop exit test,
which tells when there are no more
variables, is done at the beginning of
VARSLOOP (lines 4070-4120). This
is because the routine has to exit at
once if there are no variables at all!
The end of the Basic variables area
is contained in zero page $2F/ 30. If
this point is reached, there are no more
variables. What follows are the Basic
arrays with which we are not dealing
at this point.
Final Notes
As I  was developing the variables
printout routine I  discovered to my
great puzzlement that certain variable
names did not work properly. For
example 'CC' was stored as 'C' and
'Cl' didn't work at all and resulted in
a syntax error report.
Then I discovered the reason for
those irregularities: The extended
Basic commands we use starts with a
letter, that is a normal ASCII char-
acter. I f  you declare a  variable by
omitting the LET command (as one
usually does), then the variable name
too starts with a letter!
To overcome this I  changed the
main routine in the following way:
First, I added two lines, which test for

a stolen character (lines 550-560). I f
a token has been found, which means
that the line starts with a  Basic
command, the routine jumps straight
to $A7ED which evaluates the Basic
command in the usual manner.
Next, before starting the tests for
our extended Basic commands, I save
the Basic pointer S7A/7B (lines 600-
630). If the tests are negative, that is,
if none of our extended Basic com-
mands has been entered, $7A/7B is
recovered (lines 1070-1100). This resets
the pointer to the ﬁrst character on
the line, resulting in a variable name
being read correctly.

The Lines are Engaged...
A Reading resident has been having
a rather harassing time of late due to
an Amstrad magazine who misprinted
the Activision hotline number. The
person in question was receiving calls
all around the clock from people
requesting hints and tips on Activision
games -  causing some distress. The
correct number is (0734) 310003,
Speaking of telephone lines, those
kind peeps at British Telecom have
changed Incentive's number. The new
number and code is, i f you're at all
interested, (0734) 817288,

Just When You...
...Thought you could get your hands
on Mars Cops, the game has been
delayed, yet again.
Due originally for release almost
a year ago, the game was nearing
completion when the ﬁckle ﬁnger of
fate struck Arcana Software Limited.
The programmer, who had worked to
getting the game two weeks from being
ready, has walked out on the company.
This means a new programmer will
have to ﬁnish the project and thus we
shall not see Mars Cops until the
beginning of September.
