About the Author
David Byrnes is one of those grizzled old-timers you’ll fi nd mentioned every 
so often in AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies. He began his drafting career on the 
boards in 1979, and fi rst learned AutoCAD with version 1.4. Dave is based in 
Vancouver, British Columbia, where he works as a civil/structural drafter. He 
taught AutoCAD for fi fteen years at Emily Carr University of Art + Design and 
British Columbia Institute of Technology in Vancouver. Dave has authored 
or co-authored over a dozen AutoCAD books and has been the sole author of 
this title since AutoCAD 2008 For Dummies.
Dedication
I left the bohemian lifestyle of the AutoCAD consultant at the beginning of 
2008 and rejoined the engineering company I last worked for in 1988 (luckily 
they’d forgotten all about that chandelier). Working full-time (oh! the horror!) 
and keeping up with AutoCAD so I can revise this book has made me some-
what inaccessible for 3 months a year, and I’m forever grateful to Annie and 
Delia, still and always the two women in my life, who remind me there are 
other things besides keyboards and mice (and sometimes they have to try 
really hard).
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks, fi rst of all, to former author Mark Middlebrook for bringing me into 
the AutoCAD For Dummies world. Mark asked me to tech edit AutoCAD 2000 
For Dummies, then to join him as co-author of AutoCAD 2006 For Dummies, 
and fi nally to take over the title altogether. I hope my torch bearing comes 
close to the high standards that Mark set, and I wish him well in his new 
career in the world of fi ne wine (what, me jealous?).
Thanks, too, to colleagues and friends at Autodesk: above all Guillermo 
Melantoni, Heidi Hewett, and Bud Schroeder, who never seem to mind being 
asked even the dumbest questions. And speaking of colleagues, thanks to my 
cubicle-mates at Sandwell for showing me how things are done in the real 
world of engineering.
At Wiley, Acquisitions Editor Kyle Looper was a reliable source of calm 
but fi rm direction. It was a great pleasure to work with project editor Blair 
Pottenger again, and copy editor Laura Miller made so many great sugges-
tions she ought to get an author credit. And thanks, fi nally, to Lee Ambrosius 
who not only did his usual sterling job of tech editing, but contributed the 
three chapters on 3D in Part V of this book.

Foreword
I
f you are completely new to AutoCAD or just feeling a little 
rusty, this book will help start the wheels turning and keep 
you rolling in the right direction. Tidbits of historical insight and 
explanations help you understand not only “how” to perform 
a task, but “why.” David’s friendly and humorous writing style 
makes the book easy (and even entertaining) to read. The topics 
are well organized, enabling you to read it cover to cover or use 
it as a handy reference tool. It includes a comprehensive Table of 
Contents and Index to help you quickly locate key topics. Icons 
scattered throughout the book further aid in your quest for 
knowledge by identifying important or useful information such as 
warnings or new functionality. 
David’s experience as a technical writer and AutoCAD user and 
educator is unmistakable in AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies. He 
doesn’t just describe AutoCAD tools — he describes the processes 
in which you can use them most-efficiently. David does a fantastic 
job of integrating powerful AutoCAD functionality such as named 
page setups, annotation scaling, and parametric constraints into 
the standard workflow for “beginning” AutoCAD users. Even 
veteran AutoCAD users can learn from AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies 
with a willingness to explore newer methods they may have 
previously overlooked.
David, thanks for providing a valuable resource to help AutoCAD 
users maximize their software investment with minimal brain 
drain. While AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies isn’t really “For Dummies,” 
it is a welcome relief to the typical software technology books.

Introduction
I
t’s amazing to think that AutoCAD came into being more than a quarter of a 
century ago, at a time when most people thought that personal computers 
weren’t capable of industrial-strength tasks like CAD. (The acronym stands for 
Computer-Aided Drafting, Computer-Aided Design, or both, depending on whom 
you talk to.) What’s equally amazing to the grizzled old-timer writing these words 
is the fact that many of today’s hotshot AutoCAD users weren’t even born when 
the program first hit the street! It’s almost as amazing that, 25 years and counting 
after its birth, AutoCAD remains the king of the microcomputer CAD hill by a tall 
margin, making it one of the longest-lived PC programs ever. It’s conceivable that 
the long-term future of CAD may belong to special-purpose, 3D-based software 
such as the Autodesk Inventor and Revit programs, but for the present and the 
near future anyway, AutoCAD is where the CAD action is.
AutoCAD has grown more complex over the years, in part to keep up with the 
increasing complexity of the design and drafting processes that AutoCAD is 
intended to serve. It’s not enough just to draw nice-looking lines anymore. If 
you want to play CAD with the big boys and girls, you need to carefully orga-
nize the objects you draw, their properties, and the files in which they reside. 
You need to coordinate your CAD work with other people in your office who 
will be working on or making use of the same drawings. You need to be savvy 
about shipping drawings around via the Internet. You may even need to be a 
little cognizant of working with AutoCAD in three dimensions.
AutoCAD 2011 provides the tools for doing all these things, but it’s not 
always easy to figure out which hammer to pick up or which nail to bang on 
first. With this book, you have an excellent chance of creating a presentable, 
usable, printable, and sharable drawing on your first or second try without 
putting a T-square through your computer screen in frustration.
What’s Not (And What Is) in This Book
Unlike many other For Dummies books, this one does sometimes tell you to 
consult the official software documentation — such as it is. AutoCAD is just too 
big and complicated for a single book to attempt to describe it completely.
AutoCAD is also too big and complicated for a book like this to cover every 
feature. I don’t address advanced topics like database connectivity, custom-
ization, or programming, in the interest of bringing you a book of a reason-
able size — one that you’ll read rather than stick on your shelf with those 
other thousand-page tomes!

2
AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies 
Autodesk likes to keep its users (and us authors!) guessing about new fea-
tures in future releases of the software. AutoCAD 2009 surprised users and 
authors alike with a totally revamped user interface, replacing the drop-down 
menus and toolbars of previous versions with a Microsoft Office 2007–style 
Ribbon (happily, Autodesk doesn’t force its users to adopt the new look like 
Microsoft does — there’s still an “AutoCAD Classic” interface available). The 
new interface got some tweaking in AutoCAD 2010 — 2009’s Menu Browser, 
which essentially duplicated the pull-down menu structure, was replaced 
with a better thought-out Application Menu.
AutoCAD 2010 also delivered two significant new features — parametric 
drawing and organic (or free-form) 3D modeling. The changes in AutoCAD 
2011 are relatively minor compared with those: AutoCAD added inferred 
constraints to its parametric toolbox, and 3D benefitted from the addition of 
a major suite of surface modeling tools. But while the program may not have 
changed that much from the last release, the book you hold in your hands 
has changed. For years now I’ve been bemoaning the fact that lack of space 
prevented virtually any coverage of 3D modeling. I guess the editors at Wiley 
got tired of my whining, so AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies proudly presents 
three new chapters on 3D modeling and visualization, written by 3D expert 
(and AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies technical editor!) Lee Ambrosius.
This book focuses on AutoCAD 2011 and addresses its slightly less-capable 
but much lower-priced sibling, AutoCAD LT 2011. I do occasionally mention 
differences with previous versions so that everyone has some context and 
upgraders can more readily understand the differences. I also mention the 
important differences between full AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT so that you’ll 
know what you — or your LT-using colleagues — are missing this book is 
concerned, the major difference is the almost total absence of 3D capabilities 
in AutoCAD LT. This book does not cover the discipline-specific features in 
AutoCAD-based products such as AutoCAD Architecture 2011 or AutoCAD 
Mechanical 2011, except for some general discussion in Chapter 1, but most 
of the information in this book applies to the general-purpose AutoCAD fea-
tures in the AutoCAD 2011–based versions of those programs as well.
Who Do I Think You Are?
AutoCAD has a large, loyal, dedicated group of long-time users. This book is 
not for the sort of people who have been using AutoCAD for a decade or more, 
who plan their vacation time around Autodesk University, or who consider 
1,000-page-plus technical tomes about AutoCAD to be pleasure reading. This 
book is for people who want to get going quickly with AutoCAD but who also 
know the importance of developing proper CAD techniques from the beginning.

3
 Introduction
However, you do need to have some idea of how to use your computer 
system before tackling AutoCAD — and this book. You need to have a com-
puter system with AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT (preferably the 2011 version). A 
printer or plotter and a connection to the Internet will be big helps, too.
You also need to know how to use your version of Windows to copy and 
delete files, create a folder, and find a file. You need to know how to use a 
mouse to select (highlight) or to choose (activate) commands, how to close 
a window, and how to minimize and maximize windows. Make sure that 
you’re familiar with the basics of your operating system before you start with 
AutoCAD.
How This Book Is Organized
Appearances can be deceptive. For example, had you wandered into my 
office and seen the apparently random piles of stuff that covered my desk 
while I was writing this book, you might wonder how I could possibly orga-
nize a sentence, let alone an entire book. But, given a suitable degree of 
concerted thought, I know exactly where to put my hands on that list of new 
dimension variables, my bag of 1/2" binder clips, or the rest of that bagel and 
cream cheese I started at coffee break.
I hope you’ll find that the book also reflects some concerted thought about 
how to present AutoCAD in a way that’s both easy-to-dip-into and smoothly-
flowing-from-beginning-to-end.
The organization of this book into parts — collections of related chapters — is 
one of the most important, uh, parts of this book. You really can get to know 
AutoCAD one piece at a time, and each part represents a group of closely 
related topics. The order of parts also says something about priority; yes, you 
have my permission to ignore the stuff in later parts until you’ve mastered 
most of the stuff in the early ones. This kind of building-block approach can be 
especially valuable in a program as complex as AutoCAD.
The following sections describe the parts that the book breaks down into.
Part I: AutoCAD 101
Need to know your way around the AutoCAD screen? Why does AutoCAD 
even exist, anyway? What are all the different AutoCAD-based products that 
Autodesk sells, and should you be using one of them — for example, AutoCAD 
LT — instead of AutoCAD? Is everything so slooow because it’s supposed to be 

4
AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies 
slow, or do you have too wimpy a machine to use this wonder of modern-day 
computing? And why do you have to do this stuff in the first place?
Part I answers all these questions and more. This part also includes what 
may seem like a great deal of excruciating detail about setting up a new draw-
ing in AutoCAD. But what’s even more excruciating is doing your setup work 
incorrectly and then feeling as if AutoCAD is fighting you every step of the 
way. With a little drawing setup work done in advance, it won’t.
Part II: Let There Be Lines
In this part, you discover some essential concepts, including object proper-
ties and CAD precision techniques. I know that you’re raring to make some 
drawings, but if you don’t get a handle on this stuff early on, you’ll be termi-
nally confused when you try to draw and edit objects. If you want to make 
drawings that look good, plot good, and are good, read this stuff!
After the concepts preamble, the bulk of this part covers the trio of activi-
ties that you’ll probably spend most of your time in AutoCAD doing: drawing 
objects, editing them, and zooming and panning to see them better on the 
screen. These are the things that you do in order to create the geometry — 
that is, the CAD representations of the objects in the real world that you’re 
designing. By the end of Part II, you should be pretty good at geometry, even 
if your ninth-grade math teacher told you otherwise.
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk
CAD drawings don’t live on lines alone — most of them require quite a bit of 
text, dimensioning, and hatching in order to make the design intent clear to 
the poor chump who has to build your amazing creation. (Whoever said “a 
picture is worth a thousand words” must not have counted up the number 
of words on the average architectural drawing!) This part shows you how to 
add these essential features to your drawings.
After you’ve gussied up your drawing with text, dimensions, and hatching, 
you’ll probably want to create a snapshot of it to show off to your client, con-
tractor, or grandma. Normal people call this process printing, but CAD people 
call it plotting. Whatever you decide to call it, I show you how to do it.
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD
A good CAD user, like a good kindergartner, plays well with others. AutoCAD 
encourages this behavior with a host of drawing- and data-sharing features. 
Blocks, external reference files, and raster images encourage reuse of parts 

5
 Introduction
of drawings, entire drawings, and bitmap image files. You can create symbols 
with changeable text or appearance, and you can apply parametric “rules” 
to drawing objects so they help maintain design intent. This part of the book 
ends by explaining how to use AutoCAD’s Internet features to enable sharing 
of drawings well beyond your hard disk and local network.
The drawing- and data-sharing features in AutoCAD take you way beyond old-
style, pencil-and-paper design and drafting. After you’ve discovered how to 
apply the techniques in this part, you’ll be well on your way to full CAD nerd-
hood. (You may want to warn your family beforehand.)
Part V: On a 3D Spree
In this part, you discover the basics of 3D modeling in AutoCAD 2011. 
Beginning with the 3D environment — how to change its appearance, how 
to move around in it, how to examine the model itself in different ways — 
the chapters introduce different modeling techniques, from solid models, 
through to the latest surface modeling commands included with AutoCAD 
2011. 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part contains a concise catalog of differences between AutoCAD and 
AutoCAD LT, and lists of resources and settings that can make the time you 
spend in AutoCADland more enjoyable. There’s a lot of meat packed into 
these three chapters — juicy tidbits from years of drafting, experimentation, 
and fist-shaking at things that don’t work right — not to mention years of 
compulsive list-making. I hope that these lists help you get on the right track 
quickly and stay there.
But wait . . . there’s more!
AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies now has a companion Web site. Point your browser 
at www.dummies.com/go/autocad2011 to find many of the drawing files I 
use to demonstrate commands and procedures in this book. The drawings are 
posted to the Web site in zip format; just download and unzip them and they’re 
ready to open in AutoCAD. The zip files are named for the chapters and contain 
one or more drawing files. For example, afd03.zip contains the versions of 
the drawing for the base plate exercise in Chapter 3 of the book (refer to the 
downloadable Read Me file for an explanation of the naming conventions used 
for the drawing files). Note that not all chapters have associated drawing files.
The drawing files are saved in AutoCAD 2010 format and can be opened in 
AutoCAD 2010 or 2011 (and, of course, AutoCAD LT 2010 or 2011). If you’re

AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies 
using this book with an earlier release, you can download Autodesk’s DWG 
TrueView, a free viewing and conversion utility from www.autodesk.com/
trueview.
If you don’t have any AutoCAD release and just want to get a taste of the 
program before you buy, you can also download a free 30-day trial version of 
either AutoCAD 2011 or AutoCAD LT 2011. Just browse to www.autodesk.
com/autocad or www.autodesk.com/autocadlt.
You can also find the cheat sheet that’s mentioned several times in the book 
at www.dummies.com/gp/cheatsheet/autocad2011. 
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I point out certain morsels of particularly important or 
useful information by placing handy little icons in the margin. Naturally, dif-
ferent icons indicate different types of information:
 
This icon tells you that herein lies a pointed insight that can save you time 
and trouble as you use AutoCAD. In many cases, Tip paragraphs act as a 
funnel on AutoCAD’s impressive but sometimes overwhelming flexibility: After 
telling you all the ways that you can do something, I tell you the way that you 
should do it in most cases.
 
The Technical Stuff icon points out places where I delve a little more deeply 
into AutoCAD’s inner workings or point out something that most people don’t 
need to know most of the time. These paragraphs definitely are not required 
reading the first time through, so if you come to one of them at a time when 
you’ve reached your techie detail threshold, feel free to skip over it.
 
This icon points out text that tells you how to stay out of trouble when living 
close to the edge. Failure to heed its message may have unpleasant conse-
quences for you or your drawing — or both.
 
There’s a lot to remember when you’re using AutoCAD, so I’ve remembered to 
remind you not to forget about some of those things that you should remem-
ber. These paragraphs usually refer to a crucial point earlier in the chapter 
or in a previous chapter. So if you’re reading sequentially, a Remember para-
graph serves as a friendly reminder. If you’re not reading sequentially, this 
kind of paragraph may help you realize that you need to review a central con-
cept or technique before proceeding.
 
This icon points to new stuff in AutoCAD 2011 (and sometimes AutoCAD LT 
2011). It’s mostly designed for people who are somewhat familiar with a previ-
ous version of AutoCAD and want to be alerted to what’s new in this release. 
New AutoCAD users starting out their CAD working lives with AutoCAD 2011 

7
 Introduction
will find this stuff interesting, too — especially when they can show off their 
new book learnin’ to the grizzled AutoCAD veterans in the office who don’t yet 
know about all the cool, new features.
 
This icon highlights text that shows the differences between AutoCAD LT and 
AutoCAD. If you’re using AutoCAD LT, you’ll find out what you’re missing com-
pared to “full” AutoCAD. If your friend is using LT, you’ll know where to look 
to find stuff in AutoCAD to brag about.
A Few Conventions — Just in Case
You can probably figure out for yourself all the information in this section, 
but here are the details just in case.
Commanding from the keyboard
Text you type into the program at the command line, in a dialog box, in a 
text box, and so on appears in boldface type. Examples of AutoCAD prompts 
appear in a special typeface, as does any other text in the book that 
echoes a message, a word, or one or more lines of text that actually appear 
on-screen. Sequences of prompts that appear in the AutoCAD command line 
area have a shaded background, like so:
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:
Many of the figures — especially in Chapters 8 through 11 — also show 
AutoCAD command line sequences that demonstrate AutoCAD’s prompts and 
example responses.
Many AutoCAD commands have aliases — shortcut (fewer-letter) versions 
for the benefit of those who like to type commands at the AutoCAD command 
line. In this book, I show command names in uppercase letters. Chapters 
throughout the book include tables listing, respectively, the most commonly 
used drawing and editing commands, and in these tables I list both the full 
command name and its alias in parentheses; for example, LINE (L), ARRAY 
(AR), and so forth. If you’re using the keyboard to enter commands, this 
means you can type either LINE or simply L and then press the Enter key 
to execute the command. You can view a list of all the command aliases by 
typing ALIASEDIT (not in AutoCAD LT) — but just look, and be careful not to 
change anything!

AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies 
Tying things up with the Ribbon
As you’ve noticed if you’ve skimmed through the book and looked at a few 
of the figures, AutoCAD 2011 doesn’t look like earlier releases you may be 
familiar with. Throughout the book, I tell you where to find commands on the 
new Office 2007–style Application Menu and Ribbon interface. (The Ribbon 
is organized into a series of task-based tabs, and each tab has a number of 
panels containing specific tool buttons.)
Where to Go from Here
If you read this Introduction, you’re like me — you like to read. (The cut-to-
the-chase people tend to flip to the index right away and look up what they 
need to know at that instant.) If you’re a total AutoCAD newbie, you can read 
this book in order, from front to back; it follows a straightforward route from 
setting up your drawing environment, to outputting your masterworks to 
hard copy, to sharing your work with others. If you’re an experienced user, 
you’ll probably be one of those index flippers looking for the missing infor-
mation you need to complete a specific task. You can probably find the index 
on your own, but I encourage you to browse through the book anyway, with 
highlighter or sticky notes in hand, so you can find those particularly impor-
tant places when you need them again. If you’re competent in most areas of 
AutoCAD and pretty familiar with the previous version, look for the New In 
2011 icons in the margins to find out the latest features you never knew you 
couldn’t live without. Whichever route you choose, I hope you enjoy your 
time with AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies. And . . . you’re off!

A
utoCAD 2011 is more than just another drawing 
program; it’s a complete environment for drafting 
and design. So if you’re new to AutoCAD, you need to 
know several things to get off to a good start — especially 
how to use the command line area and how to set up your 
drawing properly. These key techniques are described in 
this part of the book.
If you’ve used earlier versions of AutoCAD, you’ll be most 
interested in the high points of the new release, including 
some newer interface components. The lowdown on 
what’s new is here, too.

M
aybe you’re one of the few remaining holdouts who continue to prac-
tice the ancient art of manual drafting with pencil and vellum. If so, 
I must tell you, you’re a dwindling breed. Or maybe you’re completely new 
to drafting and yearn for the wealth and fame (would I lead you on?) of the 
drafter’s life. Maybe you’re an engineer or architect who needs to catch up 
with the young CAD hotshots in your office. Maybe you tried to use AutoCAD 
a long time ago, but gave up in frustration or just got rusty. Or maybe you 
currently use an older release, such as AutoCAD 2006 or even (if you’re into 
antiques) AutoCAD 2000.
Whatever your current situation or motivation, I hope that you enjoy the 
process of becoming proficient with AutoCAD. Drawing with AutoCAD is chal-
lenging at first, but it’s a challenge worth meeting. AutoCAD rewards those 
who think creatively about their work and look for ways to do it better. You 
can always find out more, discover a new trick, or improve the efficiency and 
quality of your drawing production.
AutoCAD first hit the bricks in the early 1980s, around the same time as the 
first IBM PCs. It was offered for a bewildering variety of operating systems, 
including CP/M (ask your granddad about that one!), various flavors of UNIX, 
and even Apple’s Macintosh. By far the most popular of those early versions 
was for MS-DOS (your dad can tell you about that one). Eventually, Autodesk 
settled on Microsoft Windows as the sole operating system for AutoCAD. 

12
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
AutoCAD 2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011 are supported in the following Windows 
flavors, including both 32- and 64-bit versions:
 ✓ 
Windows 7 and Windows Vista Home Premium
 ✓ 
Windows 7 Professional
 ✓ 
Windows 7 and Windows Vista Enterprise
 ✓ 
Windows 7 and Windows Vista Ultimate
 ✓ 
Windows Vista Business
 ✓ 
Windows XP Professional
 ✓ 
Windows XP Home (32-bit only)
Although it’s not officially supported, it can also run in Windows XP Tablet 
2005 Edition and make use of the tablet functionality included in Windows 
Vista and Windows 7. Trying to do production drafting on a tablet isn’t a 
great idea due to limitations in the graphics system, but I know it works, 
because I’m running it that way myself!
Because of AutoCAD’s MS-DOS heritage and its emphasis on efficiency for 
production drafters, it’s not the easiest program to master, but it has gotten 
easier and more consistent over the past decade or so. AutoCAD is pretty 
well integrated into the Windows environment now, but you still bump into 
some vestiges of its MS-DOS legacy — especially the command line (that 
text area lurking at the bottom of the AutoCAD screen — see Chapter 2 for 
details). But even the command line — oops! command window — is kinder 
and gentler in AutoCAD 2011. This book guides you around the bumps and 
minimizes the bruises.
Why AutoCAD?
AutoCAD has been around a long time — since 1982, which I suspect, dear 
readers, is longer than some of you! AutoCAD ushered in the transition from 
really expensive mainframe and minicomputer CAD systems costing tens of 
thousands of dollars to merely somewhat expensive microcomputer CAD pro-
grams costing a few thousand dollars.
AutoCAD’s 3D abilities have grown by leaps and bounds over the last several 
releases, and 3D modeling is becoming a common way of checking designs 
before they’re drafted. Nevertheless, AutoCAD is, first and foremost, a pro-
gram for creating two-dimensional technical drawings: drawings in which 
measurements and precision are important because these kinds of drawings 

13
 Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
often get used to build something. The drawings you create with AutoCAD 
must adhere to standards established long ago for hand-drafted drawings. 
The up-front investment to use AutoCAD is certainly more expensive than the 
investment needed to use pencil and paper, and the learning curve is much 
steeper, too. So why bother? The key reasons for using AutoCAD rather than 
pencil and paper are
 ✓ 
Precision: Creating lines, circles, and other shapes of the exact dimen-
sions is easier with AutoCAD than with pencils.
 ✓ 
Modifiability: Drawings are much easier to modify on the computer 
screen than on paper. CAD modifications are a lot cleaner, too.
 ✓ 
Efficiency: Creating many kinds of drawings is faster with a CAD pro-
gram — especially drawings that involve repetition, such as floor plans 
in a multistory building. But that efficiency takes skill and practice. If 
you’re an accomplished pencil-and-paper drafter, don’t expect CAD to 
be faster at first!
Figure 1-1 shows several kinds of drawings in AutoCAD 2011.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Why choose AutoCAD? AutoCAD is just the starting point of a whole industry 
of software products designed to work with AutoCAD. Autodesk has helped 
this process along immensely by designing a series of programming interfaces 
to AutoCAD (but not, alas, to AutoCAD LT — see the “Seeing the LT” section 
later in the chapter) that other companies — and Autodesk itself — have used 
to extend the application. Some of the add-on products have become such 
winners that Autodesk acquired them and incorporated them into its own 
products. When you compare all the resources — including the add-ons, exten-
sions, training courses, books, and so on — AutoCAD doesn’t have much PC 
CAD competition.
The Importance of Being DWG
To take full advantage of AutoCAD in your work environment, you need to be 
aware of the DWG file format, the format in which AutoCAD saves drawings. 
Here are some DWG facts to keep in mind:
 ✓ 
In some cases, an older release of AutoCAD can’t open a DWG file that’s 
been saved by a newer AutoCAD release.
 ✓ 
A newer release of AutoCAD can always open files saved by older 
versions.
 ✓ 
Some previous AutoCAD releases can open files saved by the subse-
quent one or two versions. For example, AutoCAD 2007 and AutoCAD 
2008 can open DWG files saved by AutoCAD 2009. That’s because 
Autodesk didn’t change the DWG file format between those releases. 
However, the drawing file format did change with AutoCAD 2010, so 
drawings created in the current release must be saved in an older 
format to be openable in AutoCAD 2009 and earlier.
 ✓ 
You can use the Save As option in newer releases to save the file to 
some older DWG formats. In fact, AutoCAD 2011 can save as far back as 
AutoCAD Release 14, which dates all the way back to 1997!
Table 1-1 shows which versions (described later in this chapter) use which 
DWG file formats.

The new file format in AutoCAD 2010 was necessary to handle new features — 
especially parametric drafting. The new format is also more efficient at saving 
files and can handle much larger objects. Best of all from the user’s perspec-
tive, it’s noticeably faster to work with than AutoCAD 2009.
Working with AutoCAD is easier when your coworkers and colleagues in 
other companies all use the same release of AutoCAD and AutoCAD-related 
tools. That way, your DWG files, add-on tools, and even the details of your 
CAD knowledge can be mixed and matched among your workgroup and part-
ners. In the real world, you may work with people, probably from other com-
panies, who use AutoCAD releases as old as AutoCAD 2006 — or even older.
 
Many programs claim to be DWG compatible — that is, capable of converting 
data to and from AutoCAD’s DWG format. But achieving this compatibility is a 
difficult thing to do well. Even a small error in file conversion can have results 
ranging in severity from annoying to appalling. Every time you open a drawing 
file, AutoCAD checks its parentage and warns you if the drawing was created 
by a non-Autodesk program. If you exchange DWG files with people who use 
other CAD programs, you may have to spend time finding and fixing transla-
tion problems.
Seeing the LT
AutoCAD LT is one of the best deals around, a shining example of the old 80/20 
rule: roughly 80 percent of the capabilities of AutoCAD for roughly 20 percent 
of the money. (Actually, with recent price creep, it’s now more like a 70/30 
rule!) Like AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT runs on mainstream Windows computers 

16
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
and doesn’t require any additional hardware devices. With AutoCAD LT, you 
can be a player in the world of AutoCAD, the world’s leading CAD program, for 
a comparatively low starting cost.
AutoCAD LT is a very close cousin to AutoCAD. Autodesk creates AutoCAD 
LT by starting with the AutoCAD program, taking out a few features to jus-
tify charging a lower price, and adding a couple of features to enhance ease 
of use versus full AutoCAD. As a result, AutoCAD LT looks and works much 
like AutoCAD. The drawing areas, Ribbons, and Application Menu of the two 
programs are nearly identical. (LT is missing a few Ribbon tabs, panels, and 
commands.)
In fact, the major difference between the programs has nothing to do with the 
programs themselves. The major difference is that AutoCAD LT lacks sup-
port for several customization and programming languages that are used to 
develop AutoCAD add-ons. So almost none of the add-on programs or utilities 
offered by Autodesk and others are available to LT users.
AutoCAD LT also has only limited 3D support. You can view and edit 3D 
objects in AutoCAD LT, so you can work with drawings created in AutoCAD 
that contain 3D objects. However, you can’t create true 3D objects in LT.
Although you may hear claims that AutoCAD LT is easier to master and 
use than AutoCAD, the truth is that they’re about equally difficult (or easy, 
depending on your NQ [nerd quotient]). The LT learning curve doesn’t differ 
significantly from that of AutoCAD. AutoCAD was originally designed for max-
imum power and then modified somewhat to improve ease of use. AutoCAD 
LT shares this same heritage.
Fortunately, the minimal differences between LT and AutoCAD mean that 
after you climb that learning curve, you have the same great view. You have 
almost the full range of the AutoCAD 2D drafting tools, and you can exchange 
DWG files with AutoCAD users without data loss.
 
This book covers AutoCAD 2011, but most of the information in it (except for 
the 3D chapters in Part V) applies to AutoCAD LT 2011, as well. The icon that 
you see to the left of this paragraph highlights significant differences.
Checking System Requirements
If you’re upgrading from AutoCAD 2010 or another recent release, and you 
work mostly or entirely in 2D, you’re probably already current with system 
requirements. In fact, if your work is mostly or entirely 2D — and therefore, 
this applies especially for LT users — AutoCAD 2011 will run fine on pretty 
well any computer that will run Windows 7, Vista, or XP.

17
 Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
AutoCAD’s requirements for running in Windows 7 or Vista are substantially 
higher than for running in XP. This section covers the details.
You should know the following before you upgrade from any older AutoCAD 
release:
 ✓ 
Wash those old Windows: AutoCAD 2011 does not support older ver-
sions of Windows, such as Windows 2000, NT, 98, or Me. For AutoCAD 
2011, you have three choices of operating system:
 
• Windows XP (Home or Professional, SP2 or later)
 
• Windows Vista (Enterprise, Business, Ultimate, or Home Premium, 
SP1 or later)
 
• Windows 7 (Enterprise, Ultimate, Professional, or Home Premium)
 
 If you like to be cutting edge, there are 64-bit versions of AutoCAD 2011 
and AutoCAD LT 2011 that run in the 64-bit versions of XP, Vista, and 
Windows 7.
 ✓ 
DWG file compatibility: AutoCAD’s DWG file format changed with 
AutoCAD 2010. Users of that version can open drawings created 
in AutoCAD 2011, but you have to use the Save As option on the 
Application Menu, or the SAVEAS command, to create DWG files for 
users of AutoCAD 2009 and earlier versions. You can save as far back as 
Release 14, and if you need to go even further back, you can save to the 
Release 12 DXF format. Visit the online help index for instructions.
 ✓ 
Application compatibility: If you use third-party applications with a pre-
vious AutoCAD release, they may not work with AutoCAD 2011. AutoCAD 
applications developed with the .NET or the ObjectARX (AutoCAD 
Runtime eXtension) interfaces will probably need to be recompiled. 
Many LSP (AutoLISP) programs written for the last several versions of 
AutoCAD should work without change.
 
 Built-in support for VBA applications is not included in AutoCAD 2011. 
For this release only, you can continue to run VBA applications, but you 
first have to download and install the VBA installer from Autodesk’s 
Web site. At the time this book went to press, the URL has not been 
finalized; just go to www.autodesk.com and enter VBA installer in the 
Search box. There are 32- and 64-bit versions, so make sure you down-
load the right one for your system.
 ✓ 
Computer system requirements: For AutoCAD 2011, Autodesk recom-
mends a 1.6 GHz or better Intel or AMD processor with at least 2 GB of 
RAM if running in Windows XP, and a 3.0 GHz or better chip and 2 GB of 
RAM if running in Windows Vista or Windows 7. Multiple processors and 
dual core are supported. You also need a 1024 x 768 or higher display 
resolution with True Color graphics, 1 GB to 1.6GB of available hard disk 
space, an Internet connection, and Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 or later.

18
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 ✓ 
Additional requirements for working in 3D: AutoCAD recommends a 
3 GHz or better processor; 2 GB or more of RAM; a workstation-class, 
Direct3D-capable graphics card with at least 128 MB of memory; and an 
additional 2 GB of hard disk space beyond the 1 GB required for installation.
 
I find even the recommended system requirements on the minimal side. For 
example, my desktop computer runs at a screen resolution of 1280 x 1024, and 
my tablet computer runs at 1400 x 1050. The figures in this book were shot at 
a resolution of 1024 x 768, and as you can see, things can get pretty crowded 
at that resolution.
Suddenly, It’s 2011!
There’s been a new release of AutoCAD every spring since AutoCAD 2004 was 
launched in 2003. That’s not much time for even an army of programmers to 
deliver a compelling new feature set that’s going to convince all users that 
they just have to upgrade. What seems to have been happening is a concen-
tration on particular areas in recent releases. For example, AutoCAD 2007 
was a 3D release; the 3D modeling engine was made much easier to use, but 
there was relatively little to please the 2D crowd. By contrast, AutoCAD 2008 
was deemed to be “the drafter’s release” because of the number of enhance-
ments to 2D drawing capabilities — above all, the introduction of annotative 
documentation objects. In AutoCAD 2009, the new interface got the lion’s 
share of development (suddenly, it’s Office 2007!); major new features were 
limited to some 3D navigation tools, the very useful Quick Properties tool, 
and a palettized Layer Properties Manager. AutoCAD 2010 offered significant 
enhancements to both 2D and 3D users, in parametric drafting tools, and 
free-form mesh modeling.
 
AutoCAD 2011 again has presents for both the 2D and the 3D crowds, in the 
new transparency object property, object visibility controls, and a new suite 
of surface modeling tools. I introduce transparency in Chapter 6 and object 
isolation in Chapter 10; you find out about network surfaces, blends, and G2 
continuity in Chapter 22, and rendering with materials in Chapter 23. In the 
meantime, here’s a short list of some of the other new features, along with 
where you can go to find out more:
 ✓ 
AutoCAD’s drawing screen: After a quarter-century of out-of-the-box 
black backgrounds, Autodesk’s programmers decided to kick the pro-
gram into the 21st century by lightening up the drawing area, making 
it more like Inventor and Revit, Autodesk’s newer 3D design programs. 
AutoCAD 2010 appeared with an off-white drawing background, but the 
program has now returned to the dark side — not black, but very dark 
gray. And the old dot grid has been sidelined by a new graph paper-style 
linear grid.

19
 Chapter 1: Introducing AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
 ✓ 
Navigation bar: Pan, Zoom, SteeringWheel, Orbit, and ShowMotion (the 
last two not in AutoCAD LT) are removed from the status bar and relo-
cated to the new, floating Navigation bar. The ViewCube, near neighbor 
to the Navigation bar, is now on screen even in the 2D Wireframe visual 
style (it was formerly visible only in 3D visual styles). Since AutoCAD LT 
has virtually no 3D capabilities, it doesn’t get the ViewCube. I introduce 
the Navigation bar in Chapter 2, and cover its 2D tools in Chapter 12.
 ✓ 
New Visual Styles: Visual styles let you quickly view 3D models with sur-
faces and a minimal degree of rendering. AutoCAD 2011 comes with ten 
visual styles; the four new ones include “Shades of Gray” and “X-Ray.” 
Visual styles (which are not included in AutoCAD LT) are described in 
Chapter 21.
 ✓ 
Object visibility: This one is probably my favorite new feature. You no 
longer have to turn an entire layer off in order to hide the display of one 
particular object — you can now select the object you don’t want to see, 
right-click, and choose Hide Objects. You can also isolate objects so 
what you select is the only thing you see. I cover hiding, isolating, and 
unisolating objects in Chapter 10.
 ✓ 
New selection tools: Two new commands on the right-click menu offer 
their assistance in selecting objects and drawing new ones. Select 
Similar prompts you to select an object, and then displays all objects 
with the same properties. Add Selected prompts you to pick an object; 
AutoCAD then starts whatever command was used to create that object 
and draws a new object using the source object’s properties. I describe 
these new tools in Chapter 10.
 ✓ 
Inferred constraints: A new status bar button toggles this feature off 
and on. When enabled, parametric constraints are added to points you 
pick using object snaps — or points to which object snaps are automati-
cally applied. For example, if you draw a series of lines using the LINE 
command, and inferred constraints is enabled, the lines get coincident 
constraints at their adjoining endpoints and behave exactly like a poly-
line. I introduce you to parametrics in Chapter 19.
 ✓ 
Hatches and gradients: The old Hatch and Gradient and Hatch Edit 
dialog boxes are still there, but the new way of adding hatching to draw-
ings is by using the new Hatch Creation and Hatch Editing contextual 
Ribbon tabs. Start the HATCH command, and as you pass your cross-
hairs over drawing geometry, different enclosed areas will highlight and 
a preview hatch pattern will appear. You just click to confirm the area 
you want. I cover hatching in Chapter 15.
 ✓ 
Polyline and spline editing: This might be my second favorite new 
feature. Polylines and splines have become much easier to edit with the 
addition of secondary grips at the midpoints of segments. Ctrl+Click 
actions on the secondary grips let you add or remove vertices or change 
line segments to arc segments.

20
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 ✓ 
3D Features: AutoCAD 2011 gains a new 3D Basics workspace that pres-
ents a not-quite-so overwhelming panoply of buttons and lists as the 
regular 3D Modeling workspace. New features include NURBS surfaces 
and a vast material library. Perhaps best of all for the 3D crowd is the 
addition of a set of 3D object snaps. (AutoCAD LT users . . . you know 
the scoop by now.) In this edition of AutoCAD For Dummies, an entire 
new section presents an introduction to viewing, creating, and editing 
3D models in AutoCAD.

A
utoCAD 2011 is a full-fledged and thoroughly up-to-date member of 
the Windows world, but if you skipped AutoCAD 2009, or you’re using 
Windows XP, or you’ve yet to kick the tires of the Microsoft Office 2007 suite, 
you may not recognize much in AutoCAD’s newest release. But the title bar 
says “AutoCAD 2011,” so you must be in the right place!
Like the rest of the book, this chapter is written for someone who has used 
other Windows programs but has little or no experience with AutoCAD. If 
you are experienced with recent releases of AutoCAD, some of this chapter 
may be old hat (even if it does look different). Here and throughout the rest 
of the book, I show you how to do things using AutoCAD’s implementation 
of Microsoft’s Fluent User Interface (or FUI for short). In the “Going for that 
classic look” sidebar later in this chapter, I show you how to make the new 
version look a lot like an old one.
By default, AutoCAD 2011 opens in the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace, 
and will continue to do so until you make another workspace current (I 
explain workspaces in the section “And They’re Off: AutoCAD’s Opening 
Screens,” later in this chapter). If you’ve been away from AutoCAD for a 
while, right now, you may be asking yourself, “Where are my toolbars? Where 
is my menu?” Unlike older Windows programs, AutoCAD 2011 sports just one 
toolbar — the Quick Access toolbar on the application title bar, right next to 
the Application button (known informally as the Big Red A) — and doesn’t 

22
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
show a menu bar in this environment. Instead, the 2D Drafting & Annotation 
workspace displays two major interface items:
 ✓ 
The Application Menu: Clicking the Application button at the top-left 
corner of the AutoCAD window opens AutoCAD 2011’s Application 
Menu. The Application Menu presents file-related commands only; here 
you can create new drawings, open existing drawings, save files, or print 
your masterpieces.
 ✓ 
The Ribbon: The Ribbon replaces the menus, toolbars, many of the 
palettes, and the dashboard of earlier releases. Where the Application 
Menu focuses on file management, the Ribbon is where you find com-
mands to create and modify drawing objects. The Autodesk program-
mers made a best guess at a task-based approach to drafting and 
organized the old interface items into panels of related tools.
I discuss both of these items in more detail in the following sections. For the 
dyed-in-the-wool traditionalists, you can reset the AutoCAD 2011 environ-
ment so it looks pretty much like it did in AutoCAD 2008. I show you how in 
the “Going for that classic look” sidebar, in this chapter.
AutoCAD Does Windows (and Office)
Whether you’re a total newcomer or an experienced user from a few releases 
back, I can guarantee that finding your way around AutoCAD 2011 is going to 
be a challenging experience.
If you’re already familiar with the Microsoft Office 2007 suite, you may recog-
nize some program features, such as the Ribbon and the Application Menu, 
which you use for choosing commands or changing system settings. But even 
if AutoCAD’s new look does seem a little familiar in places, many aspects of 
the program’s appearance — and some of the ways in which you work with 
it — are quite different from other Windows programs. Depending on the 
workspace you’ve chosen to use, you can, in many cases, tell the program 
what to do in at least five ways — pick a toolbar button, pick from a pull-
down menu, pick a tool button from a Ribbon panel, type on the keyboard, or 
pick from a right-click menu — none of which is necessarily the best method 
to use for every task.
 
Slick as they are, Ribbon panels and browsing through the Application Menu 
aren’t always the most efficient way of doing things. When you want to get real 
work done, you need to combine the Ribbon panels with other methods — 
especially entering options with the keyboard or choosing them from the right-
click menus. I show you how throughout this book.

23
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
And They’re Off: AutoCAD’s 
Opening Screens
In addition to the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace, there are a few addi-
tional preconfigured workspaces available from the Workspace Switching 
button. You can also create an “initial setup” based on the industry you work 
in, and the content you want to see on the Ribbon. You can create an Initial 
Setup Workspace by clicking Initial Setup on the User Preferences tab of the 
Options dialog box.
Profiling your display
The illustrations and descriptions in this chap-
ter and throughout the book show the default 
configuration of AutoCAD 2011’s 2D Drafting &  
Annotation workspace — that is, the way the 
screen looks if you use the standard version 
of AutoCAD 2011 (not a flavored version, such 
as AutoCAD Architecture 2011 or AutoCAD
 
Mechanical 2011) and don’t change any dis-
play settings. You can change workspaces by 
clicking either the Workspace Switching button 
on the status bar or the Workspace drop-down 
menu on the Quick Access toolbar, and choos-
ing a different workspace from the menu.
 
You can change the appearance of the work-
space itself with settings on the Display tab of 
the Options dialog box (click the Application  
button, then click Options at the bottom of the 
Application Menu) and by dragging toolbars  
and other screen components.
The main change from AutoCAD’s default set-
tings that I’ve made for this book is to config-
ure the drawing area background to be white 
because the figures show up better that way. 
The default background color in both AutoCAD 
2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011 is dark gray, but
 
many longtime users prefer a pure black back-
ground because they believe there’s less glare 
that way. (This is much less of an issue with LCD 
flat-panel displays.) You may want to set a black 
or a white background on your own system or 
stay with the default gray background — it’s 
your choice, and there’s no right or wrong
 
way. Some of AutoCAD’s object colors show 
up better on a light background, and some are  
better on a black one.
You can reset the default AutoCAD 2011 color 
scheme from the Options dialog box’s Display 
tab. Click Colors to open the Drawing Window 
Colors dialog box, then click the Restore Classic 
Colors button. AutoCAD 2011 includes a couple 
of skin-like color schemes, also accessible
 
from the Display tab of the Options dialog box. 
Designed to enhance the look of the new inter-
face and ingeniously named Light and Dark, the 
differences between them are pretty subtle and 
apply to Windows elements like the title and 
taskbar, not to AutoCAD elements like cross-
hairs or background colors.

24
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
However, because there are so many possible permutations of the Initial 
Setup Workspace, let alone the 3D Modeling and AutoCAD Classic flavors, 
for most of this book (the exception is Part V on 3D modeling) I’m going to 
be sticking with the out-of-the-box 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace (the 
exception is Part V, which deals with 3D modeling), and I recommend you do 
the same as you read along.
 A 
workspace is a collection of menus, palettes, toolbars, and/or Ribbon panels 
tailored for specific tasks, such as 3D modeling or 2D drafting.
After you switch, AutoCAD remembers which workspace you last used and 
opens in that one. Four standard workspaces are created when you install 
AutoCAD 2011 (only two come with AutoCAD LT 2011):
 ✓ 
2D Drafting & Annotation: This workspace (as shown in Figure 2-1) is 
configured for a 2D drafting environment, with Ribbon tabs and panels 
optimized for technical drawing in two dimensions.
 
✓ 3D Basics: This workspace is designed to help you get your feet wet with 
3D modeling in AutoCAD 2011. It leaves out the Solid, Surface, and Mesh 
object creation tabs, and provides simplified panels in the other tabs. I 
cover modeling in 3D in Part V of this book, and there I use (and recom-
mend that you do the same) the full 3D Modeling workspace Ribbon. 
This workspace isn’t included in AutoCAD LT because LT doesn’t do 3D.
 ✓ 
3D Modeling: This Ribbon-based workspace is configured for a 3D mod-
eling environment, with navigation, visualization, and modeling tools 
suitable for working in 3D. This workspace isn’t included in AutoCAD LT, 
either.
 ✓ 
AutoCAD Classic: This workspace is configured for a 2D drafting envi-
ronment, with toolbars and tool palette arrangements similar to those 
in AutoCAD 2008 and earlier. In AutoCAD LT this workspace is called 
AutoCAD LT Classic.
Running with Ribbons
Whether you’re running AutoCAD 2011 in Windows 7, Vista, or XP, most of 
AutoCAD’s default screen (refer to Figure 2-1) is pretty different from tradi-
tional Windows fare. Yes, you have title bars and a status bar, but the rest of 
the interface might look foreign. I cover the familiar stuff first.

A hierarchy of title bars
Like most Windows programs, AutoCAD has a title bar at the top of its appli-
cation window that reminds you which program you’re in (not that you’d 
ever mistake the AutoCAD 2011 window for, say, FreeCell — or even AutoCAD 
2008!).
 ✓ 
At the right side of the program title bar is the standard set of three 
Windows control buttons: Minimize, Maximize/Restore, and Close.
 ✓ 
Each non-maximized drawing window within the AutoCAD program 
window has its own title bar, as shown in Figure 2-2. You can use the 
control buttons on a drawing window’s title bar to minimize, maximize/
restore, or close that drawing instead of the entire AutoCAD program.

26
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Going for that classic look
Like it or not, the Ribbon-based user interface 
isn’t going away any time soon. I didn’t care for 
the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace when 
it first showed up in AutoCAD 2007, but thanks 
to the Ribbon, I’m now sold on it. AutoCAD
 
2011’s 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace is 
where I spend most of my time, and that’s what 
nearly all the figures in this book (including the  
figure here) show.
Unlike Microsoft’s Office 2007 suite, which
 
dragged longtime users kicking and screaming 
into the new Fluent User Interface, AutoCAD 
users have the option of staying with the old 
interface. The easiest way to go back to the 
future is to switch workspaces using (what
 
else?) the Workspace Switching button on the  
status bar, or the Workspace drop-down on the 
Quick Access toolbar. Select AutoCAD Classic, 
and presto — this is (almost) your father’s
 
AutoCAD! You end up with a menu bar; some 
familiar-looking toolbars docked to the top, left, 
and right sides of the drawing area; and a float-
ing tool palette near the middle of the display.
The new interface lets you add bits of the old 
one too. You can display the classic drop-down 
menu system by clicking the down arrow at
 
the right end of the Quick Access toolbar and 
choosing Show Menu Bar. You can also stay 
mostly in the Ribbon but display your favorite 
classic toolbars at the same time. Just click  
Toolbars on the Windows panel of the View
 
tab, click AutoCAD to display the entire list of 
toolbars, and then select the one you want.

Drawing window title bar
Drawing window control buttons
As in other Windows programs, if you maximize a drawing’s window, it expands 
to fill the entire drawing area. In AutoCAD 2011’s 2D Drafting & Annotation work-
space, a maximized drawing window’s control buttons have migrated south, 
from the menu bar (which isn’t there anymore) to the upper-right corner of the 
drawing area itself. To un-maximize (restore) the drawing so that you can see 
any other drawings that you have open, click the lower Restore button.
The program title and drawing name are centered in the title bar instead of 
being off to the left, beside a program icon. The AutoCAD title bar also has a 
couple of devices added to it:
 ✓ 
InfoCenter: Forced out of its old home in the menu bar to a new location 
at the right side of the program title bar, this is Information Central for 
AutoCAD. Type a keyword and click the binoculars for more informa-
tion, or click the satellite dish to connect to the Communication Center 
and check for updates.
 
 You can save InfoCenter topics to a Favorites list (click the star), and 
you can access or sign up for the AutoCAD Subscription Center (alas, 
not included in the price of admission). Access to the online help is via 
the question-mark button at the end of the InfoCenter panel.

28
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 ✓ 
Quick Access toolbar: This permanent toolbar (the only one common to 
all workspaces) contains frequently used commands in an easily acces-
sible location. You can add and remove tool buttons by clicking the 
down arrow at the right end of the Quick Access toolbar and selecting or 
deselecting the ones you want to add or remove, respectively.
 
 If you’re floundering around looking for the commands you used to be 
able to find, a life preserver is hiding in the drop-down menu at the right 
end of the Quick Access toolbar. Click Show Menu Bar, and the old famil-
iar classic menu appears above the Ribbon.
Making choices from the Application Menu
The Application Menu is accessible from all workspaces. AutoCAD 2011’s 
Application Menu follows Microsoft’s Fluent User Interface (or FUI — honest!) 
guidelines in placing file management commands here, and all drawing and 
editing commands on the Ribbon. The Application Menu is divided into ten 
categories, as follows:
 ✓ 
New: Create a new drawing from a list of templates or create a new sheet 
set (not in AutoCAD LT, and in any case, I don’t cover sheet sets in this 
book).
 ✓ 
Open: Open an existing drawing or sheet set for editing, or import data 
from a MicroStation DGN file into a new AutoCAD drawing.
 ✓ 
Save: Save the current drawing in the current location; if the current 
drawing hasn’t been saved, you’re prompted for a filename and a location.
 ✓ 
Save As: Save the current drawing to a new filename and/or location and 
make the newly named or located file the current drawing. Also save the 
drawing as a template (DWT) or standards (DWS) file, or export a paper 
space layout to a new drawing.
 ✓ 
Export: Save the current drawing to a variety of Design Web Format 
(DWF) files, a PDF, a DGN, or other file format. I discuss most of these 
formats in Chapters 18 and 20.
 
 AutoCAD 2011 exports to FBX format (that’s one I don’t discuss in this 
book). FBX is specifically designed to export lights and materials — even 
animation data (and haven’t we come a long way from lines and circles!) 
from AutoCAD drawings to more specialized 3D programs like Autodesk 
Maya or Max. In short . . . if you need this format, you already know about it.
 ✓ 
Print: Print a single drawing or batch plot multiple drawings, create or 
modify named page setups, and manage plotters and plot styles (I cover 
most of these operations in Chapter 16).
 ✓ 
Publish: Send a 3D model to an outside 3D printing service or create an

 ✓ 
Send: E-mail the current drawing file or create a Zip file containing the 
current drawing and any associated files needed to display the drawing 
completely (most often, those associated files are external references, 
which I introduce in Chapter 18).
 ✓ 
Drawing Utilities: Set file properties or drawing units; purge unused 
blocks, layers, and styles from the current drawing; and audit or recover 
damaged drawings.
 ✓ 
Close: Close the current drawing or close all drawings. If any drawings have 
been changed, you’re prompted to save before AutoCAD closes the file.
But wait! There’s more under the Big Red A
In addition to the Application Menu’s actual file menu items, a few other fea-
tures are worth a mention:
 ✓ 
Recent Documents: If you choose this option, the right pane displays 
a list of drawings you’ve recently edited but that aren’t currently open. 
You can show them in a simple list or as thumbnail images, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. You can also pin them to stop them from scrolling off the list. 
Naturally enough, clicking one of the icons opens the drawing.

Open Documents: Choose this option to see what’s already open, and 
click an item to switch to it. This is equivalent to pressing Ctrl+Tab to 
switch between open documents in any Windows program and works 
the same basic way as the Quick View Drawings feature, described in the 
“Looking for Mr. Status Bar” section, later in the chapter.
 ✓ 
Options: Click this button to open the Options dialog box, where you 
can make hundreds of system settings. You can also open Options by 
typing OP (the alias for the OPTIONS command).
 ✓ 
Search: If you’re not sure of a command name or you want help on a 
topic, just start typing in the Application Menu’s search bar. AutoCAD 
2011 very quickly displays a categorized list, complete with links to start 
commands or to access the online help (see Figure 2-4).

Unraveling the Ribbon
It’s a whole new racetrack in AutoCAD 2011. In AutoCAD 2008 and prior 
releases, you bounced around a bunch of palettes, toolbars, and dashboard 
panels to find the commands you wanted. Now everything (well . . . almost 
everything) lives in one place: the Ribbon.

31
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
The primary interface element in the 2D Drafting & Annotation, 3D Basics, 
and 3D Modeling workspaces is the Ribbon, an adjustable area that contains 
different collections of tabbed, task-oriented collections of panels. Some 
panels — those marked with a little black triangle on the panel label — have 
more tools concealed on a slideout (see Figure 2-5). Click the panel label to 
open the slideout. You can click the pushpin icon to pin the slideout open — 
otherwise, it will slide away home after you click a button.
In AutoCAD 2011, you can click-and-drag a Ribbon panel and pull it into the 
drawing area. So if, for example, you find yourself doing a whack of dimension-
ing, but you also want to move away from the Annotate tab to other Ribbon 
tabs, you can drag the Dimensions panel into the drawing, and it will stay put, 
even as you switch to other panels or tabs. Just be sure to put it back where it 
came from when you’re finished with it (as your mom used to say).
Autodesk’s programmers see the Ribbon as an alternative way of interacting 
with the program. Theoretically, the Ribbon eliminates the need for menus 
and separate toolbars, although the change-averse may think otherwise. The 
Ribbon is fully customizable, but I don’t get into customizing AutoCAD in 
this book — if you want to find out more, click Customization Guide in the 
AutoCAD 2011 online help’s Home page.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 
By default, the Ribbon is docked at the top of the screen, but it can be 
docked against any edge, anchored to the left or right side of the AutoCAD 
window, or floated. To gain some screen space, you can click the little white 
button to the right of the last tab on the Ribbon’s tab bar to minimize the 
Ribbon, first to tabs and panel labels, and then to tabs only. Click one more 
time to revert to the full Ribbon.
Instead of menus of grouped commands like Draw, Modify, Insert, and so 
forth, the tabs are organized by task as follows:
 ✓ 
Home: The Home tab contains Draw, Modify, Layers, Annotation, Block, 
Properties, Utilities, and Clipboard panels. Some panels may be dis-
played as collapsed depending on your screen resolution (the Tables, 
Markup, and Annotation Scaling panels at the right end of the Annotate 
tab in Figure 2-5 is in a collapsed state). I cover most of the commands in 
these panels in other parts of the book.
 ✓ 
Insert: This tab groups Block and Reference panels, as well as Import 
commands and a series of commands for working with nongraphical 
information, including attributes, fields, and data links. I do cover blocks 
(Chapter 17) and external references (Chapter 18), but importing and 
data tools are beyond the scope of this book and aren’t covered.
 ✓ 
Annotate: The Annotate tab expands on the minimalist Annotation panel 
on the Home tab, with many more options for creating text, dimensions, 
leaders, and tables, as well as markup functions and a few annotation 
scaling tools.
 ✓ 
Parametric: This tab is home for one of AutoCAD 2011’s most powerful 
features — parametric drawing. You can apply geometric or dimen-
sional parameters or constraints to drawing objects so that, say, two 
circles are always concentric or the length of a rectangle is always twice 
No Express service?
If your Ribbon doesn’t include the Express Tools 
tab (it’s at the far right in Figure 2-1), you should 
consider installing the Express Tools from your 
AutoCAD DVD (AutoCAD LT does not include or 
support the Express Tools).
When you first install AutoCAD 2011, you choose 
between a Typical and a Custom installation. If 
you choose Typical, the next screen asks if you 
want to install the Express Tools. If you choose 
a Custom installation, in the next screen, make  
sure to check the Express Tools item in the list  
of components. If you do not install the Express 
Tools during initial setup, you’ll have to rerun 
the setup routine from your AutoCAD 2011 DVD. 
If you haven’t installed AutoCAD yet, I strongly  
recommend that you choose the Typical instal-
lation option — or at least make sure the
 
Express Tools box is checked during a Custom  
installation.

33
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
its width. (AutoCAD LT is limited in this department: You can modify 
or delete existing constraints, but you need the full version to create 
them.) I introduce parametric drawing in Chapter 19.
 ✓ 
View: The View tab contains tools and panels for controlling drawing 
display, working with user coordinate systems and viewports, loading 
various palettes, and organizing Windows functions such as cascad-
ing open files or displaying different parts of the application window. I 
explain most of the features on this tab later in the book.
 ✓ 
Manage: This tab contains panels that access the Action Recorder, 
CAD Standards (neither of which is in AutoCAD LT), and a set of draw-
ing management and customization tools. I don’t cover anything on the 
Manage tab in this book.
 ✓ 
Output: Panels on this tab let you get those drawings off your hands by 
printing, publishing, or simply sending them electronically to others. I 
cover some of these functions in Chapter 16.
 ✓ 
Express Tools: The Express Tools are an invaluable set of custom com-
mands that will streamline your work procedures in pretty well every 
aspect of AutoCAD. They’re officially unsupported, but they’ve been 
an install option for many releases now, and mostly, they work very 
well. You get this tab only if you have the full version of AutoCAD — the 
Express Tools are not available in AutoCAD LT.
Getting with the Program
In most of this book, I focus on 2D drafting, by far the easiest way of getting 
your feet wet with AutoCAD. (Just don’t be dripping water on your com-
puter.) And if you’re not already in the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace, 
I suggest that you use the Workspace Switching button to return to it. After 
you make the switch to this workspace, AutoCAD displays the interface 
shown earlier in Figure 2-1.
Like all good Windows programs, AutoCAD has tooltips, those short descrip-
tions that appear in little text boxes when you hover the mouse pointer over 
a button. In AutoCAD 2011, tooltips display two levels of information. When 
you hover the mouse pointer over a tool button, you first see a quick iden-
tification of the command. If you keep hovering, a longer description of the 
icon’s function, often with a graphic image, appears in an extended tooltip. 
Helpful as they are when you’re starting with AutoCAD, you’ll probably want 
to remove these training wheels sooner or later. You can do so in the Options 
dialog box. (See the online help for more information.)

Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Looking for Mr. Status Bar
The application status bar (see Figure 2-6) appears at the bottom of the 
AutoCAD screen. The status bar displays and allows you to change several 
important drawing modes, aids, and settings that affect how you draw and 
edit in the current drawing. I introduce them in this section.
You can set status bar buttons to display icons or the traditional text labels 
that will be familiar to users of previous versions. To switch from one style to 
the other, right-click any of the drawing mode buttons at the left side of the 
status bar and select or deselect Use Icons.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Status 
(bars) 
check.
 
Status bar buttons showing icons
Status bar buttons showing text labels
Some of these status bar settings won’t make complete sense until you’ve 
used the AutoCAD commands that they influence, but here’s a brief descrip-
tion, with references to detailed descriptions of how to use each setting, 
starting at the left end of the status bar (and note that not all buttons are dis-
played at all times, so Figure 2-6 doesn’t show all the buttons listed):
 ✓ 
Coordinates of the crosshairs: The coordinates readout displays the 
current X,Y,Z location of the crosshairs in the drawing area, with respect 
to the origin point (whose coordinates are 0,0,0). Chapter 7 describes 
AutoCAD’s coordinate conventions and how to use this area of the 
status bar.
 
 If the coordinates in the lower-left corner of the screen are grayed out, 
coordinate tracking is turned off. Click the coordinates so that they 
appear in dark numbers that change when you move the crosshairs in 
the drawing area.
 
 ✓ 
Infer Constraints (INFER): Parametric constraints were new in AutoCAD 
2010, and inferred constraints are the first major enhancement to this 
relatively new feature. When INFER is enabled, you automatically set 
geometry-based constraints as you draw. I cover geometric and dimen-
sional constraints in Chapter 19.
 ✓ 
SNAP, GRID, and ORTHO modes: These three buttons control three of 
AutoCAD’s tools that help with precision drawing and editing:

35
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
 
 • 
SNAP: Constrains the crosshairs to regularly spaced intervals, 
enabling you to draw objects a fixed distance apart more easily
 
 • 
GRID: Displays a series of graph paper–style lines or regularly 
spaced dots, which serve as a distance reference
 
 • 
ORTHO: Constrains the crosshairs to horizontal and vertical move-
ment, which makes drawing orthogonal (straight horizontal and 
vertical) lines easy
 
 See Chapter 4 for instructions on how to configure these modes and 
Chapter 7 for information about why, when, and how to use them in 
actual drawing operations.
 
 ✓ 
POLAR Tracking mode: Polar tracking causes the crosshairs to jump to 
certain angles when you draw and edit objects. The default angle set-
tings are multiples of 90 degrees, but you can specify other angle incre-
ments, such as 45 or 30 degrees. See Chapter 7 for instructions on 
specifying the polar tracking angles that you prefer. Clicking the Polar 
button toggles polar tracking on and off. Ortho and polar tracking are 
mutually exclusive — turning on one mode disables the other.
 
 ✓ 
Object Snap (OSNAP): Object snap is another AutoCAD tool for ensuring 
precision drawing and editing. You use object snaps to grab points on 
existing objects — for example, the endpoint of a line or the center of a 
circle. Chapter 7 contains detailed instructions on how to use this feature.
 
 ✓ 
3D Object Snap (3DOSNAP): With AutoCAD’s enhanced 3D capabilities, 
an extension of object snaps into the third dimension was a given. 
Enabling this mode lets you snap to the precise center of a face, a 
vertex, the midpoint of an edge, or a number of similar 3D points you 
can’t get to with regular object snaps.
 
 ✓ 
Object Snap Tracking (OTRACK): When you turn on object snap track-
ing, AutoCAD hunts in a more sophisticated way for points that are 
derived from object snap points. Chapter 7 briefly describes this 
advanced feature.
 
 ✓ 
Dynamic User Coordinate System (DUCS): This one’s for 3D object cre-
ation (and so is not included in AutoCAD LT). Most AutoCAD primitive 
objects, such as lines, arcs, and circles, are planar, and you have to set 
an appropriate plane in three dimensions if you want to work in 3D. You 
can set planes with the UCS command — I explain how in Chapter 22 — 
but enabling Dynamic UCS automatically sets the workplane by simply 
hovering the mouse over the face of an object.
 
 ✓ 
Dynamic Input (DYN): Dynamic input displays commands, options, 
prompts, and user input in a tooltip adjacent to the crosshairs and 
enables you to keep focused on what you’re drawing. In addition, the 
dynamic input tooltip displays what you type in response to prompts. I 
describe dynamic input later in this chapter.

36
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 ✓ 
Lineweight (LWT) display mode: One of the properties that you can 
assign to objects in AutoCAD is lineweight — the thickness that lines 
appear when you plot the drawing. This button controls whether you 
see the lineweights on the screen. (This button doesn’t control whether 
lineweights appear on plots; that’s a separate setting in the Plot dialog 
box.) Chapter 6 gives you the skinny (and the wide) on lineweights.
 
 
✓ Transparency (TPY): A new object property in AutoCAD 2011 lets you 
create see-through objects for the first time. Similar to the Lineweight 
button, this button controls whether objects assigned the transparency 
property appear transparent or opaque. I introduce you to object trans-
parency in Chapter 6.
 
 ✓ 
Quick Properties (QP): When Quick Properties is enabled, selecting an 
object in the drawing displays a pop-up window that lists the main prop-
erties of that object. You can choose which properties you want dis-
played by right-clicking the QP button and choosing Settings. I fill you in 
on object properties in Chapter 6.
 
 ✓ 
Selection Cycling (SC): It’s remarkably easy in AutoCAD to draw objects 
on top of other objects and not be able to tell you’ve done so. When the 
new Selection Cycling is enabled, an icon showing two overlapping rect-
angles appears beside the crosshairs if AutoCAD finds more than one 
object under them. If you then click to select, a Selection window pops 
up showing you how many objects, and of what type, are under the 
point that you picked (see Figure 2-7).
 
Figure 2-7: 
Overlapping 
objects 
listed in the 
Selection 
window.
 
 
 ✓ 
MODEL/PAPER: Clicking this button toggles between model space and 
paper space.
 
 
 As I describe in the section “Down the main stretch: The drawing area,” 
later in this chapter, AutoCAD’s drawing area is composed of two over-
lapping environments: Model space is where you create your model 
geometry, and paper space is where you compose your drawing sheet 
to document that geometry. Clicking this button when the Model tab 
is active (that is, you’re in full-screen model space) switches you to 

37
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
a paper space layout. A completed layout includes viewports, which 
reveal the objects in model space at a particular scale. (I tell you more 
about viewports and layouts in Chapter 5.) After you switch to a paper 
space layout, clicking this button toggles between paper space and 
model space within the layout. The button label switches from MODEL to 
PAPER to show you which space you’re in.
 
 ✓ 
Model and Layout: (These two buttons disappear if Model and Layout 
tabs are displayed.) Clicking the Model button switches you out of the 
layout and back to full-screen model space. (If Model and Layout tabs 
are displayed, you click the Model tab to switch to full-screen model 
space.) Clicking Layout switches you to whichever paper space layout 
was active when you switched to model space. (Note that the tooltip for 
the Layout button displays the name of the layout, which might be 
changed from the default Layout1 or Layout2.)
 
 ✓ 
Quick View Layouts: Clicking this button displays a horizontal row of 
graphic images of all layouts in the current drawing. Click a layout image 
to make that layout current. The Quick View toolbar below the layout 
images contains buttons for pinning the Quick View Layouts bar so it 
stays open, creating a new layout, publishing the selected layout, and 
closing Quick View Layouts. I cover layout creation in Chapter 5 and 
publishing in Chapter 16.
 
 ✓ 
Quick View Drawings: Clicking this button displays a row of graphic 
images of all currently open drawings. Click a drawing image to make it 
current. (Why, yes, it is the same as Ctrl+Tabbing!) Quick View Drawings 
includes the same Quick View toolbar as Quick View Layouts.
 
 ✓ 
Maximize/Minimize Viewport (appears on paper space layouts only): 
When you’re looking at one of the Layout tabs instead of the Model tab, 
the status bar displays an additional Maximize Viewport button. Click 
this button to expand the current paper space viewport so that it fills 
the entire drawing area. Click the button — now called Minimize 
Viewport — again to restore the viewport to its normal size. (Chapter 5 
describes viewports.)
The next six buttons control the size and appearance of AutoCAD’s annota-
tive objects — things like text, dimensions, hatching, and so forth. Annotative 
objects are complex, so don’t worry if you don’t understand at this point — 
remember, in this chapter, I’m just showing you what the buttons do. Because 
annotative objects means text more than anything else, I explain this feature in 
Chapter 13.
 
 ✓ 
Lock/Unlock Viewport: Once you’re satisfied with the display inside 
your viewport, and you’ve assigned a viewport scale, use this button to 
lock the viewport display so you don’t accidentally pan or zoom inside 
it. (See Chapter 5 for more on viewports.)

38
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 ✓ 
Annotation Scale (appears in full-screen model space only): Clicking 
Annotation Scale displays a list of preset annotation scales; if the 
Automatically Add Scales button is toggled on, changing a scale here 
causes all annotative objects to update to the new scale.
 
 ✓ 
Viewport Scale: This button appears only in a layout, when a model 
space viewport is activated. If the viewport is locked, this button is inac-
tive. If the viewport is unlocked, clicking the button displays a list of 
scales; choose the desired scale from the list.
 
 ✓ 
Annotation Scale Is Not Equal To Viewport Scale: If the scale assigned 
to annotative objects within the viewport differs from the scale assigned 
to the viewport itself, clicking this button will synchronize the annota-
tion scale to the viewport scale.
 
 ✓ 
Annotation Visibility: This button toggles the visibility of annotative 
objects. When the light bulb is off (gray), only annotative objects of the 
current annotative scale are visible; when the light bulb is on (yellow), 
all annotative objects in the drawing, regardless of scale, are visible.
 
 ✓ 
Automatically Add Scales: When this button is toggled on, additional 
annotative scales are automatically added to objects inside the viewport 
when you change the viewport scale.
 
 ✓ 
Workspace Switching: Clicking this button displays a list of saved work-
spaces, including the four default workspaces (two in AutoCAD LT): 
AutoCAD Classic, 2D Drafting & Annotation, 3D Basics, and 3D Modeling 
(the latter two are not included in AutoCAD LT), plus any user-defined 
and saved workspaces.
 
 ✓ 
Lock/Unlock Toolbar/Window Positions: “Now, where did I leave that 
Properties palette?” You’ll never have to ask yourself again — AutoCAD 
2011 lets you lock the Ribbon, toolbars, or palettes (which for some 
reason it’s started calling windows) in position, so you’ll always know 
where they are.
 
 
✓ Hardware Acceleration: You can quickly toggle hardware acceleration 
on and off from the status bar. Prior to AutoCAD 2011, you had to run 
the 3DCONFIG command and proceed through a couple of dialog boxes. 
Visit the online help to find out more about improved graphics perfor-
mance and better rendering options using hardware acceleration; hard-
ware acceleration is not available in AutoCAD LT.
The remaining status bar icons, with the exception of Clean Screen at the 
very end, live in a special area of the status bar called the tray. The tray dis-
plays icons that represent drawing services, and most do not appear at all 
times. These tray icons include

39
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
 
 ✓ 
Trusted Autodesk DWG: A trusted drawing is one created by AutoCAD, 
AutoCAD LT, or any program developed by Autodesk. In recent years, 
more and more programs have been able to save in DWG format, but in 
Autodesk’s eyes, these files are not to be trusted. If you open such a 
drawing file, you’ll get a warning dialog box and a little yellow danger 
sign over the trusted DWG icon (make sure you know where your wallet 
is when you work on one of these files).
 
 ✓ 
Object Isolation: In AutoCAD 2011, you don’t need to turn a layer — and 
everything on it — off if you want a clearer view of something in a 
crowded drawing. Now you can select an object and either hide it (so it 
disappears) or isolate it (so everything else disappears). If the light bulb 
on this button is dim, it means one or more objects are either hidden or 
isolated; click the button and choose Unisolate Objects to turn every-
thing else — including the light bulb icon — back on.
 
 ✓ 
Associated Standards File: You see this button if you’ve enabled CAD 
standards checking and configured a drawing standards (DWS) file. 
Clicking this button displays the Check Standards dialog box. AutoCAD’s 
CAD Standards functions are not included in AutoCAD LT. I don’t cover 
standards checking in this book.
 
 ✓ 
Manage Xrefs: You won’t see this combination button and notification 
symbol until you open a drawing that contains xrefs (external DWG files 
that are incorporated into the current drawing). Chapter 18 tells you 
how to use xrefs and what the Manage Xrefs button does.
 ✓ 
Status Bar Menu: When you click the easy-to-miss, downward-pointing 
arrow near the right end of the status bar, you open a menu with options 
for toggling off or on each status bar button. Now you can decorate your 
status bar to your taste. You can also turn on the drawing status bar. 
Doing so moves the three annotation scaling buttons described above 
to a separate drawing-specific status bar. (My personal preference is to 
leave it turned off.)
 
 ✓ 
Clean Screen: No, this button doesn’t squeegee your monitor. Clicking 
this button frees up a bit more screen space by first maximizing the 
AutoCAD window and then turning off the title bar, toolbars, palettes, 
and the Windows taskbar. Click the button again to restore those 
elements.
Several status bar buttons, including Snap, Polar Tracking, Object Snap, and 
Object Snap Tracking, sport right-click menus that offer a speedier way of 
setting options. With some of the other buttons, such as Grid and Dynamic 
Input, you right-click the button and choose Settings to open the Drafting 
Settings dialog box to specify options. Chapters 4 and 6 give you specific 
guidance about when and how to change these settings.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 
See you later, Navigator
 
In AutoCAD 2011, primary access to the display commands has moved from 
the status bar to a new Navigation bar that appears, by default, at the right 
edge of the program window. AutoCAD also has a ViewCube that provides an 
alternative to the Orbit tool (neither the cube nor the Orbit tool are included 
in AutoCAD LT). The ViewCube itself first appeared in AutoCAD 2010; what’s 
new in AutoCAD 2011 is its presence in all workspaces — last time it only 
appeared in the 3D workspaces. Figure 2-8 shows the differences between the 
navigation devices in AutoCAD (on the left) and AutoCAD LT. I introduce you 
to the Navigation bar buttons below, and explain their operation more fully in 
Chapter 12. I give you the drill on the ViewCube and the Orbit tool in Chapter 
21. Here’s an introduction to the Navigation bar buttons:

 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
 
 ✓ 
SteeringWheel: You were probably wondering when this motoring meta-
phor was going to pay off, right? Well, believe it or not, there really is an 
AutoCAD function called the SteeringWheel! (I’m still looking for the Gas 
Pedal . . . oops, I mean GasPedal.) A SteeringWheel is described in the 
online help as a tracking menu — the idea here is that you combine a 
number of display operations into a single input “device.” I mention the 
SteeringWheel in Chapter 12 but point out here that it’s of little use in 2D 
drafting — which, unfortunately, is all that AutoCAD LT users can do 
with it.
 
 ✓ 
Pan and Zoom: These buttons provide access to two commonly used 
display commands, PAN and ZOOM. PAN moves you around your draw-
ing without changing your viewing distance; ZOOM brings the drawing 
objects closer so you can see more detail, or farther away, so you can 
see more of the drawing area. These and other display commands are 
described in Chapter 12.
 
 ✓ 
Orbit: The Orbit tool (not available in AutoCAD LT) is an interactive 
device for viewing your 3D models from any angle. I describe this tool 
with the other 3D viewing options in Chapter 21.
 
 ✓ 
ShowMotion: The ShowMotion tool starts a rudimentary animation 
program. As the online help describes it, you can generate effects simi-
lar to those in TV commercials to dress up motion studies of your 
designs. ShowMotion isn’t included in AutoCAD LT and is beyond — well 
beyond — the scope of this book.
Let your fingers do the talking: 
The command window
The infamous command window (or command line, or command prompt, 
or command area, whatever you want to call it), shown in Figure 2-9, is a 
throwback to the dark ages of AutoCAD. It puzzles newcomers and delights 
AutoCAD aficionados. Despite the promise of AutoCAD’s heads-up dynamic 
input, for now at least, the hard truth is that you have to come to like — or at 
least tolerate — the command window if you want to become at all comfort-
able using AutoCAD.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Obey the 
command 
window.
 

42
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
You should cotton on and cozy up to the command window because it’s still 
AutoCAD’s primary communications conduit with you. AutoCAD sometimes 
displays prompts, warnings, and error messages in the command window 
that dynamic input doesn’t show — there simply isn’t room in the dynamic 
input tooltip to show as much information as you get at the command 
window. True, when using dynamic input, you can press the down-arrow key 
to see more options. But which is less efficient: moving your eyes down the 
screen to glance at the command window or taking your eyes right off the 
screen to find the down-arrow key on your keyboard?
The key(board) to AutoCAD success
Despite (or is it because of?) AutoCAD’s long heritage as the most successful 
CAD software for personal computers, newcomers are still astonished at the 
amount of typing they have to do. Some more-modern programs have much 
less dependency on the keyboard than AutoCAD, but as you get used to it, 
you’ll find that no other input method gives you as much flexibility as pound-
ing the ivories . . . oops, wrong keyboard!
Typing at your computer’s keyboard is an efficient way to run some com-
mands and the only way to run a few others. Instead of clicking a button or 
choosing from a menu, you can start a command by typing the command 
name and then pressing Enter. Even better, for most common commands, you 
can type the keyboard shortcut for a command name and press Enter. Most 
of the keyboard shortcuts (called aliases) for command names are just one or 
two letters — for example, L for the LINE command and CP for the COPY com-
mand. Most people who discover how to use the shortcuts for the commands 
that they run most frequently find that their AutoCAD productivity improves 
noticeably. Even if you’re not worried about increasing your productivity with 
this technique, several everyday commands are nowhere to be found on the 
Ribbon. If you want to run those commands, you have to type them!
 
Not all command aliases are as obvious as L for LINE (for example, CP 
for COPY or — believe it or not — T for MTEXT). To see a complete list 
of command aliases, look in the AutoCAD (or the AutoCAD LT) Program 
Parameters (PGP) file by going to the Manage tab and clicking Edit Aliases on 
the Customization panel. Windows Notepad opens with the acad.pgp (or 
acadlt.pgp) file loaded. Scroll down to the section headed “Sample Aliases 
for AutoCAD Commands. I don’t recommend changing anything, but it’s a 
good idea to print this file and pin up the aliases section over your desk.
After you’ve started a command — whether from a Ribbon panel tool button 
or by typing — the dynamic input tooltip and the command window are 
where AutoCAD prompts you with options for that command. You activate 
one of these options by typing the uppercase letter(s) in the option and 
pressing Enter.

43
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
 
In many cases, you can activate a command’s options by right-clicking in the 
drawing area and choosing the desired option from the menu that appears, 
instead of by typing the letter(s) for the option and pressing Enter.
 
I like dynamic input. Really, I do. But sometimes it fights with normal com-
mand input, and that can make things really confusing. In the following chap-
ters, I tell you when to be wary.
The following sequence demonstrates how you use the keyboard to run com-
mands and to view and select options. If you have dynamic input toggled on, 
your results are going to be different from what I say, so I suggest you click 
the DYN status bar button to turn it off, temporarily at least (if your status 
bar buttons show icons instead of text, look for the + symbol with the single 
white rectangle). In the following steps, watch the command window, and 
pay attention to messages from AutoCAD:
 1. 
Type L and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the LINE command and displays the following prompt in 
the command window:
LINE Specify first point:
 
2. Click a point anywhere in the drawing area.
 
 The command window prompt changes to
Specify next point or [Undo]:
 
3. Click another point anywhere in the drawing area.
 
 AutoCAD draws the first line segment.
 
4. Click a third point anywhere in the drawing area.
 
 AutoCAD draws the second line segment and prompts
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
 
 The command line now displays two options, Close and Undo, separated 
by a slash.
 
 In this case, the Close and Undo options appear in brackets. AutoCAD’s 
command line always displays command options in square brackets. 
To activate an option, type the letter(s) shown in uppercase and press 
Enter. You can type the option letter(s) in lowercase or uppercase.
 5. 
Type U and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD undoes the second line segment.
 6. 
Type 3,2 (without any spaces) and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD draws a new line segment to the point whose X coordinate is 3 
and Y coordinate is 2.

44
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
7. Click several more points anywhere in the drawing area.
 
 AutoCAD draws additional line segments.
 8. 
Type X and press Enter.
 
 X isn’t a valid option of the LINE command, so AutoCAD displays an 
error message and prompts you again for another point:
Point or option keyword required.
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:
 
 Option keyword is programmer jargon for the letter(s) shown in upper-
case that you type to activate a command option. This error message is 
AutoCAD’s way of saying, “I don’t understand what you mean by typing 
X. Either specify a point or type a letter that I do understand.”
 
9. Type C and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD draws a final line segment, which creates a closed figure and 
ends the LINE command. A blank command line returns, indicating that 
AutoCAD is ready for the next command:
Command:
 
10. Press F2.
 
 AutoCAD displays the AutoCAD Text Window, which is simply an 
enlarged, scrollable version of the command window, as shown in 
Figure 2-10.
 
 The normal three-line command window usually shows you what you 
need to see, but occasionally you want to review a larger chunk of com-
mand-line history (“What was AutoCAD trying to tell me a minute ago?!”).
 
11. Press the F2 key again.
 
 AutoCAD closes the AutoCAD Text Window.

 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
Here are a few other tips and tricks for effective keyboarding:
 ✓ 
Use the Esc key to bail out of the current operation. Sometimes you 
might get confused about what you’re doing in AutoCAD and/or what 
you’re seeing in the command window or the dynamic input tooltip. If 
you need to bail out of the current operation, just press Esc one or more 
times until you see a blank command line — Command: at the bottom of 
the command window, with nothing after it. As in most other Windows 
programs, Esc is the cancel key. Unlike many other Windows programs, 
AutoCAD keeps you well informed of whether an operation is in prog-
ress. The blank command line indicates that AutoCAD is resting, waiting 
for your next command.
 ✓ 
Press Enter to accept the default action. Some command prompts 
include a default action in angled brackets. For example, the first prompt 
of the POLYGON command is
Enter number of sides <4>:
 
 The default here is four sides, and you can accept it simply by pressing 
Enter. (That is, you don’t have to type 4 first.)
 
 AutoCAD uses two kinds of brackets when it prompts.
 
• Command options appear in regular square brackets: [Close/
Undo].
 
 To activate a command option, type the letter(s) that appear in 
uppercase and then press Enter. The dynamic input tooltip doesn’t 
display options in brackets; instead, you press the down-arrow key 
to display additional command options in rows next to the cross-
hairs.
 
• A default value or option appears in angled brackets: <4>.
 
 To choose the default value or option, simply press Enter. Default 
values in angled brackets appear in both the dynamic input tooltip 
and the command-line prompts.
 
 You don’t always have to press the Enter key to forward your input to 
AutoCAD. Depending on what you’re doing, you can often right-click and 
pick Enter from the top of the right-click menu. And most efficient of all, 
even for the most inept typists, you can use the spacebar as an Enter 
key — as long as you’re not entering text.
 ✓ 
Watch the command line. You can discover a lot about how to use the 
command line simply by watching it after each action that you take. 
When you click a toolbar button or menu choice, AutoCAD types the 
name of the command automatically and displays it in the dynamic input 
tooltip and at the command line. If you’re watching the command line, 
you’ll absorb the command names more or less naturally.

46
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 When AutoCAD echoes commands automatically in response to your 
toolbar and menu clicks, it usually adds one or two extra characters to 
the front of the command name:
 
• AutoCAD usually puts an underscore in front of the command 
name (for example, _LINE instead of LINE). The underscore is an 
Autodesk programmers’ trick that enables non-English versions 
of AutoCAD to understand the English command names that are 
embedded in the menus.
 
• AutoCAD sometimes puts an apostrophe in front of the command 
name and any underscore (for example, ‘_ZOOM instead of ZOOM). 
The apostrophe indicates a transparent command; you can run the 
command in the middle of another command without canceling the 
first command. For example, you can start the LINE command, run 
the ZOOM command transparently, and then pick up where you 
left off with the LINE command.
 ✓ 
Leave the command line in the default configuration. The command 
window, like most other parts of the AutoCAD screen, is resizable and 
movable. The default location (docked at the bottom of the AutoCAD 
screen) and size (three lines deep) work well for most people. Resist the 
temptation to mess with the command window’s appearance — at least 
until you’re comfortable with using the command line.
 ✓ 
Right-click in the command window for options. If you right-click in the 
command window, you see a menu with some useful choices, including 
Recent Commands — the last six commands that you ran.
 ✓ 
Press the up- and down-arrow keys to cycle through the stack of com-
mands that you’ve used recently. This is another handy way to recall 
and rerun a command. Press the left- and right-arrow keys to edit the 
command line text that you’ve typed or recalled.
Most Windows users are familiar with Alt-key shortcuts. Press the Alt key in 
traditional Windows programs, and your menu bar lights up with one charac-
ter of each menu item underlined. You type the underlined letter to open the 
menu or execute the command. AutoCAD 2011’s implementation of the Fluent 
User Interface has an equivalent, called KeyTips, and they work in much the 
same way. In Figure 2-11, I’ve just pressed the Alt key. If I tap the A key now, 
the Annotate tab will open with a new set of KeyTips, and I can keep tapping 
the keys to execute a specific command.
Keeping tabs on palettes
Palettes are refined (well-mannered) versions of dialog boxes. Unlike regular 
dialog boxes, which insist on your undivided attention as long as they’re 
open, palettes stay discreetly in the background as you carry on with 
other tasks. AutoCAD still has many dialog boxes, but over the past several 
releases, quite a few former dialog boxes have been replaced by palettes.

47
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
 
Figure 2-11: 
Hold down 
the Alt key

a kazillion 
KeyTips.
 
AutoCAD 2011 contains more than a dozen palettes (more than a half-dozen 
in AutoCAD LT). Unless noted otherwise, you can open any of these palettes 
from the Palettes panel of the View tab. The more commonly used palettes are
 ✓ 
Properties and DesignCenter: These two palettes are used to control 
object properties and named objects (layers, blocks, and so on), respec-
tively. Chapter 6 shows you how.
 ✓ 
Tool Palettes: Each tool palette holds content (drawing symbols and 
hatch patterns) and/or commands (not regular AutoCAD commands — 
what would be the point? — but macros that make commands do spe-
cific things) instead of paints. You can create your own tool palettes, but 
the ones that come with AutoCAD contain dozens of symbols you can 
drag into your drawing — check ’em out!
 ✓ 
Sheet Set Manager: Provides tools for managing all of a project’s draw-
ings as a sheet set. Chapter 5 gives you some brief theory on why you 
might want to use sheet sets and how to do so. (AutoCAD LT does not 
support sheet sets.)
 ✓ 
External References: Used to attach external files to the current draw-
ing; file types include raster images, Drawing Web Format (DWF, or 
DWFx) files, PDF files, MicroStation DGN files, and other drawing files. I 
discuss attaching external reference files in Chapter 18.
 ✓ 
Markup Set Manager: Displays design and drafting review comments 
from users of Autodesk Design Review. For more information on markup 
sets, see the online help.
 ✓ 
QuickCalc: A handy pushbutton scientific calculator that hides out on 
the Home tab’s Utilities panel. You’ll know if you need this.
 ✓ 
Layer Properties Manager: The main control center for managing 
the layers on your drawing. The palettized Layer Properties Manager 
not only stays open while you’re doing other things, but also applies 
any changes you make instantly in the drawing. The Layer Properties 
Manager can be found on the Layers panel of the Home tab.

48
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
Using the View and Home tabs is one way of opening palettes. Alternatively, 
several palettes have keyboard shortcuts. You can toggle these by pressing 
Ctrl+1 (Properties), Ctrl+2 (DesignCenter), Ctrl+3 (Tool Palettes), Ctrl+4 (Sheet 
Set Manager), Ctrl+7 (Markup Set Manager), or Ctrl+8 (QuickCalc).
Down the main stretch: The drawing area
After all these warmup laps, you’re probably itching for the main event — 
the AutoCAD drawing area. This is where you do your drawing, of course. 
In the course of creating drawings, you click points to specify locations and 
distances, click objects to select them for editing, and zoom and pan to get a 
better view of what you’re working on.
Most of this book shows you how to interact with the drawing area, but you 
should know a few things up front.
Model space and paper space layouts
One of the initially disorienting things about AutoCAD is that finished draw-
ings can be composed of objects drawn in different spaces, which AutoCAD 
indicates with either two status bar buttons, or two or more tabs at the 
bottom left of the drawing area:
 ✓ 
Model space: Where you create and modify the objects that represent 
things in the real world — walls, widgets, waterways, or whatever.
 ✓ 
Paper space: Where you create particular views of these objects for 
plotting, usually with a title block around them. Paper space comprises 
one or more layouts, each of which can contain a different arrangement 
of model space views and different title block information.
When you click the Model button on the status bar or the Model tab, you see 
pure, unadulterated model space, as shown in Figure 2-12. When you click the 
Layout button, you see a paper space layout, as shown in Figure 2-13. A com-
pleted layout usually includes one or more viewports, which are windows that 
display all or part of model space at a particular scale. A layout also usually 
includes a title block or other objects that exist only in the layout and don’t 
appear when you click the Model tab. (Think of the viewport as a window 
looking into model space and the title block as a frame around the window.) 
Thus, a layout displays model space and paper space objects together, and 
AutoCAD lets you draw and edit objects in either space. See Chapter 5 for 
information about creating paper space layouts and Chapter 16 for the low-
down on plotting them.

49
 Chapter 2: Le Tour de AutoCAD 2011
 
Figure 2-12: 
A building 
model ready 
for editing 
in model 
space.
 
When a layout is current, you can move the crosshairs back and forth 
between model space and paper space while remaining in the layout. You 
can’t be in both spaces at the same time, however; if paper space is cur-
rent, you can click directly on top of a model space object, but it won’t be 
selected. Similarly, if model space is current, you can’t select anything in 
paper space. To move between the two spaces, double-click inside a view-
port to switch to model space or outside a viewport to switch to paper space.
 
This back-and-forth double-clicking is necessary only when you’re drawing 
things while viewing one of the paper space layouts or adjusting the view of 
the drawing objects within the viewport. In practice, you probably won’t draw 
very much using this method. Instead, you’ll do most of your drawing on the 
Model tab, and after you’ve set up a paper space layout, click its layout tab 
only when you want to plot.

Drawing on the drawing area
Here are a few other things to know about the AutoCAD drawing area:
 ✓ 
Efficient, confident use of AutoCAD requires that you continually glance 
from the drawing area to the command window (to see those all-impor-
tant prompts!) and then back up to the drawing area. This sequence is 
not a natural reflex for most people, and that’s why the dynamic input 
tooltip at the crosshairs was introduced. But you still get information 
from the command line that you don’t get anywhere else. Get in the 
habit of looking at the command line after each action that you take.
 ✓ 
Clicking at random in the drawing area is not quite as harmless in 
AutoCAD as it is in many other Windows programs. When you click 
in the AutoCAD drawing area, you’re almost always performing some 
action — usually specifying a point or selecting objects for editing. Feel 
free to experiment, but look at the command line after each click. If you 
get confused, press Esc a couple of times to clear the current operation 
and return to the naked command prompt.
 ✓ 
In most cases, you can right-click in the drawing area to display a menu 
with some options for the current situation.

Fun with F1
The full AutoCAD 2011 Help menu is accessible only as a drop-down list on 
the program title bar (as always, pressing F1 at any time opens the online 
help window). Click the down arrow beside the question mark to open the 
menu (see Figure 2-14) to see what’s available. I describe most of the help 
options here:
 
Figure 2-14:

✓ Help: The main AutoCAD 2011 Help system, as shown in Figure 2-15, 
uses your Web browser to display information. By default, AutoCAD 
uses Internet Explorer, but if you prefer an alternative browser, you can 
select “Default System Browser” on the System tab of the Options dialog 
box. Like most Windows programs, AutoCAD’s help is context-sensitive; 
for example, if you start the LINE command and just don’t know what 
to do next, Help will . . . er, help. You can browse through the various 
online reference manuals from the AutoCAD 2011 Help Home page. Click 
Index to look up commands and concepts, and type in the Search box 
to look for specific words. In this book, I sometimes direct you to the 
AutoCAD online help system for information about advanced topics.
 
✓ Welcome Screen: The Welcome screen was actually new in AutoCAD 
2010. What’s new — and very welcome — this time is a series of 
Getting Started video clips that present different program features. The 
AutoCAD Welcome Screen includes a couple of 3D modeling videos, and 
there are links to more videos and a suggested “Learning Path.”
 ✓ 
New Features Workshop: This describes the new and enhanced features 
in AutoCAD 2011. It’s especially useful for people who are upgrading 
from a previous AutoCAD release.
 ✓ 
Additional Resources: Most of the choices in the Additional Resources 
submenu connect you to various parts of Autodesk’s Web site. The most 
useful is probably the Support Knowledge Base. From this link, you can 
search the Autodesk Knowledge Base, download software updates, and 
get help from Web- and newsgroup-based discussion groups.

AutoCAD is one program with which you really need to take advantage of 
the online help resources. AutoCAD contains many commands, options, and 
quirks. (Alas, the quirks aren’t listed in the online help.) Everyone from the 
greenest beginner to the most seasoned expert can find out something by 
using the AutoCAD online help. Take a moment to peruse the Home page of 
the main help system so that you know what’s available. Throughout this 
book, I direct you to pages in the help system that I think are particularly 
useful, but don’t be afraid to explore on your own when you get stuck or 
feel curious.

Chapter 3
A Lap around the CAD Track
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up a simple drawing
▶ Drawing some objects
▶ Zooming and panning in your drawing
▶ Editing some objects
▶ Plotting your drawing
T
he previous two chapters introduce you to the AutoCAD world and the 
AutoCAD 2011 interface. The chapters that follow present the techniques 
that underlie good drafting practice. By now, you’re probably eager to start 
moving the crosshairs around and draw something! This chapter takes you 
on a gentle tour of the most common CAD drafting functions:
 ✓ 
Setting up a new drawing
 ✓ 
Drawing some objects
 ✓ 
Editing those objects
 ✓ 
Zooming and panning so that you can view those objects better
 ✓ 
Plotting (printing) the drawing
Much of the stuff in this chapter may be mysterious to you. Don’t worry — I 
tell you where to look for more information on specific topics. In this chapter, 
you’re simply taking AutoCAD out for a test drive to get a feel for what it can 
do. Go ahead and kick the tires — and don’t worry about putting a dent in the 
fender!
In this chapter, you create a drawing of an architectural detail — a base plate 
and column, as shown in Figure 3-1. Even if you don’t work in architecture or 
building construction, this exercise gives you some simple shapes to work 
with and demonstrates commands you can use in most drafting disciplines.

54
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Throughout this book, I show AutoCAD running in the Ribbon-based 2D 
Drafting & Annotation workspace, introduced in AutoCAD 2009 and present 
in both AutoCAD 2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011. Likewise, I tell you where to 
find commands and what to select using the Ribbon.
 
If you’re familiar with earlier versions of AutoCAD and the new user interface 
looks just too weird, you can strap on some training wheels while you’re get-
ting used to it. Just click the down arrow at the right end of the Quick Access 
Toolbar (by default, it appears to the right of the Plot button; the Plot button 
looks like an ordinary desktop printer) and choose Show Menu Bar. If you’re 
really and truly a Luddite where the Ribbon is concerned, you can revert to 
the “classic” way of doing things by either opening the Workspace drop-down 
on the Quick Access Toolbar, or by selecting the Workspace Switching button 
on the status bar and choosing AutoCAD Classic (AutoCAD LT Classic in that 
version). Presto change-o — suddenly, it’s 2008!
Although the drafting example in this chapter is simple, the procedures that 
it demonstrates are real, honest-to-CAD-ness, proper drafting practice. I 
emphasize from the beginning the importance of proper drawing setup, put-
ting objects on appropriate layers, and drawing and editing with due concern 
for precision. Some of the steps in this chapter may seem a bit complicated 
at first, but they reflect the way that experienced AutoCAD users work. My 
goal is to help you develop good CAD habits and do things the right way from 
the very start.

How base is 
my plate.
 

55
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
The step-by-step procedures in this chapter, unlike those in most chapters of 
this book, form a sequence. You must do the steps in order. Figuring out how 
to use AutoCAD is a little like figuring out how to drive, except that with 
AutoCAD, you’re free to stop in the middle of the street and take a break.
 
If you find that object selection or editing functions work differently from how 
I describe them in this chapter, you or someone else probably changed the 
configuration settings on the Option dialog box’s Selection tab. Chapter 10 
describes these settings and how to restore the AutoCAD defaults.
A Simple Setup
In this chapter, I walk you through creating, editing, viewing, and plotting 
a new drawing — refer to Figure 3-1 if you want to get an idea of what the 
finished product looks like. You can follow these steps using either imperial 
or metric units; I show metric values in brackets after the imperial ones, like 
this: Type 1.5 [38] and press Enter.
 
Pay attention to AutoCAD’s feedback. Glance at the messages AutoCAD sends 
after each step via the command window at the bottom of the screen or the 
Dynamic Input tooltip near the crosshairs so that you can begin to get familiar 
with the names of commands and their options. (If you don’t see any messages 
next to the crosshairs when you use the program, click the Dynamic Input 
button on the status bar — if your status bar displays button icons rather than 
text labels, click the button with the tooltip that reads “Dynamic Input.”)
As I describe in Chapter 4, drawing setup isn’t a simple task in AutoCAD. 
Nonetheless, drawing setup is an important part of the job, and if you don’t 
get in the habit of doing it right, you run into endless problems later on — 
especially when you try to plot. (See Chapter 16 for the lowdown on plotting 
your drawings.) In this first set of steps, you create a new drawing from a 
template, change some settings to establish a 1:10 (that is, 1 inch or 1 mil-
limeter on the drawing is equivalent to 10 inches or 10 millimeters on the real 
object) scale, and save the drawing:
 
1. Start AutoCAD by double-clicking its shortcut on the Windows desktop.
 
 If you don’t have an AutoCAD shortcut on your desktop, choose 
Start➪All Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2011➪AutoCAD 2011. (The 
last two will be AutoCAD LT 2011, if that’s your version.)
 
 The workspaces in AutoCAD 2011 look very similar to one another. 
To make sure you’re in the same workspace that I am, look at the 
Workspace label at the left side of the AutoCAD window’s title bar. If it 
doesn’t say 2D Drafting & Annotation, click the little black arrow on the 
button and then select 2D Drafting & Annotation from the menu.

56
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
2. Click the Application button to display the Application Menu. Then, 
click New, or hover the mouse pointer over New and select Drawing.
 
 Don’t click the New button on the Quick Access Toolbar — use the 
menu. I explain why in Chapter 4, but just humor me for now. The Select 
Template dialog box appears with a list of drawing templates (DWT 
files), which you can use as the starting point for new drawings. Chapter 
4 describes how to create and use drawing templates.
 3. 
Select acad.dwt [acadiso.dwt], as shown in Figure 3-2, and click 
Open. (For AutoCAD LT, select acadlt.dwt [acadltiso.dwt].)
 
 AutoCAD creates a new, blank drawing that uses the settings in acad.
dwt or acadiso.dwt. The acad.dwt template (acadlt.dwt in 
AutoCAD LT) is AutoCAD’s default, plain-Jane template for drawings in 
imperial units (units expressed in inches and/or feet). The acadiso.dwt 
(acadltiso.dwt in AutoCAD LT) template is the corresponding ver-
sion for drawings created in metric units. Chapter 4 contains additional 
information about these and other templates.

new draw-
ing from a 
template.
 
 
4. Click all the buttons on the left half of the status bar except Dynamic 
Input until they look like they’re turned off. If your status bar displays 
button icons rather than text labels, click the button with the dynamic 
input tooltip.

57
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
 Some of these settings can make selecting points difficult. It’s best to 
start with them all turned off and then toggle them on and off as needed. 
I tell you which ones to use in the steps that follow. I start you off with 
Dynamic Input enabled, but you’ll turn it off before you actually draw 
anything.
 
 If your status bar buttons show icons instead of text, right-click any 
button, click Use Icons to deselect the option and display text labels. 
You can leave them that way or right-click and select Use Icons again to 
toggle the icon display back on.
 5. 
Type LIMITS and press Enter.
 
 Drawing limits define your working area. AutoCAD prompts you to reset 
the model space limits. For now, ignore the dynamic input tooltip next 
to the crosshairs and look at the command window. The command line 
reads
Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>:
 
6. Press Enter to keep 0,0 as the lower-left corner value.
 
 AutoCAD prompts for the upper-right corner. The command line reads
Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000> [<420.0000,297.0000>]:
 7. 
Type 100,50 [2750,1250] (no spaces) and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD echoes the values you enter at the command line.
 
 100 x 50 corresponds to 10 inches by 5 inches (a little smaller than an 
8.5-x-11-inch piece of paper turned on its long side) times a drawing 
scale factor of 10 (because you’re eventually going to plot at 1:10 scale). 
If you’re a metric maven, 2750 x 1250 corresponds to 275 mm by 125 
mm (slightly smaller than an ISO A4 sheet turned lengthways) times a 
drawing scale factor of 10 (because you, too, will eventually plot at 1:10 
scale). See Chapter 4 for more information about drawing scales.
 
 To be honest, setting limits isn’t very important in AutoCAD anymore — 
modern computers can process much more data than they could in the 
1980s when AutoCAD first appeared — but it does make it easier to plot 
a drawing from model space as you do in this chapter. I give you the low-
down on limits in Chapter 4.
 
8. Right-click the Snap Mode button on the AutoCAD status bar and 
choose Settings. If your status bar displays button icons rather than 
text labels, right-click the button with the Snap Mode tooltip.
 
 The Snap and Grid tab of the Drafting Settings dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 3-3. (Note that AutoCAD LT lacks some options that are 
present in the full version of AutoCAD.)

9. Change the values in the dialog box so it looks like Figure 3-3:
 • 
Snap On: Selected
 
 Snap constrains your crosshairs to moving in an invisible grid of 
equally spaced points (0.5 [10] units apart in this case).
 • 
Grid On: Selected
 
 Grid displays a visible grid of little dots or grid lines on the screen 
(5 [100] units apart in this case), which you can use as reference 
points. The grid doesn’t appear on printed drawings.
 • 
Snap X Spacing: 0.5 [10]
 • 
Snap Y Spacing: 0.5 [10]
 • 
Grid X Spacing: 5 [100]
 • 
Grid Y Spacing: 5 [100]
 • 
Display dotted grid in 2D model space: Selected
 10. 
Click OK.
 
 You see some grid dots, 5 [100] units apart, in the drawing area. If you 
move your mouse around and watch the coordinate display area at the 
left side of the status bar, you notice that the values change in 0.5-unit 
[10-unit] increments.
 
11. Click the tiny down arrow below the Zoom button (the one with the

ing area in Figure 3-1), then choose Zoom All from the menu.
 
 AutoCAD zooms out so that the entire area defined by the limits is visible.

12. Click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+S.
 
 Because you haven’t saved the drawing yet, AutoCAD opens the Save 
Drawing As dialog box.
 
13. Navigate to a suitable folder by choosing from the Save In drop-down 
list and/or double-clicking folders in the list of folders below it.
 
 Remember where you save the file so you can go back to it later.
 
14. Type a name in the File Name text box and click Save.
 
 For example, type Detail or My Plate is Base.
 
 Depending on your Windows Explorer settings, you may or may not see 
the .dwg extension in the File Name text box. In any case, you don’t 
need to type it. AutoCAD adds it for you.
 
 AutoCAD saves the new DWG file to the folder you specified in Step 13.
Whew — that was more work than digging a post hole — and all just to set up 
a simple drawing! Chapter 4 goes into more detail about drawing setup and 
describes why all these gyrations are necessary.
Drawing a (Base) Plate
With a properly set-up drawing, you’re ready to draw some objects. In this 
example, you use the RECTANG command to draw a steel base plate and 
column, the CIRCLE command to draw an anchor bolt, and the POLYGON 
command to draw a hexagonal nut. (Both the RECTANG and POLYGON com-
mands create polylines — objects that contain a series of straight-line seg-
ments and/or arc segments.) I describe these drawing commands in more 
detail in Chapters 8 and 9.
AutoCAD, like most CAD programs, uses layers as an organizing principle for 
all the objects that you draw. Chapter 6 describes layers and other object 
properties in detail. In this example, you create separate layers for the base 
plate, column, anchor bolts, and nuts. This might seem like layer madness, 
but when you’re doing complex drawings, you need to use a lot of layers just 
to keep things organized.
Drawing rectangles on the right layers
The following steps demonstrate how to create and use layers, as well as 
how to draw rectangles. You also see how to apply fillets to objects and 
offset them. (Chapter 6 describes layers in detail, and Chapter 8 covers the 
RECTANG command. Chapter 11 explains the FILLET and OFFSET 

60
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
commands.) Start by creating a Column layer and a Plate layer and then 
drawing a rectangular column on the Column layer and a square base plate 
on the Plate layer:
 
1. Make sure that you complete the drawing setup in the previous sec-
tion of this chapter and have the drawing open in AutoCAD.
 
2. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.
 
 You’ll find the most frequently used commands for 2D drafting tasks on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab. (For a refresher on the contents of the other 
tabs, check out Chapter 2.) Unless I direct you otherwise, look on the 
Home tab for the panels and buttons I specify in the following steps.
 
3. On the Layers panel, click the Layer Properties button.
 
 The Layer Properties button is at the upper-left corner of the Layers 
panel. The LAYER command starts, and AutoCAD displays the Layer 
Properties Manager palette.
 
4. Click the New Layer button.
 
 AutoCAD adds a new layer to the list and gives it the default name 
Layer1 (see Figure 3-4).
 
Figure 3-4: 
Creating a 
new layer.
 
 
5. Type a more suitable name for the layer on which you’ll draw the 
column and press Enter.
 
 For this example, type Column.
 
6. Click the color swatch or name (white) in the Column layer row.
 
 The Select Color dialog box appears (see Figure 3-5).
 
7. Click color 5 (blue) in the single, separate row to the left of the 
ByLayer and ByBlock buttons, and then click OK.
 
 The Select Color dialog box closes, and AutoCAD changes the color of 
the Column layer to blue.

61
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track

Blue is the 
color — 
select it 
from the 
standard 
color tiles.
 
 
8. With the Layer Properties Manager still open, repeat Steps 4 through 7 
to create a new layer named Plate and set its color to 4 (cyan).
 
9. With layer Plate still highlighted, click the Set Current button (the 
green check mark).
 
 Plate becomes the current layer, and everything you draw is placed on 
that layer until you set a different layer current.
 
10. Click Close (the “X” at the top-left corner of the palette in Figure 3-4) 
to close the Layer Properties Manager palette.
 
 The Layer drop-down list on the Home tab’s Layers panel displays Plate 
as the current layer. Now you can draw a rectangular plate on the Plate 
layer.
 
 You probably already know that the RECTANG command will draw a 
rectangular plate for you, but for the next step, pretend you don’t.
 
11. Click the Application button, click inside the Search edit box at the 
top of the Application Menu, and start typing RECT. . .
 
 As you type into the Search box, AutoCAD guesses what you might be 
looking for. When you’ve typed enough letters, the command you’re 
probably looking for appears at or near the top of the Application Menu.
 
12. When “Rectangle” appears in the Search results, simply click the com-
mand item.
 
 The RECTANG command starts, and AutoCAD prompts you to specify 
the first corner point. The command line shows
Specify first corner point or [Chamfer/Elevation/Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
 
13. Click in the drawing area at the point 32,7 [800,175].
 
 By watching the coordinate display on the Dynamic Input tooltip, you 
can see the coordinates of the current crosshairs location. Because 

62
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Snap Mode is set to 0.5 [10] units, you can land right on the point 32,7 
[800,175]. Picking the first corner in this location gives you enough room 
to work.
 
 AutoCAD prompts at the command line
Specify other corner point or [Area/Dimensions/Rotation]:
 14. 
Type 36,36 [900,900] (without any spaces) and press Enter.
 
 Make sure that the Dynamic Input button is on for this step. If it’s not, 
AutoCAD treats an input of 36,36 as absolute coordinates — that is, 36 
units above and 36 units to the right of the origin. When dynamic input is 
on, an input of 36,36 is treated as 36 units above and 36 units to the right 
of the last point — in other words, as relative to the last point. See Chapter 
7 for more information about typing absolute and relative coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD draws the 36 x 36 [900 x 900] rectangle, as shown in Figure 3-6. 
It’s on the Plate layer and inherits that layer’s cyan color.
 
 You draw the column next, but first you have to change layers.
 
15. On the Layers panel of the Home tab, click the Layer drop-down list to 
display the list of layers. Click Column to set it as the current layer.
 
 Using the Layer drop-down list saves you from having to open the Layer 
Properties Manager, select the layer, and click the Set Current button. 
Becoming an AutoCAD master is all about efficiency!

16. Right-click in an empty area of the screen to display the shortcut 
menu. Choose Recent Input, then click RECTANG to draw another 
rectangle.
 
 In the next steps, you create a hollow steel column.
 
17. At the Specify First Corner Point prompt, type 44,16 [1100,400] and 
press Enter.
 
18. At the Specify Other Corner Point prompt, type 12,18 [300,450] and 
press Enter.
 
 A second rectangle is drawn in the middle of the base plate.
 
 Next, you round the corners of the column with the FILLET command 
and then use OFFSET to give it some thickness.
 
19. On the Home tab’s Modify panel, click the Fillet button.
 
 The FILLET command starts, and AutoCAD prompts you to select the 
first object. Look at the command line to see the options for this com-
mand. In the next step, you specify a 2-inch [50 mm] radius fillet to all 
four corners.
 20. 
Type R and press Enter to set a new fillet radius. Type 2 [50] and press 
Enter.
 
 AutoCAD again prompts you to select the first object. You could pick 
each of the lines at each corner that need to be filleted (that’s eight 
picks), but because the column is a continuous polyline, in this case a 
more efficient method is to use the FILLET command’s Polyline option to 
fillet all four corners in one fell swoop.
 21. 
Type P to choose the Polyline option, and then press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select a 2D polyline.
 
22. Select the rectangle you drew in Steps 16 to 18.
 
 All four corners of the column are rounded with a 2-inch [50-mm] radius 
fillet.
 
 Next, offset the polyline to create a 3/4-inch [19 mm] thick steel column.
 
23. On the Modify panel, click the Offset button.
 
24. At the Specify Offset Distance prompt, type .75 [19] and press Enter.
 
25. At the Select Object to Offset prompt, click the rounded rectangle. At 
the Specify Point on Side to Offset prompt, click anywhere inside the 
rounded rectangle. Press Enter to complete the command.
 
 AutoCAD offsets the selected object toward the inside of the rounded 
rectangle (see Figure 3-7).

64
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 Make sure your Object Snap status bar button is toggled off for this step, 
or AutoCAD may offset your object back on top of itself.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Give it 
some thick-
ness with 
OFFSET.
 
Select the object here.
Pick here to show offset directions.
 
26. Click the Dynamic Input button on the status bar so the button looks 
turned off.
 
 Now that you’ve given Dynamic Input a test drive, turn it off for the rest 
of this chapter. You know how to turn it off and on, and if you like it, by 
all means, turn it on again for the remainder of the book. Personally, I 
think that it gets in the way too much to be truly useful, so I rarely use it.
 
27. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
 
 AutoCAD saves the drawing and renames the previously saved version 
drawingname.bak — for example, My Plate is Base.bak. .bak is 
AutoCAD’s extension for a backup file.
Circling your plate
You can use the CIRCLE command to draw a 1 1/2-inch diameter anchor bolt 
on an Anchor Bolts layer by following these steps:
 
1. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 in the previous section to create a new layer 
for the anchor bolts. Give the layer the name Anchor Bolts, assign it 
the color 3 (green), set it as the current layer, and then close the Layer 
Properties Manager.

65
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
 The Layer drop-down on the Layers panel displays Anchor Bolts as the 
current layer.
 
2. On the Home tab’s Draw panel, click the Circle button.
 
 The CIRCLE command starts, and AutoCAD prompts you to specify the 
center point. The command line shows:
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan radius)]:
 
3. Click in the drawing area at point 38,13 [950,325].
 
 AutoCAD asks you to specify the size of the circle. The command line 
shows:
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
 
 You decide that you want 1 1/2-inch [38 mm] diameter anchor bolts. 
AutoCAD is asking for a radius. Although you can probably figure out 
the radius of a 1 1/2-inch [38 mm] diameter circle, specify the Diameter 
option and let AutoCAD do the hard work.
 4. 
Type D and press Enter to select the Diameter option.
  
AutoCAD prompts:
Specify diameter of circle:
 5. 
Type 1.5 [38] and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD draws the 1 1/2-inch [38 mm] diameter circle. It’s on the 
Anchor Bolts layer and inherits that layer’s green color (see Figure 3-8).
 
6. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
 
Figure 3-8:

Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Placing your polygon
Every good bolt deserves a nut. Use the POLYGON command to draw a hex-
agonal shape on a Nuts layer (well, what else would you call it?). Besides 
showing you how to draw polygons, these steps introduce you to a couple of 
AutoCAD’s more useful precision techniques: object snaps and Ortho Mode.
 
1. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 in the “Drawing rectangles on the right 
layers” section, earlier in this chapter, to create a new layer for the 
nuts and set it as the current layer. Give the layer the name Nuts and 
assign it the color 1 (red).
 
 The Layer drop-down list displays Nuts as the current layer.
 
 You don’t have to create a separate layer for every type of object that 
you draw. For example, you could draw both the anchor bolts and nuts 
on a layer called Hardware. Layer names and usage depend on industry 
and office practices in addition to a certain amount of individual judg-
ment. Having too many layers is better than having too few because 
lumping two or more layers together is much easier than dividing the 
objects on one layer into two or more layers.
 
 The Ribbon’s standard panels aren’t big enough to contain a button for 
every command, so AutoCAD hides the ones that don’t fit in slideout 
panels that you open by clicking the panel label. A small down-pointing 
triangle beside the panel name means there’s a slideout with more com-
mands available.
 
2. Click the Draw panel’s label to open the panel slideout. On the Draw 
panel slideout, click the Polygon button — the one that looks like a 
plan of the Pentagon.
 
 The POLYGON command starts, and AutoCAD prompts you to:
Enter number of sides <4>:
 
 Peek ahead to Figure 3-9 in order to get an idea of how the nut will look 
after you draw it. Four-sided nuts can be a little difficult to adjust in the 
real world, so I stick with the conventional hexagonal sort.
 3. 
Type 6 and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD next prompts you for the center of the polygon:
Specify center of polygon or [Edge]: 
 
 In the next steps, you use one of AutoCAD’s precision drafting modes: 
Object Snap. I explain object snaps in detail in Chapter 7, but for now, 
just follow along here.
 
4. Click the Object Snap button on the status bar to turn on Object Snap 
mode. When Object Snap is enabled, the command prompt shows 
<Osnap on>.

67
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
Figure 3-9: 
Bolts and 
nuts . . . 
ready to 
anchor.
 
 
 As you move the crosshairs around near the anchor bolt, notice that 
AutoCAD tends to pull the crosshairs to certain points on existing 
objects.
 
5. Move the crosshairs over the anchor bolt you just drew.
 
 A tooltip should show Center and pull the crosshairs to the center of 
the anchor bolt circle. If you don’t see a Center object snap marker or 
tooltip, then right-click the Object Snap button and click Center. You 
may also see tracking vectors across the screen from this point — you 
can ignore those.
 
6. Click when the tooltip reads Center — not Center-Intersection or 
something similar — just Center.
 
 The POLYGON command draws regular closed polygons based on an 
imaginary circle; the center of this imaginary circle is the point you just 
picked.
  
AutoCAD prompts:
Enter an option [Inscribed in circle/Circumscribed about circle] <I>:
 
7. Press Enter to accept the default Inscribed in Circle option.
 
 The Inscribed option draws a polygon whose corners touch the circum-
ference of the imaginary circle. The Circumscribed option draws a poly-
gon whose sides are tangent to the circumference of the circle.
 
 AutoCAD then asks you to:
Specify radius of circle:

68
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
8. Turn on Ortho Mode by clicking the Ortho Mode button on the status 
bar until you see <Ortho on> on the command line.
 
 Ortho mode forces the crosshairs to move orthogonally — that is in a 
precise horizontal or vertical direction. I describe Ortho mode more 
fully in Chapter 7.
 
9. Move the mouse to the right so the top and bottom sides of the poly-
gon are horizontal, but don’t click yet!
 10. 
Type 1.5 [38] and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD draws the nut, as shown in Figure 3-9. It’s on the Nuts layer 
and inherits that layer’s red color.
 
 If your nut-and-bolt looks just like Figure 3-9, way to go — you did it 
right! If, by chance, your bolt is completely inside the circle, you prob-
ably missed Step 4 of the “Circling your plate” section, earlier in this 
chapter, where I tell you to use the CIRCLE command’s Diameter option.
 
11. Turn off Ortho mode and object snaps by clicking the Ortho Mode and 
Object Snap buttons on the status bar until they look dimmed and you 
see <Ortho off> and <Osnap off> on the command line.
 
 Occasionally, Ortho Mode and object snaps interfere with drafting in 
AutoCAD. Disabling them as you do in this step keeps them from being a 
problem.
 
12. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
Not much of a base plate yet, is it? But don’t worry — I cover creating more 
nuts and bolts with editing commands in the section “Modifying to Make It 
Merrier,” later in this chapter. If your brain is feeling full, now is a good time 
to take a break and go look out the window. If you exit AutoCAD, just restart 
the program and reopen your drawing when you’re ready to continue.
Getting a Closer Look with Zoom and Pan
The example drawing in this chapter is pretty uncluttered and small, but 
most real CAD drawings are neither of those. Technical drawings are usually 
jam-packed with lines, text, and dimensions. CAD drawings often get plotted 
on sheets of paper that measure two to three feet on a side — that’s in the 
hundreds of millimeters, if you’re a metric maven. Anyone who owns a moni-
tor that large probably can afford to hire a whole room of drafters and, there-
fore, isn’t reading this book. You need to zoom and pan in your drawings — a 
lot. I cover zooming and panning in detail in Chapter 12. Quick definitions 
should suffice for now:

69
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 ✓ 
Zoom means changing the magnification of the display. When you zoom 
in, you move closer to the drawing objects so you can see detail, and 
when you zoom out, you move farther away so you can see more of the 
drawing area.
 ✓ 
Pan means moving from one area to another without changing the 
magnification. If you’ve used the scroll bars in any application, you’ve 
panned the display.
Zooming and panning frequently lets you see the details better, draw more 
confidently (because you can see what you’re doing), and edit more quickly 
(because object selection is easier when a zillion objects aren’t on the 
screen).
Fortunately, zooming and panning in AutoCAD is as simple as it is necessary. 
The following steps describe how to use AutoCAD’s Zoom and Pan Realtime 
feature, which is pretty easy to operate and provides a lot of flexibility. 
Chapter 12 covers additional zoom and pan options.
To zoom and pan in your drawing, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click in a blank area of the drawing and choose Zoom from the 
shortcut (right-click) menu.
 
 The Realtime option of the ZOOM command starts. The crosshairs 
change to a magnifying glass, and AutoCAD prompts you at the com-
mand line:
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display shortcut menu.
 
2. Move the crosshairs near the middle of the screen, press and hold the 
left mouse button, and drag the crosshairs up and down until the base 
plate almost fills the screen.
 
 As you can see, dragging up increases the zoom magnification, and drag-
ging down decreases it.
 
3. Right-click in the drawing area to display the Zoom/Pan Realtime 
menu, as shown in Figure 3-10, and choose Pan from the menu.
 
 The magnifying-glass mouse pointer changes to a hand.
 
Figure 3-10:

Pan 
Realtime 
shortcut 
menu.
 

70
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
4. Click and drag to pan the drawing until the plate is more or less cen-
tered in the drawing area.
 
 You’re not moving the plate, although it may look like it. You’re moving 
your viewing position while the plate stays put. Never move drawing 
objects if you just want to view them from a different position.
 
 You can use the shortcut menu to toggle back and forth between Zoom 
and Pan as many times as you like. If you get lost, choose Zoom Original 
or Zoom Extents to return to a recognizable view.
 
5. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Exit from the Zoom/Pan 
Realtime menu.
 
 The hand pointer returns to the normal AutoCAD crosshairs.
Modifying to Make It Merrier
When you have a better view of your base plate (which I talk about in the 
preceding section), you can edit the objects on it more easily. In the fol-
lowing sections, you use the ARRAY command to add more anchor bolts, 
the STRETCH command to change the shape of the plate, and the HATCH 
command to add crosshatching to the column. As always, I cover these com-
mands in detail later in the book.
Hooray for array
Using the ARRAY command is a great way to generate a bunch of new objects 
from existing objects at regular angles or spacing. The array pattern can be 
either rectangular (that is, columns and rows of objects) or polar (in a circle 
around a center point, like the spokes of a wheel around its hub). In this 
example, you use a rectangular array to create three additional anchor bolts:
 
1. On the Home tab’s Modify panel, click the Array button — the one 
with four squares.
 
 The ARRAY command starts, and AutoCAD displays the Array dialog box.
 
2. Select the Rectangular Array radio button.
 
3. Click the Select Objects button.
 
 The Array dialog box temporarily disappears, and AutoCAD prompts 
you to select objects.
 
4. Turn off Snap mode by clicking the its button on the status bar until it 
looks dimmed and you see <Snap off> on the command line.
 
 Turning off Snap mode temporarily makes selecting objects easier.

71
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
5. Click the anchor bolt and then click the nut.
 
 If you encounter any problems while trying to select objects, press 
the Esc key a couple of times to cancel the command; then restart the 
ARRAY command and try again.
 
 AutoCAD continues to prompt you at the command line:
Select objects: 1 found, 2 total
 
6. Press Enter or right-click to end object selection.
 
 The Array dialog box reappears.
 
7. Click inside the Rows text box and set the value to 2. Press Tab to 
move to the Columns text box and set the value to 2.
 
 The source object is included in AutoCAD arrays. The preview shows 
that you’ve set up a rectangular array of four evenly spaced objects (see 
Figure 3-11).
 
Figure 3-11: 
The Array 
dialog box, 
ready to bolt 
your base 
plate.
 
 
8. In the Row Offset text box, type 24 [600]. Click inside the Column 
Offset text box and type 24 [600].
 
 A rectangular array creates regularly spaced rows and columns. The 
Row Offset is the vertical distance separating the rows; Column Offset is 
the horizontal distance separating columns.
 
9. Click the Preview button.
 
 AutoCAD shows you what the array will look like if you accept the cur-
rent settings. You can pan or zoom within Preview mode if you need a 
bigger or a more detailed view.
 
10. If anything looks wrong, click the Esc key, make changes, and preview 
again. When everything looks good, right-click to accept the array.
 
 AutoCAD adds the additional objects to the drawing, as shown in 
Figure 3-12.

Perfect! Except that nutbar engineer has decided the column needs to be 
18 x 18 inches [450 x 450 mm] instead of 12 x 18 inches [300 x 450 mm — 
unfortunately, there are just as many metric nutbars as imperial ones]. And 
that means the base plate is too small, and the anchor bolts are in the wrong 
place, too. If you were working on the drawing board, you’d be getting out an 
eraser and rubbing out all your efforts. AutoCAD to the rescue!
Stretching out
The STRETCH command is powerful but a little complicated — it can 
stretch or move objects, depending on how you select them. The key to 
using STRETCH is specifying a crossing selection box properly. (Chapter 10 
gives you more details about crossing boxes and how to use them with the 
STRETCH command.)

73
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
Follow these steps to stretch the column and base plate:
 
1. On the Modify panel, click the Stretch button — the one with the 
corner of a rectangle being stretched.
 
 The STRETCH command starts, and AutoCAD prompts you to select 
objects. This is one of those times (and one of those commands) that 
really does require you to look at the command line:
Select objects to stretch by crossing-window or 
crossing-polygon...
Select objects:
 
2. Click a point above and to the right of the upper-right corner of the 
plate (Point 1 in Figure 3-13).

74
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
3. Move the crosshairs down and to the left.
 
 The pointer changes to a dashed rectangle enclosing a rectangular green 
area, which indicates that you’re specifying a crossing box. AutoCAD 
prompts you at the command line:
Select objects: Specify opposite corner:
 
4. Click a point below the plate, roughly under the center of the column 
(Point 2 in Figure 3-13).
 
 The crossing box must cut through the plate and column in order for the 
STRETCH command to work (refer to Figure 3-13).
 
 AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Select objects: Specify opposite corner: 7 found
Select objects:
 
5. Press Enter to end object selection.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the base point.
 
6. If they’re not already on, turn on Snap Mode, Ortho Mode, and Object 
Snap by clicking their respective buttons on the status bar until they 
appear highlighted.
 
7. Click the lower-right corner of the plate.
 
 This point serves as the base point for the stretch operation. Chapter 11 
describes base points and displacements in greater detail.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you at the command line:
Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>:
 
8. Move the crosshairs to the right until the tooltip shows a displacement 
of 6 [150] units to the right, and then click in the drawing space (see 
Figure 3-14).
 
 AutoCAD stretches the column and plate by the distance that you indi-
cate and moves the anchor bolts that were completely inside the cross-
ing window rectangle, as shown in Figure 3-14.
 
 If your first stretch didn’t work right, hold down the Ctrl key, type Z, and 
try again. STRETCH is an immensely useful command — one that makes 
you wonder how drafters used to do it all with erasers and pencils — 
but it does take some practice to get the hang of those crossing boxes.

Crossing your hatches
Your final editing task is to add some crosshatching to the space between the 
inside and outside edges of the column to indicate that the drawing shows a 
section of the column. Follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off Snap, Ortho, and Object Snap Modes by clicking their respec-
tive buttons on the status bar until they look dimmed.
 
2. Repeat Steps 2 through 7 from the “Drawing rectangles on the right 
layers” section, earlier in this chapter, to create a new layer named 
Hatch. Set its color to 6 (magenta) and make it the current layer.
 
3. On the Home tab’s Draw panel, click the Hatch button — the one that 
shows the fine crosshatching inside a square.
 
 The Hatch Creation tab appears on the Ribbon. For more information on 
this tab and hatching, in general, see Chapter 15.
 
4. In the Hatch Creation tab’s Pattern area, click the Hatch Pattern 
button and select ANSI31.

 As you move your mouse over the drawing objects, a live preview shows 
you the result if you click at the current crosshair position. AutoCAD 
prompts

 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
After some drawing and editing, you may wonder how you’re supposed to 
know when to turn off or on the various status bar modes (Snap, Grid, Ortho, 
Object Snap, and so on). You’ll start to get an instinctive sense of when each 
mode is useful and when it gets in the way. In subsequent chapters of this 
book, I give you some more specific guidelines.
Following the Plot
Looking at drawings on a computer screen and exchanging them with others 
via e-mail or Web sites is all well and good. But sooner or later, someone — 
maybe you! — will want to see a printed version. Printing drawings — or plot-
ting, as CAD geeks like to call it — is much more complicated than printing 
a word-processing document or a spreadsheet. That’s because you have to 
worry about things such as drawing scale, lineweights, title blocks, and weird 
paper sizes. I go deeper into plotting in Chapter 16, but this section gives you 
an abbreviated procedure that can help you generate a recognizable printed 
drawing.
 
The following steps show you how to plot the model space portion of the draw-
ing. As Chapter 5 describes, AutoCAD includes a sophisticated feature — paper 
space layouts — for creating arrangements of your drawing that you plot. These 
arrangements usually include a title block. Because I promised you a gentle 
tour of AutoCAD drafting functions, I left the paper space layout and title block 
issues until a bit later. When you’re ready for the whole plotting enchilada, 
turn to Chapter 5 for information about how to set up paper space layouts and 
see Chapter 16 for full plotting instructions.
Follow these steps to plot a drawing:
 
1. Click the Plot button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
 
 The Quick Access Toolbar is at the left end of the program’s title bar, 
just to the right of the Application button. The Plot icon looks like an 
ordinary desktop printer.
 
 AutoCAD opens the Plot-Model dialog box, with the title bar showing 
what you’re plotting (model space, in this case).
 
2. Click the More Options button (in the bottom-right corner of the 
dialog box, next to the Help button).
 
 The Plot dialog box reveals additional settings, as shown in Figure 3-16.
 
3. In the Printer/Plotter area, select a printer from the Name list.
 
4. In the Paper Size area, use the drop-down list to select a paper size 
that’s loaded in your printer or plotter.
 
 Anything Letter size (8 1/2 x 11 inches) [A4 (210 x 297 mm)] or larger 
works for this example.

78
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
Figure 3-16: 
The Plot dia-
log box with 
the More

area visible.
 
 
5. In the Plot Area, select Limits from the drop-down list.
 
 This is the entire drawing area, which you specified when you set up the 
drawing in the section “A Simple Setup,” earlier in this chapter.
 
6. In the Plot Offset area, select the Center the Plot check box.
 
 Alternatively, you can specify offsets of 0 or other amounts in order to 
position the plot at a specific location on the paper.
 
7. In the Plot Scale area, deselect the Fit to Paper check box and choose 
1:10 from the Scale drop-down list.
 
 1:10 is the scale used to set up the drawing (which I explain in the sec-
tion “A Simple Setup,” earlier in this chapter). No prizes for guessing the 
metric equivalent of 1:10!
 
8. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area, click the drop-down 
list and choose monochrome.ctb.
  
The monochrome.ctb plot style table ensures that all your lines appear 
solid black, rather than as different colors or weird shades of gray. See 
Chapter 16 for information about plot style tables, and monochrome and 
color plotting.
 
9. Click Yes when a question dialog box appears, asking Assign This Plot 
Style Table to All Layouts?
 
 You can leave the remaining settings at their default values (refer to 
Figure 3-16).

79
 Chapter 3: A Lap around the CAD Track
 
 Some printers let you print closer to the edges of the sheet than others. 
To find out the actual printable area of your own printer, move the 
mouse pointer to the postage stamp–sized partial preview in the middle 
of the Plot dialog box and pause. A tooltip appears, listing the Paper Size 
and Printable Area for the printer and paper size that you selected.
 
10. Click the Preview button.
 
 If the plot scale you entered in the Plot dialog box is out of sync with 
the drawing’s annotation scale, a Plot Scale Confirm dialog box appears, 
advising you that the annotation scale isn’t equal to the plot scale. This 
drawing doesn’t contain any text or dimensions, and I didn’t bother 
making the hatch annotative, so it’s fine to click Continue and generate 
the plot.
 
 Annotative scaling controls the printed size of text, dimensions, hatch-
ing, and other types of annotation objects at plot time — as long as the 
drawing’s annotation scale matches the plot scale. I explain annotative 
objects in Chapter 13.
 
 The Plot dialog box disappears temporarily, and AutoCAD shows how 
the plot will look on paper. In addition, AutoCAD prompts you on the 
status bar:
Press pick button and drag vertically to zoom, ESC or ENTER to exit, or 
right-click to display shortcut menu.
 
11. Right-click in the preview area and choose Exit.
 
12. If the preview doesn’t look right, adjust the settings in the Plot dialog 
box and look at the preview again until it looks right.
 13. 
Click OK.
 
 The Plot Scale Confirm dialog box pops up again. You may be tempted to 
click Always Continue Under These Conditions, but I recommend against 
that until you’ve gained a little familiarity with annotative objects.
 
 The Plot dialog box closes. AutoCAD generates the plot and sends it 
to the printer. After generating the plot, AutoCAD displays a Plot and 
Publish Job Complete balloon notification from the right end of the 
status bar. (A Click to View Plot and Publish Details link displays more 
information about the plot job.)
 
14. Click the X (Close) button in the Plot and Publish Job Complete bal-
loon notification.
 
 The balloon notification disappears.

 If you’re not happy with the lineweights of the lines on your plot at this 
point, fear not. You can use the lineweights feature (Chapter 6) or plot 
styles (Chapter 16) to control plotted lineweights.
 
15. Press Ctrl+S to save the drawing.
Congratulations! You successfully executed your first plot in AutoCAD. 
Chapter 16 tells you more — much more — about AutoCAD’s highly flexible 
but occasionally perplexing plotting system.

Setup for Success
In This Chapter
▶ Developing a setup strategy
▶ Starting a new drawing
▶ Setting up model space
▶ Creating and using drawing templates
S
urprisingly, drawing setup is one of the trickier aspects of using 
AutoCAD. It’s an easy thing to do incompletely or incorrectly, and 
AutoCAD 2011 doesn’t provide a simple, one-click tool to help you do all of it 
right. And yet, drawing setup is a crucial thing to get right. Setup steps that 
you omit or don’t do right may come back to bite you later.
Sloppy setup really becomes apparent when you try to plot (print) your draw-
ing. Things that seemed more or less okay as you zoomed around on the 
screen are suddenly the wrong size or scale on paper. And nothing brands 
someone as a naive AutoCAD wannabe as quickly as the inability to plot 
a drawing at the right size and scale. Chapter 5 covers plotting setup pro-
cedures, but the information in this chapter is a necessary prerequisite to 
successful plotting and sheet setup. If you don’t get this stuff right, there’s a 
good chance you’ll find that . . . the plot sickens.
This chapter describes the decisions you need to make before you set up a 
new drawing, shows the steps for doing a complete and correct setup, and 
demonstrates how to save setup settings for reuse.
 
Don’t assume that you can just create a new blank DWG file and start drawing 
things. Do read this chapter before you get too deep into the later chapters in 
this book. Many AutoCAD drawing commands and concepts depend on proper 
drawing setup, so you’ll have a much easier time drawing and editing things 
if you’ve done your setup homework. A few minutes invested in setting up a 
drawing well can save hours of thrashing around later on.

82
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
After you’ve digested the detailed drawing setup procedures described in 
this and the following chapter, use the AutoCAD Drawing Setup Roadmap on 
the Cheat Sheet (which you can find on this book’s companion Web site at 
www.dummies.com/go/cheatsheet/autocad2011) as a quick reference 
to guide you through the process.
A Setup Roadmap
You have to set up AutoCAD correctly, partly because AutoCAD is so flexible 
and partly because, well, you’re doing CAD — computer-aided drafting (or 
design). The computer can’t aid your drafting (or design) if you don’t clue it 
in on things like system of measure, drawing scale, paper size, and units. In 
this context, the following facts help explain why AutoCAD drawing setup is 
important:
 ✓ 
Electronic paper: The most important thing you can do to make using 
AutoCAD fun is to work on a correctly set up drawing so that your 
screen acts like paper, only smarter. When drawing on real paper, you 
constantly have to translate between units on the paper and the real-
life units of the object you’re drawing. But when drawing in AutoCAD’s 
smarter paper, you draw directly in real-life units — feet and inches, 
millimeters, or whatever you typically use on your projects. AutoCAD 
can then calculate distances and dimensions for you and add them to 
the drawing. You can make the mouse pointer jump directly to preset 
intervals on-screen, and a visible, resizable grid gives you a better sense 
of the scale of your drawing. However, this smart paper function works 
well only if you tell AutoCAD some crucial parameters for your specific 
drawing. AutoCAD can’t really do its job until you tell it how to work.
 ✓ 
Dead-trees paper: Creating a great drawing on-screen that doesn’t fit 
well on paper is all too easy. After you finish creating your drawing on 
the smart paper AutoCAD provides on-screen, you then usually have to 
plot it on the good, old-fashioned paper that people have used for thou-
sands of years. At that point, you must deal with the fact that people like 
to use certain standard paper sizes and drawing scales. (Most people 
also like everything to fit neatly on one sheet of paper.) If you set up 
AutoCAD correctly, good plotting results automatically; if not, plotting 
time can become one colossal hassle.
 ✓ 
It ain’t easy: AutoCAD provides templates and Setup Wizards for you, 
but the templates don’t work well unless you understand them, and 
some of the wizards don’t work well even if you do understand them. 
This deficiency is one of the major weaknesses in AutoCAD. You must 
figure out on your own (with the help of this book, of course) how to 
make the program work right. If you just plunge in without carefully 
setting up, your drawing and printing efforts are likely to wind up a real 
mess.

83
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
Fortunately, setting up AutoCAD correctly is a bit like following a roadmap 
to a new destination. Although the directions for performing your setup are 
complex, you can master them with attention and practice. Even more for-
tunately, this chapter provides a detailed and field-tested route. And soon, 
you’ll know the route like the back of your hand.
 
While you’re working in AutoCAD, always keep in mind what your final output 
should look like on real paper. Even your first printed drawings should look 
just like hand-drawn ones — only without all those eraser smudges.
Before you start the drawing setup process, you need to make decisions 
about your new drawing. The following four questions are absolutely critical; 
if you don’t answer them or your answers are wrong, you’ll probably need to 
rework the drawing later:
 ✓ 
What system of measure — metric or imperial — will you use?
 ✓ 
What drawing units will you use?
 ✓ 
At what scale — or scales — will you plot it?
 ✓ 
On what size paper does it need to fit?
In some cases, you can defer answering one additional question, but it’s usu-
ally better to deal with it up front: What kind of border or title block does 
your drawing require?
 
If you’re in a hurry, it’s tempting to find an existing drawing that was set up for 
the drawing scale and paper size that you want to use, make a copy of that 
DWG file, erase the objects, and start drawing. Use this approach with care, 
though. When you start from another drawing, you inherit any setup mistakes 
in that drawing. Also, drawings that were created in much older versions of 
AutoCAD may not take advantage of current program features and CAD prac-
tices. If you can find a suitable drawing that was set up in a recent version of 
AutoCAD by an experienced person who is conscientious about doing setup 
right, consider using it. Otherwise, you’re better off setting up a new drawing 
from scratch.
Choosing your units
AutoCAD is extremely flexible about drawing units; it lets you have them 
your way. Usually, you choose the type of units that you normally use to talk 
about whatever you’re drawing: feet and inches for a building in the United 
States, millimeters for a metric screw, and so on.
Speaking of millimeters, there’s another choice you have to make even before 
you choose your units of measure, and that’s your system of measure.

84
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Most of the world abandoned local systems of measure generations ago. Even 
widely adopted ones like the imperial system have mostly fallen by the way-
side, just like their driving force, the British Empire. Except, of course, in the 
United States, where feet, inches, pounds, gallons, and degrees Fahrenheit 
still rule.
During drawing setup, you choose settings for Length units (for measuring 
linear objects and distances) and Angle units (for measuring angles between 
nonparallel objects or points on arcs or circles) in the Drawing Units dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 4-1. (I show you how to specify these settings in the 
section “Setting your units,” later in this chapter.) The Length unit types are 
as follows:
 ✓ 
Architectural units are based in feet and inches and use fractions to rep-
resent partial inches.
 ✓ 
Decimal units are unitless — that is, they’re not based on any particular 
real-world unit. With decimal units, each unit in the drawing could rep-
resent an inch, a millimeter, a cubit (if you’re into building arks in case 
that rainy day should come), or any other unit of measure you deem 
suitable.
 ✓ 
Engineering units are based in feet and inches and use decimals to rep-
resent partial inches.
 ✓ 
Fractional units, like decimal units, are unitless and show values as frac-
tions rather than decimal numbers.
Enter the metric system
 . . . or, “Let’s forget everything we learned
 
about measuring stuff and start over again!” All 
(well, nearly all) the world is metric. Instead of a 
system of linear measure based on twelves, of  
volume measure based on sixteens, and of tem-
perature measure based on who knows what, 
metric bases all types of measure on tens. (Of 
course, For Dummies books are in the metric 
vanguard because every single For Dummies 
title includes a Part of Tens.)
The metric system first gained a toehold (ten 
toes, of course) in France during the Revolution. 
Over time, it became apparent that some
 
standardization was called for, and a mere
 
century and a half later, SI Metric became that  
standard. SI is short for Systeme International 
d’Unites. (That’s International System of Units  
in English. Isn’t it great to speak more than one  
language?)
The United States may be late coming to the 
party, but the U.S. federal government has made 
a commitment to adopt SI Metric. For more
 
information, point your browser to the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology’s Special 
Publication 814 (http://ts.nist.gov/
WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/
pub814.cfm).

85
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
 ✓ 
Scientific units are also unitless and show values as exponents, used for 
drawing really tiny or really large things. If you design molecules or gal-
axies, this is the unit type for you.
The Angle unit types are as follows:
 ✓ 
Decimal Degrees show angles as decimal numbers and are by far the 
easiest to work with — if your type of work allows it!
 ✓ 
Deg/Min/Sec is based on the old style of dividing a degree into minutes 
and minutes into seconds. But seconds aren’t fine enough to display 
AutoCAD’s precision capabilities, so seconds can be further divided into 
decimals.
 ✓ 
Grads and Radians are mathematically beautiful (so I’m told) but are 
not widely used in drafting. Apparently the French artillery uses grads, 
but as long as we’re friends with them, we shouldn’t have to worry.
 ✓ 
Surveyor’s Units type is similar to Deg/Min/Sec, but uses quadrants 
(quarter circles), rather than a whole circle, where an angle in Deg/Min/
Sec might measure 300°0'0.00", the same angle in Surveyor’s Units would 
be represented as S 30°0'0.00" E.
 
For the great majority of AutoCAD users, the unit types to know and use are 
Decimal, Architectural, and Decimal Degree. You’ll know or be told if you need 
to use one of the other types!
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Drawing 
Units dialog 
box.
 
After you specify a type of unit, you draw things on-screen at full size in those 
units just as though you were laying them out on the construction site or in 
the machine shop. You draw an 8-foot-high line, for example, to indicate the 

86
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
height of a wall and an 8-inch-high line to indicate the cutout for a doggie 
door (for a dachshund, naturally). The on-screen line may actually be only 
2 inches long at a particular zoom magnification, but AutoCAD stores the 
length as 8 feet. This way of working is easy and natural for most people for 
whom CAD is their first drafting experience, but it seems weird to people 
who’ve done a lot of manual drafting. If you’re in the latter category, don’t 
worry; you’ll soon get the hang of it.
 
When you use dash-dot linetypes (Chapter 6) and hatching (Chapter 15) in 
a drawing, it matters to AutoCAD whether the drawing uses an imperial 
(inches, feet, miles, and so on) or metric (millimeters, meters, kilometers, and 
so on) system of measure. The MEASUREMENT system variable controls 
whether the linetype and hatch patterns that AutoCAD lists for you to 
choose from are scaled with inches or millimeters in mind as the plotting 
units. MEASUREMENT=0 means inches (that is, an imperial-units drawing), 
whereas MEASUREMENT=1 means millimeters (that is, a metric-units draw-
ing). If you start from an appropriate template drawing (as described in the 
section “A Template for Success,” later in this chapter), the MEASUREMENT 
system variable will be set correctly, and you won’t ever have to think 
about it. (For an explanation of system variables and how to set them, see 
Chapter 26.)
Weighing up your scales
The next decision you should make before setting up a new drawing is choos-
ing the scale at which you’ll eventually plot the drawing. This decision gives 
you the drawing scale and drawing scale factor — two ways of expressing the 
same relationship between the objects in the real world and the objects plot-
ted on paper.
The scale factor factor
“Okay,” you’re saying, “I understand I need to print my drawings at a scale 
acceptable to the discipline I work in. But if I’m drawing stuff full size, why 
do I need to worry about the scale factor?” Grab yourself a nice mug of cocoa 
and settle down ’round the fire, because I’m going to tell you. By now you 
know (because I’ve told you so) that you draw real things full size, but draw-
ings contain other things that are not real, such as text, dimensions, hatch 
patterns, title blocks, dash-dot linetypes, and so forth. And those nonreal 
things need to be legible on your plotted drawing.
Say, for example, you want to draw a plan of your garage. You need it to fit 
on an 11- x 17-inch sheet of paper, and you want to add a title like (if you’re 
really original like me) “My Garage.” Typically, text annotations are 3/32" or 
1/8" high. Now, if you draw your 6"-wide wall full size, put a 1/8"-high title 
beside it, and then print the drawing at a scale of, say, 1:24 (that’s 1 drawing 

87
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
inch equals 24 real inches, usually expressed as 1/2" = 1'-0"), the 6" wall itself 
will measure 1/4" on the sheet, and the note will be an illegible little speck 
beside it. You fix it with the help of the drawing scale factor; the “Drawing 
scale versus drawing scale factor” sidebar explains how you arrive at the 
scale factor, and Table 4-1, in the following section, presents a list of accept-
able standard scales with their corresponding scale factors for both imperial 
and metric systems of measure.
Thinking annotatively
AutoCAD 2008 introduced a new way of setting some types of annotation 
objects to the appropriate plotted size. Annotative objects possess a special 
property so that when you change the annotation scale of a layout’s viewport 
or of the model tab, all the annotative objects — including text, dimensions, 
dash-dot linetypes, hatch patterns, and symbol blocks — change automati-
cally to their correct size for the chosen scale. I take a closer look at annota-
tive objects in Chapter 13, but in the meantime, it’s still worthwhile getting 
familiar with using drawing scale factors because they’re useful in a few 
other ways.
 
You shouldn’t just invent some arbitrary scale based on what looks okay on 
whatever size paper you happen to have handy. Most industries work with a 
small set of approved drawing scales that are related to one another by fac-
tors of 2 or 10. If you use other scales, you’ll at best be branded a clueless 
newbie — and, at worst, have to redo all your drawings at an accepted scale.
Drawing scale versus drawing scale factor
CAD users employ two different ways of talking 
about a drawing’s intended plot scale: drawing 
scale and drawing scale factor.
Drawing scale is the traditional way of describ-
ing a scale — traditional in that it existed long  
before CAD came to be. Drawing scales are 
expressed with an equal sign or colon; for
 
example, 1/8” = 1’–0”, 1:20, or 2:1. You can trans-
late the equal sign or colon as “corresponds 
to.” In all cases, the measurement to the left of 
the equal sign or colon indicates a paper mea-
surement, and the number to the right indicates 
a real-world measurement. In other words,
 
the imperial drawing scale 1/8” = 1’–0” means 
that 1/8” on the plotted drawing corresponds 
to 1’–0” in the CAD drawing and in the real
 
world, assuming that the plot was made at the  
proper scale. A metric drawing scale is usually 
expressed without units, as a simple ratio. Thus, 
a scale of 1:20 means 1 unit on the plotted draw-
ing corresponds to 20 units in the real world. In 
architectural and engineering drawings, the  
numbers usually refer to millimeters.
Drawing scale factor  is a single number that 
represents a multiplier, such as 96, 20, or 0.5. 
The drawing scale factor for a drawing is the 
conversion factor between a measurement on 
the plot and a measurement in the real world.

88
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Table 4-1 lists some common architectural drawing scales, using both impe-
rial and metric systems of measure. The table also lists the drawing scale 
factor corresponding to each drawing scale and the common uses for each 
scale. If you work in industries other than those listed here, ask drafters or 
coworkers what the common drawing scales are and for what kinds of draw-
ings they’re used.

After you choose a drawing scale, engrave the corresponding drawing scale 
factor on your desk, write it on your hand (don’t mix those two up, okay?), 
and put it on a sticky note on your monitor. You need to know the drawing 
scale factor for many drawing tasks, as well as for some plotting. You should 
be able to recite the drawing scale factor of any drawing you’re working on in 
AutoCAD without even thinking about it.
 
Even if you’re going to use the Plot dialog box’s Fit to Paper option (rather than 
a specific scale factor) to plot the drawing, you still need to choose a scale to 
make the non-real things (such as text, dash-dot linetypes, hatch patterns, and 
so on) appear at a useful size. Choose a scale that’s in the neighborhood of the 
Fit to Paper plotting factor, which AutoCAD displays in the Plot Scale area of 
the Plot dialog box. For example, if you determine that you need to squeeze 
your drawing down about 90 times to fit on the desired sheet size, choose 
a drawing scale of 1/8 inch = 1'–0" (drawing scale factor = 96) if you’re using 
architectural units or 1:100 (drawing scale factor = 100) for other kinds of units.

89
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
Thinking about paper
With knowledge of your industry’s common drawing scales, you can choose 
a provisional scale based on what you’re depicting. But you won’t know for 
sure whether that scale works until you compare it with the size of the paper 
that you want to use for plotting your drawing. Here again, most industries 
use a small range of standard sheet sizes. Three common sets of sizes exist, 
as shown in Figure 4-2 and Table 4-2:
 ✓ 
ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
 ✓ 
Architectural
 ✓ 
ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

You select a particular set of sheet sizes based on the common practices 
in your industry. You then narrow down your choice based on the area 
required by what you’re going to draw. For example, most imperial-units 
architectural plans are plotted on Architectural or ANSI D- or E-size sheets, 
and most metric architectural plans go on ISO A1 or A0 sheets.
If you know the desired sheet size and drawing scale factor, you can calculate 
the available drawing area easily. Simply multiply each of the sheet’s dimen-
sions by the drawing scale factor. For example, if you choose an 11- x 17-inch 
sheet and a drawing scale factor of 96 (corresponding to a plot scale of 1/8" 
= 1'–0"), you multiply 17 times 96 and 11 times 96 to get an available drawing 
area of 1,632 inches x 1,056 inches (or 136 feet x 88 feet). If your sheet size is 
in inches but your drawing scale is in millimeters, you need to multiply by an 
additional 25.4 to convert from inches to millimeters. For example, with an 
11- x 17-inch sheet and a scale of 1:200 (drawing scale factor = 200), you mul-
tiply 17 times 200 times 25.4 and 11 times 200 times 25.4 to get 86,360 x 55,880 
mm or 86.36 x 55.88 m — not quite big enough for a football field (American 
or European football).
Conversely, if you know the sheet size that you’re going to use and the real-
world size of what you’re going to draw, and you want to find out the largest 
plot scale you can use, you have to divide, not multiply. Divide the needed 
real-world drawing area’s length and width by the sheet’s dimensions. Take 
the larger number — either the length result or the width result — and round 
up to the nearest real drawing scale factor (that is, one that’s commonly used 
in your industry). For example, suppose you want to draw a 60- x 40-foot (or 
720- x 480-inch) floor plan and print it on 11- x 17-inch paper. You divide 720 
by 17 and 480 by 11 to get 42.35 and 43.64, respectively. The larger number, 
43.64, corresponds in this example to the short dimension of the house and 
the paper. The nearest larger common architectural drawing scale factor is 
48 (corresponding to 1/4" = 1'–0"), which leaves a little room for the plotting 
margin and title block.
The Cheat Sheet on this book’s companion Web site (www.dummies.com/
go/cheatsheet/autocad2011) includes two tables that list the available 
drawing areas for a range of sheet sizes and drawing scales. Those tables 
can help you decide on an appropriate paper size and drawing scale; revert 
to the calculation method for situations that the tables don’t cover. If you

 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
don’t keep a favorite old calculator on your physical desktop, don’t despair: 
AutoCAD 2011 has one lurking on the Ribbon. You’ll find it on the Home tab’s 
Utilities panel (hint: It looks like a calculator). You speed demons can toggle 
QuickCalc off and on with the Ctrl+8 key combo!
 
When you select a sheet size and drawing scale, always leave some extra room 
for the following two reasons:
 ✓ 
Margin allowance: Most plotters and printers can’t print all the way to 
the edge of the sheet — they require a small margin. For example, my 
trusty old Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4050 has a printable area of about 
8.0 x 10.7 inches on an 8.5- x 11-inch ANSI A-size (letter-size) sheet. (You 
can find this information in the Plot dialog box, as described in Chapter 
16.) If you’re a stickler for precision, you can use the printable area 
instead of the physical sheet area in the calculations described earlier in 
this section.
 ✓ 
Annotations: Most drawings require some annotations — text, dimen-
sions, grid bubbles, and so on — outside the objects you’re drawing, 
plus a title block surrounding the objects and annotations. If you don’t 
leave some room for the annotations and title block, you’ll end up 
having to cram things together too much or change to a different sheet 
size. Either way, you’ll be slowed down later in the project, when you 
can least afford it.
 
Some industries deal with the sheet-is-too-small/drawing-scale-is-too-large 
problem by breaking up drawings onto multiple plotted sheets. You might 
consider doing the same.
 
Don’t be afraid to start with real paper. Experienced drafters often make a 
quick, throwaway pencil-and-paper sketch indicating the dimensions of the 
sheet of paper they intend to plot on, a sketch of the title block, and a very 
rough, schematic sketch of the thing they’re going to draw. By sketching on 
paper first, you’ll often catch scale or sheet size problems before you set up 
a drawing, when repairs take only a few minutes — not after you’ve created 
the drawing, when fixing the problem can take hours.
Defending your border
The next decision to make is what kind of border your drawing needs. The 
options include a full-blown title block, a simple rectangle, or nothing at all 
around your drawing. If you need a title block, do you have one, can you 
borrow an existing one, or will you need to draw one from scratch? Although 
you can draw title block geometry in an individual drawing, you’ll save time 
by reusing the same title block for multiple drawings. Your company may 
already have a standard title block drawing ready to use, or someone else 
who’s working on your project may have created one for the project.

92
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
The most efficient way of creating a title block is as a separate DWG file, 
drawn at its normal plotted size (for example, 36 inches long by 24 inches 
high for an architectural D-size title block, or 841 mm long by 594 mm high 
for an ISO A1-size version). You then insert or xref the title block drawing 
into each sheet drawing. I explain inserting drawings into other drawings, or 
attaching drawings as external reference files in Chapters 17 and 18. 
A Template for Success
When you start in either the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace (as I do 
throughout this book) or the old AutoCAD Classic workspace, AutoCAD cre-
ates a new, blank drawing configured for 2D drafting. Depending on where 
you live (your country, not your street address!) and the dominant system 
of measure used there, AutoCAD will base this new drawing on one of two 
default drawing templates: acad.dwt for the imperial system of measure, 
as used in the United States, or acadiso.dwt for the metric system, used 
throughout the rest of the galaxy. (In AutoCAD LT, the two default templates 
are acadlt.dwt and acadltiso.dwt.) When you explicitly create a new 
drawing from within AutoCAD, the Select Template dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4-3, appears by default so that you can choose a template on which to 
base your new drawing.
 
Figure 4-3: 
A toolbox of 
templates.
 
You may be familiar with Microsoft Word or Excel template files, and 
AutoCAD drawing templates work pretty much the same way — because 
Autodesk stole the idea from them (encouraged, of course, by Microsoft).

93
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
A template is simply a drawing whose name ends in the letters DWT, which 
you use as the starting point for another drawing. When you create a new 
drawing from a template, AutoCAD makes a copy of the template file and 
opens the copy in a new drawing editor window. The first time you save the 
file, you’re prompted for a new filename to save to; the original template file 
stays unchanged.
Using a suitable template can save you time and worry because many of the 
setup options are already set correctly for you. You know the drawing will 
print correctly; you just have to worry about getting the geometry and text 
right. Of course, all this optimism assumes that the person who set up the 
template knew what she was doing.
The stock templates that come with AutoCAD are okay as a starting point, 
but you’ll need to modify them to suit your purposes or create your own 
from scratch. In particular, the stock AutoCAD templates are probably not 
set up for the scales that you’ll want to use. The instructions in the rest of 
this chapter tell you how to specify scale-dependent setup information.
So, the only problems with templates are creating good ones and then later 
finding the right one to use when you need it. Later in this chapter, in the 
“Making Templates Your Own” section, I show you how to create templates 
from your own setup drawings. Here, I show you how to use an already cre-
ated template, such as one of the templates that comes with AutoCAD 2011 
or from one of your CAD-savvy colleagues. If you’re lucky, someone in your 
office has created suitable templates that you can use to get going quickly.
Follow these steps to create a new drawing from a template drawing:
 
1. Run the NEW command by pressing Ctrl+N or clicking the Application 
button and choosing New.
 
 The Select Template dialog box appears.
 
 The first button on the Quick Access Toolbar runs the QNEW (Quick 
NEW) command instead of the ordinary NEW command. If you or some-
one else has changed the Default Template File Name for QNEW in the 
Options dialog box, QNEW will not open the Select Template dialog box 
but will instead simply present you with a new, blank drawing — possibly 
not the one you wanted. You can take advantage of QNEW, though — for 
information about how, see the “Making Templates Your Own” section, 
later in this chapter.
 
2. Click the name of the template that you want to use as the starting 
point for your new drawing and click the Open button.
 
 A new drawing window with a temporary name, such as Drawing2.dwg, 
appears. (The template you opened remains unchanged on your hard 
disk.)

94
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 Depending on which template you choose, your new drawing may open 
in a paper space layout, not in model space. If that’s the case, click the 
Model button on the status bar before changing the settings described 
in the next section. I describe how to set up and take advantage of paper 
space layouts in Chapter 5.
 
3. Press Ctrl+S or click the Application button and choose Save to save 
the file under a new name.
 
 Take the time to save the drawing to the appropriate name and 
location now.
 
4. Make needed changes.
 
 With most of the templates that come with AutoCAD, consider changing 
the units, limits, grid and snap settings, linetype scale, and dimension 
scale. See the next section for instructions.
 
5. Save the drawing again.
 
 If you’ll need other drawings in the future similar to the current one, 
consider saving your modified template as a template in its own right. 
See the section “Making Templates Your Own,” later in this chapter, for 
the lowdown on saving templates.
 
A few of the remaining templates that come with AutoCAD include title blocks 
for various sizes of sheets. In addition, most templates come in two versions — 
one for people who use color-dependent plot styles and one for people who 
use named plot styles. You probably want the color-dependent versions. 
(Chapter 16 describes the two kinds of plot styles and why you probably want 
the color-dependent variety.) I warned you that this drawing setup stuff would 
be complicated!
Making the Most of Model Space
After you’ve decided on drawing scale and sheet size, you’re ready to set up 
your drawing. Most drawings require a two-part setup:
 
1. Set up model space, where you’ll create most of your drawing.
 
2. Create one or more paper space layouts for plotting.
As I explain in Chapter 2, model space is the infinitely large, three-dimen-
sional environment in which you create the “real” objects you’re drawing. 
You can perform model space setup as described in this section. Chapter 5 
introduces you to setting up your paper space layouts.

95
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
Setting your units
First, set the linear and angular units that you want to use in your new draw-
ing. The following procedure describes how:
 
1. Click the Application button and then choose Units from the Drawing 
Utilities group.
 
 The Drawing Units dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Set your 
units here.
 
 
2. Choose a linear unit type from the Length Type drop-down list.
 
 Choose the type of unit representation that’s appropriate for your work. 
Engineering and Architectural units are displayed in feet and inches; 
the other types of units aren’t tied to any particular unit of measure-
ment. You decide whether each unit represents a millimeter, centimeter, 
meter, inch, foot, or something else. Your choice is much simpler if 
you’re working in metric: Choose Decimal units.
 
 AutoCAD can think in inches! If you’re using Engineering or Architectural 
units (feet and inches), AutoCAD interprets any distance or coordinate 
you enter as that many inches. You must use the ’ (apostrophe) charac-
ter on your keyboard to indicate a number in feet instead of inches.
 
3. From the Length Precision drop-down list, choose the level of precision 
you want when AutoCAD displays coordinates and linear measurements.
 
 The Length Precision setting controls how precisely AutoCAD displays 
coordinates, distances, and prompts in some dialog boxes. For example, 
the Coordinates section of the status bar displays the current coordi-
nates of the crosshairs using the current precision.

96
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 The linear and angular precision settings affect only AutoCAD’s display 
of coordinates, distances, and angles on the status bar, in dialog boxes, 
and in the command window and Dynamic Input tooltip areas. For draw-
ings stored as DWG files, AutoCAD always uses maximum precision to 
store the locations and sizes of all objects that you draw regardless of 
how many decimal places you choose to display in the Drawing Units 
dialog box. In addition, AutoCAD provides separate settings for control-
ling the precision of dimension text — see Chapter 14 for details.
 
4. Choose an angular unit type from the Angle Type drop-down list.
 
 Decimal Degrees and Deg/Min/Sec are the most common choices.
 
 The Clockwise check box and the Direction button provide additional 
angle measurement options, but you’ll rarely need to change the default 
settings: Unless you’re a land surveyor, measure angles counterclock-
wise and use east as the 0 degree direction.
 
5. From the Angle Precision drop-down list, choose the degree of preci-
sion you want when AutoCAD displays angular measurements.
 
6. In the Insertion Scale area, choose the units of measurement for this 
drawing.
  
Choose your base unit for this drawing — that is, the real-world distance 
represented by one AutoCAD unit.
 
 The AutoCAD (but not the AutoCAD LT) Drawing Units dialog box 
includes a Lighting area where you specify the unit type to be used to 
measure the intensity of photometric lights. I introduce lighting as part 
of rendering 3D models in Chapter 23.
 
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box and save your settings.
Making the drawing area snap-py 
(and grid-dy)
 
One of the most striking visual changes in AutoCAD 2011 is the new-look grid. 
For the last three decades, AutoCAD’s grid consisted of a set of evenly spaced 
dots that served as a visual distance reference. You can still configure a dot 
grid in AutoCAD 2011, but the new default is a snazzy graph paper-like grid 
made up of a network of lines.
AutoCAD’s snap feature creates a set of evenly spaced, invisible hot spots, 
which make the crosshairs move in nice, even increments. Both Grid Mode 
and Snap Mode are like the intersection points of the lines on a piece of grid 
paper, but the grid is simply a visual reference — it never prints — whereas 
Snap constrains the points that you can pick with the mouse. You can — and 
usually will — set grid and snap spacing to different values.

97
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
Set the grid and the snap intervals in the Drafting Settings dialog box by fol-
lowing these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Snap or Grid button on the status bar and choose 
Settings.
 
 The Drafting Settings dialog box appears with the Snap and Grid tab 
selected, as shown in Figure 4-5.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Get your 
drafting set-
tings here!
 
 
 The Snap and Grid tab has six sections, but the Snap Spacing and Grid 
Spacing areas within that tab are all you need to worry about for most 
2D drafting work.
 
2. Select the Snap On check box to turn on Snap Mode.
 
 This action enables default snaps half a unit apart (ten units apart if 
you’re working with the default metric template).
 
 AutoCAD usually has several ways of doing things. You can also click the 
Snap Mode button on the status bar to toggle snap on and off; the same 
goes for the Grid Display button and the grid setting. Or you could use 
the function keys: F7 toggles the grid off and on, and F9 does the same for 
Snap Mode.
 
3. Enter the snap interval you want in the Snap X Spacing box.
 
 Use the information in the sections preceding this procedure to decide 
on a reasonable snap spacing.
 
 If the Equal X and Y Spacing check box is selected, the Y spacing auto-
matically changes to equal the X spacing, which is almost always what 
you want. Uncheck the box if you want to specify unequal snap spacing.
 
4. Select the Grid On check box to turn on the grid.

98
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
5. Enter the desired grid spacing in the Grid X Spacing box.
 
 Use the information in the sections preceding this procedure to decide 
on a reasonable grid spacing.
 
 Just like with snap spacing, if the Equal X and Y Spacing check box is 
selected, the Y spacing automatically changes to equal the X spacing. 
Again, you usually want to leave it that way.
 
 X measures horizontal distance; Y measures vertical distance. The 
AutoCAD drawing area normally shows an X and Y icon in case you 
forget.
 
 If you’re an old AutoCAD hand and find the new graph-paper grid too 
obtrusive, check the Display Dotted Grid In 2D Model Space box in the 
Grid Style area to switch to the old-style rows and columns of dots.
 
6. Specify additional grid display options in the Grid Behavior area.
 
 If you select the Adaptive Grid check box, AutoCAD changes the density 
or spacing of the grid lines or dots as you zoom in and out. If you also 
select Allow Subdivision Below Grid Spacing, the spacing can go lower 
than what you’ve set, and it may go higher if you’re zoomed a long way 
out of your drawing. (If it didn’t, you couldn’t see your drawing for the 
grid!)
 
 Selecting the Display Grid Beyond Limits check box allows the grid to 
display over the entire drawing area, no matter how far you’re zoomed 
out. Clearing this check box makes AutoCAD behave the way it’s always 
behaved — that is, the grid is displayed only in the area defined by the 
drawing limits.
 
 The Follow Dynamic UCS option (not available in AutoCAD LT) is a 
3D-specific feature that changes your drawing plane as you mouse 
over 3D objects. I cover this feature in Chapter 22. 
 
7. Click OK to close the Drafting Settings dialog box.
Setting linetype and dimension scales
Even though you’ve engraved the drawing scale factor on your desk and writ-
ten it on your hand — not vice versa — AutoCAD doesn’t know the drawing 
scale until you enter it. Keeping AutoCAD in the dark is fine as long as you’re 
just drawing continuous lines and curves representing real-world geometry 
because you draw these objects at their real-world size, without worrying 
about plot scale.
However . . . as soon as you start using non-continuous dash-dot linetypes 
(line patterns that contain gaps in them), you need to tell AutoCAD how to 
scale the gaps in the linetypes based on the plot scale. If you forget this, the 
dash-dot linetype patterns can look waaaay too big or too small. Figure 4-6 
shows what I mean.

99
 Chapter 4: Setup for Success
 
Figure 4-6: 
. . . and this 
little center 
line looks 
juuuust 
right!
 
Too Big…
Just Right!
Too Small…
The scale factor that controls dash-dot linetypes is found in a system vari-
able called LTSCALE (as in LineType SCALE). You can change this setting at 
any time, but it’s best to set it correctly when you’re setting up the drawing.
The following sequence includes directions for typing system variable and 
command names. To set the linetype scale at the keyboard, follow these steps:
 
1. Type LTSCALE (or LTS) and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD responds with a prompt, asking you for the scale factor. The 
value at the end of the prompt is the current linetype scale setting, as 
shown in the following command line example:
Enter new linetype scale factor <1.0000>:
 
2. Type the value you want for the linetype scale and press Enter.
 
 The easiest choice is to set the linetype scale to the drawing scale 
factor. Some people, however, find that the dashes and gaps in dash-
dot linetypes get a bit too long when they use the drawing scale factor. 
If you’re one of those people, set LTSCALE to one-half of the drawing 
scale factor. (Feel free to experiment with this value; some people prefer 
a linetype scale of three-quarters the scale factor. If you’re working in 
metric, try 0.75 times the scale factor instead — just ask your calculator 
if you don’t believe me.)
 
 Alternatively, you can specify linetype scale in the Linetype Manager 
dialog box: Click the Linetype drop-down on the Properties panel of the 
Ribbon’s Home tab and select Other. Then, in the Linetype Manager 
dialog box, click the Show Details button, and type your desired linetype 
scale in the Global Scale Factor text box. 
 
Besides LTSCALE, there are three other similarly named system variables you 
can use to control the display of dash-dot linetypes:
 ✓ 
PSLTSCALE: Makes linetype spacing look the same in paper space view-
ports, regardless of the viewport scale.
 ✓ 
CELTSCALE: Changes the effective linetype scale factor for new objects.

100
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 ✓ 
MSLTSCALE: Visually displays dash-dot linetypes in the model tab 
based on the annotative scale setting.
If any of these sound useful — and I highly recommend you enable 
PSLTSCALE — check them out in the online help index.
 
The procedure described here for setting linetype scale assumes that you’re 
starting a new drawing from one of the plain-jane templates (acad.dwt or 
acadiso.dwt in the full version, acadlt.dwt or acadltiso.dwt in AutoCAD 
LT) and using the default linetype scale. Don’t change LTSCALE in existing draw-
ings without knowing exactly why you’re doing it and what values to set them 
to, in case someone before you set their values for good reasons.
Entering drawing properties
I recommend one last bit of housekeeping before you’re finished with model 
space drawing setup: Enter summary information in the Drawing Properties 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-7. Click the Application button; in the 
Drawing Utilities section, choose Drawing Properties to open the Drawing 
Properties dialog box; then click the Summary tab. Enter the drawing scale 
and the drawing scale factor you’re using in the Comments area, plus any 
other information you think useful.
 Don’t 
confuse drawing properties (which are really file properties) with your 
drawing’s object properties — they’re different things. The properties you 
enter here can help you or someone you love when she opens your drawing 
and wonders how you set it up. Object properties are a big enough topic to 
merit their own chapter — see Chapter 6.

Making Templates Your Own
You can create a template from any DWG file by using the Save Drawing As 
dialog box. Follow these steps to save your drawing as a template:
 
1. Click the Application button and choose Save As.
 
 The Save Drawing As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
Figure 4-8:

2. From the Files of Type drop-down list, choose AutoCAD Drawing 
Template (*.dwt) or AutoCAD LT Drawing Template (*.dwt).
 
3. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the drawing.
 
 The AutoCAD 2011 default folder for template drawings is buried deep in 
the bowels of your Windows user profile. Save your templates there if you 
want them to appear in AutoCAD’s Select Template list. You can save your 
templates in another folder, but if you want to use them later, you have to 
navigate to that folder each time to use them. See the Technical Stuff para-
graph that follows this procedure for additional suggestions.
 
4. Enter a name for the drawing template in the File Name text box and 
click Save.
 
 A dialog box for the template description and units appears.
 
5. Specify the template’s measurement units (English or Metric) in the 
drop-down list.
 
 Enter the key info now — you can’t do it later unless you save the tem-
plate to a different name. Don’t bother filling in the Description field; 
AutoCAD doesn’t display it in the Select Template dialog box. Don’t 
worry about the Layer Notification area shown in Figure 4-8 for now; I 
tell you all about drawing layers in Chapter 6.

6. Click OK to save the file.
 
 The Template Options dialog box closes and the template is saved to 
your hard disk.
 
7. To save your drawing as a regular drawing, click the Application 
button and choose Save As.
 
 The Save Drawing As dialog box appears again.
 
8. From the Files of Type drop-down list, choose AutoCAD 2010 Drawing 
(*.dwg).
 
 Choose the AutoCAD LT equivalent, if that’s your version. AutoCAD 2011 
uses the AutoCAD 2010 DWG file format. Choose a previous DWG file 
format if you want to be able to open your drawing in AutoCAD 2009 or 
earlier.
 
9. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the drawing.
 
 Use a different folder from the one with your template drawings.
 
10. Enter the name of the drawing in the File Name text box and click Save.
 
 The file is saved. Now, when you save it in the future, the regular file, not 
the template file, gets updated.
 
The QNEW (Quick NEW) command, when properly configured, can bypass 
the Select Template dialog box and create a new drawing from your favorite 
template. The first button on the Quick Access Toolbar — the button with the 
plain white sheet of paper — runs the newer QNEW command instead of the 
older NEW command.
To put the Quick into QNEW, though, you have to tell AutoCAD which default 
template to use: Click the Application button, then click the Options button 
at the lower-right corner of the Application Menu. On the Files tab, choose 
Template Settings➪Default Template File Name for QNEW. The QNEW default 
file name setting is None, which causes QNEW to act just like NEW (that is, 
QNEW opens the Select Template dialog box). Specify the name of your favor-
ite template here, and you get a new drawing file based on it every time you 
click QNEW.
 
AutoCAD 2011 stores template drawings and many other support files 
under your Windows user folder. To discover where your template folder 
is hiding, open the Options dialog box. On the Files tab, choose Template 
Settings➪Drawing Template File Location, as shown in Figure 4-9.

you actually use there, and change the Drawing Template File Location setting so 
that it points to your new template folder.

Planning for Paper
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up paper space layouts
▶ Buttons or tabs for layout fashionistas
▶ Looking into viewports
▶ Working in paper space
M
ost of what the earlier chapters look at revolves around setting up the 
model space environment — that infinitely large, three-dimensional 
realm wherein you create your gleaming towers, your wondrous electronic 
gadgetry . . . or your garden shed or your angle bracket. However, you may 
have picked up a hint here or there that AutoCAD has a whole different envi-
ronment known as paper space.
The final product of all this setup, remember, is a printed drawing on a piece 
of paper. Unless you’re prepared to send your computer out to the work site, 
you’re going to have to get those designs off the screen and onto paper. The 
first part of that process is configuring the sheet layout in paper space, which 
I explain in this chapter. For the actual process of outputting either model 
space or layouts to printer or plotter, see Chapter 16.
Chapter 2 introduces you to the two spaces — model and paper — and 
Chapter 4 explains how to configure model space for efficient drawing. Before 
you plunge into paper space, a quick recap of model space is in order.
 
Model space is the drawing environment that’s current when the Model tab (not 
the Model button) on the status bar is active. Model space is where you create 
the “real” objects that you’re drawing, so these objects are referred to as model 
geometry whether they’re 2D or 3D entities. When the Model tab is active, you 
see objects in model space only — anything in paper space is invisible.
 
In AutoCAD 2011, it’s still possible to ignore paper space layouts entirely and 
do all your drawing and plotting in model space. But you owe it to yourself to 
give layouts a try. You’ll probably find that they make plotting more consistent 
and predictable. They’ll give you more plotting flexibility when you need it. And 
you’ll certainly encounter drawings from other people that make extensive use 
of paper space, so you need to understand it if you plan to exchange drawings 
with anyone else.

106
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Setting Up a Layout in Paper Space
A paper space layout is a representation of a drawing sheet. Although the 
model geometry — the real stuff — goes in model space, the “not-real” draw-
ing objects (for example, a drawing border, title block, general notes, per-
haps view labels, and symbols like North arrows) all go in paper space on the 
layout. Where model space is like the world, infinitely large and three-dimen-
sional, paper space is finite — the size of a drawing sheet, in fact — and two-
dimensional, just like a drawing sheet.
Aside from just an arrangement of your drawing sheet, layouts also store plot 
information. AutoCAD saves separate plot settings with each layout as well 
as model space so that you can plot each one differently. In practice, you’ll 
probably need to use only one of the paper space layout tabs, especially 
when you’re getting started with AutoCAD.
Rather than just reading about it, you may also want to open a few of the 
AutoCAD 2011 sample drawings and click the Model and Layout buttons or 
tabs to witness the variety of ways in which paper space is used.
 
The AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT sample drawings are no longer installed with 
the program, but they’re still available — online. Download them from www.
autodesk.com/autocad-samples or www.autodesk.com/autocadlt-
samples. The upside of the change is that users of either program now have 
access to the other’s sample files.
Will that be tabs or buttons?
The Autodesk documentation sometimes refers to the Model tab or to layout 
tabs, and sometimes (like just a second ago) I do here as well. In its out-of-the-
box condition, AutoCAD does display actual, selectable tabs at the lower-left 
edge of the drawing window, clearly labeled Model, Layout1, and Layout2 
(refer to Figure 2-2 in Chapter 2). You can gain a fraction more screen space 
if you hide the tabs, but even when they’re hidden, they’re still referred to as 
tabs. Here’s how to toggle the way that tabs are displayed:
 
 
✓ To hide layout tabs: Right-click the visible Model tab or any layout tab, 
and choose Hide Layout and Model Tabs from the pop-up menu.
 
 ✓ 
To show layout tabs: Right-click the Model button (the one with the icon 
and the Model tooltip, not the Model or Paper Space button, which is 
sometimes confusingly labeled MODEL) or the Layout button right next 
door and choose Display Layout and Model Tabs.
Hiding the tabs does give you a bit more drawing area, but there’s a 
drawback — the Layout button can only control a single layout (whichever 
layout happens to be current). You have to use the Quick View Layouts feature 

107
 Chapter 5: Planning for Paper
(described in the next section) to switch between layouts, but if your draw-
ing only has one layout, hiding the tabs is well worthwhile.
 
You can rename layout tabs — but not the Model tab — by double-clicking the 
layout name twice to open an edit box.
 
The state of your tabs is stored — but not automatically saved — in your cur-
rent workspace. For example, if you’re working in the 2D Drafting & Annotation 
workspace, then switch to the AutoCAD Classic workspace, and then switch 
back to 2D Drafting & Annotation, the change you made from tabs to buttons or 
vice versa will not be retained. For information on saving your own custom 
workspace, look up workspace in the online help system.
View layouts Quick(View)ly
Quick View Layouts is the second of two AutoCAD 2011 features that use 
the Quick View image strip to display preview images of drawings or layouts. 
I introduce Quick View Drawings — which previews all your open drawings in 
the Quick View strip — in Chapter 2.
In earlier versions of AutoCAD, with buttons enabled rather than tabs, you 
would right-click the Layout button to open a shortcut menu listing the draw-
ing’s layouts. But mere words in a menu are so previous release! The follow-
ing steps explain how to change between model space and a layout or switch 
between layouts:
 
 
1. Click the Quick View Layouts button on the status bar.
 
 
 The Quick View image strip appears above the status bar and displays 
resizable image panels for model space and all layouts. Right below 
the row of images is the Quick View toolbar. Figure 5-1 shows a typical 
arrangement in a multi-layout drawing.

Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 Don’t confuse the Quick View toolbar with the Quick Access Toolbar that 
lives up top, next to the Application button. AutoCAD is getting so quick, 
it’s hard to keep up with it!
 
 The Quick View toolbar contains four buttons that perform the following 
tasks (buttons listed from left to right):
 • 
Pin Quick View Layouts: Normally the images disappear as soon as 
you select a layout or click outside it. Clicking this button reorients 
the side view of the pushpin so it looks like it’s poking a hole in 
your screen (you should be aware that neither Autodesk nor I am 
responsible for punctures in your monitor) and forces the image 
panels to remain open.
 • 
New Layout: Click this button to create a new layout with a single 
viewport. The new layout appears as a new image at the end of the 
strip.
 • 
Publish: Click this button to open the Publish dialog box. You use 
the PUBLISH command if you have a whole set of drawings you 
want to output and package at one time. I explain the AutoCAD ver-
sion of publishing in Chapter 20.
 • 
Close: Use this button to close the Quick View Layouts image strip  
if you pinned it open. Simply clicking outside the image strip closes 
the image strip if it’s unpinned.
 
2. Move your mouse pointer over each image in the Quick View panel.
 
 The image background highlights to indicate the layout the pointer 
focus is on.
 
 When a panel is highlighted, two icons appear at the top corners of the 
panel. The Publish button at top-right does the same thing as Batch Plot 
on the Application Menu. If you want to print the individual layout without 
going through all the Publish rigmarole, click the Plot icon at the top-left.
 
3. Click the preview image of model space or the layout you want to 
make current.
 
 The selected layout is activated and fills the drawing window, and the 
preview image strip closes.
 
 If you have a wheel mouse, you can move between previews by scroll-
ing the wheel in either direction. You can also resize the previews by 
mousing over an image and then pressing the Ctrl key while scrolling the 
wheel back and forth.
Creating a layout
Creating a simple paper space layout is straightforward, thanks to the Create 
Layout Wizard, as shown in Figure 5-2. (Yes! Finally, a useful AutoCAD wizard.) 
The command name is LAYOUTWIZARD, and it’s missing in action from 

109
 Chapter 5: Planning for Paper
AutoCAD 2011’s new user interface. To get to it, enter LAYOUTWIZARD at the 
keyboard (or, if you’re using the AutoCAD Classic workspace, open the Insert 
menu, choose Layout, then Create Layout Wizard).
 
Figure 5-2: 
The Create 
Layout 
Wizard.
 
 
Although the Create Layout Wizard guides you step by step through the pro-
cess of creating a paper space layout from scratch, it doesn’t eliminate the 
necessity of coming up with a sensible set of layout parameters. The sheet 
size and plot scale that you choose provide a certain amount of space for 
showing your model (see the “Thinking about paper” section in Chapter 4), 
and wizards aren’t allowed to bend the laws of arithmetic to escape that fact. 
For example, a map of Australia at a scale of 1 inch = 1 foot won’t fit on an 8 
1/2- x 11-inch sheet, no way, no how. In other words, garbage in, garbage (lay)
out. Fortunately, the Create Layout Wizard lends itself to experimentation, and 
you can easily delete layouts that don’t work.
Follow these steps to create a layout:
 1. 
Type LAYOUTWIZARD and press Enter.
 
 The Create Layout Wizard displays its first page and prompts you to 
enter a name for the new layout.
 
2. Give the new layout a name and click Next.
 
 In place of the default name, Layout3, I recommend something more 
descriptive — for example, D-Size Sheet. Or you can call it A1-Size Sheet 
if you’re of the metric persuasion.
 
3. Choose a printer or plotter to use when plotting this layout and click 
Next.
 
 Think of your choice as the default plotter for this layout. You can change 
to a different plotter later or create page setups that plot the same layout 
on different plotters. (I explain page setups in Chapter 16.)

110
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
 
 Many of the names in the configured plotter list should look familiar 
because they’re your Windows printers (system printers, in AutoCAD 
lingo). Names with a .pc3 extension represent non-system printer driv-
ers. See Chapter 16 for details.
 
4. Choose a paper size, specify whether to use inches or millimeters to 
represent paper units, and click Next.
 
 The available paper sizes depend on the printer or plotter that you 
selected in Step 3.
 
5. Specify the orientation of the drawing on the paper and click Next.
 
 The icon displaying the letter A on the piece of paper shows you which 
orientation is which.
 
6. On the Create Layout – Title Block page, select None and click Next.
 
 I don’t recommend selecting one of the two available title blocks, as the 
odds are slim that either will fit on the paper size you selected in Step 4.
 
 Earlier AutoCAD releases included a handy set of pre-drawn title blocks 
for a range of both imperial and metric paper sizes. All but two of them 
have disappeared, and those two are still the only ones in AutoCAD 
2011. Unfortunately, neither of them is likely to work out for you. If, in 
Step 4, you chose inches as your units and any paper size other than 
ARCH D (36.00 x 24.00 inches), or millimeters as your units and any 
paper size at all, the title block will not fit the sheet.
 
 When you know your way around the program a bit, you can always 
draw, insert, or xref a title block later. See Chapters 17 and 18 for infor-
mation about inserting or xrefing a title block. You can also add custom 
title block drawings to your AutoCAD Template folder. If you want 
to know where to put them, see the section on making templates in 
Chapter 4.
 
7. Define the arrangement of viewports that AutoCAD should create and 
select the viewport scale for them all from the drop-down list. Then 
click Next.
  
A viewport is a window from paper space into model space. You must 
create at least one viewport to display the model in your new layout. I 
tell you more about viewports in the section “A view(port) for drawing 
in,” later in this chapter.
 
 The default Viewport scale, Scaled to Fit, ensures that all of your model 
drawing objects appear in the viewport, but it results in an arbitrary 
scale factor. Most technical drawings require a specific scale, such as 
1:100 or 1/8" = 1'–0".
 
8. Click Select Location to specify the location of the viewport(s) on the 
layout; then pick the viewport’s corners. 
 
 After you click the Select Location button, the Create Layout Wizard 
displays the preliminary layout with any title block that you’ve chosen. 
Pick two points to define a rectangle that falls within the drawing area 

111
 Chapter 5: Planning for Paper
of your title block (or within the plottable area of the sheet, if you chose 
no title block in Step 6). AutoCAD then redisplays the Finish page of the 
Create Layout wizard.
 
 AutoCAD represents the plottable area of the sheet with a dashed rect-
angle near the edge of the sheet. If you don’t select a location for the 
viewport(s), the Create Layout Wizard creates a viewport that fills the 
plottable area of the sheet.
 9. 
Click Finish.
 
 AutoCAD creates the new layout.
 
 Like the other wizards, the Create Layout Wizard is aimed at new users 
or old-timers who have somehow overlooked the introduction of paper 
space layouts. You won’t need to run this wizard every time you start 
a new drawing, but you may well run it once and then save the result-
ing file as a template for future drawings (see Chapter 4 for more about 
templates).
Copying and changing layouts
After you create a layout, you can delete, copy, rename, and otherwise manipu-
late it by clicking Quick View Layouts on the status bar and right-clicking a pre-
view image. If you’re using layout tabs rather than buttons, right-click its tab to 
display the menu or simply drag the tab to a new position. Figure 5-3 shows the 
right-click menu options in Quick View Layouts.
 
Figure 5-3: 
The Quick 
View 
Layouts 
right-click 
menu.
 
 
The From Template option refers to layout templates. After you create layouts 
in a template (DWT) or a drawing (DWG) file, you can use the From Template 
option to import these layouts into the current drawing. For details, see the 
LAYOUT command’s Template option in the Command Reference section of 
online help.

112
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Many drawings require only one paper space layout. If you always plot the 
same view of the model and always plot to the same device and on the same 
size paper, a single paper space layout should suffice. If you want to plot 
your model in different ways (for example, at different scales, with different 
layers visible, with different areas visible, or with different plotted line char-
acteristics), you may want to create additional paper space layouts.
Lost in paper space
After you create a paper space layout, you suddenly have two views of the 
same drawing geometry: the view in your original model space and the new 
layout’s view (perhaps decorated with a handsome title block and other 
accoutrements of plotting nobility). It’s important to realize that both views 
are of the same geometry. If you change the model geometry on one view, 
you’re changing it everywhere because all layouts display the same model 
space objects.
When you make a layout current, you can switch the active space between 
paper space (that is, drawing and zooming on the sheet of paper) and model 
space (drawing and zooming on the model, inside the viewport) in several 
ways, including the following:
 ✓ 
In the drawing area, double-click inside a viewport boundary to move 
the crosshairs into model space in that viewport. Alternatively, you can 
double-click outside all viewports (for example, in the gray area outside 
the sheet) to move the crosshairs into paper space.
 
 ✓ 
Click the Maximize/Minimize Viewport button on the status bar. (For 
more information, see Chapter 2.)
 ✓ 
Enter MSPACE (the command alias is MS) or PSPACE (PS) at the 
keyboard.
 
 ✓ 
Click the MODEL/PAPER button on the status bar.
When the crosshairs are in model space, anything you draw or edit changes 
the model in model space and therefore, through the viewports, on all paper 
space layouts. When the crosshairs are in paper space, anything you draw 
appears only on that one layout. It’s as though you were drawing on an ace-
tate sheet over the top of that sheet of plotter paper — the model beneath 
remains unaffected.
This behavior can make your brain hurt until you get used to it. To avoid con-
fusion, stick with the following approach (at least, until you’re more familiar 
with paper space):

113
 Chapter 5: Planning for Paper
 ✓ 
If you want to edit the model: Do so in full-screen model space. Click 
the Model tab if tabs are displayed, or click the Model button if tabs are 
hidden. (The Model button is the one with the little black icon; don’t 
confuse it with the MODEL/PAPER button, which switches between model 
and paper space within the same layout.) Don’t try to edit the model in a 
paper space viewport — it’s a very inefficient use of your screen space.
 ✓ 
If you want to edit a particular layout without affecting the model: Use 
one of the methods I’ve described to make that layout current, and make 
sure that the crosshairs are in paper space.
What space am I in?
When you start working in layouts, it may not always be crystal clear 
whether you’re in model space or paper space. The status bar button will 
help — it will say PAPER if you’re in paper space or MODEL if you’re in the 
other place. Here are a few other ways to tell your layout spaces apart:
 ✓ 
Check the crosshairs. If you’re in paper space, you can move the cross-
hairs over the entire drawing area. If you’re in model space, you can 
move the crosshairs only within the currently active viewport; if you try 
to move the crosshairs outside the viewport, they turn into a Windows 
selection arrow.
 ✓ 
Select some model geometry. Try clicking some objects you know are in 
model space. If you can select them and they highlight, you’re in model 
space. If nothing happens when you click them, they’re inaccessible 
because you’re in paper space.
 ✓ 
Check the UCS icon. The UCS (for User Coordinate System) icon is the 
symbol at the lower-left corner of the drawing area. The model space 
icon takes the shape of two lines at right angles to each other, with the 
letters indicating the direction of the X-axis and the Y-axis (the W stands 
for the World Coordinate System). The paper space icon is triangular, 
and the closed, three-sided shape represents a flat plane. If you don’t 
see such a symbol, type UCSICON and press Enter; then type either ON 
to display the UCS icon in the lower-left corner of the display, or OR to 
display it at the drawings origin (that is, 0,0 coordinates), as shown in 
Figure 5-4. I explain more about user coordinate systems in Chapter 7.
 
 Figure 5-4 shows the 2D UCS icon. By default, AutoCAD displays the 3D 
UCS icon, even when you’re working in the 2D Drafting & Annotation 
workspace. You can switch to the 2D style, adjust the icon size, and 
tell AutoCAD to display the icon in a single color by clicking UCS Icon, 
Properties on the Coordinates panel of the Ribbon’s View tab and 
adjusting the settings in the UCS Icon dialog box.

A view(port) for drawing in
A viewport is a paper space object — a window into your drawing sheet — 
through which you view model space objects from paper space. By default, 
when you create a new layout, a large single viewport is created.
 
The viewports I talk about in this chapter are paper space viewports. You can 
also create viewports in model space, but they’re completely different ani-
mals. Model space viewports are also known as tiled viewports because they 
can’t have any space between them, like bathroom tiles. You can use tiled 
viewports to look up close at widely separated areas of your screen. What’s 
potentially confusing is that AutoCAD uses the same command name, and 
even the same dialog box, for creating the two different types. For this chap-
ter, make sure that you’re in paper space when you create viewports.
Paper space viewports are assigned drawing scales, and you can have multiple 
viewports with different scales on the same layout. For example, one viewport 
can show the floor plan of an exhibit space at 1/4" to one foot, and another 
viewport can show an enlarged view of a display cabinet at 1"=1'. Because the 
individual viewports are scaled, the entire layout can be plotted at 1:1.
The Create Layout Wizard is fine when you’re starting out, but most real 
drawings have unique, non-standardized arrangements of viewports. When 
creating layouts, it’s often easiest to create viewports from scratch. The fol-
lowing procedure explains how:
 
1. Using one of the techniques described in the “Creating a layout” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter, create a new layout in your drawing.
 
 For example, click Quick View Layouts to display the preview images, 
and then right-click any of the images and choose New Layout. A new 
layout is added to the end of the image strip.
 
2. Click the image for the new layout to open it.
 
 A new layout appears in the drawing window, showing the default sheet 
area and a single rectangular viewport centered on the sheet. You aren’t 
going to use this viewport.

115
 Chapter 5: Planning for Paper
 
3. Move the crosshairs over the viewport boundary and click to select it. 
Press the Delete key.
 
 Although they don’t behave like other drawing objects, viewports are 
objects, just like lines or circles. And like any other drawing objects, 
they can be selected and moved, copied, arrayed — or deleted.
 
4. On the Ribbon, click the View tab; then, in the Viewports panel, 
choose New. In the Viewports dialog box, click Single in the list of 
standard viewports at the left, then click OK.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to pick the first corner for the new viewport.
 
 You must be in paper space for these steps to work as described. If you 
opened the Viewports dialog box, clicked Single, and clicked OK, and 
nothing happened, you’re still in model space, where you already have a 
single viewport.
 
5. Pick a point somewhere on the blank page to locate the first corner of 
the new viewport.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to pick the second corner.
 
6. Pick another point to place the second corner of the new viewport.
 
 AutoCAD draws the viewport, and the model space geometry appears 
inside it. Next, specify a drawing scale for your viewport(s).
 
 Specifying the correct viewport scale sooner rather than later bestows a 
couple of important benefits:
 
• Correctly scaling viewports allows you to use annotative documen-
tation objects, such as text, dimensions, hatch patterns, blocks, 
and non-continuous (dash-dot) linetypes. I introduce you to anno-
tative objects in Chapter 13.
 
• Correctly scaling all your viewports allows you to easily plot the 
completed layout at a scale of 1:1 while retaining individual, true-
to-scale viewports.
 
7. Double-click inside the viewport you want to apply a scale to.
 
 Model space becomes active, as it must, because that’s the space you 
have to scale. The Viewport Scale button appears toward the right side 
of the status bar when model space is activated in a layout.
 
8. Click the Viewport Scale button on the status bar.
 
 Clicking the Viewport Scale button opens a pop-up list of every draw-
ing scale registered in the scales list — including metric scales even if 
you’re working in an English-units drawing, and vice versa.
 
 Most of the time, for most people, there are way too many scales in 
the lists you see in the Viewport Scale button and the Plot dialog box. 
AutoCAD has a handy dandy Edit Scale List dialog box that lets you 
remove those imperial scales if you never work in feet and inches and 
vice versa, if you work only in metric. To run through your scales, choose 

116
Part I: AutoCAD 101 
Scale List from the Annotation Scaling panel on the Annotate tab, or type 
SCALELISTEDIT and press Enter to open the Edit Scale List dialog box. If 
you make a mistake, the Reset button in the Edit Scale List dialog box will 
restore all the default scales.
 
9. Find the scale you want to apply to the active viewport and select it 
from the list.
 
 The display zooms in or out to adjust to the chosen viewport scale.
 
 Reread that last sentence and then think about how often you have to 
pan and zoom in your drawing. If you zoom inside a viewport whose 
scale you’ve set — kaboom! — you just blew the scale off the map. 
Luckily, you can prevent yourself or anyone else from inadvertently 
destroying your beautifully arranged and scaled viewport by completing 
the final steps of viewport setup:
 
10. Make sure you’re in paper space (check the UCS icon or move the 
crosshairs).
 
11. Select the boundary of the viewport whose arrangement you want to 
protect.
 
 With the viewport selected, the Viewport Scale button reappears with 
its selectable list of scales, and right beside it is another button with a 
yellow unlocked padlock icon. As its tooltip indicates, its function is to 
lock and unlock viewports.
 
12. Click the Lock/Unlock Viewport button to lock the viewport scale.
 
 The yellow unlocked padlock changes to a blue locked padlock, and the 
Viewport Scale button now becomes unselectable. Locking the display 
sets AutoCAD up for some nifty zooming . . . if you’re in paper space, 
a normal zoom is executed. If you’re in model space inside a viewport, a 
normal zoom would wreck the scale, so when you try to zoom, AutoCAD 
near-instantaneously switches to paper space, zooms you in, and then 
switches back to model space. Sheer prestidigitation!
 
 Sometimes the perfect viewport arrangement requires that a smaller 
viewport be completely surrounded by a larger one. Easy enough to 
create, yes, and easy to select — as long as you’re in paper space. 
However, if you’re in model space and you want to click from one view-
port to the next to make it current, it’s impossible to make model space 
current in a completely surrounded viewport by clicking inside it. Let 
your fingers come to the rescue: The Ctrl+R key combination cycles 
through model space in all drawing viewports, even if they’re completely 
surrounded by other viewports.
And there you have your 12-step program to layout bliss! All that setup had 
a purpose, of course: to enable you to print perfect paper plots (or plot per-
fect paper prints, if you prefer to see it that way). I cover plotting in depth in 
Chapter 16, but a short introductory word here might be useful.

117
 Chapter 5: Planning for Paper
About Paper Space Layouts and Plotting
As this chapter describes, you can use AutoCAD’s paper space feature to 
compose one or more layouts for plotting your drawing in particular ways. 
Each layout lives on a separate tab, which you click at the bottom of the 
drawing area — or in a secret hiding place if you’ve hidden the Model and 
Layout tabs. AutoCAD saves plot settings (plot device, paper size, plot scale, 
and so on) separately for each of the layouts, as well as model space.
Whether to plot model space or a layout in a drawing depends entirely on 
how the drawing was set up. If you or someone else went through a layout 
setup procedure similar to the one in this chapter, you probably should plot 
the layout. If not, plot model space.
 
Viewport boundaries will print if you don’t pay attention to where you create 
them. What that means is that each drawing view has a nice rectangular border 
around it. Nice, but a definite no-no in every drafting office. In Chapter 6, I intro-
duce you to object properties, including probably the most important one, 
layers. You can define a layer so that objects on it do not plot, and that’s where 
you should create your viewports.
 
If you don’t have any paper space drawings handy, you can use one of the 
AutoCAD sample drawings. Refer to the New in AutoCAD 2011 paragraph in 
the “Setting Up a Layout in Paper Space” section, earlier in the chapter.
 
Some different ways of plotting the same model can be handled in a single paper 
space layout with different page setups. See Chapter 16 for more details. If your 
projects require lots of drawings, you can parlay layouts into sheet sets — a 
feature that makes for more sophisticated creation, management, plotting, and 
electronic transfer of multi-sheet drawing sets. (Sorry, LT users — AutoCAD LT 
doesn’t support sheet sets.) Again, see Chapter 16 for more information.

Let There Be Lines

In this part . . .
L
ines, circles, and other elements of geometry make 
up the heart of your drawing. AutoCAD offers many 
different drawing commands, many ways to use them to 
draw objects precisely, and many properties for controlling 
the on-screen and plotted appearance of objects. After 
you draw your geometry, you’ll probably spend at least as 
much time editing it as your design and drawings evolve. 
And in the process, you’ll need to zoom in and out and 
pan all around to see how the entire drawing is coming 
together.
Drawing geometry, editing it, and changing the displayed 
view are the foundation of the drawing process; this part 
shows you how to make that foundation solid.

Chapter 6
Manage Your Properties
In This Chapter
▶ Managing layers
▶ Managing other object properties: color, linetype, and lineweight
▶ Copying layers and other named objects with DesignCenter
C
AD programs are different from other drawing programs. You have to 
pay attention to little details like object properties and the precision 
of the points that you specify when you draw and edit objects. If you ignore 
these details and just start drawing, you’ll end up with a mess of sloppy 
geometry that’s hard to edit, view, and plot.
This chapter introduces you to object properties, one set of AutoCAD tools 
and techniques that help you prevent CAD messes. Chapter 7 explains the 
most important precision drawing techniques that you need to observe in 
order to create usable AutoCAD drawings. The information in these two 
chapters is essential to know before you start drawing and editing objects, 
procedures that I describe in Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11.
When you first start using AutoCAD, one of its most overwhelming features is 
the number of property settings and precision controls that you need to pay 
attention to — even when you draw a simple line. Unlike many other programs, 
it’s not enough to draw a line in a more-or-less adequate location and then 
slap some color on it. But all those settings and controls can inspire the feeling 
that you have to find out how to drive a Formula 1 car to make a trip down the 
street. (The advantage is that after you are comfortable in the driver’s seat, 
AutoCAD will take you on the long-haul trips and get you there faster.)
Following are the three keys to good CAD drawing practice:
 ✓ 
Properties: Pay attention to and manage the properties of every drawing 
object that you create — especially the layer that each drawing object is 
on. I explain layers and other object properties in the next section.
 ✓ 
Named objects: Pay attention to and use the named objects in every 
drawing — the layers, text styles, block definitions, and other non-
graphical objects that serve to define the look of all the graphical objects 

122
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
in the drawing. I enlighten you in the “Using Named Objects” section, 
later in this chapter.
 ✓ 
Precision: Pay attention to and control the precision of every point 
and distance that you use to draw and edit each object. I fill you in on 
AutoCAD’s precision drawing techniques in Chapter 7.
These can seem like daunting tasks at first, but the following sections help 
you cut them down to size.
Managing Your Properties
All the objects that you draw in AutoCAD are like good Monopoly players: 
They own properties. In AutoCAD, these properties aren’t physical things; 
they’re an object’s characteristics, such as layer, color, linetype, lineweight, 
transparency, and plot style. You use properties to communicate information 
about the characteristics of the objects you draw, such as the kinds of real-
world objects they represent, their materials, their relative location in space, 
or their relative importance. In AutoCAD, you also use properties to organize 
objects for editing and plotting purposes.
 
 You can view — and change — all properties of an object in the Properties 
palette and many of them in Quick Properties. In Figure 6-1, the Properties 
palette at the left and the Quick Properties panel at the right show properties 
for the selected line object.
 
 The Properties palette was joined in AutoCAD 2009 by its more streamlined 
little sibling, Quick Properties. When Quick Properties is toggled on in the 
status bar, selecting an object opens a floating panel that displays a custom-
izable selection of that object’s properties. (If your status bar buttons show 
text rather than icons, look for the QP button.)
To toggle the full Properties palette on and off, click the Properties button 
on the View tab of the Ribbon or use the Ctrl+1 key combination. Before you 
select an object, the Properties palette displays the current properties — 
properties that AutoCAD applies to new objects when you draw them. After 
you select an object, the Properties palette displays the properties for that 
object. If you select more than one object, the Properties palette displays the 
properties that they have in common.
 
If the Quick Properties button is turned off in the status bar, you can double-
click most object types, and the Properties palette will open, displaying 
information about that object. If Quick Properties is turned on, single- or dou-
ble-clicking an object opens the Quick Properties panel.

Putting it on a layer
Every object has a layer as one of its properties. You may be familiar with 
layers — independent drawing spaces that stack on top of each other to 
create an overall image — from using drawing programs. AutoCAD, like most 
CAD programs, uses layers as the primary organizing principle for all the 
objects that you draw. You use layers to organize objects into logical groups 
of things that belong together; for example, walls, furniture, and text notes 
usually belong on three separate layers, for a couple of reasons:
 ✓ 
Layers give you a way to turn groups of objects on and off — both on 
the screen and on the plot.
 ✓ 
Layers provide the most efficient way of controlling object color, line-
type, lineweight, and plot style.
So, to work efficiently in AutoCAD, you create some layers, assigning them 
names and properties, such as color and linetype. Then you draw objects 
on those layers. When you draw an object, AutoCAD automatically puts it 
on the current layer — the layer that you see in the Layer drop-down list on 
the Home tab’s Layers panel when no objects are selected. If a layer already 
exists in your drawing, you can make it the current layer by choosing it in the 
Layer drop-down list, as shown in Figure 6-2.
 
It’s not absolutely necessary to create all your layers before you draw any-
thing, but it will save you some time if you start with a few basic layers and 
then add new layers as needed. Many experienced AutoCAD users draw things 
first and then create appropriate layers and change the objects to the new 
layers. You can easily change an object’s layer by selecting it and then choos-
ing the desired new layer name from the Layer drop-down list.

124
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
Figure 6-2: 
Setting an 
existing

Make sure that no objects are selected before you use the Layer drop-down 
list to change the current layer. (Press the Esc key twice to be sure.) If objects 
are selected, the Layer drop-down list displays (and lets you change) those 
objects’ layers. When no objects are selected, the Layer drop-down list dis-
plays (and lets you change) the current layer.
Stacking up your layers
How do you decide what to call your layers and 
which objects to put on them? Some industries 
have developed layer guidelines, and many
 
offices have created documented layer stan-
dards. Some projects even impose specific
 
layer requirements. (But be careful; if someone 
says, “You need a brick layer for this project,” 
that can mean a couple of different things.)
 
Ask experienced CAD drafters in your office or 
industry how they use layers in AutoCAD. If you 
can’t find any definitive answer, create a chart 
of layers for yourself. Each row in the chart
 
should list the layer name, default color, default 
linetype, default lineweight, default transpar-
ency, and what kinds of objects belong on that  
layer. If you use named plot styles to control 
your plotted output, add default plot style to the 
list — that’s not necessary for traditional color-
based plotting.

125
 Chapter 6: Manage Your Properties
Accumulating properties
Besides layers, the remaining object properties that you’re likely to want 
to use often are color, linetype, lineweight, transparency, and possibly plot 
style. Table 6-1 summarizes these five properties.
Table 6-1 
Useful Object Properties

Long before AutoCAD could display lineweights on the screen and print those 
same lineweights on paper, object colors controlled the printed lineweight of 
objects. AutoCAD 2000 introduced a more logical system, where you could 
assign an actual plotted thickness to objects. As logical as that method seems, 
the older method, in which the color of objects determines their plotted line-
weight, continues to dominate. You may find yourself working this way even in 
AutoCAD 2011, for compatibility with drawings (and coworkers) that use the 
old way.
AutoCAD gives you two different ways of controlling object properties:
 ✓ 
By Layer: Each layer has a default color, linetype, lineweight, trans-
parency, and plot style property. Unless you tell AutoCAD otherwise, 
objects inherit the properties of the layers on which they’re created. 
When objects are selected in a drawing created using this system, the 
object properties are listed as ByLayer.
 ✓ 
By Object: AutoCAD also enables you to override an object’s layer’s 
property setting and give the object a specific color, linetype, line-
weight, transparency, or plot style that differs from the layer’s.
 
If you’ve worked with other graphics programs, you may be used to assigning 
properties, such as color, to specific objects. If so, you may be tempted to do 
the same in AutoCAD. Resist the temptation. Did you catch that? One more 
time: Resist the temptation.

126
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
In almost all cases, it’s better to create layers, assign properties to each 
layer, and let the objects on each layer inherit that layer’s properties. Here 
are some benefits of using the ByLayer approach:
 ✓ 
You can easily change the properties of a group of related objects that 
you put on one layer. You simply change the property for the layer, not 
for a bunch of separate objects.
 ✓ 
Experienced drafters use the ByLayer approach, so if you work with 
drawings from other people, you’ll be much more compatible with them 
if you do it the same way. You’ll also avoid getting yelled at by irate CAD 
managers, whose job duties include haranguing any hapless newbie who 
assigns properties to individual objects.
If you take my advice and assign properties ByLayer, all you have to do is 
set layer properties in the Layer Properties Manager palette (I tell you how 
in this section), as shown in Figure 6-3. Before you draw any objects, make 
sure the Color Control, Linetype Control, Lineweight Control drop-down lists, 
and the Transparency button on the Ribbon Home tab’s Properties panel 
are set to ByLayer, as shown in Figure 6-4 (remember that the configuration 
of panels and drop-down lists may vary according to the resolution of your 
display). If the drawing is set to use color-based plot styles instead of named 
plot styles (see Chapter 16), the Plot Style Control drop-down list will be inac-
tive and will display ByColor.
 
Like all palettes in AutoCAD, you can leave the Layer Properties Manager open 
while you do other things in the drawing — unlike the dialog box method of 
stopping what you’re doing, opening the dialog box, making adjustments, clos-
ing the dialog box, and then resuming what you were doing. Also like other 
palettes, the Layer Properties Manager can be set to auto-hide itself to its title 
bar, to be either floating or docked, or to be anchored (do you get the sense 
that there are some AutoCAD programmers who’d rather be sailing?) to either 
side of the screen.

the way.
 
Lineweight control
Color control
Plot Style control
Linetype control
If the drawing is set to use named plot styles instead of color-based plot 
styles (see Chapter 16), the Plot Style control drop-down list should also dis-
play ByLayer.
 
If you want to avoid doing things the wrong way and getting yelled at by CAD 
managers, don’t assign properties to objects in either of these ways:
 ✓ 
Don’t make the very common beginner’s mistake of choosing a specific 
color, linetype, lineweight, transparency, or plot style from the appropri-
ate drop-down list on the Properties panel of the Ribbon’s Home tab, or 
from the Properties palette, and then drawing the objects.
 ✓ 
Don’t make the also-very-common beginner’s mistake of drawing the 
objects, selecting them, and then choosing a property from the same 
drop-down lists.
If you prefer to do things the right way (that is, my way!), assign these prop-
erties ByLayer, as I describe in the following section.
 
AutoCAD’s SETBYLAYER command lets you correct those non-ByLayer 
properties — on the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Modify panel label to 
open its slideout menu, then click Set to ByLayer. Answer the prompts at 
the command line to finish modifying objects. For more information, refer to 
SETBYLAYER in the online help.
Creating new layers
If a suitable layer doesn’t exist, you need to create one in the Layer 
Properties Manager palette. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Layer Properties button on the Layers panel of the Ribbon’s 
Home tab, or type LAYER (or LA) at the command line and press Enter.
 
 The Layer Properties Manager palette appears. A new drawing has 
only one layer: Layer 0. You need to add the layers necessary for your 
drawing.

128
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
2. Click the New Layer button (it looks like a sheet of paper with a little 
sunburst on one corner) to create a new layer.
 
 A new layer appears. AutoCAD names it Layer1 but highlights the name 
in an edit box so you can type a new name to replace it easily, as shown 
in Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Adding a 
new layer 
in the Layer

3. Type a name for the new layer.
 
 Type the layer name with initial caps (only the first letters of words in 
uppercase). Layer names written completely in uppercase are much 
wider, which means that they often get truncated in the Layer Control 
drop-down list.
 
4. On the same line as the new layer, click the color block or color name 
(White by default) of the new layer.
 
 The Select Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
Figure 6-6:

129
 Chapter 6: Manage Your Properties
 
 The normal AutoCAD color scheme — AutoCAD Color Index (ACI) — 
provides 255 colors. So many choices are overkill for ordinary drafting.
 
 For now, stick with the first nine colors — the ones that appear in a 
single, separate row to the left of the ByLayer and ByBlock buttons on 
the Index Color tab of the Select Color dialog box — for the following 
reasons:
 
• These colors are easy to distinguish from one another.
 
• Using a small number of colors makes configuring your plot param-
eters easier. (I describe the procedure in Chapter 16.)
 
 In the Select Color dialog box, the True Color tab offers a choice of 
more than 16 million colors, which you can specify by using HSL (Hue 
Saturation Luminance) or RGB (Red Green Blue) numbers. The Color 
Books tab enables you to use PANTONE and RAL color schemes, which 
are popular in publishing. If your work requires tons of colors or close 
color matching between the computer screen and printed output, you’re 
probably familiar with the relevant color palette and how to use it. If 
you’re using AutoCAD for ordinary drafting or design, stick with the 
AutoCAD Color Index palette.
 
5. Click a color to select it as the color for this layer and click OK.
 
 The Select Color dialog box closes, and focus returns to the Layer 
Properties Manager palette. In the Color column, the new layer color 
changes to either the name or the number of the color that you selected.
 
 AutoCAD’s first seven colors have both numbers and standard names: 
1 = red, 2 = yellow, 3 = green, 4 = cyan, 5 = blue, 6 = magenta, and 7 = 
white (which appears black when displayed on a white background). 
The remaining 248 colors have numbers only.
 
6. On the same line as the new layer, click the Linetype name of the new 
layer.
 
 The Select Linetype dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
 The default AutoCAD linetype is Continuous, which means no gaps in the 
line.
 
Figure 6-7: 
The Select 
Linetype 
dialog box.
 

130
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
 If you already loaded the linetypes you need for your drawing, or if the 
template file you started from has some linetypes loaded, the Select 
Linetype dialog box displays them in the Loaded Linetypes list. If not, 
click the Load button to open the Load or Reload Linetypes dialog box. 
By default, AutoCAD displays linetypes from the standard AutoCAD 
or AutoCAD LT linetype definition file — acad.lin for imperial-units 
drawings or acadiso.lin for metric-units drawings (acadlt.lin and 
acadltiso.lin in AutoCAD LT). Load the desired linetype by selecting 
its name and clicking OK.
 
 Unless you have a really good reason (for example, your boss tells you 
so), avoid loading or using any linetypes labeled ACAD_ISO. These 
linetypes are normally used only in metric drawings — and rarely even 
then. They overrule everything I’m trying to show you about printed 
lineweight in what follows, so if at all possible, just say NO to ACAD_ISO. 
I promise you’ll find it easier to use the linetypes with the more descrip-
tive names: CENTER, DASHED, and so on.
 
7. Click the desired linetype in the Loaded Linetypes list to select it as the 
linetype for the layer; say that really fast five times and then click OK.
 
 The Select Linetype dialog box disappears, returning you to the Layer 
Properties Manager palette. In the Name list, the linetype for the 
selected layer changes to the linetype you just chose.
 
8. On the same line as the new layer, click the new layer’s lineweight.
 
 The Lineweight dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8: 
The 
Lineweight 
dialog box.
 
 
9. Select the lineweight you want from the scrolling list and click OK.
 
 Using the lineweight property is a two-step process. After you’ve 
assigned a lineweight to a layer, you must click the Show/Hide 

131
 Chapter 6: Manage Your Properties
Lineweight button on the status bar to see the effect. You can toggle the 
feature off and on with this button.
 
 The lineweight 0.00 mm tells AutoCAD to use the thinnest possible line-
weight on the screen and on the plot. I recommend that for now, you 
leave lineweight set to Default and instead map screen color to plotted 
lineweight, as described in greater detail in Chapter 16.
 
 AutoCAD 2011’s new transparency property will probably be most 
appreciated by people preparing drawings for presentation. Clicking 
in the Transparency column doesn’t open a dialog box; instead, you 
type a numeric value between 0 and 90. Transparency = 0 is the default 
and means no transparency at all — objects drawn on a layer set to 
Transparency = 0 are completely opaque. Set the value to greater than 0 
and you start seeing things through the objects you draw. 
 
10. In the same line as the new layer, click the value in the Transparency 
column.
 
 By default, layer transparency is set to 0, for no transparency. As you 
increase the numeric value, the degree of transparency increases (the 
maximum value is 90). Similar to the Lineweight property, you have to 
turn on the Transparency button on the status bar to see through your 
objects.
 
 The Plot Style column’s contents depend on whether the drawing uses 
named plot styles or the traditional color-based plotting. Drawings set 
up to use color-based plotting display an unchangeable plot style name 
based on the layer’s color property. The grayed-out style name changes 
only when the layer color changes. If, on the other hand, your drawing 
uses named plot styles, you can assign a named plot style to the layer in 
this column. (Chapter 16 explains why you might not want to.)
 
 The setting in the Plot column controls whether the layer’s objects 
appear on plots. Click the little printer icon to toggle this setting off (the 
little printer gets a red bar through it) for any layer whose objects you 
want to see on the screen but hide on plots.
 
11. (Optional) If you want to add a description to the layer, scroll the 
layer list to the right to see the Description column, click in the 
Description box corresponding to your new layer, and type a 
description.
 
 My advice is to name your layers so you can tell what’s on them. If 
you do choose to use layer descriptions, stretch the Layer Properties 
Manager palette to the right so that you can see the descriptions with-
out having to scroll the layer list.
 
12. Repeat Steps 1 through 11 to create any other layers that you want.

132
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
13. Select the new layer that you want to make current and click the Set 
Current button (the green check mark).
 
 Changes you make in the Layer Properties Manager palette are instan-
taneous, unlike a dialog box in which you have to click OK to close the 
dialog box and apply the change.
 
 Don’t forget to toggle on the Lineweight and Transparency buttons on 
the status bar to see the effect of assigning these properties. Unlike 
color and linetype, lineweight and transparency can be switched off 
and on.
 
 The Layer drop-down list now displays your new layer as the current 
layer — the one on which AutoCAD places new objects that you draw.
After you create layers, you can set any one of them to be the current layer. 
Make sure that no objects are selected and then choose the layer name from 
the Layer Control drop-down list on the Layers panel in the Ribbon or the 
Layers toolbar.
A load of linetypes
When you load a linetype, AutoCAD copies
 
its linetype definition — a formula for how to 
create the dashes, dots, and gaps in that partic-
ular linetype — from the acad.lin (imperial 
units) or acadiso.lin (metric units) file into 
the drawing. (The files are acadlt.lin and 
acadltiso.lin, respectively, in AutoCAD 
LT.) The definition doesn’t automatically appear 
in other drawings; you have to load each line-
type that you want to use into each drawing in  
which you want to use it. If you find yourself 
loading the same linetypes repeatedly into dif-
ferent drawings, consider adding them to your  
template drawings instead. (See Chapter 4 for 
information about templates and how to create 
them.) After you add linetypes to a template
 
drawing, all new drawings that you create from 
that template will start with those linetypes
 
loaded automatically.
Don’t go overboard on loading linetypes. For 
example, you don’t need to load all the linetypes 
in the acad.lin file on the off chance that 
you might use them all someday. The resulting  
linetype list would be long and unwieldy. Most  
drawings require only a few linetypes, and most 
industries and companies settle on a half dozen 
or so linetypes for common use. Your industry,  
office, or project may have guidelines about  
which linetypes to use for which purposes.
If you’re the techno-dweeb type and don’t mind 
editing a text file that contains linetype defini-
tions, you can define your own linetypes or
 
weed out the ones you’ll never use. Press F1 to 
open the main online help window. Then choose 
Customization Guide➪Custom Linetypes.

133
 Chapter 6: Manage Your Properties
Manipulating layers
After you create layers and draw objects on them, you can turn a layer off or 
on to hide or show the objects on that layer. In the Layer Properties Manager 
palette, the first three icons to the right of the layer name control AutoCAD’s 
layer visibility modes:
 ✓ 
Off/On: Click the light-bulb icon to toggle visibility of all objects on the 
selected layer. AutoCAD does not regenerate the drawing when you turn 
layers back on. (I give you the lowdown on regenerations in Chapter 12.)
 ✓ 
Freeze/Thaw: Click the sun icon to toggle off visibility of all objects 
on the selected layer. Click the snowflake icon to toggle visibility on. 
AutoCAD regenerates the drawing when you thaw layers.
 ✓ 
Lock/Unlock: Click the padlock icon to lock and unlock layers. When a 
layer is locked, you can see but not edit objects on that layer.
You can rearrange column order by simply dragging and dropping the 
column label to a new place. And you can right-click any column label to dis-
play a menu from which you can turn columns off and on.
Off/On and Freeze/Thaw do almost the same thing — both settings let you 
make objects visible or invisible by layer. In the old days, turning layers off 
and on was often a faster process than thawing frozen layers because thaw-
ing layers always required regenerating the drawing. But modern computers, 
modern operating systems, and recent AutoCAD releases make regenerations 
much less of an issue on all but the largest drawings. You’ll probably find it 
makes no appreciable difference whether you freeze and thaw layers or turn 
them off and on.
 
You can turn layers off and on, freeze and thaw them, and lock and unlock 
them by clicking the appropriate icons in the Layer Control drop-down list on 
the Ribbon.
The state of your layers
Say you have a floor plan of a house that includes a layer showing the fram-
ing and another layer showing the wiring. You’d probably never show both 
of those elements on the same drawing, so you’d need to do some layer man-
agement when you showed your drawing to the framers or the electricians. 
Rather than turning a dozen layers off and a different dozen layers on when 
you want a different view into your drawing, you can save groups of layer set-
tings as a named layer state. You can manage your layer states in the appro-
priately named Layer States Manager dialog box by clicking the Layer States 
Manager button in the Layer Properties Manager. You can also access the 
Layer States Manager directly by entering LAYERSTATES at the command 

134
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
line or choosing Manage Layer States from the Layer State drop-down list in 
the Layers panel.
 
AutoCAD fades locked layers, giving you a really effective visual reference 
without confusing you about which layers might be locked or not. You can 
control the amount of fading by setting a nonzero value for the system vari-
able LAYLOCKFADECTL. (See Chapter 26 for an explanation of system vari-
ables and check out the online help for specific info on this one.) You can turn 
off fading but retain the current setting for future use by adding a minus sign 
(-) in front of the fade value, or you can turn off the fading altogether by set-
ting this value to 0.
 
If you find yourself using lots of layers, you can create layer filters to make 
viewing and managing the layer list easier. A group filter is simply a subset of 
layers that you choose (by dragging layer names into the group filter name or 
by selecting objects in the drawing). A property filter is a subset of layers that 
AutoCAD creates and updates automatically based on layer property criteria 
that you define (for example, all layers whose names contain Wall or whose 
color is green). To find out more, move your mouse pointer into the Layer 
Properties Manager palette, press F1, and click the New Property Filter 
hyperlink.
In both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, you can access a set of layer tools 
through the Layers panel of the Ribbon’s Home tab (you have to open the 
panel slideout to see them all — see Figure 6-9). Layer Isolate and Layer Off 
are especially useful — you simply click an object to specify the layer to iso-
late (that is, fade all layers except the chosen one) or turn off altogether. For 
more information, open the online help system and choose User’s Guide➪
Create and Modify Objects➪Control the Properties of Objects➪Work with 
Layers➪Use Layers to Manage Complexity.
 
Figure 6-9: 
Tooling 
through the 
layer tools.
 
The LAYISO command incorporates the same layer fading feature described 
in the preceding tip for locked layers — and it locks the layers as well. Set it 
up the way you want by typing S (for Settings) and pressing Enter; then type 
the option letter for the specific settings you want. Look up LAYISO in the 
online help Index for more information.

135
 Chapter 6: Manage Your Properties
 
Instead of turning off a layer when there’s only a few things in the way, you 
can hide or isolate individual objects with AutoCAD 2011’s ISOLATEOBJECTS 
and HIDEOBJECTS commands while keeping normal visibility for other objects 
on the layer. I discuss these commands in Chapter 10.
Using Named Objects
One of the things that can make AutoCAD a tough nut to crack is the some-
what cavalier naming conventions used in the program’s documentation. For 
years, things like lines, arcs, and other graphical items were called entities, 
but more recently, they started being called objects. Fair enough, but object 
has also long been used to define certain non-graphical components of a 
drawing — things that you’d hardly consider to be objects at all — and those 
are the kind of named objects I describe in what follows.
 
Hidden in the innards of every AutoCAD drawing file is a set of named objects. 
Named objects are organized into symbol tables, and the properties that are 
common to all AutoCAD objects are defined in these tables. For example, all 
the line objects in a drawing are stored on one or more layers, so a layer prop-
erty is common to all lines and is defined in the layer table. But the coordinates 
that define the start and end points of a given line are unique to that line (or 
they should be!) — so the coordinate properties are not common to all lines.
Layers are one example of a named object. The layer table in a given drawing 
contains a list of the layers in the current drawing, along with the settings for 
each layer (color, linetype, on/off setting, and so on).
Named objects don’t appear as graphical objects in your drawing. They’re 
like the hard-working pit crew that keeps the race cars running smoothly 
behind the scenes. The named objects you’re likely to use the most include
 ✓ 
Layers (covered in the section “Putting it on a layer,” earlier in this 
chapter)
 ✓ 
Linetypes (covered in the section “Accumulating properties,” earlier in 
this chapter)
 ✓ 
Text styles (see Chapter 13)
 ✓ 
Table styles (see Chapter 13)
 ✓ 
Multi-leader styles (see Chapter 13)
 ✓ 
Multiline styles (not covered in this book; see the online help)
 ✓ 
Dimension styles (see Chapter 14)
 ✓ 
Block definitions and xrefs (see Chapters 17 and 18)
 ✓ 
Layouts (see Chapter 5)

136
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
When you use commands, such as LAYER, LINETYPE, and DIMSTYLE, you’re 
creating and editing named objects. After you’ve created named objects in 
a drawing, AutoCAD DesignCenter gives you the tools to copy them to other 
drawings.
 
Donald Trump might think otherwise, but you can have too many properties 
(at least in AutoCAD). You may have created layers or loaded linetypes, text, 
or dimension styles that you end up not using. If you think you may have 
some of these superfluous named objects in your drawing, the PURGE com-
mand can help you get rid of them. Click the Application button to display the 
Application Menu. Choose Drawing Utilities, and then Purge to open the Purge 
dialog box. You can click the plus sign (+) beside each category and purge 
individual items, or you can click Purge All and get rid of tons of stuff at once. 
Visit the online help for more about purging.
Using AutoCAD DesignCenter
DesignCenter is a dumb name for a useful, if somewhat busy, palette. (At 
least they didn’t call it DesignCenter Manager!) The DesignCenter palette is 
handy for borrowing data from all kinds of drawings. Whereas the Properties 
palette, described in the section “Managing Your Properties,” earlier in this 
chapter, is concerned with properties of graphical objects, the DesignCenter 
palette deals primarily with named objects: layers, linetypes, block defini-
tions, text styles, and other organizational objects in your drawings.
The DesignCenter palette (as shown in Figure 6-10) consists of a toolbar at 
the top, a set of three tabs below that, a tree view pane on the left, and a con-
tent pane on the right. The tree view pane displays a Windows Explorer–like 
navigation panel, showing drawing files and the symbol tables contained in 
each drawing. The content pane usually displays the contents of the selected 
drawing or symbol table.
The three tabs just below the DesignCenter toolbar control what you see in 
the tree view and content panes:
 ✓ 
Folders: This tab shows the folders on your local and network drives, 
just like the Windows Explorer Folders pane does. Use this tab if the

The Autodesk Seek Design Content button on DesignCenter’s toolbar links to 
parts libraries that are available on Autodesk’s Web sites. Autodesk Seek is 
essentially an online catalog of building products. Browse the offerings to see 
whether any of the online libraries can be useful in your work.
The toolbar buttons further refine what you see in the tree view and content 
panes. A few of these buttons toggle different parts of the panes.
The following steps outline the procedure for using DesignCenter to copy 
named objects from one drawing to another. See the next section, “Copying 
layers between drawings,” for a specific example.
 
 
1. If it isn’t already open, switch to the Ribbon’s View tab, find the 
Palettes panel, and click DesignCenter to open the DesignCenter 
palette.
 
 You can also press Ctrl+2 to open this palette.
 
2. Select or load the drawing(s) whose content you want to view or use 
into the navigation pane on the left.
 
 If the source drawing is already open, you can access its content from 
the Open Drawings tab. If the source drawing isn’t open but is stored on 

138
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
your hard drive or network, click Load on the DesignCenter toolbar and 
navigate to the file’s location in the Folders tab.
 
3. In the Open Drawings tab (if the source drawing is currently open) 
or the Folders tab (if the source drawing is not open) of the tree view 
pane, click the plus sign (+) beside the source file to expand the list of 
named object categories.
 
 The list of named object categories appears in a list in the tree view 
pane on the left and as icons in the content pane on the right.
 
4. In the tree view pane, select the category of named object you want to 
copy.
 
 The content pane now displays the individual named objects within the 
named object category. For example, in Figure 6-10 (shown previously), 
the Layers category is selected in the tree view pane, and icons for each 
named layer are shown in the content pane.
 
5. In the content pane, select the items you want to copy. Right-click and 
choose Add [Symbol] (or Insert Block if you’re copying block defini-
tions) or simply drag and drop them into the drawing area.
 
 Use Shift or Ctrl to select multiple named objects.
Copying layers between drawings
The previous set of steps outlines the general procedure for copying named 
objects from one drawing to another by using DesignCenter. The following 
steps show a specific example: copying layers from one drawing to another. 
You can use the same technique to copy dimension styles, layouts, linetypes, 
table styles, text styles, or any of the named objects shown in Figure 6-10.
 
1. Open the drawing that contains the layers you want to copy (the 
source drawing).
 
2. Open the drawing to which you want to copy the layers (the destina-
tion drawing).
 
 If you already had both drawings open, make sure that you can see the 
destination drawing. If you can’t, click Switch Windows in the View tab’s 
Windows panel and choose the destination drawing in order to bring it 
to the foreground, or tile the windows, as shown in Figure 6-11, by click-
ing Tile Vertically in the same Windows panel.
 
3. Click the DesignCenter button on the Palettes panel of the Ribbon’s 
View tab or press Ctrl+2.

4. In the DesignCenter palette, click the Open Drawings tab.
 
 The DesignCenter tree view pane on the left side of the palette displays 
a list of drawings that you currently have open in AutoCAD.
 
 You can also use the Folders tab, the Load button, or the Search button 
to load a drawing into DesignCenter without opening it in AutoCAD.
 
5. In the tree view pane of the DesignCenter palette, click the plus sign 
(+) next to the name of the source drawing that you opened in Step 1.
 
 A list of symbol categories that you can copy, including layers, appears 
in the tree view pane.
 
6. Click Layers in the list in the tree view pane.
 
 The display in the content pane at the right changes to show the indi-
vidual layers that are stored in the source drawing.
 
7. Click and drag the desired layer or layers from the content pane of 
the DesignCenter palette into the window containing the destination 
drawing that you opened in Step 2, as shown in Figure 6-11.

140
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
If the current drawing contains a layer whose name matches the name of one 
of the layers you’re copying, AutoCAD doesn’t change the current drawing’s 
layer definition. For example, if you add a layer named Doors whose color is 
red into a drawing that already includes a Doors layer whose color is green, 
the destination drawing’s Doors layer remains green. Named objects from 
DesignCenter never overwrite objects with the same name in the destination 
drawing. AutoCAD always displays the message Duplicate definitions 
will be ignored even if there aren’t any duplicates.
 
If you’re repeatedly copying named objects from the same drawings or fold-
ers, add them to your DesignCenter favorites list. On the Folders tab, right-
click the drawing or folder and choose Add to Favorites from the menu. This 
procedure adds another shortcut to your list of favorites.
 ✓ 
To see your favorites: Click the DesignCenter toolbar’s Favorites button.
 ✓ 
To return to a favorite: Double-click its shortcut in the content pane.

D
rawing precision is vital to good CAD drafting practice, even more 
than for manual drafting. (Accuracy, of course, is vital to both types of 
drafting — if you’re sketchy on the difference between accuracy and preci-
sion, look ahead to the “CAD precision versus accuracy” sidebar in this chap-
ter.) If you think CAD managers get a little tense when you assign properties 
directly to objects instead of ByLayer, wait until you see them lay into some-
one (I sincerely hope it’s not you!) who doesn’t use precision techniques 
when creating drawings in AutoCAD.
Controlling Your Precision
In AutoCAD, lack of precision makes later editing, hatching, and dimensioning 
tasks much more difficult and time consuming. Keep these facts in mind:
 ✓ 
Small errors in precision in the early stages of creating or editing a draw-
ing often have a big effect on productivity and precision later.
 ✓ 
Drawings may guide manufacturing and construction projects; drawing 
data may drive automatic manufacturing machinery. Huge amounts of 
money and even lives can ride on a drawing’s precision.
In recognition of these facts, a passion for precision permeates the profes-
sion. Precision is one of the characteristics that separates CAD from ordinary 
illustration-type drawing work. The sooner you get fussy about precision in 
AutoCAD, the happier everyone is.

142
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
When I talk about drawing things precisely, I mean using precision tech-
niques and tools to specify points and distances with as much exactness as 
the program allows. Luckily, AutoCAD provides a comprehensive package of 
tools for doing just that. Table 7-1 lists the more important AutoCAD preci-
sion techniques, along with visual cues to the status bar buttons that you 
click to toggle some of the features.
 
As I describe in Chapter 2, you can switch the display on status bar buttons 
between text and icons by right-clicking any of those buttons and selecting 
or unselecting Use Icons. Table 7-1 shows the icons and lists the text for both 
alternatives.
AutoCAD 2011 introduces another P-for-precision technique with parametric 
drawing. In AutoCAD, you’ve always been able to indicate that, for example, 
two circles are concentric by adding dimensions from their center points 
to another point in the drawing. With parametrics, you can add geometric 
relations, which might say that these two circles are always concentric, 
even if they end up being dimensioned from different points in the drawing. 
Parametrics, as you might imagine, is a complex technology, into which I 
delve more deeply in Chapter 19.
 
Precision is especially important when you’re drawing or editing geometry — 
the lines, arcs, and so on that make up whatever you’re representing in the 
CAD drawing. Precision placement usually is less important with notes, lead-
ers, and other annotations that describe, not show.
CAD precision versus accuracy
You often hear the words precision and accu-
racy used interchangeably, but it’s useful to  
understand the difference. In this book, I use 
precision to mean controlling the placement of 
objects so they lie exactly where you want them 
to lie in the drawing. For example, lines whose  
endpoints meet must meet exactly, and a circle 
that’s supposed to be centered on the coordi-
nates 0,0 must be drawn with its center exactly 
at 0,0. I use accuracy to refer to the degree  
to which your drawing matches its real-world 
counterpart. An accurate floor plan is one in 
which the dimensions of the CAD objects equal 
the dimensions of the as-built house. In a sense, 
then, it’s not the drawing that should be accu-
rate — it’s the house!
CAD precision usually helps produce accu-
rate drawings, but that’s not always the case. 
You can produce a precise CAD drawing that’s 
inaccurate because you started from inac-
curate information (for example, the contrac-
tor gave you a wrong field measurement). Or 
you might deliberately exaggerate certain
 
distances to convey the relationship between 
objects more clearly on the plotted drawing. 
Even where you must sacrifice accuracy, aim 
for precision.

Before you draw objects, always check the status bar buttons and set them 
according to your precision needs.
 ✓ 
A button that looks lit (that is, just a little brighter than its neighbors — 
typically, a light blue) indicates that the feature is on.
 ✓ 
A button that looks dimmed (typically, dark gray) indicates that the 
feature is off.
Keyboard capers: Coordinate input
The most direct way to enter points precisely is to type numbers at the key-
board. AutoCAD uses these keyboard coordinate entry formats:
 ✓ 
Absolute Cartesian (X,Y) coordinates in the form X,Y (for example, 7,4)
 ✓ 
Relative X,Y coordinates in the form @X,Y (for example, @3,2)
 ✓ 
Relative polar coordinates in the form @distance<angle (for example, 
@6<45)
Understanding AutoCAD’s 
coordinate systems
AutoCAD stores locational data for every object in a drawing based on a 
centuries-old system of Cartesian, or X,Y coordinates.
Cartesian coordinates are named for French philosopher René “I think, there-
fore I am” Descartes. In his Discourse on Method, Descartes came up with the 
idea of locating any point on a planar surface by measuring its distance from 
the intersection of a pair of axes (that’s axes as in more than one axis, not 
the tool for chopping wood). By convention, the intersection of those axes 
(called, also by convention, the X-axis and the Y-axis) are perpendicular to 
one another, and their intersection point is identified as 0,0. The logical next 
step in this system of X,Y coordinates is to introduce a third axis (called, 
what else, the Z-axis), perpendicular to the plane defined by the X- and 
Y-axes. This one shares the X,Y intersection point of 0,0 and so its coordi-
nates are identified as 0,0,0.
Theoretically, any point in three-dimensional space can be located by a set 
of X,Y,Z coordinates. And, by extension, every point in an AutoCAD draw-
ing file can be identified by its X,Y,Z coordinates (in most 2D drawings, the 
Z-coordinate is 0). This system of coordinates is referred to in AutoCAD as 
the World Coordinate System, or WCS.

145
 Chapter 7: Preciseliness Is Next to CADliness
Introducing User Coordinate Systems
Many times, it’s convenient to define additional coordinate systems to make 
drawing things a little easier, so AutoCAD lets you roll your own. These non–
World Coordinate Systems are called User Coordinate Systems (UCS for short), 
and they’re so widely used that UCS now refers to every coordinate system in 
AutoCAD.
Why would you want to diverge from the standard WCS? Well, the most 
common reason is that you might be working in 3D, and it’s way easier to 
calculate and enter coordinates if they’re based on the plane you want to 
work on. For example, say you’re modeling one of those old-fashioned wedge-
shaped rubber doorstops, and you want to add the manufacturer’s logo to 
the sloping surface of the wedge. That’s not easy if you stay in the WCS, but 
AutoCAD lets you set a new UCS based on that sloping surface. Once that 
UCS is made current, you draw in it just as you draw in the WCS.
UCSs can be useful on two dimensions as well as three. The WCS assumes 
the north direction is straight up — 90 degrees, according to AutoCAD’s 
defaults — but your drawing might work better on a sheet where north 
pointed to the left. Easy enough — create a UCS with north pointing left (I’ll 
leave you to look up this process in the online help — I only have so many 
pages!)
 
It’s generally easier to create a UCS by typing options at the command line, 
but once they’re created, they’re easier to manage through the UCS dialog 
box. Click the UCS, Named UCS button on the View tab’s Coordinates panel, or 
type UCSMAN and press Enter.
AutoCAD’s UCS icon shows you clearly whether you’re in paper space or 
model space, and almost as clearly whether you’re in the WCS or a UCS if 
you’re in model space. For some reason, the AutoCAD programmers have 
made the model space UCS icon harder to see in the last few releases. 
Figure 7-1 shows AutoCAD 2011’s variations on the theme.

146
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
You can use the UCS command in paper space as well as model space, but it’s 
almost always a bad idea. Leave paper space in the WCS to make your plotting 
a whole lot easier.
Drawing by numbers
AutoCAD locates absolute X,Y coordinates with respect to the 0,0 point 
(otherwise known as the origin) of the drawing — usually its lower-left 
corner. AutoCAD locates relative X,Y coordinates and relative polar coordi-
nates with respect to the previous point that you picked or typed. Figure 7-2 
demonstrates how to use all three coordinate formats to draw a pair of line 
segments that start at absolute coordinates 2,1; then go 3 units to the right 
and 2 units up relative to the first point; then, relative to that point, go 4 units 
at an angle of 60 degrees.
 
In case you’re wondering, AutoCAD also understands absolute polar coordi-
nates in the form distance<angle, but this format is almost never useful.

ing from the

147
 Chapter 7: Preciseliness Is Next to CADliness
 
You can find out the X,Y location of your crosshairs by moving them around 
in the drawing area and reading the coordinate values at the left end of the 
status bar. The X,Y coordinates should change as you move the crosshairs. If 
the coordinates don’t change, click the drawing coordinates area until you see 
<Coords on> in the command window.
Astute observers of the full version of AutoCAD will have noticed that there 
are three numbers at the left end of the status bar (AutoCAD LT is numeri-
cally deprived). AutoCAD is actually showing you the X,Y,Z coordinates of 
the crosshairs. However, in 2D drafting, the Z value is (or should be) 0, so 
you can continue calling them X,Y coordinates.
Although it’s not apparent at first, there are, in fact, three coordinate display 
modes. Clicking the coordinates readout cycles through:
 ✓ 
Off (<coords off>): The status bar coordinates readout is dimmed, 
and the coordinate values don’t update until you pick a point.
 ✓ 
On, showing X,Y coordinates (<coords on>): The coordinates readout 
appears black, and the absolute X,Y coordinates update continuously as 
you move the crosshairs. If no command is active, clicking the coordi-
nates readout alternates between this mode and <coords off>.
 ✓ 
On, showing polar coordinates (<coords on>): This mode, which 
displays distance and angle relative to the last point picked rather than 
absolute X,Y values, appears if a command is active and AutoCAD is 
waiting for you to pick a point.
If you start a command such as LINE, pick a point, and then click the 
Coordinates area a few times, the display changes from coordinates off to live 
absolute coordinates (X,Y position) to live polar coordinates (distance and 
angle from the previous point). The live polar coordinates display mode is 
the most informative most of the time.
 
When you type coordinates at the command line, do not add any spaces 
because AutoCAD interprets a space as though you’ve pressed Enter. This 
“Spacebar = Enter” weirdness is a productivity feature that’s been in AutoCAD 
forever. It’s easier to find the spacebar than the Enter key when you’re enter-
ing lots of commands and coordinates in a hurry — and it’s especially handy 
for touch typists who are all thumbs.
 
If you’re working in AutoCAD’s Architectural or Engineering units, the default 
unit of entry is inches, not feet. Here are some things to consider about enter-
ing numeric values when you work in feet and inches:
 ✓ 
To specify feet, you must enter the symbol for feet after the number. For 
example:
 
 6' for 6 feet.

148
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 ✓ 
You can enter a dash to separate feet from inches, as architects often do:
 
 6'–6" is 6 feet, 6 inches.
 ✓ 
Both the dash and the inch mark are optional when you’re entering 
coordinates and distances:
 
 6'6" and 6'6 is the same as 6'–6".
 ✓ 
If you’re typing a coordinate or distance that contains fractional inches, 
you must enter a dash — not a space — between the whole number of 
inches and the fraction:
 
 6'6–1/2 (or 6'–6–1/2) represents 6 feet, 6 1/2 inches.
 ✓ 
If all this dashing about confuses you, enter partial inches by using deci-
mals, instead:
 
 6'6.5 is the same as 6'6–1/2" to AutoCAD, whether you’re working 
in Architectural or Engineering units.
 
Have you ever wanted to check the accuracy (or precision!) of something that’s 
already drawn? AutoCAD 20102011’s MEASUREGEOM command is a one-stop 
shop where you can query drawing objects for distances, angles, areas, and 
other geometric or locational information about drawing objects. You can find it 
on the Utilities panel of the Home tab — look for an icon with a yellow ruler.
Grab an object and make it snappy
After you’ve drawn a few objects precisely in a new drawing, the most effi-
cient way to draw more objects with equal precision is to grab specific, geo-
metrically precise points, such as endpoints, midpoints, or quadrants, on 
the existing objects. Every object type in AutoCAD has at least one of these 
points, and you can “snap” to them precisely as you draw by using object 
snaps (osnaps for short by those in the know).
AutoCAD provides two ways of using object snaps:
 ✓ 
Object snap overrides: An object snap override is active for a single 
pick.
 ✓ 
Running object snaps: A running object snap stays in effect until you 
turn it off.
 
AutoCAD 2011 introduces a new suite of object snaps specifically for working 
in 3D (as usual, 3D features are not included in AutoCAD LT). I cover them 
fully in Chapter 21, but point them out here because the new 3DOSNAP status 
bar button is right next to the regular old OSNAP button, and not so easy to 
distinguish from it. In this section, you use the regular OSNAP button that 
shows the square with the sunburst at the top-left corner, not the 3D-looking 
box with the sunburst at the bottom-left corner.

149
 Chapter 7: Preciseliness Is Next to CADliness
Grabbing points with object snap overrides
Here’s how you draw precise lines by using object snap overrides:
 
1. Open a drawing containing some geometry.
 
 
2. Turn off running object snap mode by clicking the Object Snap button 
on the status bar until the button appears to be dimmed and <Osnap 
off> appears in the command window.
  
Although you can use object snap overrides while running object snap 
mode is enabled, I recommend that you turn off running object snaps 
while you’re getting familiar with object snap overrides. After you’ve got 
the hang of each feature separately, you can use them together.
 
3. Start the LINE command by clicking the Line button on the Ribbon’s 
Draw panel or typing LINE (or L) and pressing Enter.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select the starting point of the line:
Specify first point:
 
4. Hold down the Shift key, right-click anywhere in the drawing area, 
and release the Shift key.
 
 The Object Snap menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.

150
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
5. Choose an Object Snap mode, such as Endpoint, from the object snap 
menu.
 
 The Object Snap menu disappears, and the command window displays 
an additional prompt indicating that you’ve directed AutoCAD to seek 
out, for example, endpoints of existing objects:
_endp of:
 
6. Move the crosshairs slowly around the drawing, pausing over various 
lines and other objects without clicking yet.
 
 When you move the crosshairs near an object with an endpoint, a col-
ored square icon appears at the endpoint, indicating that AutoCAD can 
snap to that point. If you stop moving the crosshairs for a moment, 
a tooltip displaying the Object Snap mode (for example, Endpoint) 
appears to reinforce the idea.
 
7. Click when the Endpoint object snap square appears on the point you 
want to snap to.
 
 AutoCAD snaps to the endpoint, which becomes the first point of the 
new line segment that you’re about to draw. The command line prompts 
you to select the other endpoint of the new line segment:
Specify next point or [Undo]:
 
 When you move the crosshairs around the drawing, AutoCAD no longer 
seeks out endpoints because object snap overrides last for only a single 
pick. You can use the object snap right-click menu again to snap the 
other end of your new line segment to another point on an existing 
object.
 
8. Use the Shift+right-click sequence described in Step 4 to display the 
Object Snap menu again. Then choose another Object Snap mode, 
such as Midpoint, from the object snap menu.
 
 The command line displays an additional prompt indicating that you’ve 
directed AutoCAD to seek, for example, midpoints of existing objects:
_mid of:
 
 When you move the crosshairs near the midpoint of an object, a colored 
triangle appears at the snap point. Each object snap type (endpoint, 
midpoint, intersection, and so on) displays a different symbol. If you stop 
moving the crosshairs, the tooltip text reminds you what the symbol 
means. Figure 7-4 shows what the screen looks like during this step.
 
9. Draw additional line segments by picking additional points. Use the 
Object Snap right-click menu to specify a single object snap type 
before you pick each point.
 
 Try the Intersection, Perpendicular, and Nearest object snaps. If your 
drawing contains arcs or circles, try Center and Quadrant.

10. When you’re finished experimenting with object snap overrides, right-
click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the menu 
to end the LINE command.
 
 There’s a difference between right-clicking and Shift+right-clicking in the 
drawing area:
 • 
Right-clicking: Displays menu options for the current command (or 
common commands and settings when no command is active).
 • 
Shift+right-clicking: Always displays the same Object Snap menu.
Running with object snaps
Often, you use an object snap setting (such as Endpoint) repeatedly. Use run-
ning object snaps to address this need.
The following steps set a running object snap:
 
 
1. Right-click the OSNAP button on the status bar.
 
 
 The Object Snap menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.

152
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
 Many status bar buttons display shortcut menus when you right-click, as 
shown in Figure 7-5. (Object Snap and Object Snap Tracking both display 
the menu of running object snaps.) Many settings, including all running 
object snap types, can be set by clicking a menu item — you no longer 
need to open the Drafting Settings dialog box, make your settings, and 
then click OK to close the dialog box.

tures is an

2. Click in the menu to select one or more Object Snap settings.
 
 Active running object snap settings show a highlighted square around 
the icon (see Figure 7-5).
You click the Object Snap button on the status bar to toggle running object 
snap mode. After you turn on running object snap, AutoCAD hunts for points 
that correspond to the object snaps you checked on the Object Snap button’s 
right-click menu. As with object snap overrides, AutoCAD displays a special 
symbol — such as a square for an Endpoint object snap — to indicate that it 
has found an object snap point. If you keep the crosshairs still, AutoCAD also 
displays a tooltip that lists the kind of object snap point.
Use object snap overrides or running object snaps to enforce precision by 
making sure that new points you pick coincide exactly with points on existing 
objects. In AutoCAD, it’s not good enough for points to almost coincide or to 
look like they coincide. You lose points, both figuratively and literally, if you 
don’t use object snaps or one of the other precision techniques covered in 
this chapter to enforce precision.

153
 Chapter 7: Preciseliness Is Next to CADliness
 
Most, but not all, object snap overrides have running object snap equivalents. 
For example, Endpoint, Midpoint, and Center work as either overrides or run-
ning object snaps, but Mid Between 2 Points works only in Override mode.
Other Practical Precision Procedures
The following are some other AutoCAD precision techniques (refer to Table 7-1):
 
 ✓ 
Snap: If you turn on Snap mode, AutoCAD constrains the crosshairs to 
an imaginary rectangular grid of points at the spacing that you’ve speci-
fied. Follow these steps to turn on Snap mode:
 
1. Right-click the Snap Mode button on the status bar.
 2. 
Choose Settings.
 
 The Snap and Grid tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a snap spacing in the Snap X Spacing field and click OK.
 
 Click the Snap Mode button on the status bar (labeled SNAP if your 
status bar buttons show text) or press F9 to toggle snap mode off and 
on. To use snap effectively, change the snap spacing frequently — 
changing to a smaller spacing as you zoom in and work on smaller areas. 
You often need to toggle snap off and on because selecting objects and 
doing some editing tasks are easier with snap off.
 
 In AutoCAD 2011, you can switch between Grid Snap (that is, snap points 
in rows and columns) and PolarSnap (snap points based on distances 
and angles) using the Snap Mode button’s shortcut menu. See the 
PolarSnap item later in this list for more info.
 
 ✓ 
Ortho: Ortho mode forces the crosshairs to move horizontally or verti-
cally relative to the current coordinate system’s X- and Y-axes. Click the 
Ortho Mode button (ORTHO for text buttons) on the status bar or press 
F8 to toggle Ortho mode. Because technical drawings often include lots 
of orthogonal lines, you may use Ortho mode a lot, although take a close 
look at polar tracking as well.
 ✓ 
Direct distance entry (DDE): This point-and-type technique is an easy 
and efficient way to draw with precision. You simply point the cross-
hairs in a particular direction, type a distance at the command line, and 
press Enter. You can use DDE any time the crosshairs are anchored to a 
point, and the command line or dynamic input tooltip prompts you for 
another point or a distance.
 
 You’ll usually use DDE with polar tracking turned on to specify distances 
in particular directions (for example, in angle increments of 45 degrees). 
You can also combine DDE with Ortho mode to specify a distance in an 
orthogonal direction (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees).

 ✓ 
Object snap tracking: This feature extends running object snaps so that 
you can locate points based on more than one object snap point. For 
example, you can define a point at the center of a square by tracking to 
the midpoints of two perpendicular sides. Click Object Snap Tracking on 
the status bar (if you’re showing text instead of icons, this button is 
labeled OTRACK — which has nothing at all to do with the Irish railway 
system) or press F11 to toggle object snap tracking.
 
 ✓ 
Polar tracking: When you turn on polar tracking, the crosshairs jump to 
increments of the angle you specified in the Drafting Settings dialog box 
or chose on the right-click menu. When the crosshairs jump, a tooltip 
label starting with Polar: appears. Right-click the Polar Tracking 
button on the status bar (POLAR on buttons that show text labels) and 
choose the Settings option to display the Polar Tracking tab on the 
Drafting Settings dialog box. Select an angle from the Increment Angle 
drop-down list and then click OK. Click the Polar Tracking button on the 
status bar or press F10 to toggle Polar Tracking mode.
 
 Remember, you can set a predefined polar tracking angle by right-click-
ing the Polar Tracking button and choosing it from the menu. If you want 
to add an angle that’s not on the list, you have to click Settings to open 
the Drafting Settings dialog box.
 ✓ 
PolarSnap: You can force polar tracking to jump to specific incremental 
distances along the tracking angles by changing the snap type from grid 
snap to PolarSnap. For example, if you turn on polar tracking and set it 
to 45 degrees, then turn on PolarSnap and set it to 2 units, polar tracking 
jumps to points that are at angle increments of 45 degrees and distance 
increments of 2 units from the previous point. Polar Snap has a similar 
effect on object snap tracking.
 
 To activate PolarSnap, right-click the Snap Mode button and choose 
PolarSnap from the menu. To specify a PolarSnap distance, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Right-click the SNAP button on the status bar.
 2. 
Choose Settings.
 
 The Snap and Grid tab on the Drafting Settings dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the PolarSnap radio button, type a distance in the Polar 
Distance text box, and then click OK.
 
 When you want to return to ordinary rectangular snap, as described at 
the beginning of this list, right-click the Snap Mode button and choose 
Grid Snap from the menu.
 ✓ 
Temporary overrides: Settings, such as SNAP, ORTHO, and POLAR 
remain on until you turn them off. You can also use temporary overrides, 
which last only as long as you hold down their key or key combination. 
For example, with ortho turned off, holding down the Shift key puts 
AutoCAD into a temporary Ortho mode for as long as you press Shift. 
For additional information, visit the online help system.

 Chapter 7: Preciseliness Is Next to CADliness
 
If you’re new to AutoCAD, its wide range of precision tools probably seems 
overwhelming at this point. Rest assured that there’s more than one way to 
skin a cat precisely (with cats, accuracy is unimportant), and not everyone 
needs to understand all the ways. You can make perfectly precise drawings 
without using every single implement in AutoCAD’s precision toolkit. I recom-
mend these steps:
 
1. Get comfortable with typing coordinates, Ortho mode, direct distance 
entry, and object snap overrides.
 
2. Become familiar with running object snaps and try Snap mode.
 
3. After you have all these precision features under your belt, feel free to 
experiment with polar tracking, PolarSnap, and object snap tracking.
 
It’s easy to confuse the names of the snap and object snap (osnap) features. 
Remember that snap limits the crosshairs to locations whose coordinates 
are multiples of the current snap spacing. Snap works whether or not there 
are objects in the drawing. Object snap (osnap) enables you to grab points on 
existing objects, whether or not those points happen to correspond with the 
snap spacing.

Down the Straightaway
In This Chapter
▶ Drawing linear things with the AutoCAD drawing commands
▶ Lining up for lines and polylines
▶ Closing up with rectangles and polygons
A
s you probably remember from your crayon and coloring book days, 
drawing stuff is fun. CAD imposes a little more discipline, but draw-
ing stuff with AutoCAD is still fun (trust me on this one). In computer-aided 
drafting, you usually start by drawing geometry — shapes such as lines, 
circles, rectangles, and so on — that represents the real-world object that 
you’re documenting. This chapter shows you how to draw linear geometry — 
objects that proceed in a straightforward manner from one point to the next. 
In Chapter 9, I throw some curves at you.
After you’ve created some straight or curvy geometry, you’ll probably need 
to add some dimensions, text, and hatching, but those elements come later 
(in Part III of this book). Or you may want to use that geometry as the basis 
for some cool 3D modeling (I introduce you to that topic in Part V). Your first 
task is to get the geometry right; then you can worry about labeling things.
 
Drawing geometry properly in AutoCAD depends on paying attention to object 
properties and the precision of the points that you specify to create the 
objects. I cover these matters in Chapters 6 and 7, so if you eagerly jumped to 
this chapter to get right to the fun stuff, take a moment to review those chap-
ters first.

Introducing the AutoCAD 
Drawing Commands
For descriptive purposes, I’m dividing the drawing commands into three 
groups:
 ✓ 
Straight lines and objects composed of straight lines (covered in this 
chapter)
 ✓ 
Curves (which I explain in Chapter 9)
 ✓ 
Points (see Chapter 9 if you’re wondering what the point is)
Table 8-1 presents the most important commands for drawing 2D linear 
objects in AutoCAD. It lists each command by name, with the shortcut keys, 
or alias (when one exists), in parentheses. The table also displays each com-
mand’s graphical icon, as found on the Draw panel of the Ribbon’s Home 
tab, and in identical form on toolbar buttons and pull-down menus in the 
AutoCAD Classic workspace.

 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
If you’re coming from AutoCAD 2008 or earlier, AutoCAD 2011’s Ribbon is 
obviously very different from what you’re used to; it’s even a little different 
from the Ribbon in AutoCAD 2009. Like many Ribbon panels, the Draw panel 
has additional tool buttons on a slideout you can use once or pin so it stays 
open — refer to Chapter 2 for a refresher on Ribbon panels and slideouts. 
Similarly, many of the choices on the AutoCAD Draw menu open submenus 
containing several variations on each drawing command.
AutoCAD’s drawing commands are highly interactive. You need to read and 
respond to the prompts in the command window (or at the dynamic input 
tooltip next to the crosshairs if Dynamic Input mode is turned on). You can 
also access many of the command options that you see in command window 
prompts by pressing the up- and down-arrow keys to display the options 
at the dynamic input tooltip. You can even right-click and select command 
options from the context-specific shortcut menu.
 
AutoCAD’s Dynamic Input system displays a lot of the information that you 
used to have to look down to the command window to see. To use Dynamic 
Input, make sure the Dynamic Input button on the status bar is turned on 
(that is, it looks highlighted). You can also press the F12 function key to 
toggle Dynamic Input on and off. Don’t turn the command window off just yet, 
though — especially if you’re new to AutoCAD. I recommend that you keep the 
command window open and docked at all times.
So what’s the best course: to enter drawing commands from the command 
line, which you can do in any workspace? Or to choose commands from the 
Ribbon in the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace, or the AutoCAD Classic 
workspace’s menus or toolbars? Well . . . it all depends:
 ✓ 
If you’ve never used AutoCAD in your life: Use the Ribbon (that is, the 
default 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace) rather than the toolbars 
and menus of the traditional AutoCAD Classic workspace. Thanks to 
Microsoft’s clout in the user-interface world, I don’t think the Ribbon is 
going away. I suspect more and more programs are going to adopt its 
look, if for no other reason than to avoid looking old-fashioned.
 ✓ 
If you’re an experienced AutoCAD user who’s been away for a release 
or two: Give the Ribbon a decent test drive before you switch to the 
AutoCAD Classic workspace. To ease your transition, you can display 
the classic menu bar above the Ribbon. Simply click the down arrow at 
the right end of the Quick Access toolbar and choose Show Menu Bar 
(see Figure 8-1).
 
Whichever kind of user you are and regardless of the workspace you choose, 
it’s a truth universally acknowledged that the most efficient way of work-
ing with AutoCAD is to use the keyboard to enter command aliases or open 
and close palettes. No matter how many times the graphical user interface 
changes, just remember that you can always use the system that’s been part 

160

of AutoCAD since version 1.0 in 1982: Use the keyboard and let your fingers do 
the talking.

The Straight and Narrow: Lines, 
Polylines, and Polygons
As I harp on a bunch of times elsewhere in this book, CAD programs are 
for precision drawing, so you’ll spend a lot of your AutoCAD time drawing 
objects composed of straight-line segments. This rest of the chapter covers 
these commands:
 ✓ 
LINE (L): Draws a series of straight line segments; each segment is a 
separate object.
 ✓ 
PLINE (PL): Draws a polyline — a series of straight and/or curved line 
segments. (Yes, I’m cheating a bit here — curvy things are covered in 
Chapter 9 — but I didn’t want you to have to read about one command 
in two different places!) All the segments remain connected to each 
other as a single object.
 ✓ 
RECTANG (REC): Draws a polyline in the shape of a rectangle.
 ✓ 
POLYGON (POL): Draws a polyline in the shape of a regular polygon 
(that is, a closed shape with all sides equal and all angles equal).

161
 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
The following additional straight-line drawing commands are also available in 
AutoCAD:
 ✓ 
RAY: Draws a line that starts at a point and just keeps on going; a ray 
therefore is a line that extends infinitely in one direction.
 ✓ 
XLINE (XL): Draws a line that passes through a point and extends infi-
nitely in both directions.
 
The RAY and XLINE commands are used to draw construction lines that guide 
the construction of additional geometry. Drawing construction lines is less 
common in AutoCAD than in some other CAD programs. AutoCAD’s many 
precision techniques often provide more efficient methods for creating new 
geometry than adding construction lines to your drawing does.
Toeing the line
The LINE command in AutoCAD draws a series of one or more visually con-
nected line segments. Although the lines appear to be physically connected, 
in fact, each segment, or piece of a line with endpoints, is a separate object. 
This construction doesn’t seem like a big deal until you try to move or oth-
erwise edit a series of segments that you drew with the LINE command; you 
must select every piece separately. To avoid such a hassle, use polylines 
(described in the following section), not lines (or lines and arcs), when you 
want the connected segments to act as a single object.
If you’re used to drawing lines in other programs, you may find it confusing at 
first that AutoCAD’s LINE command doesn’t stop after you draw a single seg-
ment. AutoCAD keeps prompting you to specify additional points so that you 
can draw a series of (apparently) connected segments. When you’re finished 
drawing segments, just press Enter to finish the LINE command.
Unlike a lot of the AutoCAD drawing commands, LINE doesn’t offer a bunch of 
potentially confusing options. It has a Close option to create a closed polygo-
nal shape and an Undo option to remove the most recent segment that you 
drew.
 
Like all drawing commands, LINE puts the line segments that it draws on the 
current layer and uses the current color, linetype, lineweight, transparency, 
and plot style properties. When you’re doing real drafting, as opposed to just 
experimenting, make sure of the following:
 ✓ 
Think about setting these properties before you start drawing. Although 
you can easily change an object’s layer or other object properties, it’s 
often more efficient to set properties first. (I recommend that you set 
color, linetype, lineweight, transparency, and, if you’re using named plot 

162
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
styles, plot style to ByLayer.) See Chapter 6 for information on setting 
the current properties with the Properties toolbar.
 ✓ 
Make sure that you use one of AutoCAD’s precision tools, such as object 
snaps, typed coordinates, or tracking, to ensure that you specify each 
object point precisely. Chapter 7 describes these tools.
Follow these steps to draw a series of line segments by using the LINE 
command:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the line segments that you’ll draw.
 
2. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.
 
 The panels on the Home tab contain the most commonly used com-
mands in AutoCAD.
 
 
3. Click the Line button on the Draw panel of the Ribbon’s Home tab, or 
type L and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the LINE command and prompts you to select the first 
point.
 
4. Specify the starting point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 Remember to use one of the precision techniques I describe in Chapters 
6 and 7 if you’re doing real drafting. For the first point, object snap, 
snap, and typing coordinates all work well.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the other endpoint of the first line seg-
ment. The command window prompt shows
Specify next point or [Undo]:
 
 You can also see command prompts at the dynamic input tooltip beside 
the crosshairs by pressing the down-arrow key (press F12 or click the 
Dynamic Input status bar button to enable Dynamic Input mode). The 
arrow icon on the dynamic input tooltip is your indicator that there are 
options available.
 
5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
 
 Again, use one of the AutoCAD precision techniques if you’re doing real 
drafting. For the second and subsequent points, all the techniques men-
tioned in Step 4 work well, as do ortho, polar, object snap tracking, and 
direct distance entry.
 
 After you specify the third point, AutoCAD adds the Close option. The 
command prompt shows
Specify next point or [Close/Undo]:

163
 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
 
6. When you’re finished drawing segments, end with one of these steps:
 
• Either press Enter or right-click anywhere in the drawing area and 
choose Enter from the right-click menu to leave the figure open.
 • 
Type C and press Enter or press the down arrow on your keyboard 
and choose Close from the menu (as shown in Figure 8-2) to close 
the figure.
 
 In either case, the blank command prompt indicates that the LINE com-
mand is finished:
Command:

Connecting the lines with polyline
The LINE command is fine for some drawing tasks, but the PLINE command 
is a better, more flexible choice in many situations. The PLINE command 
draws a special kind of object called a polyline. You may hear CAD drafters 
refer to a polyline as a pline (rhymes with beeline) because of the command 
name.

164
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
The most important differences between the LINE and PLINE commands are 
these:
 ✓ 
The LINE command draws a series of separate line segments. Even 
though they appear to be connected on the screen, each segment is a 
separate object. If you move one line segment, the other segments that 
you drew at the same time don’t move with it.
 ✓ 
The PLINE command draws a single, connected, multisegment object. 
If you select any segment for editing, your changes affect the entire poly-
line. Figure 8-3 shows how the same sketch drawn with the LINE and the 
PLINE commands responds when you select one of the objects.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Results of 
drawing 
with the 
LINE and 
PLINE 
commands.
 Each segment is a separate object
All segments form one object
 
 Use PLINE instead of LINE in most cases where you need to draw a 
series of connected line segments. If you’re drawing a series of end-to-
end segments, there’s a good chance that those segments are logically 
connected — for example, they might represent the outline of a single 
object or a continuous pathway. If the segments are connected logically, 
it makes sense to keep them connected in AutoCAD. The most obvious 
practical benefit of grouping segments together into a polyline is that 
many editing operations are more efficient when you use polylines. 
When you select any segment in a polyline for editing, the entire polyline 
is affected.
 ✓ 
The PLINE command can draw curved segments as well as straight 
ones. If you want a combination of separate linear and curved segments 
you must switch back and forth between the LINE and ARC commands 

165
 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
(I cover arcs in Chapter 9). With PLINE you can switch between linear or 
circular-curve sections by choosing the command options described in 
the steps that come after this list.
 ✓ 
Polylines can have width. Polyline segment width is visually similar 
to AutoCAD’s lineweight object property, except that polyline segment 
width can be uniform or tapered. The ability to create polyline segments 
with line widths was more important in the old days, before AutoCAD 
had lineweight as an object property. People used to draw polylines 
with a small amount of width to show the segments as just slightly 
bolder than regular lines, which are always displayed as a single pixel 
wide. Nowadays, it’s easier and more efficient to achieve this effect 
with object lineweights (as described in Chapter 6) or plot styles (as 
described in Chapter 16).
After you create a polyline, you can adjust its segments by grip editing any of 
the vertex points. (The little squares on the vertices in Figure 8-3 are called 
grips; see Chapter 10 for details on grip editing.) For more complicated poly-
line editing tasks, you can use the PEDIT command to edit the polyline, or 
you can convert the polyline to a collection of line and arc segments by using 
the EXPLODE command — although you lose any width defined for each seg-
ment when you explode a polyline. For more information on these two com-
mands, look them up in the index of the online help.
 
AutoCAD 2011 shows additional polyline grips when you select a polyline for 
editing. Instead of displaying grips at segment endpoints only as in previous 
releases, AutoCAD now displays grips at midpoints of segments as well as end-
points, as shown in Figure 8-3. Also new is the ability to click a grip to display 
a menu of options for editing polylines, including adding and removing verti-
ces, and converting line segments to arc segments and vice versa.
Drawing polylines composed of straight segments is pretty much like draw-
ing with the LINE command, as demonstrated in the following procedure. The 
PLINE command has lots of options, so watch the prompts! If Dynamic Input 
is on, use the down-arrow key to see the options listed at the crosshairs, or 
right-click to display the PLINE right-click menu, or simply read the command 
line.
To draw a polyline composed of straight segments, follow these steps:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the line segments that you’ll draw.
 
 
2. Click the Polyline button on the Ribbon’s Draw panel or type PL and 
press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the PLINE command and prompts you to specify a start 
point.
 
3. Specify the starting point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.

166
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
 AutoCAD displays the current polyline segment line width at the com-
mand line and prompts you to specify the other endpoint of the first 
polyline segment:
Current line-width is 0.0000
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/
Width]:
 
4. If the current line width isn’t zero, change it to zero by typing W 
to select the Width option, and then entering 0 as the starting and 
ending widths as shown in the following command line sequence:
Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/
Width]: W
Enter Specify starting width <0.0000>: 0
Enter Specify ending width <0.0000>: 0
Enter Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/
Undo/Width]:
 
 Despite what you may think, a zero-width polyline segment isn’t the 
AutoCAD equivalent of drawing with invisible ink. Zero width means “dis-
play this segment using the normal, single-pixel width on the screen.”
 
5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
 
 After you specify the second point, AutoCAD adds the Close option to 
the prompt. The command line shows
Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/
Undo/Width]:
 
 In addition, you can view and choose options from the dynamic input 
options list, as shown in Figure 8-4, by pressing the down arrow on your 
keyboard.
 
Figure 8-4:

 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
 
6. After you finish drawing segments, either press Enter (to leave the 
figure open) or type C and press Enter (to close it).
 
 AutoCAD draws the final segment. The blank command line indicates 
that the PLINE command is finished.
In the following procedure, I spice things up a bit and give you a preview of 
coming (curvy) attractions (in Chapter 9) by adding an arc segment to a 
polyline.
 
Just so you know, curved segments in polylines are circular arcs — pieces of 
circles with center points that you can draw with AutoCAD’s ARC command. 
AutoCAD can draw other kinds of curves, including ellipses and splines, but 
not within the PLINE command.
To draw a polyline that includes curved segments, follow these steps:
 
1. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 of the previous procedure.
 
2. When you’re ready to add one or more arc segments, type A and press 
Enter to select the Arc option.
 
 The prompt changes to show arc segment options. Most of these 
options correspond to the many ways of drawing circular arcs in 
AutoCAD; see the section on arcs in Chapter 9. The command line shows
Specify endpoint of arc or [Angle/CEnter/CLose/
    Direction/Halfwidth/Line/Radius/Second
    pt/Undo/Width]:
 
3. Specify the endpoint of the arc by clicking a point or typing 
coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD draws the curved segment of the polyline. The prompts con-
tinue to show arc segment options.
 
 Your options at this point include
 
• Specifying additional points to draw more arc segments.
 
• Choosing another arc-drawing method (such as Center or 
Second pt).
 
• Returning to drawing straight-line segments with the Line option.
 
 In this example, you return to drawing straight-line segments.
 
 Perhaps the most useful of the alternative arc-drawing methods is 
Second pt. That gives you more control over the direction of the arc, but 
at the cost of losing tangency of adjacent segments. Sometimes it’s best 
not to go off on a tangent, anyway.

168
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
4. Type L and press Enter to select the Line option.
Specify endpoint of arc or [Angle/CEnter/CLose/
Direction/Halfwidth/Line/Radius/Second pt/
Undo/Width]: L
 
 The prompt changes back to showing straight-line segment options.
Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/
Undo/Width]:
 
5. Specify additional points by clicking or typing.
 
6. After you’re finished drawing segments, either press Enter or type C 
and press Enter.
Figure 8-5 shows some of the things that you can draw with the PLINE com-
mand by using straight segments, arc segments, or a combination of both.
 
Figure 8-5: 
A plethora

The LINE and PLINE commands work well for drawing a series of end-to-end 
single lines, but what if you want to draw a series of double lines to represent, 
for example, the edges of a wall or roadway? Here are some options:
 ✓ 
Use the AutoCAD MLINE command to draw multilines — series of two or 
more parallel straight lines. The AutoCAD multiline feature was full of 
limitations when it debuted way back in 1994 (in the notorious Release 
13), and despite some minor tweaks in AutoCAD 2006, it hasn’t improved 
significantly since then. Look up the MLINE and MLSTYLE commands 
in AutoCAD’s online help system if you’d like to tangle with this feature, 
but be prepared to spend time experimenting and struggling.

169
 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
 
✓ In AutoCAD LT only, use the DLINE (DL), or Double Line, command to 
draw pairs of parallel line and/or arc segments. AutoCAD LT doesn’t 
include the MLINE command, which, given MLINE’s problems, is more of 
a blessing than a limitation. AutoCAD, on the other hand, doesn’t include 
the DLINE command. (Score one for the little brother!)
 ✓ 
Use the PLINE command to draw a single set of connected line and/or 
arc segments, and then use the OFFSET command to create one or more 
sets of parallel segments. Chapter 11 covers the OFFSET command.
Squaring off with rectangles
You can use the PLINE or LINE command to draw a rectangle segment by seg-
ment. In most cases, though, you’ll find it easier to use the special-purpose 
RECTANG command. The following procedure demonstrates how:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the line segments that you’ll draw.
 
 
2. Click the Rectangle button on the Home tab’s Draw panel or type REC 
and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the RECTANG command and prompts you to specify a 
point for one corner of the rectangle. The command line shows
Specify first corner point or [Chamfer/Elevation/
Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
 
 You can add fancy effects with the additional command options. The 
default options work best for most purposes. Look up RECTANG in the 
AutoCAD help system if you want to know more about the options.
 
3. Specify the first corner by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the other corner of the rectangle — the 
one that’s diagonally opposite from the first corner.
Specify other corner point or [Area/Dimensions/
Rotation]:
 
4. Specify the other corner by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 If you know the size of the rectangle that you want to draw (for example, 
100 units long by 75 units high), type relative coordinates to specify the 
dimensions — for example, @100,75, or just 100,75 if dynamic input is 
enabled. (Chapter 7 describes how to type coordinates.)
 
 AutoCAD draws the rectangle.

170
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Unlike the neglected MLINE command, the RECTANG command has improved 
considerably since its debut. You can specify a rotation angle and — very 
handy for space planners — you can provide one dimension and an area. 
RECTANG will calculate the length of the other side and draw the rectangle.
Choosing your sides with polygon
Rectangles and other closed polylines are types of polygons, or closed fig-
ures with three or more sides. The AutoCAD POLYGON command provides 
a quick way of drawing regular polygons — polygons in which all sides and 
angles are equal.
The following procedure demonstrates the POLYGON command:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the line segments that you’ll draw.
 
 
2. Click the Polygon button on the Home tab’s Draw panel slideout or 
type POL and press Enter.
 
 
 AutoCAD starts the POLYGON command and prompts you to enter the 
number of sides for the polygon.
Enter number of sides <4>:
 
3. Type the number of sides for the polygon that you want to draw and 
press Enter.
 
 Your polygon can have between 3 and 1,024 sides.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the center point of the polygon.
Specify center of polygon or [Edge]:
 
 You can use the Edge option to draw a polygon by specifying the length 
of one side instead of the center and radius of an imaginary inscribed 
or circumscribed circle. The imaginary circle method is much more 
common.
 
4. Specify the center point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify whether the polygon will be inscribed 
in (that is, the corners touch the circumference of the circle) or circum-
scribed about (that is, the sides are tangent to the circle) an imaginary 
circle whose radius you will specify in Step 6:
Enter an option [Inscribed in circle/Circumscribed 
about circle] <I>:

171
 Chapter 8: Down the Straightaway
 5. 
Type I (for inscribed) or C (for circumscribed), and press Enter.
 
 The command line prompts you to specify the radius of an imaginary 
circle.
Specify radius of circle:
 
6. Specify the radius by typing a distance or clicking a point.
 
 AutoCAD draws the polygon.
 
 If you type a distance or you click a point with ortho turned on, the poly-
gon will be aligned orthogonally, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Figure 8-6 shows the results of drawing plenty of polygons — a practice 
known as polygony, which, as far as I know, is legal nearly everywhere.

lthough straight-line segments predominate in many CAD drawings, 
even the most humdrum, rectilinear design is likely to have a few 
curves. And if you’re drawing Audi car bodies or Gaudí buildings, your draw-
ings are going to contain a lot of curves! Your drawings should also have a 
point; in fact, they may have several points, so at the end of this chapter, I fill 
you in on creating point objects in AutoCAD. But to begin, I show you how to 
use the following AutoCAD curve-drawing commands:
 ✓ 
CIRCLE: Draws circles. (You were expecting hyperbolic paraboloids, 
maybe?)
 ✓ 
ARC: Draws circular arcs — arcs with center points and fixed radii, not 
arcs cut from ellipses, parabolas, or some other complex curve.
 ✓ 
ELLIPSE: Draws ellipses and elliptical arcs.
 ✓ 
SPLINE: Draws smoothly flowing curves of a variety of shapes.
 ✓ 
DONUT: Draws filled-in rings and circles.
 ✓ 
REVCLOUD: Draws freeform “clouds,” the most common application of 
which is to indicate revised areas in the drawing.
(Throwing) Curves
Table 9-1 lists the AutoCAD commands for drawing curvy things. It shows you 
the tool icons found on the Ribbon, toolbars, and menus, and gives the com-
mand name with alias (where one exists) if you like to type. It also tells you

where to find or how to enter the commands using both the Ribbon in the 2D 
Drafting & Annotation workspace and the Draw toolbar and Draw menu in the 
AutoCAD Classic environment.

Slideout panels are part of the Ribbon interface in AutoCAD 2011’s 2D Drafting 
& Annotation, 3D Basics, and 3D Modeling workspaces. Slideouts are present in 
panels that show a small down-pointing triangle next to the panel title. To open 
a slideout, click the panel title bar (for example, Draw on the Home tab). The 
panel expands downward, and a pushpin icon appears at the left end of the 
panel title bar. After you click a tool button, the slideout panel closes. Click the 
pushpin in the title bar to pin the panel — that is, force it to stay open.
If you’re familiar with earlier AutoCAD releases, you may suspect that the 
Draw panel in AutoCAD 2011’s Ribbon interface is also missing some com-
mands. Well, as they used to say in the ’90s, the paradigm has shifted! Those 
commands are still there, they’ve just shifted around to reflect the task-based 
Ribbon layout. For example, block creation and insertion lived on the classic 
Draw menu and Draw toolbar, but in the newer user interface, those tools 

175
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
have moved to the Blocks panel, which can be found on both the Insert and 
Home tabs. Similarly, the text commands (whose classic interface home was 
also on the Draw menu and Draw toolbar) are on the Ribbon’s Annotate and 
Home tabs.
Going full circle
AutoCAD offers an easy and intuitive way to draw circles, and it also offers . . . 
other ways. The easy way is to define the center point of the circle and then 
to specify the radius (the default option) or the diameter. You can also define 
a circle by choosing one of the following options of the command (for those 
other ways):
 ✓ 
2-Point (2P): Draws a circle where the distance between two specified 
points is equal to the diameter of the circle. If you’re keyboarding, enter 
2P at the command prompt to choose this option; it’s spelled out as 
2-Point on tooltips.
 ✓ 
3-Point (3P): Draws a circle through any three specified points.
 ✓ 
Tangent-Tangent-Radius (Ttr): Draws a circle tangent to two existing 
drawing objects and a specified radius.
 ✓ 
Tangent-Tangent-Tangent: Draws a circle tangent to three valid existing 
drawing objects. (By valid, I mean it’s mathematically possible to con-
struct a circle tangent to the three selected objects.) Note that you can’t 
create this kind of circle by typing a command option at the command 
line because there is no such command option. This method is actually 
a macro and you run it by choosing Tan, Tan, Tan from the Circle flyout 
button on the Home tab’s Draw panel.
Figure 9-1 illustrates these six different ways of drawing circles. Whether 
these additional methods are useful or not depends on the kinds of drawings 
that you make and how geometry is defined in your industry. Get familiar 
with the default center point/radius method and then try the other methods 
to see whether they may be helpful to you. If you find yourself going around 
in circles, you can always draw them the default way and move them into 
position with other geometry.
Follow these steps to use the CIRCLE command:
 
1. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.
 
 The most frequently used commands in AutoCAD are found on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab.
 
2. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the circles that you’ll draw.

3. Click the Circle button on the Ribbon’s Draw panel or type C and 
press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the CIRCLE command and prompts you to specify the 
center point of the circle. If dynamic input is toggled on, press the down 
arrow on your keyboard to see the options at the crosshairs. The com-
mand line shows
Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan 
radius)]:
 
 The prompts show the methods other than “center point plus radius” 
that you can use to draw circles in AutoCAD. (No, tan tan radius is 
not a mathematician’s dance.) Look up CIRCLE command in the online 
help if you think you may have a use for these less-common circle-draw-
ing techniques.
 
4. Specify the center point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 Use one of the precision techniques described in Chapter 7 if you’re 
doing real drafting. Object snap, snap, and typing coordinates all work 
well for specifying the center point.
 
 AutoCAD then prompts you to specify the circle’s radius.
Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]:
  
Type D and press Enter if you prefer to enter the diameter rather than 
the radius and you’ve forgotten your two-times tables — or, more seri-
ously, if the diameter is easier to type exactly than the radius is.
 
5. Specify the radius by typing a distance or clicking a point.

177
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
 
 AutoCAD draws your circle and returns to a blank command prompt. 
The first point you picked is the center. The command prompt doesn’t 
tell you so, but if you pick a second point instead of entering a number 
(or typing D to invoke the Diameter option), AutoCAD interprets the dis-
tance between the first and second points as the radius value.
Arc-y-ology
Arcs in AutoCAD are, quite simply, pieces of circles. As with circles, AutoCAD 
offers you an easy way to define arcs. Just specify three points on-screen to 
define the arc, easy as one-two-three. These points tell AutoCAD where to 
start the arc, how much to curve it, and where to end it.
Sounds pretty easy, right? So, where’s the problem? The trouble is that you 
nearly always have to specify arcs more exactly than is possible by using 
this method. AutoCAD helps you specify such arcs, too — but the procedure 
ain’t easy.
You can start your arc by specifying the center of the arc or the start point. 
If you choose the Center option, AutoCAD prompts you for the center point 
first and the start point second. AutoCAD defines arcs counterclockwise, 
so pick a start point in a clockwise direction from the endpoint. After you 
specify the center and start point, AutoCAD presents several options you can 
choose, including the following:
 ✓ 
Angle: Specifies the included angle that the arc sweeps out. A 180-
degree angle, for example, is a semicircle.
 ✓ 
Length of chord: Specifies the length of an imaginary straight line con-
necting the endpoints of the arc. Most people seldom or never use this 
option.
 ✓ 
End point: Specifies where the arc ends. It’s the default option and often 
the easiest to use.
If you specify the start point as the first option, you can choose among the 
following three command options as well:
 ✓ 
Center: Prompts you for the arc’s center point and then finishes with 
the three options listed previously.
 ✓ 
End: Specifies the endpoint of the arc. You then need to define the angle 
that the arc covers, its direction, its radius, or its center point.
 ✓ 
Second point: The default option. The second point you choose isn’t the 
endpoint; instead, it’s a point on the arc that, along with the start and 
end points, defines how much the arc curves. After you enter the second 
point, you must enter an endpoint to complete the arc.

178
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
To get a feel for how these permutations can be strung together to create dif-
ferent arc-drawing methods, click the down arrow beside the Arc tool button 
on the Ribbon’s Draw panel and look at the impressive flyout that unfurls, as 
shown in Figure 9-2. Using the Ribbon is also the most direct way of actually 
using any of these options — at least until you’re really familiar with the pro-
gram and are adept at entering keyboard shortcuts.
 
Figure 9-2: 
A deluge of 
Arc options, 
with the 
results of 
using some 
of those 
options.
 
The following example shows how you draw an arc with the default start 
point/second point/endpoint method:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the arcs that you’ll draw.
 
 
2. Click the Arc button on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type A and 
press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the ARC command and prompts you to specify the start 
point of the arc. The command line shows
Specify start point of arc or [Center]:
 
3. Specify the start point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify a second point on the arc.

179
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
 
4. Specify a second point on the arc by clicking a point or typing 
coordinates.
 
 The second point lies somewhere along the curve of the arc. AutoCAD 
determines the exact curvature of the arc after you choose the final end-
point in the following step. To align the second point with an existing 
object, use an Object Snap mode.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the endpoint of the arc; as you move 
the crosshairs around, AutoCAD shows how the arc will look.
 
5. Specify the endpoint of the arc by clicking a point or typing 
coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD draws the arc, as shown previously in Figure 9-2.
 
As you may recall, pressing Enter repeats the last command. What often 
throws new AutoCAD users is that Enter doesn’t repeat the options of the 
last command. If you draw an arc using the Center, Start, End option, for 
example, pressing Enter isn’t going to repeat that method — it’s going to 
repeat the ARC command in its default form, and the three points you pick 
probably won’t give you the arc you meant to draw. Bottom line: Watch the 
command line!
Solar ellipses
In case you’ve forgotten your ninth-grade math, an ellipse is like a squished 
circle (please excuse the technical jargon). Mathematically, an ellipse is 
defined by a major (long) axis and a minor (short) axis. These axes determine 
the ellipse’s length, width, and degree of curvature. An elliptical arc is an arc 
cut from an ellipse.
The AutoCAD ELLIPSE command provides a straightforward way of drawing 
an ellipse: You specify the two endpoints of one of its axes and then specify 
an endpoint on the other axis. But like the ARC command, the ELLIPSE com-
mand offers a bunch of other options:
 ✓ 
Arc: Generates an elliptical arc, not a full ellipse. You define an elliptical 
arc just as you do a full ellipse. The methods that I discuss in this sec-
tion for creating an ellipse apply to either.
 ✓ 
Center: This option requires that you define the center of the ellipse and 
then the endpoint of an axis. You can then either enter the distance of 
the other axis or specify that a rotation around the major axis defines 
the ellipse. If you choose the latter, you can enter (or drag the ellipse to) 
a specific rotation for the second axis that, in turn, completely defines 
the ellipse.

180
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 ✓ 
Rotation: With this option, you specify an angle which defines the cur-
vature of the ellipse — small angles make fat ellipses (0 degrees creates 
a circle, in fact), and large angles make skinny ellipses. The name of the 
option, Rotation, has something to do with rotating an imaginary circle 
around the first axis. If you can figure out the imaginary circle business, 
you have a better imagination than I do.
 
 The following command line example creates an ellipse by using the default 
endpoints of the axes method. Figure 9-3 shows an ellipse and an elliptical arc.
Command: ELLIPSE
Specify axis endpoint of ellipse or [Arc/Center]: pick or 
type the first endpoint of one axis
Specify other endpoint of axis: pick or type the other 
endpoint of one axis
Specify distance to other axis or [Rotation]: pick or type 
the endpoint of the other axis
 
You can create elliptical arcs (as opposed to the circular arcs that the 
AutoCAD ARC command draws) by using the Arc option of the ELLIPSE com-
mand; it’s perfect for drawing those cannonball trajectories! Alternatively, 
you can draw a full ellipse and use the TRIM or BREAK command to cut a 
piece out of it.

you have to

Splines: The sketchy, sinuous curves
Most people use CAD programs for precision drawing tasks: straight lines, 
carefully defined curves, precisely specified points, and so on. AutoCAD is not 
the program to free your inner artist — unless your inner artist is Mondrian. 

181
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
Nonetheless, even meticulously created CAD drawings sometimes need free-
form curves. The AutoCAD spline object is just the thing for the job.
You can use AutoCAD splines in two ways:
 ✓ 
Eyeball the location and shape of the curve and don’t worry too much 
about getting it just so. That’s the freeform, sketchy, not-too-precise 
approach that I describe in this section.
 ✓ 
Specify their control points and curvature characteristics precisely.
 
Beneath their easygoing, informal exterior, AutoCAD splines are really highly 
precise, mathematically-defined entities called NURBS curves (NonUniform 
Rational B-Spline curves). Mathematicians and some mechanical and indus-
trial designers care a lot about the precise characteristics of the curves they 
work with. For those people, the AutoCAD SPLINE and SPLINEDIT commands 
include a number of advanced options. Look up spline curves in the AutoCAD 
online help if you need precision in your splines.
 
Splines are one of the most heavily revamped features in AutoCAD 2011. In 
AutoCAD 2010 and earlier, there was only one method: Pick a series of points 
and AutoCAD created a spline that passed precisely through each of them. 
AutoCAD 2011 retains that method — called Fit Point — but adds a powerful 
new method called Controlled Vertices, or CV. If you select the CV method 
when you run the SPLINE command, AutoCAD draws a freeform curve that is 
(for lack of a better word) influenced by the control points. You have the 
option of specifying the degree of influence. In addition to fit-to-point splines 
and CV splines, the revivified SKETCH command can now create freehand 
splines. The new additions to the SPLINE command are primarily there to sup-
port AutoCAD 2011’s new 3D surface modeling abilities, so I talk about them a 
little more in Chapters 21, 22, and 23.
Drawing splines is straightforward, if you ignore the advanced options. The 
following procedure draws a freeform curve with the SPLINE command:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current and set other object properties that 
you want applied to the spline segments that you’ll draw.
 
 
2. Click the Spline button on the Home tab’s Draw panel or type SPL and 
press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD starts the SPLINE command and prompts you to specify the 
start point of the spline. The command line shows:
Current settings: Method=Fit Knots=Chord Specify first 
point or [Method/Knots/Object]:
 
3. Specify the start point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify additional points:
Enter next point or [start Tangency/toLerance]:

182
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
4. Specify additional points by clicking or typing coordinates.
 
 After you pick the second point, press the down-arrow key to display 
additional options at the dynamic input tooltip’s pop-up menu. (Enable 
dynamic input at the status bar if you need to.) The command line shows
Enter next point or [end Tangency/toLerance/Undo/
Close]:
 
 Because you’re drawing a freeform curve, you usually don’t need to use 
object snaps or other precision techniques when picking spline points.
 
5. Press Enter after you’ve chosen the endpoint of your spline.
 
 AutoCAD draws the spline.
 
You can specify the start and end tangency of the spline to control the curva-
ture of the start points and endpoints of the spline. If all you’re after is a 
swoopy freeform curve, just picking points as in this example works fine.
Figure 9-4 shows some examples of splines.
 
Figure 9-4: 
A slew of 
splines.
 
 
After you’ve drawn a spline, you can grip edit it to adjust its shape. See 
Chapter 10 for information about grip editing. If you need finer control over 
spline editing, look up the SPLINEDIT command in the AutoCAD online help.
Donuts: The circles with a difference
A donut in AutoCAD is another special type of polyline object that you create 
with (what else?) the DONUT command. (The rectangles and regular poly-
gons I show you in Chapter 8 are also polyline objects.) Creating a donut is 
a simple way to define a single object that consists of two concentric circles 
with the space between them filled.

183
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
When you start the DONUT command, AutoCAD prompts you for the inside 
diameter and the outside diameter — the size of the hole and the size of 
the donut — as measured across their widest points. After you’ve entered 
these values, AutoCAD prompts you for the center point of the donut. But 
one donut is rarely enough, so AutoCAD keeps prompting you for additional 
center points until you press Enter (the AutoCAD equivalent of saying, “no, 
really, I’m full now!”).
 
 The following example draws a regulation-size donut, with a 1.5-inch hole and 
3.5-inch outside diameter.
Command: DONUT
Specify inside diameter of donut <0.5000>: 1.5
Specify outside diameter of donut <1.0000>: 3.5
Specify center of donut or <exit>: pick or type the center 
point of one or more donuts
 
You can use the DONUT command to create a filled circle — also known as a 
jelly-filled donut. Just specify an inside diameter of 0. Figure 9-5 shows both 
kinds of donuts.
 
Figure 9-5: 
Donuts, 
plain and 
jelly-filled.
 
Inside Diameter = 0
Outside Diameter = 3.5
Inside Diameter = 1.5
Outside Diameter = 3.5
Revision clouds on the horizon
It’s customary in many industries to submit a set of drawings at different 
project milestones or stages of completion and then submit them again 
later with revisions — corrections, clarifications, and requested changes. 
Usually, the recipients like to locate changed stuff easily, and a common 
drafting convention is to call attention to revised items by drawing freeform 
clouds around them. The REVCLOUD command makes quick work of draw-
ing such clouds.

184
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Drawing revision clouds is easy, after you understand that you click only 
once in the drawing area. That one click defines the starting point for the 
cloud’s perimeter. After that, you simply move the crosshairs around, and 
the cloud takes shape. When you return to near the point that you clicked in 
the beginning, AutoCAD automatically closes the cloud.
 
 The following command line example shows you how to draw a revision 
cloud. Figure 9-6 shows what revision clouds look like.
Command: REVCLOUD
Minimum arc length: 0.5000 Maximum arc length: 0.5000 
Style: Normal
Specify start point or [Arc length/Object/Style] <Object>: 
pick a point along the perimeter of your future 
cloud
Guide crosshairs along cloud path... sweep the crosshairs 
around to define the cloud’s perimeter
You don’t need to click again. Simply move the crosshairs around without 
clicking. AutoCAD draws the next arc segment of the cloud when your cross-
hairs reach the minimum arc length distance from the end of the previous arc 
segment.
Continue moving the crosshairs around until you return to the point where 
you clicked first.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Meanwhile,

clouds were

over Europe.
 
Min. arc length = 0.5
Max. arc length = 0.5
Min. arc length = 1.0
Max. arc length = 1.0
Min. arc length = 0.5
Max. arc length = 1.0
 
Here are a few tips for using revision clouds:
 ✓ 
It’s a good idea to put revision clouds on their own layer so that you can 
choose to plot with or without the clouds visible.

185
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
 ✓ 
You’ll probably find it easier to control the shape of revision clouds if 
you turn off Ortho mode before you start the command.
 ✓ 
You may need to add a triangle and number, as shown in Figure 9-6, to 
indicate the revision number. A block with an attribute is a good way to 
handle this requirement: Chapter 17 covers blocks and attributes.
 
If the revision cloud’s arcs are too small or too large, erase the cloud, restart 
the REVCLOUD command, and use the command’s Arc Length option to 
change the minimum and maximum arc lengths. The default minimum and 
maximum lengths are 0.5 (or 15 in metric drawings). If you make the minimum 
and maximum lengths equal (which is the default), the lobes will be approxi-
mately equal in size. If you make them unequal, there will be more variation in 
lobe size — you’ll get fluffier clouds. Fortunately, all these options are more 
than most non-meteorologists will need.
Scoring Points
I thought about not covering points in this book, but I didn’t want you com-
plaining that AutoCAD 2011 For Dummies is pointless.
 The 
word point describes two different things in AutoCAD:
 ✓ 
A location in the drawing that you specify (by typing coordinates or 
clicking with the mouse)
 ✓ 
An object that you draw with the POINT command
Throughout this chapter and most of the book, I tell you to specify points — 
that’s the location meaning. This section tells you how to draw point objects.
A point object in AutoCAD can serve two purposes:
 ✓ 
Points often identify specific locations in your drawing to other 
people who look at the drawing. A point can be something that dis-
plays on the screen, either as a tiny dot or as another symbol, such as a 
cross with a circle around it.
 ✓ 
You can use points as precise object snap locations. Think of them as 
construction points. For example, when you’re laying out a new building, 
you might draw point objects at some of the engineering survey points 
and then snap to those points as you sketch the building’s shape with 
the PLINE command. You use the Node Object Snap mode to snap to 
AutoCAD point objects.

186
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
What makes AutoCAD point objects complicated is their almost limitless 
range of display options, provided to accommodate the two different kinds 
of purposes just described (and possibly some others that I haven’t figured 
out yet). You use the Point Style dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-7, to specify 
how points should look in the current drawing.
The Point Style dialog box can be found on the Home tab’s Utilities panel 
slideout, or by typing its command name — which happens to be about the 
least intuitive command name in all of AutoCAD: DDPTYPE (pronounced 
ddptype). The top portion of the dialog box shows the available point display 
styles. Most of the choices do pretty much the same thing. Just click one of 
the squares that says, “Hey, that’s a good point!” to you.
 
Figure 9-7: 
The Point 
Style dialog 
box con-
trols the 
way point 
objects 
appear 
on-screen.
 
 
The first choice, a single-pixel dot, is hard to see on the screen, and the second 
choice, invisible (a stealth point?), is impossible to see. Avoid these choices if 
you want your point objects to show up on the screen and on plots. The single-
pixel dot, which is the default display style, works well if you use point objects 
as object snap locations and don’t want obtrusive points on plots.
The remaining settings in the Point Style dialog box control the size at which 
points appear on the screen at different zoom magnifications. The default 
settings often work fine, but if you’re not satisfied with them, click the Help 
button in the dialog box to find out how to change them.
 
 After you specify the point style, placing points on-screen is easy. The follow-
ing example shows you how; just type POINT and press Enter.
Command: POINT
Current point modes: PDMODE=0 PDSIZE=0.0000
Specify a point: pick or type the coordinates of a 
location in the drawing

187
 Chapter 9: Dangerous Curves Ahead
 
The PDMODE and PDSIZE items listed in the command window are system 
variables that correspond to the point display mode and display size options 
in the Point Style dialog box. If you want to know exactly how the system vari-
ables correspond to the dialog box choices, you have all the makings of a suc-
cessful CAD nerd. Click the Help button in the Point Style dialog box to find 
out more (about the system variables — not about yourself).
 
How many points you make depends on how you start the command. If you 
type POINT (or its alias PO) and press Enter, AutoCAD creates a single point 
object and returns to the command prompt. Choosing Point from the Home 
tab’s Draw panel (it’s hiding on the slideout) keeps drawing points every-
where you pick on-screen; you must press Esc to stop. The same Draw panel 
slideout presents two additional commands that do their work by creating 
point objects: DIVIDE and MEASURE. Those two useful commands can help 
you in laying out drawing objects — look them up in the index of the online 
help for more information.

E
diting objects is the flip side of creating them, and in AutoCAD, you 
spend a lot of time editing — far more than drawing objects from 
scratch. That’s partly because the design and drafting process is, by its 
nature, repetitive, and also because AutoCAD makes it easy to edit objects 
cleanly.
 
When you edit objects in AutoCAD, you need to be just as concerned about 
specifying precise locations and distances as you are when you originally 
create the objects. Make sure that you’re familiar with the precision tech-
niques described in Chapter 7 before you apply the editing techniques from 
this chapter to real drawings.
Commanding and Selecting
AutoCAD offers three styles of editing:
 ✓ 
Command-first editing
 ✓ 
Selection-first editing
 ✓ 
Direct object manipulation (grip editing)
 
AutoCAD refers to command-first editing as verb-noun editing and to selection-
first editing as noun-verb editing. When you see this terminology — for exam-
ple, in the Options dialog box or the online help system — don’t worry, you 
haven’t dropped back into your fifth-grade English class!

With command-first editing, you start a command and then select the objects 
on which the command works. This style of editing may seem backward 
to you at first unless you’re a longtime AutoCAD user. Command-first edit-
ing works well for power users who are in a hurry and who are willing to 
memorize most of the commands they need to do their work. It’s also the 
only way to use some of the editing commands (such as FILLET and BREAK). 
It’s no surprise that command-first editing is the traditional editing style in 
AutoCAD, and the one method with which you need to be most comfortable.
Selection-first editing
In selection-first editing, you perform the same steps — in the same order — 
as in most Windows applications: Select the object first, and then choose 
the command. Selection-first editing tends to be easier to master and makes 
AutoCAD more approachable for new and occasional users.
Direct object manipulation
With direct object manipulation, you perform common editing operations 
by using the mouse to grab the selected object and perform an action on it, 
such as moving all or part of it to a different place in the drawing. No named 
command is involved; the act of moving the mouse and clicking the mouse 
buttons in certain ways causes the editing changes to happen. AutoCAD sup-
ports direct object manipulation through a powerful but somewhat compli-
cated technique called grip editing. Grips are the little square, rectangular, or 
triangular handles that appear on an object when you select it. You can use 
the grips to stretch, move, copy, rotate, scale, or otherwise edit the object.
Choosing an editing style
This book emphasizes command-first editing, but I also discuss grip edit-
ing in the section “Get a Grip,” later in this chapter. AutoCAD, in its heart 
of hearts, is a command-first program. In fact, it started out offering only 
command-first editing and later added selection-first methods; AutoCAD 2011 
inherits this ancestral trait. I stress command-first editing for the following 
reasons:

191
 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
 ✓ 
It’s the editing style that’s been in AutoCAD the longest and the one with 
which experienced AutoCAD users are most familiar.
 ✓ 
It works consistently with all editing commands — some editing com-
mands remain command-first only.
 ✓ 
It provides added object selection flexibility, which is useful when you 
work on complicated, busy drawings.
After you know how to do command-first editing, you can simply reverse 
the order of many editing operations to do them selection-first style, 
instead. But if you don’t get familiar with command-first editing in the 
beginning, you’ll be bewildered by a few useful AutoCAD commands that 
work only in the command-first style; commands such as these ignore any 
already-selected objects and prompt you to select objects before you can 
continue.
Much of the information in the rest of this book assumes that you’re using 
the default AutoCAD selection settings. If object selection or grip edit-
ing work differently from how I describe them in this chapter, click the 
Application button, choose Options from the bottom of the Application Menu 
to open the Options dialog box, and then check the settings on the Selection 
tab. The nine check box settings listed next should be selected, as shown in 
Figure 10-1. (All other check box settings should be deselected.)

Grab It
Part of AutoCAD’s editing flexibility comes from its object selection flexibility. 
For example, command-first editing offers 16 selection modes! (I describe the 
most useful ones in this chapter.) Don’t worry, though; you can get by most of 
the time with three selection modes, each of which I describe in this section:
 ✓ 
Selecting a single object by picking it
 ✓ 
Selecting multiple objects by enclosing them in a window selection box
 ✓ 
Selecting multiple objects by enclosing them in a crossing selection box
One-by-one selection
The most obvious way to select objects is to pick (by clicking) them one at a 
time. One or more objects that are selected and ready for editing are called 
a selection set. You can build a selection set cumulatively with this pick-one-
object-at-a-time selection mode, but this cumulative convention may be dif-
ferent from what you’re used to. In most Windows programs, if you select 
one object and then another, the first object is deselected, and the second 
one selected; only the object you select last remains selected. In AutoCAD, 
all the objects you select, one at a time, remain selected and are added to the 
selection set, no matter how many objects you pick. (You can change this 

193
 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
behavior to make AutoCAD work like other Windows programs by turning on 
the Use Shift to Add to Selection option on the Option dialog box’s Selection 
tab, but I suggest that you don’t change it.) Most editing commands affect the 
entire group of selected objects.
 
AutoCAD 2011 gains the SELECTSIMILAR command that’s been part of the ver-
tical products like AutoCAD Architecture and Civil 3D for several releases 
now. Select an object, right-click, and choose Select Similar from the shortcut 
menu. AutoCAD selects all similar objects. You can filter the properties used 
for selection by entering SELECTSIMILAR at the command prompt, then enter-
ing SE to display the Select Similar Settings dialog box (see Figure 10-2).
 
Figure 10-2:

Selection boxes left and right
Selecting objects one at a time works great when you want to edit a small 
number of objects, but many CAD editing tasks involve editing lots of objects. 
Do you really want to pick 132 lines, arcs, and circles, one at a time?
Like most Windows graphics programs, AutoCAD provides a selection 
window feature for grabbing a bunch of objects in a rectangular area. As you 
may guess by now, the AutoCAD version of this feature is a bit more powerful 
than the similar feature in other Windows graphics programs and, therefore, 
is slightly confusing at first. AutoCAD calls its version implied windowing. 
Here’s how you use it.
If you click a blank area of the drawing — that is, not on an object — you’re 
implying to AutoCAD that you want to specify a selection window, or box. If 
you move the crosshairs to the right before picking the other corner of the 
selection box, you’re further implying that you want to select all objects that 
reside completely within the selection box. If you move the crosshairs to the 
left before picking the other corner of the selection box, you’re implying that 
you want to select all objects that reside completely or partially within the 
selection box.

194
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
The AutoCAD terminology for these two kinds of selection boxes gets a little 
confusing:
 ✓ 
Window object selection: The move-to-the-right, only-select-objects-
completely-within-the-box mode
 ✓ 
Crossing object selection: The move-to-the-left, select-objects-
completely-or-partially-within-the-box mode
Fortunately, AutoCAD gives you visual cues that there’s a difference. As you 
move to the right, the window box appears as a rectangle with a blue fill and 
a solid border. As you move to the left, the crossing box appears as a rect-
angle with green fill and a dashed border.
Figures 10-3 and 10-4 show a window box and a crossing box, respectively, in 
action.
You can mix and match selecting individual objects, specifying a window box, 
and specifying a crossing box. Each selection adds to the current selection 
set, allowing you to build an enormously complicated selection of objects 
and then operate on them with one or more editing commands.

You can press the Shift key in combination with any of the three standard 
selection modes — single object, window box, and crossing box — to remove 
already-selected objects from the selection set. This feature is especially 
useful when you’re building a selection set in a crowded drawing; you can 
select a big batch of objects by using Window or Crossing, and then hold 
down the Shift key while selecting to remove the objects that you want to 
exclude from the editing operation.
Perfecting Selecting
When you edit in command-first mode, you have all the selection options 
described in the previous section — single object, window box, and 
crossing box — plus a slew of others. If you type ? and press Enter at any 
Select objects prompt, AutoCAD lists all the selection options at the 
command line:

To use any of the command-first selection options at the Select objects 
prompt, type the uppercase letters indicated in Table 10-1 that correspond 
to the desired option and press Enter. After you’re finished selecting objects, 
you must press Enter again to tell AutoCAD that you’ve finished selecting 
objects and want to start the editing operation.
 
After you’re finished selecting objects, you must press Enter again to tell 
AutoCAD that you’ve finished selecting objects and want to start the editing 
operation. Say . . . is there an echo in here? As a matter of fact, I am repeating 
myself. One of the things that most new AutoCAD users find hardest to 
remember is the necessity of pressing Enter after you finish selecting objects.
 AutoCAD’s 
Selection preview features remove a lot of doubt about which 
objects you’re selecting. Rollover highlighting displays individual objects with 
a thick, dashed lineweight as you move the crosshairs over them. Area selec-
tion displays a transparent, colored highlight over multiple selections when 
you use Window and Crossing options. You can enable and disable both fea-
tures on the Selection tab of the Options dialog box (refer to Figure 10-1).

197
 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
The following example demonstrates how to use the ERASE command in 
command-first mode with several different selection options. The selection 
techniques used in this example apply to most AutoCAD editing commands.
 
1. Open a drawing that contains some objects, or start a new drawing 
and create some lines, arcs, or circles.
 
 You needn’t be too particular drawing these because you’re going to 
blow them away in the following steps.
 
2. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.
 
 If any objects are selected when you start an editing command, the com-
mand, in most cases, will operate on those objects (selection-first edit-
ing) instead of prompting you to select objects (command-first editing). 
For the reasons that I describe in the section “Commanding and 
Selecting,” earlier in this chapter, I recommend that you use command-
first editing style until you’re thoroughly familiar with it. Later, you can 
experiment with selection-first editing if you like. (Just reverse the 
sequence of commanding and selecting that I describe in this chapter.)
 
 
3. Click the Erase button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
 AutoCAD displays the Select objects prompt at the command line 
and, if Dynamic Input is enabled on the status bar, the dynamic input 
tooltip.
 
4. Select two or three individual objects by clicking each one.
 
 AutoCAD adds each object to the selection set. All the objects you select 
remain highlighted, and AutoCAD continues to display the Select 
objects prompt.
 
5. Specify a window selection box that completely encloses several 
objects.
 
 Move the crosshairs to a point below and to the left of the objects, click, 
release the mouse button, move the crosshairs above and to the right of 
the objects, and click again.
 
 All objects that are completely within the box are selected.
 
6. Specify a crossing selection box that completely encloses a few objects 
and cuts through several others.
 
 Move the crosshairs to a point below and to the right of some of the 
objects, click, release the mouse button, move the crosshairs above and 
to the left of some of the objects, and click and release again.
 
 All objects that are completely within or cross through the box are 
selected. AutoCAD continues to display the Select objects prompt.

198
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 7. 
Type WP and press Enter to activate the WPolygon selection option.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to pick points that define the selection polygon.
 
8. Pick a series of points and press Enter.
 
 Figure 10-5 shows an example. After you press Enter, AutoCAD selects 
all objects that are completely within the polygon. AutoCAD continues 
to display the Select objects prompt until you press Enter.
 
9. Press Enter to end object selection.
 
 AutoCAD erases all the selected objects and returns to an empty com-
mand prompt.
Notice how you could use a combination of object selection methods to build 
a selection set and then press Enter to execute the command on the selected 
objects. Most AutoCAD editing commands work this way in command-first 
mode.
 
If, after erasing a selection set, you immediately realize that you didn’t really 
mean to do away with so many objects, you can use the Undo button on the 
Quick Access toolbar to restore them all. But AutoCAD has one additional 
unerase trick up its sleeve — the aptly named OOPS command. When you 
type OOPS and press Enter, AutoCAD restores the last selection set that you 
erased — even if you’ve run other commands after ERASE.

199
 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
 
The ERASE command isn’t the only way to remove unwanted objects from 
your drawing. Easiest of all in any workspace is to simply select an item and 
press the Delete key.
 
It’s all too easy to draw objects on top of other objects, and once they’re 
there, pretty well impossible to recognize that there are multiples so you can 
weed out the ones you don’t want. For the last couple of releases, holding 
down the Shift key and the spacebar together while clicking on suspected mul-
tiple objects will highlight them, one after the other; when the one you’re after 
lights up, you press Enter to select it. AutoCAD 2011 introduces a more power-
ful selection cycling method. With Selection Cycling enabled on the status bar, 
AutoCAD displays a blue overlapping rectangles icon if it detects multiple 
objects under your crosshairs. And when you pick an object with this icon dis-
played, AutoCAD opens a Selection dialog box where you can choose the 
object you actually want to select (see Figure 10-6).

You clicks 
your

Object Selection: Now You See It . . .
The many object selection modes I describe in previous sections — and 
some I don’t describe at all, such as the FILTER command (check out the 
online help system for more on that) — are useful as far as they go.
 
AutoCAD 2011 lets you control the visibility of individual objects. This may or 
may not sound like a big deal, but believe me, it is. For the previous 24 
releases of AutoCAD (AutoCAD 2011 is indeed the 25th release of the soft-
ware), the only way to control the display of objects was to turn off or freeze 

200
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
the layer on which they resided. If there were other objects on that layer that 
you did want to see. . . too bad! Three new commands turn that limitation into 
ancient history:
 ✓ 
HIDEOBJECTS: Prompts you to select those objects you want to make 
temporarily disappear
 ✓ 
ISOLATEOBJECTS: Prompts you to select those objects you want to see 
while temporarily making everything else disappear
 ✓ 
UNISOLATEOBJECTS: Ends the hiding and isolating of objects
The primary method of invoking these new commands is via the right-click 
menu. Using either command-first or selection-first editing (as described 
in the section “Commanding and Selecting,” earlier in this chapter), simply 
right-click and you see the Isolate item shown in Figure 10-7. A new status 
bar icon — a light bulb at the lower-right corner of the display — is dimmed 
when objects are either hidden or isolated. Click this icon to open a menu 
that lets you turn off the hiding or isolating.
If you’re worried about the possible implications of this (“Hmm. . . I was sure 
I added those center lines . . . do I need to add them again?”), relax. Hiding 
and isolating objects is temporary — it only lasts as long as your current 
drawing session. If you end a drawing with objects isolated or hidden, they 
reappear when you reopen the file.

 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
Get a Grip
Although command-first editing is the most flexible and widespread editing 
style in AutoCAD, it’s not the only way. Grip editing is a useful adjunct to com-
mand-first editing, especially when you want to modify just one or two objects. 
You may have encountered grip editing when using other kinds of graphics 
programs. But even if you’re an experienced user of other graphics programs, 
you’ve never seen grips used in quite the way that AutoCAD uses them.
 
Anything that you can do with grip editing can be done with command-first 
editing as well. In some situations, grip editing is a little more efficient or con-
venient than command-first editing, but command-first editing always gets the 
job done. If you master only one style of editing, make it command-first style. 
In other words, feel free to skip this section — at least until you’re comfort-
able with command-first editing.
About grips
Grips are those little square, rectangular, or triangular handles that appear on 
an object after you select it.
In their simplest guise, AutoCAD grips work similarly to the little squares on 
graphical objects in other Windows programs. But in AutoCAD, instead of 
clicking and dragging a grip, you must click, release the mouse button, move 
the crosshairs, and click again at the new location. (By separating the selec-
tion of beginning and ending points into two different operations, AutoCAD 
allows you to use different techniques — such as different object snaps — to 
select each point.)
AutoCAD grips are, for sophisticated users, better than the grips found in 
most other programs because you can do so much more with them. You can, 
for example, use AutoCAD grips to move, stretch, or copy an object. You 
also can use them to rotate an object, scale it to a different size, or mirror an 
object — that is, create one or more reversed copies. Grips also act as visible 
object snaps, or little magnets that attract the crosshairs.
A gripping example
The following sections cover in detail the five grip-editing modes: STRETCH, 
MOVE, ROTATE, SCALE, and MIRROR. Follow these steps to explore the grip-
editing modes:

202
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
1. Draw some simple geometry, such as the object shown in Figure 10-8.
 
 Here’s a great place to practice some of the straight-line object creation 
tools I describe in Chapter 8!
 
2. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected, and then click Quick Properties on the status bar to turn off 
the Quick Properties panel.
 
 The Quick Properties panel is pretty useful for editing the properties of 
objects, but more often than not, it gets in the way when you want to 
edit the objects themselves.
 
 AutoCAD displays a blank command prompt — that is, no command is 
currently active.
 
3. Click an object on-screen to select it and display its grips.
 
 Grips — solid blue squares on the selected object — appear at various 
points on the object. Note that the AutoCAD command prompt remains 
blank; you haven’t started a command or grip-editing operation yet.
 
4. Click another object.
 
 Both the newly selected object and the previously selected object dis-
play grips.
 
5. Click one of the grips on either object.
 
 The blue square turns to a dark red square. This grip is now hot, or 
selected and ready for a grip-editing operation. Grip-editing options now 
appear on the command line. The first option to appear is STRETCH.
 
6. Press the spacebar repeatedly to cycle through the five grip-editing 
options on the command line.
** STRETCH **
Specify stretch point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
** MOVE **
Specify move point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
** ROTATE **
Specify rotation angle or [Base point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
** SCALE **
Specify scale factor or [Base point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
** MIRROR **
Specify second point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
 
 The grip-editing option displayed on the command line and the dynamic 
input tooltip (if Dynamic Input is enabled) changes as you press the 
spacebar. If you move the crosshairs (without picking) in between each 
press of the spacebar, the appearance of your selected object changes 
as you display each option. Choosing STRETCH, for example, causes a 
stretched version of the object to appear on-screen.

203
 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
 
 Pressing the spacebar a bunch of times is a good way to become familiar 
with the grip-editing modes, but there’s a more direct way to choose a 
particular mode. After you click a grip to make it hot, right-click to dis-
play the grip-editing menu. That menu contains all the grip-editing 
options plus some other choices, as shown in Figure 10-8.
 
 If Dynamic Input is enabled, pressing the down-arrow key while cycling 
through the grip-editing options displays a dynamic menu at the cross-
hairs from which you can choose options specific to the current grip-
editing function.
 
7. Press the spacebar until STRETCH (or the option you want) reappears 
as the grip-editing option.
 
8. Move the hot grip in the direction in which you want to stretch (or 
otherwise manipulate) your object.
 
 AutoCAD dynamically updates the image of the object to show you what 
the modified object will look like before you click the final location.
 
9. Click again to finish the grip-editing operation.
 
 The selected object with the hot grip updates.
 
10. Click the same grip that you chose in Step 5 (now in a different loca-
tion) to make it hot.
 
11. This time, move the crosshairs near one of the grips on the other 
object. When you see the magnetic pull of the grip on the other object, 
click again to connect the hot grip with the other grip.
 
 The object point represented by the hot grip now coincides exactly with 
the grip on the other object.
 
12. Press Esc to deselect all objects and remove all grips.

Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Figure 10-9 shows a hot endpoint grip of a line being connected to the end-
point grip of another line (it appears dark red on your screen). The angled 
line shows the original position of the line being edited, and the thin vertical 
line shows the new position. Using a grip in this way as a visible object snap 
offers the same advantage as using object snap overrides, as described in 
Chapter 7: It ensures precision by making sure that objects meet exactly.
 
Figure 10-9:

Dark red (hot) grip
You can experiment with all the grip-editing options to find out how they 
affect a selected object. Because MOVE and STRETCH are the most useful 
grip-editing modes, I cover them in more detail.
Move it!
Back in the days of manual drafting, moving objects was a big pain in the 
eraser. You had to erase the stuff you wanted to move and redraw the 
objects in their new location. In the process, you usually ended up erasing 
parts of other stuff that you didn’t want to move and left smudged lines and 
piles of eraser dust everywhere. CAD does away with all the fuss and muss of 
moving objects, and AutoCAD grip editing is a great way to make it happen. 
The following steps describe how to move objects:
 
1. Select one or more objects.
 
 Use any combination of the three editing modes — single object, 
window box, and crossing box — described in the “Grab It” section, ear-
lier in this chapter.
 
2. Click one of the grips to make it hot.

205
 Chapter 10: Get a Grip on Object Selection
 
 At this point in your editing career, it doesn’t matter which grip you 
click. As you become more familiar with grip editing, you’ll discover that 
certain grips serve as better reference points than others for particular 
editing operations.
 
3. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Move from the 
crosshairs menu.
 
4. Move the crosshairs to a different location and click.
 
 As you move the crosshairs around, AutoCAD displays the tentative new 
positions for all the objects, just as it does for the regular MOVE com-
mand, as shown previously in Figure 10-9. After you click, the objects 
assume their new positions.
 
5. Press Esc to deselect all objects and remove all grips.
Copy, or a kinder, gentler Move
If you were paying attention during the section “A gripping example,” earlier 
in the chapter, you may have noticed while pressing the spacebar that copy 
was not among the five grip-editing modes. Why not? Because every grip mode 
includes a copy option (as the command-line prompts show in the “A gripping 
example” section). In other words, you can STRETCH with copy, MOVE with 
copy, ROTATE with copy, SCALE with copy, and MIRROR with copy.
The copy option leaves the selected objects in place and does the editing 
operation on a new copy of the objects.
By far the most common use for the copy option is with the MOVE grip-edit-
ing mode. If you think about “MOVE with copy” for about two seconds, you’ll 
realize that it’s just a complicated way of saying “copy.” The following steps 
show how to copy objects quickly by using grip editing:
 
1. Select one or more objects.
 
2. Click any one of the grips to make it hot.
 
3. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Move from the 
menu.
 
4. Right-click again and choose Copy from the menu.
 
5. Move the crosshairs to a different location and click.
 
 After you click, new objects appear in the new location.
 
6. Move the crosshairs to additional locations and click there if you want 
to make additional copies.
 
7. Press Esc twice — once to end the copying operation and once to 
deselect all objects and remove all grips.

206
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
A warm-up Stretch
The STRETCH grip-editing mode works differently from the other modes. By 
default, it affects only the object with the hot grip on it, not all objects with 
grips on them. You can override this default behavior by using the Shift key to 
pick multiple grips and make them hot. Follow these steps to get acquainted 
with using the STRETCH grip-editing mode to stretch one or more objects:
 
1. Make sure that Ortho Mode is toggled off on the status bar by clicking 
the Ortho Mode button until <Ortho off> appears on the command 
line.
 
 Ortho mode forces stretch displacements to be orthogonal — that is, 
parallel to lines running at 0 and 90 degrees. During real editing tasks, 
you’ll often want to turn on Ortho mode, but while you get acquainted 
with stretching, leaving ortho mode off makes things clearer.
 
2. Select several objects, including at least one line.
 
3. On one of the lines, click one of the endpoint grips to make it hot.
 
 All the objects remain selected, but as you move the crosshairs, only the 
line with the hot grip changes. Figure 10-10 shows an example.
 
4. Click a new point for the hot endpoint grip.
 
 The line stretches to accommodate the new endpoint location.

5. On the same line, click the midpoint grip to make it hot.
 
 As you move the crosshairs, the entire line moves. Using the STRETCH 
grip-editing mode with a line’s midpoint “stretches” the entire line to a 
new location.
 
6. Click a new point for the hot midpoint grip.
 
 The line moves to the new midpoint location.
 
7. Hold down the Shift key. On one of the lines, click one of the endpoint 
grips to make it hot.
 
8. Still holding down the Shift key, click one of the endpoint grips on a 
different line to make it hot.
 
 Two grips on two different lines are now hot because you held down the 
Shift key and then clicked both grips.
 
 You can create more hot grips by holding down the Shift key and click-
ing more grips.
 
9. Release the Shift key and re-pick any one of the hot grips.
 
 Releasing the Shift key signals that you’re finished making grips hot. 
Re-picking one of the hot grips establishes it as the base point for the 
stretch operation.
 
10. Click a new point for the grip.
 
 All the objects with hot grips stretch based on the displacement of the 
grip that you clicked in Step 9 (see Figure 10-11).
 
11. Turn on Ortho mode by clicking its status bar button until <Ortho 
on> appears on the command line. Repeat Steps 2 through 10 to see 
the effect of Ortho mode on stretching.

I
n Chapter 10, you discover that AutoCAD has several different methods 
of modifying drawing objects. You also read how to select those objects 
in the first place, so you can edit them. Now it’s time to roll up your sleeves 
and get dirty — in this chapter, I introduce the primary edit commands in 
AutoCAD.
The following sections cover the most important AutoCAD editing com-
mands, using command-first editing mode.
 
As explained in Chapter 10, command-first — or verb-noun editing in 
AutoCAD-ese — is one of three different approaches to modifying objects 
in AutoCAD. I concentrate on this method, where you start a command and 
then you pick the objects on which the command will act, because it’s the 
only method that works for all editing commands in AutoCAD.
Your AutoCAD Tool Kit
Table 11-1 lists AutoCAD’s most frequently used editing commands. It shows 
the tool icons found on the Ribbon, the classic toolbar, and the classic menu, 
and it gives the official command name with corresponding alias (where one 
exists) for the typists in the room. Ribbon buttons are on the Home tab’s 
Modify panel in the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace. In the AutoCAD 
Classic workspace, look for these commands on the Modify toolbar and 
Modify menu.

Whether you start an AutoCAD editing command by clicking a Ribbon button 
or typing a command name or alias, in almost all cases AutoCAD prompts 
you for points, distances, and options in the command window. Read the 
prompts during every step of the command, especially when you’re figuring 
out how to use a new editing command. Otherwise, you’re unlikely to com-
plete the command successfully.
 
AutoCAD’s dynamic input system displays command options at the cross-
hairs. When you see a dynamic input tooltip with a down-arrow icon, press the 
down-arrow key on the keyboard to display the command options. You then 
can use the mouse to select an option (see Figure 11-1). Pressing the up-arrow 
key displays previous input.
As I describe in Chapter 7, maintaining precision when you draw and edit is 
crucial to good CAD work. If you’ve used a drawing program and are accus-
tomed to moving, stretching, and otherwise editing objects by eye, you’ll 
need to suppress that habit when you edit in AutoCAD. Nothing ruins a draw-
ing faster than eyeball-editing, in which you shove objects around until they 
look okay, without worrying about precise distances and points.

The Big Three: Move, Copy, and Stretch
Moving, copying, and stretching are, for many drafters, the three most 
common editing operations. AutoCAD obliges this need with the MOVE, 
COPY, and STRETCH commands.
Base points and displacements
The MOVE, COPY, and STRETCH commands all require that you specify how 
far and in what direction you want the objects moved, copied, or stretched. 
After you’ve started the command and selected the objects to be edited, 
AutoCAD prompts you for two pieces of information:
Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>:

213
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
In a not-so-clear way, these prompts say that two possible methods exist for 
you to specify how far and in what direction you want the objects copied, 
moved, or stretched:
 ✓ 
The most common way is to pick or type the coordinates of two points 
that define a displacement vector. AutoCAD calls these points the base 
point and the second point. Imagine an arrow pointing from the base 
point to the second point — that arrow defines how far and in what 
direction the objects get copied, moved, or stretched.
 ✓ 
The other way is to type an X,Y pair of numbers that represents a dis-
tance rather than a point. This distance is the absolute displacement 
that you want to copy, move, or stretch the objects.
How does AutoCAD know whether your response to the first prompt is a 
base point or a displacement? It depends on how you respond to the second 
prompt. (Is that confusing, or what?) First, you pick a point on-screen or 
enter coordinates at the Base point prompt. Next, there are a couple of 
possibilities:
 ✓ 
If you then pick or type the coordinates of a point at the second point 
prompt, AutoCAD says to itself, “Aha — displacement vector!” and 
moves the objects according to the imaginary arrow pointing from the 
base point to the second point.
 ✓ 
If you press Enter at the second prompt (without having typed any-
thing), AutoCAD says, “Aha — displacement distance,” and uses the X,Y 
pair of numbers that you typed at the first prompt as an absolute dis-
placement distance.
 
What makes this displacement business even more confusing is that AutoCAD 
lets you pick a point at the first prompt and press Enter at the second prompt. 
AutoCAD still says, “Aha — displacement distance,” but now it treats the coor-
dinates of the point you picked as an absolute distance. If the point you picked 
has relatively large coordinates, the objects can get moved way outside the 
normal drawing area as defined by the limits. The objects fly off into space, 
and you probably won’t see where they’ve gone because you’re zoomed into 
part of your normal drawing area; it just looks to you like the objects have 
vanished! In short, be careful when you press Enter during the MOVE, COPY, 
and STRETCH commands. Press Enter in response to the second prompt only 
if you want AutoCAD to use your response to the first prompt as an absolute 
displacement. If you make a mistake, click the Undo button to back up and try 
again. You can use Zoom Extents (described in Chapter 12) to look for objects 
that have flown off into space.

214
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Move
The following steps demonstrate command-first editing with the MOVE 
command, using the base point method of indicating how far and in what 
direction to move the selected objects. This procedure also gives detailed 
recommendations on how to use precision techniques when you edit.
 
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.
 
 
2. Click the Move button on the Modify panel of the Ribbon.
 
 The command line displays the Select objects prompt.
 
3. Select one or more objects.
 
 You can use any of the object selection techniques described in the 
“Perfecting Selecting” section in Chapter 10.
 
4. Press Enter when you’re finished selecting objects.
 
 AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
 
5. Specify a base point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 This point serves as the tail end of your imaginary arrow indicating how 
far and in what direction you want the objects moved. After you pick a 
base point, it’s fairly easy to see what’s going on because AutoCAD dis-
plays a temporary image of the object that moves around as you move 
the crosshairs. Figure 11-2 shows what the screen looks like.
 
 Specify a base point somewhere on or near the object(s) that you’re 
moving. You can use an Object Snap mode to choose a point exactly on 
one of the objects.
 
 AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify second point or <use first point as 
displacement>:
 
6. Specify the second point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 The second point serves as the arrow end of your imaginary displace-
ment arrow. After you specify the second point, AutoCAD moves the 
objects.
 
 Don’t press Enter alone at this prompt! If you do, AutoCAD treats the X,Y 
coordinates of the first point you picked as an absolute displacement, 
and the objects fly off unpredictably. I repeat: Don’t press Enter alone at 
this prompt! Pressing Enter without picking a point or typing coordinates 
at this prompt is one of the most common errors new AutoCAD users 
make, and it can really pollute your drawing with unwanted objects.

215
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
 
Figure 11-2: 
Dragging 
objects in 
the middle 
of the MOVE 
command.
 
 
These are common precision techniques for specifying the second point:
 ✓ 
Use an Object Snap mode to pick a second point exactly on another 
object in the drawing.
 ✓ 
Type a relative or polar coordinate, as described in Chapter 7. For exam-
ple, if you type @6,2, AutoCAD moves the objects 6 units to the right and 
2 units up. If you type @3<45, AutoCAD moves the objects 3 units at an 
angle of 45 degrees.
Use direct distance entry to move objects in an orthogonal or polar tracking 
direction. See Chapter 7 for instructions.
Copy
 
 The COPY command works almost identically to the MOVE command, except 
that AutoCAD leaves the selected objects in place and makes new copies of 
them in the new location.

216
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
The COPY command creates multiple copies by default. If you want only 
one copy, press Enter after placing it in the drawing. Choosing mOde at the 
command prompt or the dynamic input options list lets you switch between 
making a single copy and multiple copies. If you mostly make multiple copies 
or mostly make single copies, you’ll appreciate being able to change the 
default setting.
 
The COPY command includes an Undo option with which you can roll back 
multiple copies within a single COPY operation.
Copy between drawings
You can’t copy objects from one drawing to another with the COPY com-
mand. Instead, you use the COPYCLIP command together with its companion 
command, PASTECLIP.
COPYCLIP and PASTECLIP use the Windows Clipboard to temporarily store 
drawing objects from one file so they can be pasted into another file. The 
Clipboard panel on the Ribbon contains Cut, Copy, and Paste tools, the three 
standard Clipboard buttons you find in every Windows program.
 
As you’re figuring out where things are hiding in the AutoCAD 2011 Ribbon, 
remember that the standard Windows keyboard shortcuts — Ctrl+X (cut), 
Ctrl+C (copy), and Ctrl+V (paste) — are still available and are often the most 
efficient way of using the Windows Clipboard — even after you’ve found the 
Clipboard panel!
Table 11-2 summarizes AutoCAD’s most important Clipboard-related com-
mands, along with the equivalent choices on the right-click menu and 
Ribbon’s Clipboard panel. (The classic Standard toolbar buttons’ tooltips 
display the same names.)

Stretch
The STRETCH command is superficially similar to COPY and MOVE; it has the 
same inscrutable base point and displacement prompts, and it shifts objects — 
or parts of objects — to other locations in the drawing. But it also has impor-
tant differences that often confound new AutoCAD users to the point that they 
give up trying to figure out how to use STRETCH. That’s a mistake because 
STRETCH is a valuable command. With it, you can perform editing operations 
in seconds, whereas other commands would take many minutes to use. Here 
are the things you need to know to make STRETCH your friend:
 ✓ 
Selecting objects to stretch: To use STRETCH, you must select objects 
by using a crossing selection box (or crossing polygon), as described in 
Chapter 10. See Figure 11-3 for a visual explanation.
 
Figure 11-3: 
Use a 
crossing

box to select

After Stretch

218
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 ✓ 
Defining points: STRETCH operates on the defining points of objects — 
endpoints of a line, vertices of a polyline, the center of a circle, and so 
on — according to the following rule: If a defining point is within the 
crossing selection box that you specify, AutoCAD moves the defining 
point and updates the object accordingly.
 
 For example, if your crossing selection box surrounds one endpoint of a 
line but not the other endpoint, STRETCH moves the first endpoint and 
redraws the line in the new position dictated by the first endpoint’s new 
location. It’s as though you have a rubber band tacked to the wall with 
two pins, and you move one of the pins.
 ✓ 
Compressing and stretching: STRETCH can make lines longer or 
shorter, depending on your crossing selection box and displacement 
vector. In other words, the STRETCH command really combines stretch-
ing and compressing.
 ✓ 
Getting in the mode: It’s a good idea to turn on Ortho or Polar Tracking 
mode before stretching. Otherwise, you’ll end up stretching objects in 
strange directions, as shown in Figure 11-4.

ing without

The following steps describe how to stretch lines:
 
1. Draw some lines in an arrangement similar to the dark lines shown in 
Figure 11-5.
 
 Start your stretching with simple objects. You can work up to more com-
plicated objects — polylines, arcs, and so on — after you’ve limbered up 
with lines.
 
2. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.

3. Click the Stretch button on the Modify panel of the Ribbon’s 
Home tab.
 
 The command line displays the Select objects prompt with a warn-
ing to use the Crossing or CPolygon object selection mode:
Select objects to stretch by crossing-window or 
crossing-polygon...
Select objects:
 
4. Pick points to specify a crossing selection box that encloses some, but 
not all, endpoints of the lines.
 
 Figure 11-5 shows a sample crossing selection box that completely 
encloses the two vertical lines on the right side of the figure. This cross-
ing selection box cuts through the four horizontal lines, enclosing only 
one endpoint of each.
 
 You specify a crossing selection box by picking a point, moving your 
mouse to the left, and picking a second point.

220
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
5. Press Enter to end object selection.
 
 AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:
 
6. Specify a base point by object snapping to a point on an existing 
object or by typing absolute X,Y coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD displays the following prompt:
Specify second point or <use first point as 
displacement>:
 
 Toggle Ortho mode on and then off by clicking the Ortho Mode button 
on the status bar; try moving the crosshairs around first with ortho on 
and then with it off to see the difference.
 
 Figure 11-5 shows what the screen looks like as you move the crosshairs 
around without benefit of ortho or polar tracking.
 
7. Toggle Ortho mode on (if it isn’t already), and then specify the second 
point — usually by using direct distance entry.
 
 You can also specify the second point by object snapping to a point on 
an existing object or by typing relative X,Y coordinates.
 
 After you pick the second point, AutoCAD stretches the objects. Notice 
that the STRETCH command moved the two vertical lines because the 
crossing selection box contained both endpoints of both lines. STRETCH 
lengthened or shortened the four horizontal lines because the crossing 
selection box enclosed only one endpoint of each.
The STRETCH command takes some practice, but it’s worth the effort. Draw 
some additional kinds of objects and practice stretching with different cross-
ing selection box locations as well as different base points and second points.
 
The STRETCH command prompt says Select objects to stretch by 
crossing-window or crossing-polygon but picking points as in Step 4 
doesn’t give you the crossing-polygon option. (See Chapter 10 if you need a 
refresher on crossing-polygon selection.) To use a polygonal crossing selec-
tion, type CP at the Select objects prompt and press Enter.
More Manipulations
The commands in this section — MIRROR, ROTATE, SCALE, ARRAY, and 
OFFSET — provide other ways (in addition to MOVE, COPY, and STRETCH) 
of manipulating objects or creating new versions of them. The procedures for 

221
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
each command assume that you’re familiar with the object selection and edit-
ing precision techniques presented in the MOVE, COPY, and STRETCH proce-
dures (see Chapter 10 and the previous sections in this chapter).
Mirror
The MIRROR command creates a reverse copy of one or more objects. After 
you select your objects, AutoCAD prompts you to select two points that 
define a line about which the objects will be mirrored. You then have the 
option to retain or delete the source objects. Follow these steps to use the 
MIRROR command:
 
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.
 
 
2. Click the Mirror button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
3. Select one or more objects, and then press Enter to end object 
selection.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to define the mirror line by picking points:
Specify first point of mirror line:
 
4. Specify the start of the mirror line by clicking a point or typing 
coordinates.
  
AutoCAD prompts
Specify second point of mirror line:
 
5. Pick a second point.
 
 Most of the time you’ll want to have Polar Tracking or Ortho Mode 
enabled so you can mirror your objects precisely. The mirrored copies 
temporarily disappear and AutoCAD prompts:
Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>:
 
 If you enter [Y] at the final prompt, the source objects disappear and 
you’re left with the new mirrored copy. Accept the default No option, to 
retain the source objects along with the mirrored copies.
 
Normally when you mirror text or dimensions, the words come out back-
wards. The system variable MIRRTEXT can handle that little problem. By 
default, MIRRTEXT is turned off (that is, its value is 0) so the text itself still 
reads the right way around after the objects are mirrored. If you really want 
your drawing text to be backwards, change the value of MIRRTEXT to 1. I 
cover system variables in a little more detail in Chapter 26.

222
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Rotate
The ROTATE command pivots one or more objects around a point that you 
specify. Follow these steps to use the ROTATE command:
 
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.
 
 
2. Click the Rotate button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
3. Select one or more objects and then press Enter to end object 
selection.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you for the base point for rotating the selected 
objects:
Specify base point:
 
4. Specify a base point by clicking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 The base point becomes the point around which AutoCAD rotates the 
objects. You also have to specify a rotation angle:
Specify rotation angle or [Copy/Reference] <0>:
 
5. Specify a rotation angle by typing an angle measurement and pressing 
Enter, or just press Enter to accept the default value shown in angle 
brackets.
 
 Alternatively, you can indicate an angle on the screen by moving the 
crosshairs until the Coordinates section of the status bar indicates the 
desired angle and then clicking. If you choose this alternative, you will 
need to use Ortho Mode or Polar Tracking to indicate a precise angle 
(for example, 90 or 45 degrees) or an object snap to rotate an object so 
that it aligns precisely with other objects.
 
 After you specify the rotation angle by typing or picking, AutoCAD 
rotates the objects into their new position. The ROTATE command’s 
Copy option makes a rotated copy while leaving the source object in 
place.
Scale
If you read all my harping about drawing scales and scale factors in Chapter 
4, you may think that the SCALE command performs some magical scale 
transformation on your entire drawing. No such luck. It merely uniformly 
scales one or more objects up or down by a factor that you specify. Here’s 
how it works:

223
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
 
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.
 
 
2. Click the Scale button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
3. Select one or more objects and then press Enter to end object 
selection.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you for the base point about which it will scale all the 
selected objects:
Specify base point:
 
4. Specify a base point by picking a point or typing coordinates.
 
 The base point becomes the point about which the objects are scaled. 
AutoCAD prompts you for the scale factor:
Specify scale factor or [Copy/Reference] <1.0000>:
 
 Don’t assume that AutoCAD will scale the objects but leave them more 
or less where they are in the drawing. AutoCAD scales the distance 
between objects as well as the objects themselves. For example, if you 
select a circle to scale, pick a point outside the circle as the base point 
and then specify a scale factor of 2. AutoCAD not only makes the circle 
twice as big, but also moves the circle twice as far away from the base 
point that you specified. If you want to make a circle bigger but leave it 
where it’s currently located, make sure to select its center point as the 
base point for the scale operation.
 
5. Type a scale factor and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD then scales the objects by the factor that you type, using the 
base point that you specified. Numbers greater than 1 increase the 
objects’ sizes. Numbers smaller than 1 decrease the objects’ sizes.
 
Just like the ROTATE command, SCALE also has a copy option with which you 
can make enlarged or reduced duplicates of selected objects without altering 
the source objects. And both SCALE and ROTATE remember the last scale 
factor or rotation angle entered throughout the drawing session.
Array
The ARRAY command is like a supercharged COPY: You use it to create a 
rectangular grid of objects at regular X and Y spacings or a radial arrange-
ment of objects around a center point at a regular angular spacing. For exam-
ple, you can use rectangular arrays to populate an auditorium with chairs or 
a polar array to populate a bicycle wheel with spokes.

224
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
The following steps describe how to create a rectangular array, which you’ll 
probably do more often than creating a polar array:
 
1. Press Esc to make sure that no command is active and no objects are 
selected.
 
 
2. Click the Array button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
 The Array dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-6. When you start 
the command, “0 Objects Selected” appears at the upper right.
 
Figure 11-6: 
Configure 
rectangular 
or polar 
(circular) 
arrays in 
the Array 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Make sure that Rectangular Array is selected and then click the Select 
Objects button.
 
 The Array dialog box closes temporarily, allowing you to select items to 
array using any object selection method.
 
4. Select one or more objects; then press Enter.
 
 The Array dialog box reappears, and the message below the Select 
Objects button tells you that objects are selected.
 
5. Fill in the five text boxes: Rows, Columns, Row Offset, Column Offset, 
and Angle of Array.
 
 If you see text boxes labeled Center point and a circular image in the 
preview, you’re doing a polar array. Click the Rectangular Array radio 
button at the top of the dialog box and carry on.
 
 The Rows and Columns numbers include the row and column of the 
original objects themselves. In other words, entries of 1 don’t create 
any new objects in that direction. The Row Offset and Column Offset 
measurements are the distances between adjacent rows and columns. 

225
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
You can use the three buttons to the right of the Row Offset and Column 
Offset edit boxes to eyeball offset distances, but usually you should 
specify precise values in the edit boxes. The Angle of Array is the rota-
tion angle of the rectangular array; when the angle is 0 degrees, the 
array is aligned with the crosshairs.
 
6. Click the Preview button.
 
 Once again the Array dialog box disappears, and you see a preview of 
what the array will look like with your current settings. You can pan and 
zoom in the drawing if you need to in order to see the full results.
  
AutoCAD prompts:
Pick or press Esc to return to dialog or <Right-click 
to accept array>:
 
7. Right-click if you’re satisfied with the array or press Esc if you want to 
change the array parameters.
Offset
You use OFFSET to create parallel or concentric copies of lines, polylines, 
circles, arcs, or splines. Follow these steps to use OFFSET:
 
 
1. Click the Offset button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
 AutoCAD displays the current command settings and prompts you for 
the offset distance — the distance from the original object to the copy 
you’re creating:
Current settings: Erase source=No Layer=Source 
OFFSETGAPTYPE=0
Specify offset distance or [Through/Erase/Layer] 
<Through>:
 
2. Type an offset distance and press Enter.
 
 Alternatively, you can indicate an offset distance by picking two points 
on the screen. If you choose this method, you should normally use 
object snaps to specify a precise distance from one existing object to 
another.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select the object from which you want to 
create an offset copy:
Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:

226
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
3. Select a single object, such as a line, a polyline, or an arc.
 
 Note that you can select only one object at a time with the OFFSET com-
mand. AutoCAD asks where you want the offset object.
Specify point on side to offset or [Exit/Multiple/
Undo] <Exit>:
 
4. Point to one side or the other of the object and then click.
 
 It doesn’t matter how far away from the object the crosshairs are when 
you click. You’re simply indicating a direction.
 
 AutoCAD repeats the Select object prompt, in case you want to 
offset other objects by the same distance:
Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>:
 
5. Go back to Step 3 if you want to offset another object or press Enter if 
you’re finished offsetting objects for now.
Figure 11-7 shows the OFFSET command in progress. For information on the 
command options — and Multiple, Erase, and Layer are all useful options — 
look up OFFSET in the online help’s Command Reference section.

If you want to offset a series of connected lines (for example, a rectangular 
house plan outline or one side of a pathway on a map), make sure that you 
either draw it as a polyline or convert the individual line and/or arc segments 
into a polyline with the PEDIT command. (Look up PEDIT in the online help to 
find out how.) If you draw a series of line segments with the LINE command 
and then try to offset it, you have to pick each segment and offset it individu-
ally. Even worse, the corners usually aren’t finished off in the way that you’d 
expect because AutoCAD doesn’t treat the segments as connected. You avoid 
all these problems by offsetting a polyline, which AutoCAD does treat as a 
single object. Figure 11-7 shows an offset polyline. See Chapter 8 for more 
information about the differences between lines and polylines.
Slicing, Dicing, and Splicing
The commands in this section — TRIM, EXTEND, BREAK, FILLET, CHAMFER, 
and JOIN — are useful for shortening and lengthening objects, for breaking 
them in two, and for putting them back together again.
Trim and Extend
TRIM and EXTEND are the twin commands for making lines, polylines, and 
arcs shorter and longer. They’re the yin and yang, the Laurel and Hardy, the 
Jack Sprat and his wife of the AutoCAD editing world. The two commands 
and their prompts are almost identical, so the following steps cover both. I 
show the prompts for the TRIM command; the EXTEND prompts are similar:
 
 
1. Click the Trim or Extend button on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select cutting edges that will do the trimming (or, 
if you choose the EXTEND command, boundary edges for extending to):
Current settings: Projection=UCS, Edge=None
Select cutting edges ...
Select objects or <select all>:
 
2. Press Enter to accept the default option to select all drawing objects, 
or select individual objects by picking them. Press Enter to end object 
selection.
 
 The objects you select in this step become the cutting edge of the TRIM 
command or the boundary to which objects will be extended by the 
EXTEND command.
 
 Figure 11-8 shows a cutting edge (for TRIM) and a boundary edge (for 
EXTEND).

228
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
Figure 11-8: 
Anatomy of 
the TRIM 
and EXTEND 
operations.
 
Cutting edge (for trim)
Boundary edge (for extend)
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select objects that you want to trim or extend 
(EXTEND doesn’t have the eRase option):
Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or 
[Fence/Crossing/Project/Edge/eRase/Undo]:
 
3. Select a single object to trim or extend. Choose the portion of the 
object that you want AutoCAD to trim away or the end of the object 
that’s closer to the extend-to boundary.
 
 AutoCAD trims or extends the object to one of the objects that you 
selected in Step 2. If AutoCAD can’t trim or extend the object — for exam-
ple, if the trimming object and the object to be trimmed are parallel — the 
command line displays an error message such as Object does not 
intersect an edge.
 
 You can select multiple objects to trim and extend by typing F and 
pressing Enter to use the Fence object selection mode or by entering C 
to use Crossing selection. Even better, you can use implied windowing 
and drag a selection box to select multiple objects. Refer to Chapter 10 
for more on multiple object selection.

229
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
 
 The command line continues to prompt you to select other objects to 
trim or extend:
Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or 
[Fence/Crossing/Project/Edge/eRase/Undo]:
 
4. Choose additional objects or press Enter when you’re finished trim-
ming or extending.
 
 Here’s a triple-threat tip: If you accidentally trim or extend the wrong 
object and you’re still in the TRIM or EXTEND command, type U and press 
Enter to undo the most recent trim or extend. You can switch between 
TRIM and EXTEND without exiting the command by holding down the 
Shift key for the other tool. And finally, if you find yourself with a remnant 
that won’t trim because it doesn’t cross the cutting edge, type R (for 
eRase) and press Enter to erase it without leaving the TRIM command.
The example in Figure 11-8 shows trimming to a single cutting edge, in which 
the end of each trimmed line gets lopped off. Another common use of the 
TRIM command is for trimming out a piece of a line between two cutting 
edges. In the two-cutting-edges scenario, TRIM cuts a piece out of the middle 
of the trimmed line. The default option for selecting cutting edges or bound-
aries is ALL, which works well in this scenario. Pressing Enter to accept the 
default option selects all objects in the drawing as a cutting edge if you’re in 
the TRIM command, or a boundary if you’re in the EXTEND command.
 
 The LENGTHEN (LEN) command provides other useful ways to make lines, 
arcs, and polylines longer (or shorter). You can specify an absolute distance 
(or delta) to lengthen or shorten by, a percentage to lengthen or shorten by, 
or a new total length. Look up the LENGTHEN command in AutoCAD’s help 
system for more information.
Break
The BREAK command isn’t what you use before heading out for coffee. 
(AutoCAD doesn’t have a command for that yet, but I keep hoping.) It’s for 
creating gaps in lines, polylines, circles, arcs, or splines. BREAK also comes 
in handy if you need to split one object into two without actually removing 
any visible material.
The following example shows how you BREAK an object (don’t worry — in 
AutoCAD, you won’t have to pay for it):
 
 
1. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the label of the Modify panel to open 
its slideout and then click the Break button.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select a single object that you want to break.

230
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
2. Select a single object, such as a line, a polyline, or an arc.
 
 The point you pick when selecting the object serves double duty: It 
selects the object, of course, but it also becomes the default first break 
point (that is, it defines one side of the gap that you’ll create). Thus, you 
should either use one of the AutoCAD precision techniques, such as an 
object snap, to pick the object at a precise point or use the First 
point option (described in the next step) to repick the first break point.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the second break point or to type F 
and press Enter if you want to respecify the first break point:
Specify second break point or [First point]:
 
3. If the point that you picked in the preceding step doesn’t also corre-
spond to a break point (see the previous Tip), type F and press Enter 
to respecify the first break point. Then pick the point with an object 
snap or other precision technique.
 
 If you do type F and press Enter and then respecify the first break point, 
AutoCAD prompts you to select the second break point:
Specify second break point:
 
4. Specify the second break point by picking a point or typing 
coordinates.
 
 AutoCAD cuts a section out of the object, using the first and second 
break points to define the length of the gap.
 
 If you want to cut an object into two pieces without removing anything, click 
the Break at Point button on the Modify panel’s slideout. You first select the 
object and then choose a point that defines where AutoCAD breaks the 
object in two. You can then move, copy, or otherwise manipulate each sec-
tion of the original object as a separate object.
Fillet and Chamfer
Whereas TRIM, EXTEND, and BREAK alter one object at a time, the FILLET 
and CHAMFER commands modify a pair of objects. As Figure 11-9 shows, 
FILLET creates a curved corner between two lines, whereas CHAMFER cre-
ates a beveled corner. (In case you wondered, it’s pronounced FILL-et, not fill-
AY. Saying that you know how to fill-AY may get you a job in a butcher shop, 
but it will get you strange looks in a design office.)
The following steps describe how to use the FILLET command. The CHAMFER 
command works similarly except that, instead of specifying a fillet radius, 
you specify either two chamfer distances or a chamfer length and angle.

231

1. Click the Fillet button on the Home tab panel of the Ribbon.
 
 FILLET and CHAMFER share a flyout button; if you see a straight-line 
corner instead of a rounded one, click the flyout arrow to select FILLET.
 
 AutoCAD displays the current fillet settings and prompts you to select 
the first object for filleting or specify one of three options:
Current settings: Mode = TRIM, Radius = 0.0000
Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/ 
Multiple]:
 2. 
Type R and press Enter to set the fillet radius.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the fillet radius that it uses for future 
fillet operations:
Specify fillet radius <0.0000>:
 
3. Type a fillet radius and press Enter.
 
 The number you type will be the radius of the arc that joins the two 
lines.
 
 AutoCAD then asks you to select the first object:
Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/ 
Multiple]:
 
4. Select the first line of the pair that you want to fillet.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to select the second object for filleting:
Select second object or shift-select to apply corner:
 
5. Select the second line of the pair that you want to fillet.
 
 AutoCAD fillets the two objects, drawing an arc of the radius that you 
specified in Step 3.

232
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
You can fillet two lines and specify a radius of zero to make them meet at a 
point. If you have lots of lines to fillet, whether with a zero or the same non-
zero radius, use the FILLET command’s Multiple option to speed the process.
Holding down the Shift key before picking the second line automatically gives 
you a clean intersection, the same as if you’d set the fillet radius to 0. The 
CHAMFER command has the same Shift-select option.
Join
Use the JOIN command to fill gaps in lines, arcs, elliptical arcs, splines, and 
polylines. If the lines are collinear (that is, they lie in the same straight line), 
or the arcs, splines, polylines, or elliptical arcs are on a similarly curved path, 
JOIN will create a single new entity to replace the existing separate pieces, as 
shown in Figure 11-10.
 
Figure 11-10: 
Joining 
sundered 
pieces.
 

233
 Chapter 11: Edit for Credit
The following steps describe how to use the JOIN command:
 
 
1. Click the Modify panel title at the bottom edge of the Ribbon’s Home 
tab to open the Modify panel’s slideout, then click the Join button.
 
 If you foresee doing a lot of joinery, you can pin the slideout open, 
as shown in Figure 11-10. AutoCAD prompts you to select the source 
object.
 2. 
Select the source object — that is, the object you want to join other 
objects to.
 
 AutoCAD prompts according to the object type selected. If you select a 
line, the command prompt or dynamic input tooltip shows
Select lines to join to source:
 
3. Select valid objects to join to the original source object.
 
 For example, if you selected a line as your source object, AutoCAD con-
tinues prompting for additional collinear lines until you press Enter to 
end object selection.
 
4. Press Enter to end the command.
 
 AutoCAD joins the selected objects into a single object. The new object 
will inherit relevant properties such as layer or linetype of the source 
object.
 
Splines have been more difficult to combine with other object types — until 
AutoCAD 2011. Now, as long as you select the spline first, you can use JOIN to 
connect splines to 3D polylines and helixes, as well as to lines, arcs, and poly-
lines. This feature is probably most useful in 3D modeling, as the objects 
you’re joining don’t even have to be on the same plane.
 
You can turn an arc into a circle or an elliptical arc into a full ellipse with 
JOIN’s cLose option.
 
 AutoCAD 2011’s REVERSE command provides an easy way of reversing the 
direction of lines and polylines. Why does that matter? Well, most of the time 
it doesn’t, but if you happen to be using a complex linetype that uses text or 
a directional arrow block, you probably want the text to read right-way-up 
and the arrow to point in the right direction. Lines, polylines, and other 
entity types have start points and end points, and therefore, a direction that 
runs from the former to the latter. Instead of redrawing linework so your text 
or symbols appear the right way up, use the REVERSE command to flip the 
start and end points.

234
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Polishing those properties
When you think of editing objects, you probably 
think first about editing their geometry: moving, 
stretching, making new copies, and so on.
 
That’s the kind of editing I cover in this chapter.
Another kind of editing is changing objects’
 
properties. As I describe in Chapter 6, every 
object in an AutoCAD drawing has a set of non-
geometrical properties, including layer, color, 
linetype, lineweight, transparency, and maybe 
plot style. Sometimes, you need to edit those 
properties — when you accidentally draw
 
something on the wrong layer, for example. A 
handful of ways of editing an object’s proper-
ties in AutoCAD are
 ✓ The Properties palette:  This is the most  
flexible way to edit properties. Select any 
object (or objects), right-click in the draw-
ing area, and choose Properties from the 
menu. The Properties palette displays the 
names and values of all properties. Click in 
the appropriate value cell to change a par-
ticular property.
 ✓ The Quick Properties panel:
 If Quick  
Properties is enabled by clicking its status 
bar button, a panel pops up near the cross-
hairs when you select an object. Like the 
Properties palette, the Quick Properties  
panel contains value cells that you can
 
click to change the specific property. You 
can choose how many lines of information  
you want Quick Properties to display by
 
right-clicking the Quick Properties status 
bar button and choosing Settings.
 ✓ Layers and Properties control lists:
 
Another way to change properties is to
 
select objects and then choose from the 
drop-down lists (Layer, Color, and so on) 
on the Properties panel. It’s fine to change  
layers this way, but don’t be slap-dash
 
about changing the other properties — see 
Chapter 6 for more information.
 ✓ Match Properties:  You can use Match
 
Properties to copy the properties from a  
source object to one or more other objects. 
You can find the Match Properties button 
on the Clipboard panel of the AutoCAD
 
2011 Ribbon’s Home tab. Match Properties  
works similarly to the Format Painter button 
in Microsoft applications. Match Properties 
works even when the objects reside in dif-
ferent drawings.
 ✓ Change Space: I introduce the concepts of 
model space and paper space in Chapters  
4 and 5. Sometimes you add some geometry 
to paper space and then realize it should 
have been in model space, or vice versa. 
The former CHSPACE Express tool is now 
part of core AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT — 
you’ll find it on the Modify panel slideout 
on the Ribbon’s Home tab. For more infor-
mation, look up CHSPACE in the Command 
Reference of the online help.

Chapter 12
A Zoom with a View
In This Chapter
▶ Zooming and panning
▶ Naming and restoring views
▶ Zooming and panning in paper space layouts
▶ Regenerating the display
O
ne of AutoCAD’s advantages over manual drawing is its ability to show 
you different views of your drawing. You can zoom in close, zoom out 
to a great distance, and pan around. In fact, not only can you zoom and pan in 
your drawing, but in most kinds of drawings, you must do it frequently to be 
able to draw and edit effectively.
Technical drawings are jam-packed with lines, text, and dimensions. Zooming 
and panning frequently enables you to see the details better, draw more 
confidently (because you can see what you’re doing), and edit more quickly 
(because object selection is easier when there aren’t a zillion objects on the 
screen). This chapter covers AutoCAD’s most useful display control features.
Zoom and Pan with Glass and Hand
Moving your viewpoint in to get a closer view of your drawing data is called 
zooming in; moving your viewpoint back to get a more expansive view is 
called zooming out. Moving your viewpoint to another part of your drawing 
without zooming in or out is called panning.
Changing your viewing position lets you do detailed work on tiny objects and 
then zoom out and move around rooms, houses, or neighborhoods from an 
Olympian perspective. Early versions of AutoCAD included a sample drawing 
of our solar system, drawn to scale with kilometers as units, which proved 
this. If you zoomed all the way out, you could see Pluto’s orbit (yes, kids, 
Pluto was a planet back then), and you could zoom in close enough to Earth’s 
moon to read the inscription on the plaque left by the Apollo 11 astronauts!

236
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Panning means changing your viewing position without changing the mag-
nification of the view. If you zoom in enough that some of your drawing no 
longer shows up on-screen, you’re going to want to pan around — move left, 
right, up, and down in your drawing — without zooming in and out. AutoCAD 
makes panning easy with scroll bars and realtime panning. And in case you’re 
wondering what realtime panning might be (as opposed to pretendtime pan-
ning, maybe?), it simply means you can see the objects moving around the 
screen as you drag the mouse up and down or back and forth. (Of course, it’s 
your viewpoint that’s moving, not the objects!)
Both panning and zooming change the view — the current location and mag-
nification of the AutoCAD depiction of your drawing. Each time you zoom 
or pan, you establish a new view. You can give a name to a specific view to 
make returning to that view easy, as I demonstrate in the section “A View by 
Any Other Name . . . ,” later in this chapter.
You’ll get a better sense of panning and zooming around a drawing if you 
actually have a drawing to look at. Draw some objects on the screen, open 
one of your own existing drawings, or launch one of AutoCAD’s sample draw-
ings. (If you haven’t done so already, you can download the sample files from 
www.autodesk.com/autocad-samples; the AutoCAD LT sample files are 
also online now, at www.autodesk.com/autocadlt-samples.)
Navigating your drawing
 
Sometimes it seems like the Autodesk programmers like to keep us users on 
our toes. For the second time in two releases, they’ve relocated two of the 
most frequently used commands in all of AutoCAD — PAN and ZOOM. These 
commands and a few others now appear on a new interface component called 
the Navigation bar.
The Navigation bar is linked by default to another interface component 
named the ViewCube. The ViewCube was present in AutoCAD 2010, but 
only in 3D viewing modes; it’s now available in 2D Wireframe mode as well. 
(AutoCAD LT users get the Navigation bar, but not the ViewCube.) Figure 12-1 
shows the upper-right corner of the AutoCAD window with the ViewCube and 
Navigation bar in their default locations.
I fill you in on the ViewCube in Chapter 21, since it’s a more useful tool 
in three dimensions than in two. I also cover the SteeringWheels and 
ShowMotion commands in Part V of this book.
Controlling your cube
Apart from the big chunk of screen space the ViewCube and Navigation bar 
occupy, the cube itself has some disconcerting behaviors. If you click the 
Home button, for example, you automatically switch to a preset 3D isometric 
view — not that helpful if you’re doing a 2D drawing.

237
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View

I think the cube-bar combo is worthwhile when you’re doing 3D modeling, 
but more intrusive than useful for 2D drafting. Luckily, AutoCAD offers quite 
a bit of control over both the ViewCube and the Navigation bar. You can turn 
off the navigation buttons you don’t use, and you can turn off the ViewCube 
itself, either for the drawing session or permanently. 
 ✓ 
To turn off navigation buttons: Open the Navigation bar’s menu by 
clicking the down arrow at its bottom-right corner (refer to Figure 12-1) 
and unchecking SteeringWheels, Orbit, and ShowMotion.
 ✓ 
To turn off the ViewCube for the current drawing session: Go to the 
View tab’s Windows panel, click User Interface, and uncheck ViewCube. 
When you turn off the ViewCube, AutoCAD adds a new button that lets 
you turn it on again; to remove that button, open the menu again and 
uncheck ViewCube. The cube will come back again, the next time you 
start AutoCAD.
 ✓ 
To turn off the ViewCube permanently: Open the Options dialog box, 
select the 3D Modeling tab, and in the Display ViewCube or UCS Icon 
area, uncheck In 2D Model Space Display ViewCube.

238
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
In addition to the Navigation bar, the Navigate panel of the Ribbon’s View tab 
contains a Pan button and a flyout set of Zoom tool buttons (in my opinion, 
not a very convenient location for such frequently used commands!).
AutoCAD offers 11 different ways of zooming around in your drawing; I 
explain the most important ones in the next section. The following steps 
describe how to use AutoCAD’s Zoom and Pan Realtime feature, which is 
easy to operate and provides a lot of flexibility:
 
 
1. Click the lower part of the Zoom split button on the Navigation bar 
and choose Zoom Realtime from the menu.
 
 The Realtime option of the ZOOM command starts. The crosshairs 
change to a magnifying glass, and AutoCAD prompts you at the com-
mand line:
Specify corner of window, enter a scale factor (nX or nXP), or [All/Center/
Dynamic/Extents/Previous/Scale/Window/Object] <real time>:
Press ESC or ENTER to exit, or right-click to display shortcut menu.
 
2. Move the magnifying glass cursor near the middle of the screen, press 
and hold down the left mouse button, and drag the cursor up and 
down until the objects you want to see almost fill the screen.
 
 Dragging up increases the zoom magnification, and dragging down 
decreases it.
 
3. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Pan from the menu that 
appears (as shown in Figure 12-2).
 
Figure 12-2: 
The Zoom/
Pan 
Realtime 
right-click 
menu.
 
 
 Because AutoCAD LT doesn’t do 3D, there’s no 3D Orbit choice on LT’s 
right-click menu. The magnifying glass cursor changes to a hand.
 
4. Click and drag to pan the drawing in any direction.
 
 You can use the right-click menu to toggle between Zoom and Pan as 
many times as you like. If you get lost in your drawing, choose Zoom 
Original or Zoom Extents to return to a more familiar view.
 
5. Right-click in the drawing area and choose Exit.
 
 The Zoom or Pan Realtime cursor returns to the normal AutoCAD 
crosshairs.

239
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View
 
 In the preceding example, you started with zooming and ended with panning. 
You also have the option of doing the reverse: Click the Pan button on the 
Navigation bar, and after you’ve panned, use the right-click menu to switch to 
zooming. However you start it, the important thing to realize is that Zoom 
and Pan Realtime is a single AutoCAD function. At any time, you can switch 
between panning and zooming (or switch to a related function, such as Zoom 
Window) by using the right-click menu.
 
You also can pan and zoom by using your mouse’s scroll wheel (if it has one) 
or the middle button of a three-button mouse:
 ✓ 
To pan: Hold down the scroll wheel or the middle button as you move 
the mouse.
 ✓ 
To zoom in and out: Roll the scroll wheel forward and backward.
 ✓ 
To zoom to the extents of your drawing: Double-click the scroll wheel 
or the middle button.
 
The scroll wheel or middle mouse button zoom and pan operations described 
in the preceding list depend on an obscure AutoCAD system variable named 
MBUTTONPAN. When MBUTTONPAN is set to 1 — the default value — you 
can use the middle button to pan and zoom as I describe in the preceding 
list. Unless your system has been customized by someone, if you change 
MBUTTONPAN to 0, clicking the middle mouse button displays an Object Snap 
menu at the crosshairs, as it did in older AutoCAD versions. If you can’t zoom 
or pan with your middle mouse button, set MBUTTONPAN back to 1. (With 
MBUTTONPAN set to 1, you use Shift+right-click to display the Object Snap 
menu at the crosshairs.)
Realtime zooming and panning is the easiest, most interactive way to get 
around in your drawings. In some situations, though, this method is less 
efficient or precise than the old-fashioned methods, the most important of 
which I describe in the next section.
 
Another way to pan in AutoCAD should be familiar from other Windows pro-
grams — the scroll bars in the drawing area. Scrolling is the same in AutoCAD 
as in any other Windows program; click the arrows in the right and bottom 
scroll bars on the borders of the drawing window to scroll, or pan, a step at a 
time; or click and drag the little scroll boxes to pan as little or as much as you 
want to. To turn scroll bars off or on, choose Options in the Application Menu 
(or type OPTIONS or OP) to display the Options dialog box. On the Display 
tab, select or deselect the Display Scroll Bars in Drawing Window check box. 
My own preference is not to use scroll bars and regain the space, so that’s 
why you don’t see them in most figures in this book.

240
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Time to zoom
Realtime zooming is good as far as it goes, but you get much more control 
over the display if you use some of ZOOM’s alternative methods. Because 
zooming is such a frequent activity in AutoCAD, it’s worth knowing some of 
those alternative ways of doing it.
In addition to the Navigation bar button I describe above, you’ll find tool but-
tons for all the ZOOM options on the View tab’s Navigate panel. The magni-
fying-glass button has a menu — click the down arrow beside the magnifying 
glass, and a menu with the other options opens (see Figure 12-3).
 
Figure 12-3: 
A menu for 
magnifying.
 
The ZOOM command has 11 different options, the most important of which 
are the following:
  
 ✓ 
All and Extents: Zoom Extents (the button with the four-headed arrow 
and the magnifying glass) zooms out just far enough to show all the 
objects in the current drawing. Zoom All (the button showing the sheet 
with the folded-over corner) does the same thing, unless the drawing’s 
limits are larger than the extents, in which case, Zoom All zooms to 
show the entire rectangular area defined by the limits. These two 

241
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View
options are especially useful when you zoom in too small or pan off into 
empty space and want to see your entire drawing again.
 
 It’s a good idea to Zoom All or Zoom Extents and then save the drawing 
before you close it. By performing these steps, you ensure the following:
 
• The next person who opens the drawing — whether it’s you or 
someone else — can see the full drawing as soon as they start 
working.
 
• If you’ve accidentally copied some objects way beyond where they 
should be, Zoom All or Extents will make them show up so you can 
delete them.
 
• The drawing preview that appears in the Select File dialog box dis-
plays the full drawing, instead of just a tiny, unidentifiable corner 
of it.
 
 ✓ 
Window: This option is great for zooming in quickly and precisely. It 
zooms to a section of your drawing that you specify by clicking two 
points. The two points define the diagonal of a window around the area 
you want to look at.
 
 Note that the ZOOM command’s Window option is not a click-and-drag 
operation — unlike in some other Windows programs and, confusingly, 
unlike in the Zoom/Pan Realtime Zoom Window option. With the ZOOM 
command’s Window option, you click one corner, release the mouse 
button, and then click the other corner.
 
 ✓ 
Realtime: Realtime zooming, the technique described previously, 
enables you to zoom in and out by starting a realtime zoom and then 
moving the crosshairs up (to zoom in) or down (to zoom out).
 
 ✓ 
Previous: This option undoes the last zoom and/or pan sequence, taking 
you back to where you started.
 
 ✓ 
Object: This option zooms in close enough to show selected objects as 
large as they can be displayed on-screen. Using ZOOM Object is like put-
ting the selected objects under AutoCAD’s microscope.
 AutoCAD 
provides smooth view transitions whenever you use the non-realtime 
pan and zoom commands. Sometimes you can get lost if you do a ZOOM All 
from a small, highly magnified area. It’s a bad idea to leave a trail of bread-
crumbs across your screen, so these slow-motion pans and zooms may be 
fine, at least until you do know your way out of the forest . . . or your drawing. 
If, like me, you find that this feature gets old fast, there’s a View Transitions 
dialog box (type VTOPTIONS to open it) in which you can turn it off. Just 
uncheck the Enable Animation for Pan & Zoom option.
Some of the zoom options take some getting used to. I recommend that 
you use realtime zoom and pan for most of your zooming and panning. 

242
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
Supplement it with Zoom Window to move quickly into a precise area, Zoom 
Previous to go back in zoom/pan time, and Zoom All or Zoom Extents to view 
your whole drawing.
 
If you’re wondering about those other ZOOM command options — the ones 
I suggest are less important (Dynamic, Center, Scale, In and Out), look up 
ZOOM in the online help’s command reference section. Zoom Dynamic is 
an old, old command option that’s been made redundant by the Real Time 
option. As for the remaining options, and you can probably get to the view 
you want by deft movements with your wheel mouse (you are using a wheel 
mouse, aren’t you?)
A View by Any Other Name . . .
If you find yourself repeatedly zooming and panning to the same area, you 
can probably get there faster with a named view. After you name and save a 
view of a particular area of your drawing, you can return to that area quickly 
by restoring the view. You use the VIEW command, which displays the View 
Manager dialog box, to create and restore named views.
 
The View Manager now manages shots as well as views. Views have been a 
part of AutoCAD from very early days, but shots are a recent addition. While 
views are static, shots are motion based. (If you’re using the full version [that 
is, not AutoCAD LT], you may have noticed the ShowMotion button on the 
Navigation bar.) And not only can you create animated scenes, you can even 
add fancy transitions like jump cuts and fades. I introduce you to shots (the 
non-potable kind!) and the ShowMotion command in Part V of this book.
Follow these steps to create a named view:
 
1. Zoom and pan until you find the area of the drawing that you want to 
assign a name to.
 
2. On the Ribbon’s View tab, choose Named Views from the View panel.
 
 The View Manager dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the New button.
 
 The New View / Shot Properties dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 12-4.
 
4. Type a name in the View Name text box.
 
5. (Optional) Type a new category in the View Category box or select an 
existing one from the drop-down list.
 
 You create your own View Categories to organize views and certain 
display characteristics of views. This is mainly used in sheet sets. If you 
aren’t using the sheet sets feature, you can leave this box blank.

243
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View

6. Make sure the View Type drop-down is set to Still.
 
 Visit the New Features Workshop and the online help if you want to 
know more about the Cinematic and Recorded Walk options.
 
 AutoCAD LT doesn’t support view categories or types. The New View 
dialog box in LT is missing the View Category and View Type list boxes 
as well as the Background area shown in Figure 12-4.
 
7. In the Boundary area, select the Current Display radio button, if it’s 
not selected already.
 
 If you want to save a different view boundary, select the Define Window 
radio button instead, click the Define View Window button to the right of 
it, and pick two corners of the region’s boundary (as if you were zoom-
ing windows).
 
8. Confirm or change the choices in the Settings area.
 
 If you select the Save Layer Snapshot with View check box, when you 
later restore the view, AutoCAD also will restore the layer visibility set-
tings (on/off and freeze/thaw) that were in effect when you created the 
view. (Chapter 6 describes the layer visibility settings.) The Live Section 
and Visual Style settings are primarily for 3D drawings; these two set-
tings are not included in AutoCAD LT.
 9. 
Click OK.
 
 The New View/Shot Properties (New View in AutoCAD LT) dialog box 
disappears, and you see your new named view in the list in the View 
Manager dialog box.

244
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 10. 
Click OK.
 
 The View Manager dialog box disappears.
To restore a named view, proceed as follows:
 
1. Go back to the Ribbon’s View tab and choose Named Views from the 
View panel.
  
Alternatively, type VIEW (or V) and press Enter. The View Manager 
dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Views list, expand either Model Views or Layout Views (depend-
ing on where you saved your view).
 
3. Click the name of the view that you want to restore, click the Set 
Current button, and then click OK to close the dialog box.
 
You also can plot the area defined by a named view. See Chapter 16 for 
instructions on plotting views.
Looking Around in Layout Land
All the zoom, pan, and view operations I describe in this chapter work in 
paper space layouts as well as in model space. (Chapters 4 and 5 describe 
the differences between model space and paper space and how to navigate 
between the two.) One little complication exists, though: In a paper space 
layout — that is, any drawing area tab except for the Model tab — it’s pos-
sible for the crosshairs to be in either paper space or in model space inside 
a viewport. Zooming and panning have a different effect depending on which 
space your crosshairs are in at the moment. You switch between the two 
spaces using the MSPACE (alias MS) and PSPACE (PS) commands.
Experiment with the different effects by following these steps:
 
1. Open a drawing that contains at least one paper space layout with a 
title block and one or more viewports.
 
 If you don’t have any such drawings handy, try using one of the 
AutoCAD sample drawings that you can download from www.autodesk.
com/autocad-samples. For example, have a look at architectural_
-_annotation_scaling_and_multileaders.dwg.
 
2. Click Quick View Layouts on the status bar and then click one of the 
layout preview images — that is, any image other than the Model pre-
view image.
 
 AutoCAD displays the paper space layout, including any title block and 
viewports. Click somewhere away from an image to dismiss the Quick 
View image bar.

245
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View
 3. 
Type PSPACE (or its alias PS) and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD will either switch to paper space or tell you that you’re already 
there.
 
 Alternatively, you can double-click in the gray part of the drawing area 
outside the layout.
 
 You should see the triangular paper space UCS icon at the lower-left 
corner of the display. If you don’t see an icon, click the View tab on the 
Ribbon and then click Show UCS Icon or Show UCS Icon at Origin on the 
Coordinates panel’s Show UCS Icon flyout.
 
 The crosshairs are now in paper space, so zooming and panning 
changes the appearance of all the objects in the layout, including the 
title block.
 4. 
Type Z, press Enter, then type A, then press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD displays the entire layout, as shown in Figure 12-5.
 
Figure 12-5: 
The full 
layout.
 
 
 As an alternative to typing — or to navigating through Ribbon panels — 
here’s an easier way to choose from a list of all available ZOOM options: 
Type Z and press Enter, then right-click in the drawing area to see the 
right-click menu, as shown in Figure 12-6.

246
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
Figure 12-6: 
All (and 
Extents, and 
Window) 
is revealed 
when you 
right-click.
 
 
5. Zoom and pan by using any of the techniques described in this 
chapter.
 
 While you’re in paper space, zooming and panning change the magnifica-
tion of the whole drawing layout, as shown in Figure 12-7. The effect is 
similar to moving a plotted sheet in and out and all around in front of 
your face.
 
Figure 12-7: 
Zooming

space.
 

247
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View
 
6. Return to a zoomed-all view using any of these techniques; or type Z 
and press Enter, then type A and press Enter.
 
 AutoCAD displays the entire layout again.
 7. 
Type MSPACE (or MS) and press Enter.
 
 Alternatively, you can double-click with the crosshairs over a viewport.
 
 You should see the model space UCS icon at the lower-left corner of the 
display (refer to Step 3 if you don’t see an icon). The crosshairs are now 
in model space, inside the viewport, so zooming and panning change 
only the display of the objects that are visible in the viewport. The dis-
play of the title block doesn’t change.
 
8. Zoom and pan using any of the techniques described in this chapter.
 
 Zooming and panning don’t change the appearance of the title block, as 
shown in Figure 12-8. The result looks as if you’re moving a picture of 
the model space geometry in and out and all around behind a frame.
 
Figure 12-8: 
Showing 
nothing 
but the

viewport.
 
 
 In real drawings, you usually shouldn’t zoom and pan inside viewports 
after they’ve been set up (see Chapter 5). Doing so changes the scale of 
the viewport, which messes up plotting. I’m asking you to do it here to 
illustrate the difference between zooming in paper space and zooming in 
a model space viewport.

248
Part II: Let There Be Lines 
 
 If the title block changes when you zoom and pan, someone has locked 
the viewport to prevent the kind of mischief that I warn against in the 
previous paragraph. (You also see the command prompt Viewport is 
view-locked. Switching to Paper space.) Refer to Chapter 5 
for information on locking and unlocking viewports.
 
9. Choose Zoom Previous using your favorite ZOOM technique one or 
more times until you’ve restored the original view.
 10. 
Type PS and press Enter.
 
 Always leave the crosshairs in paper space when you’re ready to call a 
drawing finished.
 
11. Click the Close window control in the upper-right corner of the draw-
ing area. Click No to close the drawing without saving changes.
 
 In this example, I have you close the drawing without saving changes 
just in case you did mess up the viewport zoom scale.
In most cases, you set up a paper space layout once, as described in Chapter 
5, and then just return to it to plot. You shouldn’t be spending a lot of time 
zooming and panning in paper space layouts. You zoom and pan to get a 
better view of what you’re drawing and editing, and that’s what full-screen 
model space is for. But if you do want to zoom in paper space — to get a 
better look at part of your title block, for example — make sure that you’re 
doing it with the triangular paper space UCS icon on display at the lower-left 
corner of the drawing area.
 
The VPMAX and VPMIN commands allow you to maximize and minimize 
a viewport in the current layout. These commands provide an alternative 
to switching between the Model and Layout buttons without the potential 
problems of zooming inside of paper space viewports. The easiest way to run 
VPMAX or VPMIN is to click the Maximize Viewport/Minimize Viewport button 
located on the status bar, to the right of the Model and Layout buttons.
Degenerating and Regenerating
 
As you zoom and pan around your drawing, you may wonder how the image 
that you see on-screen is related to the DWG file that AutoCAD saves on the 
hard disk. Well, maybe you don’t wonder about that, but I’m going to tell you 
anyway!
When you draw and edit objects, AutoCAD stores all their geometrical prop-
erties (that is, location and size) in a highly precise form — technically, 
double floating-point precision. The program always maintains that precision 

249
 Chapter 12: A Zoom with a View
when you save the DWG file. For computer performance reasons, however, 
AutoCAD does not use that high-precision form of the data to display your 
drawing on-screen. Instead, AutoCAD converts the highly precise numbers in 
the DWG file into slightly less precise integers in order to create the view that 
you see on-screen.
The happy consequence of this conversion is that zooming, panning, and 
other display changes are a lot faster than they would be otherwise. The 
unhappy consequence is that the conversion, which is a regeneration (or 
regen for short), occasionally leaves you with some on-screen debris to 
deal with.
In most cases, AutoCAD performs regenerations automatically when it needs 
to. You will sometimes see command line messages like Regenerating 
model or Regenerating layout, which indicate that AutoCAD is taking 
care of regens for you.
If, on the other hand, you see the command line message Regen queued, 
AutoCAD is warning you that it’s not performing a regeneration, even though 
one might be advisable now. In addition, you might see a warning dialog box 
with the message About to regen -- proceed? These messages are 
AutoCAD’s way of saying, “What your drawing looks like on the screen at the 
moment may not exactly match the real version of the drawing database that 
gets stored when you save the drawing. I’ll update the display version at the 
next regeneration.” You can control whether regenerations happen automati-
cally with the REGENMODE system variable — see the online help for more 
information on this variable and refer to Chapter 26 for more information on 
system variables in general.
 
The REGENALL (REA) command (once again, command line only) regenerates 
all viewports in a paper space layout. If you run the REGENALL command in 
model space, it has the same effect as the ordinary REGEN command.

Part III
If Drawings 
Could Talk

In this part . . .
T
ext, dimensions, and hatching have long been important 
clarifying elements in drafting. In AutoCAD, these 
elements are flexible almost to a fault, and you can edit 
and update them quickly as you change the geometry 
beneath them. The text, dimension, and hatching annotations 
that you add “speak” about the geometry so that others 
can understand exactly what, how big, and how far.
After you’ve made some drawings that talk, you’ll 
probably send the message around by printing — or as 
CAD users call it, plotting — them. Chapter 16 is your 
guidebook to navigating the plot process, understanding 
how the legacy of AutoCAD plotting influences current 
practice, and most of all, getting a good-looking, properly 
scaled plot onto paper.

t used to be said that “a picture is worth a thousand words.” (What with 
inflation and cost of living increases, a picture is now actually worth 3,974 
words!) The opposite is often true as well: Adding a few words to your draw-
ing can save you from having to draw thousands of lines and arcs. It’s a lot 
easier to write Simpson A35 framing clip next to a simple, schematic 
representation of a clip than to draw one in microscopic detail and hope that 
the contractor can figure out what it is!
Most CAD drawings include some text in the form of explanatory notes, 
object labels, and titles. This chapter shows you how to add general drawing 
text and leaders (descriptive notes with arrows that point to specific drawing 
objects) to your drawings. I show you how to take advantage of AutoCAD’s 
annotative text objects and text styles, as well as how to find specific text 
and check your drawing for spelling errors. Chapter 14 covers text that’s con-
nected with dimensions.
 
In most cases, adding text, dimensions, and other descriptive symbols is 
something that you should do later in the drafting process, after you’ve drawn 
at least some of the geometry. In CAD drawings, text and other annotations 
are usually intended to complement the geometry, not to stand alone. Thus, 
you generally need to have the geometry in place before you annotate it. Many 
drafters find that it’s most efficient to first draw as much geometry as possible 
and then to add text annotations and dimensions to all the geometry at the 

254
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
same time. In this way, you develop a rhythm with the text and dimensioning 
commands instead of bouncing back and forth between drawing geometry and 
adding annotations.
As I mention in Chapter 4, AutoCAD’s annotative objects present a stream-
lined way of adding notes, dimensions, and other annotations to your draw-
ings. This chapter introduces annotative text, and subsequent chapters cover 
annotative dimensions and hatches. See the “Annotatively yours” sidebar, 
later in this chapter, for some background.
Getting Ready to Write
In AutoCAD, adding text to a drawing is only slightly more complicated than 
adding it to a word processing document. Here are the basic steps, which I 
explain in more detail in the following sections:
 
1. Select an existing AutoCAD text style, or create a new style, that 
includes the font and other text characteristics you want to use.
 
 Just like a word processor, AutoCAD uses styles — collections of format-
ting properties — to control the appearance of drawing text. I explain 
text styles in the next section.
 
2. Make an appropriate layer current.
 
 To make your AutoCAD drawing efficient and easy to edit for both you 
and others, create text on its own layer. Most drafting offices already 
have a set of CAD standards that establish specific layers for text and 
other object types.
 3. 
Run one of these commands to draw text:
 • 
MTEXT: Draws paragraph (also called multiline) text
 • 
TEXT: Draws single-line text
 
4. Specify the text alignment points, justification, and (if necessary) 
height.
 
5. Type the text.
 
6. (Optional) For annotative text, assign annotation scales to the text you 
just typed.
You’re probably familiar with most of these steps already — especially if 
you’ve ever used a word processor. In the next few sections of this chapter, 
I review the particularities of AutoCAD text styles, the two kinds of AutoCAD 
text, and ways of controlling height and justification.

255
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
Annotatively yours
One of the great things about AutoCAD is that 
it offers multiple ways of accomplishing your 
drafting tasks. The drawback, of course, is that 
it’s much more complicated to learn. You could 
master one of the ways and then find yourself 
working in an office where you’re expected
 
to use a different way, one that you’ve never 
tried. The solution — one that this book tries to 
provide — is to give you at least a taste of the  
most common methods.
AutoCAD 2011 supports three different methods 
for adding annotations to your drawings:
 ✓ Add text and dimensions in model space, 
multiplying the drawing scale factor (see 
Chapter 4 for details) times the desired
 
plotted text height.  For example, assume 
that someone has drawn a floor plan at a 
scale of 1/4” = 1’–0” (corresponding to a 
drawing scale factor of 48), and you want 
your notes to appear 1/8” high when the 
drawing is plotted to scale. You need to
 
create text that’s 48 times 1/8”, or 6”, high.  
And that works fine — until you need to plot 
your drawing at a different scale.
 ✓ Add text and dimensions in layouts in
 
paper space. Because paper space is plot-
ted at 1:1, you create annotations at their 
actual plotted size. The scale calculations 
are simple (“What’s 1/8” times 1, boss?”), 
but sometimes it’s beneficial to have draw-
ing annotations in the same space as the 
drawing geometry, and you may have to  
duplicate notes in each layout.
 ✓ Add text and dimensions in model space 
using annotative text and dimension styles. 
Create your annotations at their actual plot-
ted size — referred to as paper text height 
by AutoCAD — and then assign annota-
tion scales for all your desired plot scales.  
Changing the annotation scale on the status 
bar automatically changes the visible anno-
tation scale in the drawing.
Using annotative objects makes the most sense 
to me, as they can cover all plot scales. Also, 
because they’re in model space, they don’t
 
have to be duplicated on multiple layouts. As 
you’re learning AutoCAD, one of the more dif-
ficult concepts to grasp is the necessity of scal-
ing text and dimensions to apparently ludicrous 
sizes (6” high drawing text, for example) so that 
they plot correctly. Annotative objects allow  
you to keep your annotations in model space 
and specify the paper size; AutoCAD does the 
scale calculations for you.
Annotative object types include both single-
line and multiline text (covered in the sections 
“Using the Same Old Line” and “Saying More 
in Multiline Text,” respectively, in this chap-
ter), leaders (covered in the section “Bring Out 
Your Inner Leader,” in this chapter), dimensions 
(covered in Chapter 14), hatches (see Chapter 
15), and blocks and attributes (refer to Chapter  
17). By default, only annotative objects at the 
current annotation scale as set on the applica-
tion or drawing status bar are displayed, but a 
handy toggle beside the Annotation Scale list 
lets you view annotative objects at all scales if  
you need to.
The annotative workflow does require an
 
additional step compared with the other two 
methods listed previously. Instead of just cre-
ating your text (or other annotative object),
 
you create it as usual and then add annotation  
scales to the objects. I describe the process 
in detail in the steps in this chapter and in the 
following chapters.

256
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Simply stylish text
AutoCAD assigns text properties to individual lines or paragraphs of text 
based on text styles. These text styles are similar to the paragraph styles in a 
word processor; they contain font and other settings that determine the look 
and feel of text. An AutoCAD text style includes
 ✓ 
The font
 ✓ 
A text height, which you can set to a specific value or leave at 0 for later 
flexibility
 ✓ 
Special effects (where available), such as italic
 ✓ 
Really special effects, such as vertical and upside down, which almost 
nobody uses
Before you add text to a drawing, use the Text Style dialog box to select an 
existing style or create a new one with settings that are appropriate to your 
purpose.
 
You can assign the annotative property to text styles in old drawings by open-
ing the Text Style dialog box in the drawing, selecting the individual text style 
you want to update, selecting the Annotative check box, and then saving the 
drawing in AutoCAD 2011.
Most drawings require very few text styles. You can create one style for all 
notes, object labels, and annotations and another text style for special titles. 
You may also want to create a unique text style for your dimensions (refer to 
Chapter 14 for more on dimension text). A title block may require one or two 
additional fonts, especially if you want to mimic the font used in a company 
logo or project logo.
 
As with layers, your office may have its own text style standards. If so, you’ll 
make everyone happy by following those standards. One of the best ways to 
make your use of text styles efficient and consistent is to create them in a tem-
plate drawing that you use to start new drawings. (If your office is well orga-
nized, it may already have a template drawing with the company-approved 
styles defined in it.) See Chapter 4 for information about creating and using 
templates. Another handy technique is to copy existing text styles from one 
drawing to another by using the DesignCenter palette. See Chapter 6 for 
instructions.
Font follies
When you create a text style in AutoCAD, you have a choice of a huge number 
of fonts. AutoCAD can use two different kinds of fonts: native AutoCAD SHX 
(compiled shape) fonts and Windows TrueType fonts:

257
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 ✓ 
SHX: In the Text Style dialog box, SHX font names appear with a drafting 
compass to the left of the name and display the .shx file extension. SHX 
fonts usually provide better performance because they’re optimized for 
AutoCAD’s use.
 ✓ 
TrueType: In the Text Style dialog box, TrueType font names appear 
with a TT symbol to the left of the name and no file extension. TrueType 
fonts give you more and fancier font options, but they can slow down 
AutoCAD when you zoom, pan, and select and snap to objects. TrueType 
fonts also can cause greater complications when you exchange drawings 
with other AutoCAD users.
It’s okay to use a TrueType font sparingly for something like a title block 
logo, but in general, you should stick with standard AutoCAD SHX fonts 
whenever possible.
 
The most popular AutoCAD font is Romans.shx (Roman Simplex). (You may 
also run into Simplex.shx, an older version of Roman Simplex.) Romans.
shx is a good, general-purpose font for drafting in AutoCAD. Avoid compli-
cated, thick fonts. They can slow down AutoCAD, and they’re usually more dif-
ficult to read than the simpler fonts. Remember, you’re doing CAD here, not 
fancy graphic design or reproductions of medieval manuscripts!
 
Whenever possible, avoid custom fonts, which are font files that don’t come 
with AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT (both programs come with the same fonts). 
AutoCAD installs its standard SHX fonts in the C:\Program Files\
Autodesk\AutoCAD 2011\Fonts folder (C:\Program Files\Autodesk\
AutoCAD LT 2011\Fonts in AutoCAD LT); as long as you haven’t added 
any custom fonts to that folder, you can refer to it for a list of standard fonts. 
AutoCAD doesn’t embed font files in drawings; instead, it must refer to the 
font files installed locally under either AutoCAD (for SHX fonts) or Windows 
(for TrueType fonts). If you use a custom font of either type, exchanging your 
drawings with other people will be more complicated. If you must use a 
custom font, make a note of it and remember either to send it whenever you 
send the DWG file (assuming that the font isn’t copyrighted, which many 
custom fonts are) or to warn the recipients that the text will appear different 
on their systems. It’s far less hassle to avoid custom fonts altogether. See 
Chapter 20 for additional information about how to deal with fonts when you 
send and receive drawings.
Get in style
The following steps describe how to select an existing text style or create a 
new one before you enter text into a drawing. If you want to experiment with 
an existing drawing that contains a variety of text styles, you can download 
the AutoCAD 2011 sample drawings from www.autodesk.com/autocad-
samples. Look for architectural_-_annotation_scaling_and_multi
leaders.dwg.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 
1. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Annotation panel’s label to open 
the slideout and then click Text Style.
 
 The Text Style dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Text — 
with style.
 
 
2. In the Styles list, select each style in turn to examine the properties of 
the text styles that have been created in this drawing.
 
 Note the font name and look at the Preview panel in the lower-left corner 
of the dialog box to get a feel for what the different fonts look like.
 
3. If you find a suitable text style, select it in the Styles list, click Set 
Current, and then skip to Step 9.
 
 What makes a text style suitable depends on industry practices, office 
standards, and personal preferences about how the text should look. 
The information in preceding sections may help you decide. If not, ask 
an experienced drafter in your office or look at some printed drawings 
and try to match the text on those. If you’re starting from scratch, I 
highly recommend that you use annotative styles — look for the triangu-
lar symbol beside the style name.
 
4. If you don’t find a suitable text style or if you prefer to create your 
own text style, click New.
 
 Pay attention to the style that’s current when you click New. If it’s an 
annotative style, your new style will automatically be annotative; if it’s 
not annotative, it won’t. It’s easy enough to select or deselect the 
Annotative check box, but you may overlook this action at first.
 
 The New Text Style dialog box appears, with a text box for you to type a 
name.

259
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 
5. Type a name for your new text style and then click OK.
 
 Your new text style is added to the Styles list and becomes the current 
style.
 
6. Choose a font from the Font Name list.
 
 Romans.shx is the best all-purpose font for most drafting work. If you 
want to use a different font, review the font suggestions and warnings in 
the previous section.
 
 The font that you choose becomes the font that’s assigned to your new 
text style.
 
7. To create an annotative text style, select the Annotative check box. 
Clear the check box for non-annotative text.
  
Click the i icon next to the Annotative label to open AutoCAD’s online 
help and find out more.
 
8. Adjust the remaining text style settings.
 
 The text style shown in Figure 13-1 has the following setup:
 • 
Paper Text Height (just Height for non-annotative styles) = 0.0
 • 
Width Factor = 1.0
 • 
Oblique Angle = 0
 
• All check boxes other than Annotative are deselected.
 
 A text style height of 0.0 makes the style variable height, which means 
that you can specify the height separately for each text object. Assigning 
a fixed (that is, nonzero) height to a text style forces all text using the 
style to be the same height. Variable height styles are more flexible, 
but fixed height styles usually make it easier to draw text of consistent 
height. The decision to use variable height versus fixed height styles is 
another aspect of text that depends on office practice, so if you work 
with other AutoCAD users, ask around.
 
 Dimensions use text styles to format the appearance of the dimension 
text. When you create a text style that you think you might use for your 
dimensions, you must set a height of 0. Otherwise, the setting that con-
trols the dimension text will not work, and your dimension text is likely 
to be either enormous or microscopic. This one should be a double 
warning because it’s one of the most common mistakes made by new 
AutoCAD drafters!
 
9. Click Apply and then click Close.
 
 The Text Style dialog box closes, and the text style that you selected or 
created is now the current style for new text objects.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Taking your text to new heights
On the off chance that you’re choosing not to use annotative text styles, this 
section shows you why you might want to change your mind.
In Chapter 4, I describe the importance of choosing an appropriate drawing 
scale when you set up a drawing. I warn you that you need to know the draw-
ing scale factor for tasks described in other chapters of this book. This is one 
of those chapters, and I’m about to explain one of those tasks! And when I’m 
done, remember — you can avoid all the arithmetic by using annotative 
text — it’s just a check box away!
 
Drawing scale is the traditional way of describing a scale with an equal sign or 
colon — for example 1/4" = 1'–0", 1:20, or 2:1. The drawing scale factor repre-
sents the same relationship with a single number, such as 48, 20, or 0.5. The 
drawing scale factor is the multiplier that converts the first number in the 
drawing scale into the second number. Make it a point to determine the draw-
ing scale factor of a drawing before you add non-annotative text to it.
Plotted text height
Most industries have plotted text height standards (AutoCAD 2011 refers to 
paper text height, which means the same thing). A plotted text height of 1/8" 
or 3mm is common for notes. Some companies use slightly smaller heights 
(for example, 3/32" or 2.5 mm) to squeeze more text into small spaces.
Calculating non-annotative AutoCAD text height
To calculate non-annotative text height, you need to know the drawing scale 
factor, the desired plotted text height, and the location of the multiplication 
button on your calculator. Use the following steps to figure out text height:
 
1. Determine the drawing scale factor.
 
 If you set up the drawing, you should know its drawing scale, as 
described in Chapter 4. If someone else set up the drawing, and they’re 
still around, ask them!
 
 Other methods of figuring out a drawing’s scale factor include searching 
the drawing for a bar scale or a text note that indicates the drawing 
scale, or if a printout is available, measuring dimensioned distances on 
the hard copy with an architectural or engineering scale. Finally, if the 
drawing dimensions are in model space, you can check the value of the 
DIMSCALE variable (the system variable that controls dimension scale), 
as described in Chapter 14.
 
2. Determine the height that your notes should appear when you plot the 
drawing to scale.

261
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 
 See the preceding “Plotted text height” section for suggestions.
 
3. Multiply the numbers that you figured out in Steps 1 and 2.
 
 After you know the AutoCAD text height, you can use it to define the 
height of a text style or of an individual text object.
If you assign a nonzero height to a text style (Step 8 in the “Get in style” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter), all text that you create with that style will use 
the fixed height. If you leave the text style’s height set to 0, AutoCAD asks 
you for the text height when you draw single-line text objects.
 
This discussion of text height assumes that you’re adding non-annotative text 
in model space. In addition to annotative text in model space, there’s a third 
alternative. You can add annotative or non-annotative text to a paper space 
layout — for example, when you draw text in a title block or add a set of sheet 
notes that doesn’t directly relate to the model space geometry. When you 
create text in paper space, you specify the actual, plotted paper height instead 
of the scaled-up height.
One line or two?
For historical reasons (namely, because the AutoCAD text capabilities used 
to be much more primitive than they are now), AutoCAD offers two different 
kinds of text objects and two corresponding text-drawing commands. Table 
13-1 explains the two commands, with their aliases shown in parentheses.
Table 13-1

(With Alias)
Comments
Paragraph 
text
MTEXT (T)
Designed for multiple lines, with 
word-wrapping. AutoCAD keeps 
the multiple lines together as 
a single object. Other special 
formatting, such as numbered 
or bulleted lists and columns, is 
possible.
Single-
line text
TEXT (DT)
Designed for creating single 
lines. Although you can press 
Enter to create more than one 
line of text, each line becomes a 
separate text object.

262
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Although you may be inclined to ignore the older single-line text option, it’s 
worth knowing how to use both kinds of text. The TEXT command is quite a 
bit simpler than the MTEXT command, and it’s still useful for entering short, 
single-line pieces of text such as object labels and one-line notes. And it’s the 
command of choice for CAD comedians who want to document their one-liners!
 
If you work in an office with people who’ve been AutoCAD users for more than 
a few years, you will probably hear them referring to DTEXT. For the last few 
releases, TEXT has been an alias for the DTEXT (D for Dynamic) command. 
However, lurking up in AutoCAD’s attic is a third text creation command, also 
named TEXT (confused yet?); if you want to experience this creaky old com-
mand, type –TEXT. Unlike the current TEXT (formerly known as DTEXT) com-
mand, with –TEXT you get no onscreen feedback at all. 
Your text will be justified
Both the TEXT and MTEXT commands offer a bewildering array of text jus-
tification options — in other words, which way the text flows from the point 
or points that you pick in the drawing to locate it. For most purposes, the 
default Left justification for single-line text or Top Left justification for para-
graph text works fine. Occasionally, you may want to use a different justifica-
tion, such as Center for labels or titles. Both commands provide options for 
changing text justification. I point out these options when I demonstrate the 
commands later in this chapter.
Using the Same Old Line
Despite its limitations, the TEXT command is useful for labels and other short 
notes for which MTEXT would be overkill. The following procedure shows 
you how to add text to your drawing by using AutoCAD’s TEXT command.
 You 
can use TEXT for multiple lines of text: Just keep pressing Enter after you 
type each line of text, and TEXT puts the new line below the previous one. The 
problem with this approach is that TEXT creates each line of text as a sepa-
rate object. If you later want to add or remove words in the multiple lines, 
AutoCAD can’t do any word-wrapping for you; you have to edit each line sepa-
rately, cutting words from one line and adding them to the adjacent line.
 
The TEXT command doesn’t use a dialog box, a fancy formatting toolbar, or a 
contextual Ribbon tab like the MTEXT command’s In-Place Text Editor. You 
set options by typing them into the command line or the Dynamic Input 
tooltip.

263
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
Here’s how you add text with the TEXT command:
 
1. Set an appropriate text style current, as described in the section 
“Simply stylish text,” earlier in this chapter.
 
 It’s possible to set an already-created text style current at the TEXT 
command prompt, but it’s usually more straightforward to set the style 
before starting the command.
 
 An alternative to opening the Text Style dialog box to make an existing 
style current is to click the Text Style drop-down list and choose the 
style there. Look for the Text Style drop-down list on the Annotation 
panel’s slideout (Home tab) or the Text panel of the Annotate tab.
 
2. (Optional) Use the Object Snap button on the status bar to enable or 
disable running object snaps.
 
 You may or may not want to snap text to existing objects. For example, 
you’d want to use a Center object snap to locate a letter or number pre-
cisely at the center of a circle.
 
 
3. On the Home tab’s Annotation panel, click the lower part of the big 
button labeled Multiline Text, then choose Single Line from the flyout 
to start the TEXT command.
 
 Don’t click the upper part of the Multiline Text button — that starts the 
multiline text command, MTEXT, which I cover in the next section.
 
 If this is the first annotative object you’re creating in this drawing ses-
sion, AutoCAD displays a Select Annotation Scale dialog box advising 
you that you are indeed creating an annotative object and asking you 
to set the scale at which you want the annotation to appear; click OK to 
continue.
 
 AutoCAD tells you the current text style and height settings and 
prompts you to select a starting point for the text or to choose an option 
for changing the text justification or current text style first:
Current text style: “Standard” Text height: 0.2000 
Annotative: Yes
Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]:
 
 If the text style is annotative, the text height displayed in the prompt is 
the model space height, not the ultimate plotted text height. For exam-
ple, if the text style is created with a fixed paper text height of 0.2000, 
and the annotation scale is set to 1:2, the AutoCAD prompt will read 
Text height: 0.4000.
 
4. If you want a different justification from the default (Left), type J, 
press Enter, and choose one of the other justification options.
  
Look up alignment, single-line text in the online help system index if you 
need help with the justification options.

264
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
5. Specify the insertion point for the first text character.
 
 You can enter the point’s coordinates from the keyboard, use the mouse 
to click a point on-screen, or press Enter to locate new text immediately 
below the most recent single-line text object that you created.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you for the text height (or the paper height if the text 
style is annotative):
Specify height <0.2000>:
 
6. Specify the height for the text.
 
 This prompt doesn’t appear if you’re using a text style with a fixed (that 
is, nonzero) height. See the “Simply stylish text” section, earlier in this 
chapter, for information about fixed versus variable text heights.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you for the text rotation angle:
Specify rotation angle of text <0>:
 
7. Specify the text rotation angle by typing the rotation angle and press-
ing Enter or by rotating the line on-screen with the mouse.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to type the text.
 
8. Type the first line of text and press Enter.
 
9. Type additional lines of text, pressing Enter at the end of each line.
 
 Figure 13-2 shows text appearing on-screen as you type it (or it would if 
this book had animated pages).
 
10. To stop entering text and return to the command prompt, press Enter 
at the start of a blank line.
 
 AutoCAD adds the new single-line text object — or objects, if you typed 
more than one line — to the drawing.

265
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 
To align lines of text exactly, make sure that you type all the lines in one 
instance of the TEXT command, pressing Enter after each line to make the 
next line appear just after it. Otherwise, aligning different lines of text pre-
cisely is harder to do (unless you set your snap just right or use a complicated 
combination of object snaps and point filters). To edit single-line text after 
you’ve created it, select the text, right-click, and choose Edit (or double-click 
the text) to open the In-Place Text Editor. (In-place simply means that you edit 
text at its exact size and location in the drawing.) I tell you more about in-
place text editing in the section “Making it with Mtext,” later in this chapter.
An in-place editing box highlights the selected text object, enabling you to 
edit the contents of the text string. If you want to edit other text properties, 
such as text height, select the text, right-click, and choose Properties to dis-
play the Properties palette. Use the Properties palette to change parameters 
as needed.
 
If the Quick Properties button on your application status bar is enabled, click-
ing a single-line text object opens the Quick Properties panel, allowing you to 
change some (but not all) of the same properties as the Properties palette.
Turning On Your Annotative Objects
As I describe in the “Annotatively yours” sidebar, earlier in the chapter, you 
have a couple of extra steps in the workflow in order to take advantage of single-
line or multiline text you create using annotative styles. You have to assign the 
scales you’re likely to use in your drawing to the text objects and then set the 
annotation scale accordingly. The following steps explain how to assign annota-
tion scales to text that has been created using an annotative text style:
 
1. Make sure the text is annotative by hovering the crosshairs over it.
 
 Text created with an annotative style but that has not had any annota-
tion scales applied to it displays a single triangular symbol beside the 
crosshairs. (The symbol represents the end view of a triangular engi-
neering scale.) If there’s no symbol, the text isn’t annotative.
 
 If Quick Properties is enabled at the status bar, you can make individual 
text objects annotative even if they’ve been created using a non-annota-
tive style by selecting the text and changing the Annotative property 
from No to Yes in the Quick Properties palette; you can do the same in 
the Properties palette by selecting the text and pressing Ctrl+1. There 
may be times when you would want to do this, but they’re probably few 
and far between. Until you become very familiar with annotative objects 
and decide how you want to use them in both new and old drawings, I 
recommend that you stick to creating your annotative text by using 
annotative text styles rather than assigning the annotative property on 
individual text objects created with non-annotative styles.

266
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
2. Click a text object to select it, then right-click and choose Annotative 
Object Scale➪Add/Delete Scales.
 
 The Annotation Object Scale dialog box appears and shows a list of all 
annotative scales assigned to the selected object. In the case of a new 
text or other annotative object, the only scale listed will be whatever 
annotation scale is set current on the status bar.
 
3. In the Annotation Object Scale dialog box, click Add.
 
 The Add Scales to Object dialog box appears, displaying a list of all 
drawing scale values stored in the drawing.
 
4. Select the desired scales from the list, holding down the Ctrl key to 
select more than one, and then click OK.
 
 The Annotation Object Scale dialog box reappears, with the scales you 
added displayed in the list box.
 
 AutoCAD will happily let you select all the scales in the box, but your 
drawings will be easier to manage if you select only the scales you’re 
likely to use — you can always go back and add another scale later.
 
 Most of the time, for most people, there are way too many scales listed 
in the Add Scales to Object dialog box. AutoCAD has a handy dandy Edit 
Scale List dialog box that lets you remove those imperial scales if you 
never work in feet and inches. And vice versa, for the metrically chal-
lenged. To run through your scales, choose Scale List on the Annotation 
Scaling panel of the Ribbon’s Annotate tab. If you make a mistake, the 
Reset button will restore all the default scales.
 5. 
Click OK.
 
 After you assign annotative scales to text (or any annotative object), 
you’ll see a pair of triangular annotative object symbols. Don’t worry — 
although you are seeing double, you’ve done it right!
 
6. Open the Annotation Scale list on the application or drawing status 
bar and select one of the scales you added to the object.
 
 The annotative objects (text in this case) will change their size as you 
change the annotation scale. If you select a scale from the list that you 
did not assign to the object in Step 3, the annotative objects disappear 
unless you turn on the Annotation Visibility toggle on the status bar. 
There are a lot of options, a mess of settings, and a slew of system vari-
ables in this complex feature. To find out more about annotative objects, 
look up scale, annotations in the online help index.
 
You can display the drawing status bar (shown in Figures 13-2 and 13-3) by 
clicking the down arrow near the right end of the application status bar to 
open the application status bar menu, and then choosing Drawing Status Bar.

267
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
Figure 13-3 shows two versions of the same drawing, with the same text 
objects (the bulleted notes and windows sizes) and wall hatching displaying 
at the different annotation scales specified in the two status bars. The non-
annotative text (the room label) remains unchanged. (I cover hatching your 
drawings in Chapter 15.)

Saying More in Multiline Text
When you just can’t shoehorn your creative genius into one or more one-line 
pieces of text, AutoCAD’s multiline text object gives you room to go on and 
on and on. The following procedure shows you how to create multiline text 
with the MTEXT command.
Making it with Mtext
 
The first part of the MTEXT command prompts you for various points and 
options. The order is a bit confusing, so read these steps and the prompts 
carefully.

268
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Here’s how you use the MTEXT command:
 
1. Set an appropriate text style current and (optionally) turn off running 
object snaps, as described in Steps 1 and 2 in the “Using the Same Old 
Line” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
 If you’re doing real drafting, you should also set an appropriate layer 
current.
 
 
2. On the Home tab’s Annotation panel, click the upper part of the split 
button labeled Multiline Text to start the MTEXT command.
 
 The command line displays the current text style and height settings 
and prompts you to select the first corner of an imaginary rectangle that 
will determine the word-wrapping width for the text object:
Current text style: “Standard” Text height: 0.2000 
Annotative: No
Specify first corner:
 
3. Pick a point in the drawing.
 
 The command line prompts you for the opposite corner of a rectangle 
that will determine the word-wrapping width; it also gives you the 
option of changing settings first:
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line 
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width/Columns]:
 4. 
Type H and press Enter to change the default text height.
 
 The command line prompts you for a new default text height:
Specify height <0.2000>:
 
5. Type an appropriate text height.
 
 See the “Taking your text to new heights” section, earlier in this chapter, 
for information. If you’re adding text in model space, I highly recom-
mend that you use annotative text.
 
 The prompt for the opposite corner of the Mtext rectangle reappears. 
The command line shows
Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line 
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width/Columns]:
 
6. If you want a different justification from the default (top left), type J, 
press Enter, and choose one of the other justification options.
  
Look up alignment, multiline text in the index of the online help system if 
you want an explanation of the other justification options.
 
7. Pick another point in the drawing.
 
 Don’t worry about the height of the rectangle that you create by choos-
ing the second point; the width of the rectangle is all that matters. 

269
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
AutoCAD adjusts the height of the text rectangle to accommodate the 
number of lines of word-wrapped text. Don’t worry too much about the 
width, either; you can adjust it later.
 
 The In-Place Text Editor frameless window appears with the tab and 
indent ruler above it, and a previously hidden Text Editor contextual tab 
appears on the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 13-4. (If you don’t see the tab 
and indent ruler at the top of your Text Editor window, right-click inside 
the window and choose Editor Settings, then Show Ruler from the right-
click menu.)
  
New isn’t always better; you may prefer the classic Text Formatting tool-
bar over the Ribbon’s Text Editor contextual tab. If you want to give the 
classic version a test drive, change the value of the system variable 
MTEXTTOOLBAR. The default value (2) displays the Text Editor tab 
only; setting it to 1 displays both the tab and the toolbar. I don’t recom-
mend setting this variable to 0 — that turns off the Text Formatting tool-
bar in all workspaces. For more about system variables, see Chapter 26.

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 When you create multiline text in both AutoCAD 2010 and AutoCAD 
2011, your text objects default to Dynamic Column mode. You can tell 
that’s what you’re going to get if the In-Place Text Editor displays a dou-
ble-headed arrow symbol in the center of the bottom border of the rect-
angle you define. This is a useful default if you really are writing a novel, 
but for most drawing notations, I recommend you turn off columns. To 
do so, click Columns on the Text Editor panel (or the Text Editing tool-
bar if that’s your preference) and choose No Columns. Setting the 
system variable MTEXTCOLUMN to 0 will force the MTEXT command to 
create non-columnized text.
 
8. Verify the text font and height.
 
 The text font and height should be right if you correctly performed 
Steps 1, 4, and 5. If not, you can change these settings in the Font drop-
down list and the Text Height text box on the Text Editor tab (or the 
classic Text Formatting toolbar).
 
9. Type text into the text area of the In-Place Text Editor.
 
 AutoCAD word-wraps multiline text automatically. If you want to force a 
line break at a particular location, press Enter.
 
10. If you want other formatting options, select text, right-click, and make 
an appropriate choice from the menu (as shown in Figure 13-5).
 
 By convention in most industries, text in drawings is always uppercase. 
How many times have you forgotten to press the Caps Lock key before 
entering drawing text? How many times have you forgotten to turn Caps 
Lock off again when it’s time to type your e-mail? To save yourself some 
agony, right-click in the In-Place Text Editor and choose AutoCAPS from 
the menu.
 
11. Click Close Text Editor (or OK in the classic Text Formatting toolbar).
 
 The In-Place Text Editor window closes, and AutoCAD adds your text to 
the drawing.
 
 You can close the text editor much more easily by simply clicking out-
side its window. But if you like clicking buttons instead, AutoCAD has 
amply provided for you.
 
12. Add annotation scales to the new multiline text object.
 
 The steps are the same for multiline text as for single-line text. Refer to 
the “Turning On Your Annotative Objects” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, if you need a refresher.
As you can tell by looking at the Text Editor tab (or the Text Formatting 
toolbar) and multiline text right-click menu, the MTEXT command gives 
you plenty of other options. You can show or hide the toolbar, the ruler, or 

271
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
the Options buttons, and you can give the In-Place Text Editor an opaque 
background. Other tool buttons give you access to columns and numbered 
or bulleted lists (both are covered in the section “Doing a number on your 
Mtext lists,” later in this chapter) and right-clicking presents a shortcut to the 
online help entry on the Text Editor Ribbon tab.
 
Figure 13-5:

Between them, the Text Editor tab (or the Text Formatting toolbar) and the 
right-click menu also include a Stack/Unstack feature for fractions, a Find and 
Replace utility, tools for changing between lowercase and uppercase, options 
for applying background masks and inserting fields, a special Symbol sub-
menu, and an Import Text option for importing text from a TXT (ASCII text) 
file or RTF (Rich Text Format) file. I discuss background masks and fields in 
the next section. If you think you may have a use for any of these other fea-
tures, choose Command Reference➪Commands➪M Commands➪MTEXT in 
AutoCAD’s online help browser to find out more about them.
It slices, it dices . . .
Two more useful options on the multiline text right-click menu are 
Background Mask and Insert Field.

272
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Mtext dons a mask
When you turn on background masking, AutoCAD hides the portions of any 
objects that lie underneath the multiline text. Use these steps to turn on and 
control this feature:
 
1. Right-click in the In-Place Text Editor and choose Background Mask 
from the menu.
 
 The Background Mask dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Use Background Mask check box so that this option is 
turned on.
 
3. Either click Use Drawing Background Color (to make the mask the 
same color as the drawing area’s background color) or choose a color 
from the drop-down list (to make the text appear in a solid rectangle 
of the specified color).
 
4. Click OK to return to the In-Place Text Editor.
 
If you’ve turned on background masking but it isn’t having the desired effect, 
use the TEXTTOFRONT command to move the text on top of other objects. 
Click the Bring to Front flyout button on Home tab’s Modify panel and choose 
Bring Text to Front.
Mtext plays the field
The Insert Field option on the In-Line Text Editor’s right-click menu creates 
a text field that updates automatically every time you open, save, plot, or 
regenerate the drawing. Fields can contain data such as the date, filename, or 
author. Fields draw information from the operating system settings, Drawing 
Properties dialog box, sheet sets feature (not covered in this book, and not 
included in AutoCAD LT), and AutoCAD system variables. (For more informa-
tion about system variables, see Chapter 26.) Use the following procedure to 
add a field while you’re creating multiline text:
 
1. Right-click in the In-Place Text Editor and choose Insert Field from the 
menu.
 
 The Field dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose a Field Name in the left column.
 
3. Choose a Format in the right column, or for date fields, type a format 
in the Date Format box.
 4. 
Click OK.
 
 AutoCAD adds the field to the Mtext object that you’re creating or editing.

273
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
Doing a number on your Mtext lists
Mtext supports bulleted and numbered lists. This feature is especially useful 
for creating general drawing notes, as shown in Figure 13-6. AutoCAD auto-
mates the process of creating numbered lists almost completely. Here’s how:
 
1. Follow Steps 1 through 8 in the earlier section, “Making it with Mtext,” 
to open the In-Place Text Editor.
 
2. Type a title — for example, DESIGN CRITERIA.
 
 If you want your title underlined, click Underline on the Formatting 
panel (or the Text Formatting toolbar) before you type the title; click 
Underline again to turn it off. Press Enter to go to the next line and press 
Enter again to leave a little more space.
 
3. On the Paragraph panel of the Text Editor tab, click the Bullets 
and Numbering flyout button; verify that Allow Auto-List, Use Tab 
Delimiter Only, and Allow Bullets and Lists are selected; and then 
click Numbered, as shown in Figure 13-6.
  
The number 1 followed by a period appears on the current line, and the 
cursor jumps to the tab stop visible in the ruler at the top of the In-Place 
Text Editor window.
  
Enabling Numbered places numerals followed by periods in front of 
items in a list. (Bulleted places bullet characters in front of items in a 
list.) Auto-List enables automatic numbering — each time you press 
Enter to move to a new line, AutoCAD increments the number.

4. Type the text corresponding to the current number or bullet.
 
 As AutoCAD wraps the text, the second and subsequent lines align with 
the tab stop, and the text is automatically indented.
 
5. Press Enter at the end of the paragraph to move to the next line.
 
 Just like creating numbered lists in your favorite word processor, 
AutoCAD automatically inserts the next number at the beginning of the 
new paragraph, with everything perfectly aligned.
 
 To create nested numbered or bulleted items as shown in Figure 13-6, 
simply press Tab at the start of the line. If you change your mind, you 
can bump a nested text item up a level by selecting the item in the 
In-Place Text Editor and pressing Shift+Tab.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each subsequent numbered or bulleted item.
 
 For legibility, you sometimes want to add spaces between the notes. If 
you press Enter twice to give yourself a blank line, AutoCAD — like 
every good word processor — thinks you’re finished with your list and 
turns numbering off. AutoCAD is smart, so you need to be smarter. If you 
put the cursor at the end of the first note and press Enter, you get a 
blank line. The problem is, the blank line is now numbered, and your 
intended Note 2 is now Note 3. Just press the Backspace key. The 
number on the blank line disappears, and Note 2 is back to being Note 2 
again. When you delete a numbered item, the remaining numbers auto-
matically adjust.
 
 If you don’t like the horizontal spacing of the numbers or the alignment 
of subsequent lines, you can adjust them easily by manipulating the tab 
and indent markers in the In-Place Text Editor’s ruler.
 
7. In the ruler, drag the upper slider (the triangle pointing down) to the 
right a short distance. Drag the lower slider (the triangle pointing up) 
to the right a slightly greater distance.
 
 The upper slider controls the indentation of the first line in each para-
graph. The lower slider controls the indentation of the second and sub-
sequent lines. An indent of one to two of the short, vertical tick marks 
usually works well for the first line. An indent of two to four tick marks 
works well for the second and subsequent lines.
 
8. Click in the ruler just above the lower slider.
 
 A small triangle (pointing right) appears above the lower slider. This tri-
angle shows the tab stop.
 
 Make sure that the corner of the tab stop (right-pointing) triangle aligns 
horizontally with the point of the lower slider triangle. If not, click and 
drag the tab stop until it aligns.
 
If you prefer to type tab and indent distances, not adjust them with the cursor, 
open the Paragraph dialog box by either

275
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 ✓ 
Clicking the little arrow at the right end of the Paragraph panel label (in 
AutoCADese, it’s called a Panel Dialog Box Launcher).
 ✓ 
Right-clicking inside the In-Place Text Editor and choosing Paragraph.
Whichever way you do it, if you select text first, the tab and indent changes 
apply to the selected text. If you don’t select text first, the changes apply to 
new text from that point in the multiline text object forward.
Line up in columns — Now!
AutoCAD is getting more word processor–like with every release! A few ver-
sions back, it was simple indents, then came numbered and bulleted lists. 
The latest addition is columns in multiline text.
Columns come in two flavors: static and dynamic.
 ✓ 
Static: You specify the number of columns into which you want to flow 
your text. Columns are always the same height, and text is allowed to 
overflow the final column if there’s too much of it.
 ✓ 
Dynamic: As you might expect, these columns are friendlier, more flex-
ible, and the life of any party. You can individually adjust column heights, 
and new columns are added automatically to accommodate the text.
Selecting either column type also offers you a Column Settings dialog box 
where you can specify values numerically instead of by dragging grips.
Figure 13-7 shows a block of multiline text imported as an RTF file from a 
word processor and then formatted in dynamic columns with the Manual 
Height option.
Setting up columns is pretty straightforward — the following steps 
explain how:
 
1. Open a drawing that contains a large multiline text object or create a 
large multiline text object in a new drawing.
 
 If you already have drawing specifications or general notes in a word 
processor document, or even a text file, you can right-click inside the 
MTEXT command’s In-Place Text Editor and choose Import Text. The 
Select File dialog box opens, giving you the choice of Rich Text Format 
(RTF) or ASCII text (TXT) files.
 
2. If the In-Place Text Editor is not already open, double-click the text, or 
select it, then right-click and choose Mtext Edit.
 
3. Click Columns in the Insert panel and choose either Dynamic Columns 
or Static Columns.

276
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
Figure 13-7: 
Dynamically 
columnizing 
your text.
 
 
 If you choose Dynamic Columns, select either Auto Height or Manual 
Height. Selecting Manual Height puts grips on each column so you can 
adjust their height individually (refer to Figure 13-7). Auto Height dis-
plays a single grip, so the heights of all columns remain the same, but 
new columns are still added as required by the amount of text.
 
 If you choose Static Columns, select the number of columns you want 
from the menu. Clicking 2, for example, creates two columns regardless 
of the length of your text — you may end up with overflowing text or 
empty columns.
 
4. Click Close Text Editor (or OK in the Text Formatting toolbar) when 
you’re satisfied with the column arrangement.
 
 You can revert to a non-columnar arrangement by clicking the Columns 
button in the Insert panel and choosing No Columns.
Modifying Mtext
After you create a multiline text object, you can edit it in the same ways as a 
single-line text object: Select the object, right-click, and choose Mtext Edit or 
Properties.

277
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 ✓ 
Mtext Edit: Selecting this option opens the In-Place Text Editor window 
so that you can change the text contents and formatting.
 ✓ 
Properties: Selecting this option opens the Properties palette, where 
you can change overall properties for the text object.
 ✓ 
Quick Properties: Enable this setting on the status bar to make simply 
selecting a multiline text object open the Quick Properties palette, in 
which you can modify a subset of the Mtext object’s properties.
The easiest way to change the word-wrapping width of a paragraph text 
object is to grip edit it. Select the text object, click one of the corner grips, 
release the mouse button, move the crosshairs, and click again. Chapter 10 
describes grip editing in detail.
 
 Just like any good word processor or text editor, AutoCAD includes both a 
spell checker and a find-and-replace tool for text or dimensions. To check the 
spelling of selected objects or the entire drawing, click the Annotate tab on the 
Ribbon and choose Check Spelling from the Text panel to display the Check 
Spelling dialog box. On the same panel, clicking Find Text, or typing FIND and 
pressing Enter displays the Find and Replace dialog box. Handily, Find and 
Replace and Spell Check are both also accessible from the Text Editor tab’s 
Spell Check and Tools panels — in case you just want to replace text or check 
spelling within a single multiline text object. Look up SPELL or FIND in the 
online help index if you need more information on either command.
Gather Round the Tables
You don’t know the meaning of the word tedious unless you’ve tried to create 
a column-and-row data table in older versions of AutoCAD using the LINE and 
DTEXT commands. AutoCAD’s table object and the TABLESTYLE and TABLE 
commands for creating it make the job almost fun.
 
Table objects in AutoCAD 2011 are not annotative, so you have just two meth-
ods of adding them to drawings. You can create them in model space, scaling 
them up by the drawing scale factor (see Chapter 4 for a refresher), or — and 
this seems more sensible to me — you can create them in a layout, in paper 
space, defining them by their actual plotted (paper) dimensions.
Tables have style, too
You control the appearance of tables — both the text and the gridlines — 
with table styles (just as you control the appearance of standalone text with 
text styles). Use the TABLESTYLE command to create and modify table 
styles. Follow these steps to create a table:

278
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 
1. On the Home tab, click the Annotation panel’s label to open its slide-
out and then choose Table Style.
 
 The Table Style dialog box appears.
 
2. In the Styles list, select the existing table style whose settings you 
want to use as the starting point for the settings of your new style.
 
 For example, select the default table style named Standard.
 
3. Click the New button to create a new table style that’s a copy of the 
existing style.
 
 The Create New Table Style dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter a New Style Name and click Continue.
 
 The New Table Style dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-8.
 
Figure 13-8: 
Setting the 
table.
 
 
5. In the Cell Styles area, with Data showing in the list box, specify set-
tings for the data alignment, margins, text, and borders.
 
 The settings you’re likely to want to change are Text Style, Text Height, 
and perhaps either Text Color (all three are on the Text tab) or Grid Color 
(on the Borders tab). If you leave colors set to ByBlock, the text and grid 
lines will inherit the color that’s current when you create the table. That 
color will be the current layer’s color, if you follow my advice in Chapter 6.
 
6. In the Cell Styles area, open the drop-down list and repeat Step 5 for 
the Headers (that is, the column headings) and the Title.
 
7. Click OK to close the New Table Style dialog box.
 
 The Table Style dialog box reappears.

279
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 8. 
Click Close.
 
 Your new table style becomes the current table style that AutoCAD uses 
for future tables in this drawing, and the Table Style dialog box closes. 
Now you’re ready to create a table, as described in the next section.
 
You can access the Manage Cell Styles dialog box directly from the Cell Styles 
drop-down list of the New Table Style dialog box. The Table Cell Format dialog 
box provides a number of additional options for formatting cells by data type.
AutoCAD stores table styles in the DWG file, so a style that you create in one 
drawing isn’t immediately available in others. You can copy a table style from 
one drawing to another with DesignCenter. (Use the procedure for copying 
layers between drawings outlined in Chapter 6, but substitute Tablestyles for 
Layers.)
Creating and editing tables
After you create a suitable table style, adding a table to your drawing is easy 
with the TABLE command. Here’s how:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current.
 
 Assuming that you leave the current color, linetype, and lineweight set 
to ByLayer, as I recommend in Chapter 6, the current layer’s properties 
will control the properties of any parts of the table that you left set to 
ByBlock when you defined the table style. (See Step 5 in the preceding 
section, “Tables have style, too.”)
 
 
2. On the Home tab’s Annotation panel, choose Table.
 
 The Insert Table dialog box appears.
 
3. Choose a table style from the Table Style Name drop-down list.
 
4. Choose an Insertion Behavior:
 • 
Specify Insertion Point: The easiest method. You pick the location of 
the table’s upper-left corner (or lower-left corner if you set Table 
Direction to Up in the table style). When you use this method, you 
specify the default column width and number of rows in the Insert 
Table dialog box.
 • 
Specify Window: You pick the upper-left corner and then the lower-
right corner. When you use this method, AutoCAD automatically 
scales the column widths and determines how many rows to include.
 
5. Specify Column & Row Settings.
 
 If you chose Specify Window in Step 4, AutoCAD sets the Column Width and 
number of Data Rows to Auto, which means that AutoCAD will figure them 
out based on the overall size of the table that you specify in Steps 7 and 8.

280
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 6. 
Click OK.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the insertion point of the table.
 
7. Click a point or type coordinates.
 
 If you chose Specify Insertion Point in Step 4, AutoCAD draws the table 
grid lines, places the cursor in the title cell, and displays the Text Editor 
tab on the Ribbon.
 
8. If you chose Specify Window in Step 4, specify the diagonally opposite 
corner of the table.
 
 AutoCAD draws the table. Based on the table size that you indicated, 
AutoCAD chooses the column width and number of rows.
 
9. Type a title for the table.
 
10. Type values in each cell, using the arrow keys or Tab key to move 
among cells.
 
 The cell right-click menu offers many other options, including copying 
contents from one cell to another, merging cells, inserting rows and 
columns, changing formatting, and inserting a block (that is, a graphical 
symbol — see Chapter 17 for information about blocks).
 
 The fields feature described earlier in this chapter works for table text, 
too — you can insert a field into a table cell. For example, you might use 
this feature to create part of a title block, with fields serving as the 
“date” and “drawn by” data.
 
11. Click Close Text Editor on the Ribbon (or click OK on the Text 
Formatting toolbar).
 
 Figure 13-9 shows a completed table, along with the Insert Table dialog box.
You can edit cell values later simply by double-clicking in a cell. To change 
column width or row height, click the table grid and then click and move the 
blue grips. (To change the width of one column without altering the overall 
width of the table, hold down the Ctrl key while you move the grip.) If you want 
to change other aspects of a table or individual cells in it, select the table or cell 
and use the Quick Properties palette or the Properties palette to make changes.
 
You can import tables from Microsoft Excel instead of using the Insert Table 
dialog box. To import Excel data, in Excel, select the desired cells and choose 
Edit➪Copy. Then in AutoCAD, choose Paste Special from the Home tab’s 
Clipboard panel and then choose AutoCAD Entities in the Paste Special dialog 
box. AutoCAD attempts to copy the Excel spreadsheet’s formatting along with 
the cell data, but you’ll probably have to adjust column widths and perform 
other cleanup on the imported table.
You can go the other direction — from AutoCAD to Excel or another 
program — via a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file. Look up TABLEEXPORT 
command in AutoCAD’s online help index.

blocks and attributes. You can also perform simple calculations in tables by 
using predefined functions or your own arithmetical expressions. Look up Use 
Formulas in Table Cells in AutoCAD’s online help Search page.
Bring Out Your Inner Leader
Don’t worry; I’m not going to make you walk across a bed of red hot coals or 
give you a sales pitch about office politics or personal growth opportunities! 
No, I’m talking about those notes with arrows that point to drawing objects 
that you need to embellish with some verbiage.
Multileaders — mleaders for short — are a vast improvement over old-style 
leaders available prior to AutoCAD 2008. In fact, they’re so good, they should 
be running the United Nations! Mleaders, unlike the old-style leaders, are 
single objects. They are also able to point in multiple directions at once (just 
don’t ask them which way is the bus station). Finally, multileaders — just 
like text, dimensions, hatching, and other objects you use to document your 
drawing — can be annotative.

282
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Multileaders seem to grow in flexibility with each release. In AutoCAD 2011, 
you can use grips to manipulate a multileader’s individual components, just as 
if it were several objects instead of a single object. Hold down the Ctrl key and 
click a multileader to select different pieces. You can even use grips to adjust 
the width of multileader text as if it were a plain everyday Mtext object.
 
There are two older-style leaders stored in AutoCAD’s attic (Autodesk hates to 
throw anything away). These semi-retired leaders are no longer accessible on 
menus or toolbars, but they’re still lurking up there waiting to . . . er, lead you 
astray. If you’ve become attached to typing commands, you may be inclined to 
type either LEADER or LE to create those pointy-headed thingies. If you do, be 
aware that LEADER runs the positively ancient command for creating notes-
with-arrows. There are no options, so only straight leader lines and infinitely 
long text strings are what you get. LE (the alias for the QLEADER command) 
runs the merely elderly command for creating notes-with-arrows; this one has 
a Settings dialog box where you can set some options, and it does ask you to 
specify a width for your Mtext note. However, unlike multileaders, both 
LEADER and LE create the leader lines and the text as two separate objects.
Electing a leader
You can draw multileader objects that consist of leader lines and multiline 
text at the same time by using the MLEADER command, as described in the 
following steps:
 
1. Set a multileader style — one that’s appropriate for your needs — 
current.
 
 
 Choose an existing multileader style from the Selects a Multileader Style 
drop-down list on the Home tab’s Annotation panel slideout, or create 
a new style by choosing Multileader Style from the Annotation slideout. 
Visit the online help for tips on creating new multileader styles.
 
 
2. Choose Multileader from the Annotation panel.
 
 The command line prompts you to select the location for the pointy end 
of the leader arrowhead:
Specify leader arrowhead location or [leader Landing
first/Content first/Options] <Options>:
 
 The initial default method is to locate the arrowhead followed by the 
leader landing (that is, the short horizontal line between the leader line 
and the text), at which point AutoCAD displays the In-Place Text Editor, 
and you enter the text of your note. If you’d rather place the leader land-
ing first, type L and press Enter. If you’d rather type the content first, 
type C and press Enter.

283
 Chapter 13: Text with Character
 
 If you want to draw spline-curved rather than straight leader lines, specify 
the number of pick points for the leader lines and press Enter to display 
multileader options at the command line or the dynamic input tooltip. 
Refer to the online help for more information on the command options.
 
3. Pick a location in the drawing that you want the leader to point to.
 
 If you use an Object Snap mode, such as Nearest or Midpoint, to pick a 
point on an object, AutoCAD associates the leader with the object. If you 
later move the object, AutoCAD updates the leader so that it points to 
the new location.
 
 The command line prompts you for the next point.
 
4. Pick a second point.
 
 AutoCAD draws a shaft from the arrowhead to this point.
 
 If you pick a second point that’s too close to the arrowhead point and 
AutoCAD doesn’t have enough room to draw the arrowhead, it omits the 
arrowhead.
 
 By default, AutoCAD lets you pick two points for the leader line: The first 
point locates the arrowhead, and the second point locates the start of the 
short horizontal leader landing. If you need more points than that, restart 
the command and choose Options, Maxpoints and set a new value.
 
 After you pick the point for the leader landing, AutoCAD opens the 
In-Place Text Editor.
 
5. Enter your comment.
 
 You’re now in the same In-Place Text Editor I describe earlier in this 
chapter, with the same Text Editor tab and options.
 6. 
Click Close.
 
 The In-Place Text Editor window closes and adds your comment to the 
drawing, next to the leader.
Figure 13-10 shows several different leaders with notes.
Multi options for multileaders
In addition to the MLEADER command itself, which I walk you through in the 
preceding steps, multileaders come with a slew of formatting, drawing, and 
editing commands:
 ✓ 
MLEADEREDIT: Use this command to add or remove leader lines 
from multileader objects. You’ll find each of those functions on the 
Multileader drop-down list (refer to Figure 13-10).

284
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 ✓ 
MLEADERSTYLE: Multileaders, like text, tables, and dimensions, are 
formatted according to named styles. To display the Multileader Style 
Manager dialog box (which looks a lot like a simplified version of the 
Dimension Style Manager) click Multileader Style on the Home tab’s 
Annotation slideout.
 ✓ 
MLEADERALIGN: A tedious chore in earlier AutoCAD versions was get-
ting all the leaders to line up; it usually involved drawing a construction 
line and then using object snaps to move common points on the lead-
ers to the construction line. To line up mleaders, choose Align from the 
Multileader drop-down list.
 ✓ 
MLEADERCOLLECT: Multileaders can contain blocks as well as text (I 
cover blocks in Chapter 17). Choose Collect from the Multileader drop-
down list to gather a group of leaders containing blocks; they’ll rear-
range themselves as a single multileader containing the multiple blocks.
For more information on any of these commands, look them up by name in 
the Command Reference section of the online help.
 
Multileaders and multileader styles can be annotative or non-annotative. 
Making them annotative and assigning appropriate annotation scales is a huge 
timesaver for detail views that you might want to plot at different scales.

I
n drafting — either CAD or manual drafting — dimensions are special 
text labels with attached lines that together clearly indicate the size of 
something. Although it’s theoretically possible to draw all the pieces of 
each dimension by using AutoCAD commands, such as LINE and MTEXT, 
dimensioning is so common a drafting task that AutoCAD provides special 
commands for doing the job more efficiently. These dimensioning commands 
group the parts of each dimension into a convenient, easy-to-edit package. 
Even better, as you edit an object — by stretching it, for example — AutoCAD 
automatically updates the measurement displayed in the dimension text label 
to indicate the object’s new size, as shown in Figure 14-1. And perhaps best 
of all, AutoCAD 2011’s annotative dimensions automatically change their size 
as you change the annotation scale on the model tab or the viewport scale in 
a layout. I explain the general principles of annotative objects in Chapter 13; 
in this chapter, I take a closer look at annotative dimensions.
AutoCAD controls the look of dimensions by means of dimension styles, just 
as it controls the look of text with text styles, and tables with table styles. 
(AutoCAD also uses text styles to control the appearance of the text in 
dimensions.) But dimension styles are much more complicated than text 
styles because dimensions have so many more pieces that you need to 
control. After you find or create an appropriate dimension style, you use one 
of several dimensioning commands to draw dimensions that point to the 
important points on an object (the two endpoints of a line, for example).

AutoCAD dimensioning is a big, complicated subject. (It’s so complicated, in 
fact, that Autodesk has an especially wise person in charge of dimensioning 
in AutoCAD — this person is called the dimwit.) Every industry has its own 
dimensioning conventions, habits, and quirks. As usual, AutoCAD tries to 
support them all and, in so doing, makes things a bit convoluted for everyone. 
This chapter covers the essential concepts and commands that you need to 
know to start drawing dimensions. Be prepared to spend some additional time 
studying how to create any specialized types of dimensions that your industry 
uses. Who knows — if you work very hard and practice every day, you too 
could become an AutoCAD dimwit!
 
You add dimensions to a drawing after you’ve drawn at least some of the 
geometry; otherwise, you won’t have much to dimension! Your dimensioning 
and overall drafting efficiency improve if you add dimensions in batches, 
rather than draw a line, draw a dimension, draw another line, draw another 
dimension. . . .

287
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
Discovering New Dimensions
Before digging into the techniques that you use to create dimension styles 
and dimensions, here’s some AutoCAD dimensioning terminology that you 
need to understand. If you’re already familiar with CAD dimensioning lingo, 
just skim this section and look at the figures in it. Otherwise, read on.
Anatomy of a dimension
AutoCAD uses the names shown in Figure 14-2 and described in the following 
list to refer to the parts of each dimension:
Why dimensions in CAD?
You may think that CAD would have rendered 
text dimensions obsolete. After all, you comply  
with all my suggestions about using AutoCAD 
precision techniques when you draw and edit,  
and you’re careful to draw each object at its 
true size, right? The contractor or machinist  
can just use AutoCAD to query distances and 
angles in the DWG file, right? Sorry, but no
 
(to the last question, anyway). Here are a few 
reasons why the traditional dimensioning that 
CAD drafting has inherited from manual drafting 
is likely to be around for a while:
 ✓ Some people need to or want to use paper 
drawings when they build something.
 
We’re still some time away from the day 
when contractors haul computers around 
on their tool belts (never mind mousing
 
around a drawing while hanging from
 
scaffolding).
 ✓ In many industries, paper drawings still  
rule legally. Your company may supply both 
plotted drawings and DWG files to clients, 
but your contracts probably specify that the 
plotted drawings govern in the case of any 
discrepancy. The contracts probably also 
warn against relying on any distances that  
the recipient of the drawings measures —  
using measuring commands in the
 
electronic drawing file or a scale on the  
plotted drawing. The text dimensions are 
supposed to supply all the dimensional
 
information that’s needed to construct the 
object.
 ✓ Dimensions sometimes carry additional  
information besides the basic length or  
angle. For example, dimension text can
 
indicate the allowable manufacturing
 
tolerances or show that a particular
 
distance is typical of similar situations
 
elsewhere on the drawing.

 ✓ 
Dimension text: The numeric value that indicates the true distance or 
angle between points or lines. Dimension text can also include other 
information in addition to or instead of the number. For example, you 
can add a suffix, such as TYP., to indicate that a dimension is typical of 
several similar configurations. AutoCAD’s default dimension style settings 
center the dimension text vertically and horizontally on the dimension 
lines, as shown in Figure 14-2, but you can change those settings to 
cause the text to appear in a different location — sitting over an unbroken 
dimension line, as shown previously in Figure 14-1, for example. See the 
section “Adjusting style settings,” later in this chapter, for instructions.
 ✓ 
Dimension lines: In linear dimensions, the dimension lines indicate the 
true distance between points. Linear dimension lines can be horizontal, 
vertical, rotated at a specific angle, or aligned with the object being 
dimensioned. Angular dimensions have curved dimension lines with the 
center of the curve at the vertex point of the objects being dimensioned. 
For radius and diameter dimensions, the dimension line simply points 
at the object being dimensioned (see Figure 14-3 for examples of these 
dimension types).
 ✓ 
Arrowheads: The dimension’s arrowheads appear at the end or ends 
of the dimension lines and emphasize the extent of the dimensioned 
length. AutoCAD’s default arrowhead style is the closed, filled type 
shown in Figure 14-2, but you can choose other symbols, such as dots or 
tick marks, to indicate the ends of the dimension lines. (Don’t get ticked 
off, but AutoCAD calls the line ending an arrowhead even when, as in the 
case of a tick mark, it doesn’t look like an arrow.)

 ✓ 
Extension lines: Extend outward from the definition points (also known 
as defpoints) that you select (usually by snapping to points on an object) 
to the dimension lines. By drafting convention, a small gap usually exists 
between the defpoints and the beginning of the extension lines. Also by 
convention, the extension lines usually extend just past the dimension 
lines — see Figures 14-2 and 14-3 for examples. You can make a set of 
dimensions look tidier by assigning fixed lengths for the extension lines. 
And if you need to dimension to circles or centerlines, you can assign 
dash-dot linetypes to either or both extension lines.
 ✓ 
Defpoints: When you create any kind of dimension, AutoCAD places one 
or more definition points (universally known as defpoints) on a special 
layer named (what else?) Defpoints, which the program creates the first 
time a dimension command is issued. These points are usually invisible 
because the objects being dimensioned are on top of them, but you can 
see where they sit by selecting a dimension to turn on its grips. The 
grips on the objects being dimensioned are on the dimension’s definition 
points. Because you wouldn’t want these points to appear when you plot 
your drawings, the Defpoints layer has a special property: Nothing created 
on the Defpoints layer will print.
 
Because of the Defpoints layer’s non-printing property, experienced users for 
many years have been using it for sketches, guidelines, and important notes 
(for example, “Don’t forget to buy bread on the way home!”). I don’t endorse 
this practice because of a convoluted relationship between the Defpoints 
layer and Layer 0 — it can be very hard to tell what’s on which layer, and that 
can make the drawing harder to edit. If you want a “scratch” layer for those 
important notes, create one named Scratch and set it to NoPlot in the Layer 
Properties Manager palette. (For more about layers and the Layer Properties 
Manager, see Chapter 6.)

AutoCAD provides several types of dimensions and commands for drawing 
them. Figure 14-3, earlier in this chapter, shows the most common types, and 
the following list describes them:
 ✓ 
Linear dimensions: Indicate the linear extent of an object or the linear 
distance between objects. Most linear dimensions are either horizontal or 
vertical, but you can draw dimensions that are rotated to other angles, too.
 ✓ 
Aligned dimensions: Similar to linear dimensions, but the dimension 
line tilts to the same angle as a line drawn through the origin points of 
its extension lines.
 ✓ 
Radial dimensions: A radius dimension shows the radius of a circle or 
an arc, and a diameter dimension calls out the diameter of a circle or an 
arc. You can position the dimension text inside or outside the curve, as 
shown in Figure 14-3. If you position the text outside the curve, AutoCAD 
(by default) draws a little cross at the center of the circle or arc. As 
shown in Figures 14-2 and 14-3, AutoCAD automatically adds the diameter 
and radius symbols to the appropriate dimension type.
 
 If you’re wondering when you should use which, because radius and 
diameter dimensions seem to do the same thing, the convention in most 
drafting disciplines is to use diameter dimensions for whole circles 
(for example, a hole) and radius dimensions for part circles or arcs (for 
example, a fillet).
 ✓ 
Angular dimensions: Indicate the angular measurement between two 
lines, the two endpoints of an arc, or two points on a circle. The dimension 
line appears as an arc that indicates the sweep of the measured angle.
Other types of dimensions and dimension-like annotations you can add to 
AutoCAD objects include arc length and ordinate dimensions, tolerances,
 inspection dimensions, and center marks. Choose Annotate Drawings➪
Dimensions and Tolerances on the Home page of the AutoCAD 2011 online 
help for more information about other less frequently used kinds of 
dimensions.
Dimension associativity
By default, AutoCAD groups all the parts of each dimension — the extension 
lines, dimension lines, arrowheads, and text — into a special associative 
dimension object. Associative means two things:
 ✓ 
The different parts of the dimension function as a single object. When 
you click any part of the dimension, AutoCAD selects all its parts.

291
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
 ✓ 
The dimension is connected to the points on the object that you 
specified when you drew the dimension. If you change the size of the 
object (for example, stretch a line), the dimension updates appropriately — 
the lines and arrows move, and the text changes to reflect the line’s new 
size.
 
The associative dimensions I’m talking about here first appeared in AutoCAD 
2002. Before that, AutoCAD had a more primitive kind of dimensioning. 
Dimensions were single objects, and they did update if you stretched an 
object as long as you were very careful to include the dimension itself in the 
crossing selection for the STRETCH command. Here’s where things can get a 
bit confusing: AutoCAD used to call these old-style, single-object dimensions 
associative but now calls them non-associative, and what used to be called 
non-associative dimensions before AutoCAD 2002 are now called exploded 
dimensions. For more information about how to determine which kind of 
dimension AutoCAD draws, see the “Controlling and editing dimension 
associativity” section, later in this chapter.
Finding your dimension tools
Both the Annotation panel on the Ribbon’s Home tab and the Dimensions 
panel on the Annotate tab provide access to AutoCAD’s most frequently used 
basic dimensioning commands. (If you’re an AutoCAD Classic workspace 
user, you’ll find them on the classic Dimension menu and Dimension toolbar.)
 
As much as I like the 2D Drafting & Annotation workspace and the Ribbon, one 
task where the classic interface just might be more efficient is in dimensioning. 
The classic Dimension toolbar provides access to more dimension tools than 
the Ribbon, and it does so while maintaining consistent one-click access to 
each command. With the Ribbon, you may find it takes a couple of clicks to 
get to the command you want, and some dimension commands aren’t even 
there.
Here’s how to turn on the Dimension toolbar in a Ribbon-based workspace:
 
1. Click the View tab on the Ribbon.
 
2. On the Windows panel, click Toolbars.
 
 AutoCAD displays a menu of loaded customization files. If your system 
does not have the Express Tools installed, or if you’re using AutoCAD 
LT, you may see only “AutoCAD” on this menu. If you’re working for a 
large company, you may well see additional custom menus on this list.
 
3. Click AutoCAD to display a list of classic toolbars.
 
4. Choose Dimension from the menu.
 
 AutoCAD closes the Toolbars menu and the classic Dimension toolbar 
appears either floating or docked on an edge of the drawing area.

292
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
All dimensioning commands have long command names (such as DIMARC, 
DIMLINEAR, and DIMRADIUS) and corresponding command aliases (such as 
DAR, DLI, and DRA, respectively — do you see a pattern?) that you can type at 
the command prompt. If you do lots of dimensioning and don’t want to toggle 
the Dimension toolbar on and off repeatedly, memorize the abbreviated forms 
of the dimension commands that you use frequently. You can find a list of the 
long command names in the Command Reference section of the AutoCAD 
online help system. On the Help home page, choose Command 
Reference➪Commands➪D Commands.
Doing Dimensions with Style(s)
Creating a usable dimension style that gives you the dimension look you 
want is the biggest challenge in using AutoCAD’s dimensioning features. 
Each drawing contains its own dimension styles, so changes you make to a 
dimension style in one drawing affect only that drawing. However, after you 
get the dimension styles right in a drawing, you can use it as a template or 
starting point for later drawings.
A dimension style (or dimstyle for short) is a collection of drawing settings 
called dimension variables, which are a special class of the system variables 
that I describe in Chapter 26.
You can create dimension styles with the annotative property — the steps 
to creating both annotative and non-annotative dimension styles are spelled 
out in the following sections. Although it’s possible to change individual 
non-annotative dimensions to annotative in the Quick Properties panel or the 
Properties palette, it’s far more efficient to assign the annotative property 
to a dimension style so that all dimensions created in that style will be 
annotative.
Borrowing existing dimension styles
If you’re lucky enough to work in an office where someone has set up 
dimension styles that are appropriate for your industry and project, you can 
skip the pain and strain of creating your own dimension styles. Bear in mind, 
however, that since annotative objects were introduced in AutoCAD 2008, 
dimension styles copied from pre-AutoCAD 2008 drawings are not going to be 
annotative. If the ready-made dimension style that you need lives in another 
drawing, you can use the DesignCenter palette to copy it into your drawing. For 
a refresher on using DesignCenter, see the sections “Using AutoCAD 
DesignCenter” and “Copying layers between drawings” in Chapter 6 — just 
substitute Dimstyles.

293
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
Creating and managing dimension styles
If you do need to create your own dimension styles or you want to tweak 
ones that you copied from another drawing, use the Dimension Style Manager 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
Figure 14-4: 
Yet another 
manager, 
this one for 
dimension 
styles.
 
Every drawing comes with a default dimension style named Standard 
(for imperial [feet and inches] drawings) or ISO-25 (for metric drawings). 
Although you can use and modify the Standard or ISO-25 style, I suggest that 
you leave them as-is and create your own dimension style(s) for the settings 
that are appropriate to your work. This approach ensures that you can use 
the default style as a reference. More important, it avoids a potential naming 
conflict that can change the way your dimensions look if the current drawing 
gets inserted into another drawing. (Chapter 17 describes this potential 
conflict.)
New drawings created in AutoCAD 2011 or AutoCAD LT 2011 using either the 
imperial template (acad.dwt or acadlt.dwt in AutoCAD LT) or the metric 
template (acadiso.dwt or acadltiso.dwt in LT) contain two dimension 
styles. As noted previously, imperial drawings have a style named Standard, 
and metric drawings sport a style named ISO-25; in addition, both have a 
style called Annotative. The Annotative style is a clone of Standard or ISO-25 
with the single difference being the values of the overall scale factor (also 
known as the DIMSCALE system variable).
The following steps describe how to create your own dimension style(s):
 
 
1. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the label of the Annotation panel to 
open the panel slideout, then click the Dimension Style button.
 
 Alternatively, if that just sounds like too much work, you could type D 
and press Enter. The Dimension Style Manager dialog box appears.

294
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
2. In the Styles list, select the existing dimension style whose settings 
you want to use as the starting point for the settings of your new style.
 
 For example, select the default dimension style named Standard or ISO-25.
 
3. Click the New button to create a new dimension style that’s a copy of 
the existing style.
 
 The Create New Dimension Style dialog box appears.
 
4. Enter a New Style Name and select or deselect the Annotative check 
box. Click Continue.
 
 Select the Annotative check box to create an annotative dimension style, 
or deselect it for a non-annotative style. Refer to Chapter 13 for more 
about annotative objects.
 
 The New Dimension Style dialog box appears. (This dialog box is virtually 
identical to the Modify Dimension Style dialog box shown in Figure 14-5 
in the following section.)
 
5. Modify dimension settings on any of the seven tabs in the New 
Dimension Style dialog box.
 
 See the descriptions of these settings in the next section of this chapter.
 
6. Click OK to close the New Dimension Style dialog box.
 
 The Dimension Style Manager dialog box reappears.
 7. 
Click Close.
 
 The Dimension Style Manager dialog box closes, and your new dimension 
style becomes the current dimension style that AutoCAD uses for future 
dimensions in this drawing.
 
8. Draw some dimensions to test your new dimension style.
 
Avoid changing existing dimension styles that you didn’t create unless you 
know for sure what they’re used for. When you change a dimension style 
setting, all dimensions that use that style change to reflect the revised setting. 
Thus, one small dimension variable setting change can affect a large number 
of existing dimensions! To play it safe, instead of modifying an existing 
dimension style, create a new style by copying the existing one and modifying 
the new one.
 
A further variation on the already convoluted dimension style picture is that 
you can create dimension substyles (also called style families) — variations of 
a main style that affect only a particular type of dimension, such as radial or 
angular. If you open the Dimension Style Manager dialog box and see names of 
dimension types indented beneath the main dimension style names, be aware 
that you’re dealing with substyles.

295

Adjusting style settings
After you click New or Modify in the Dimension Style Manager dialog box, 
AutoCAD displays a tabbed New Dimension Style or Modify Dimension Style 
dialog box (the two dialog boxes are identical except for the title bar) with 
a mind-boggling — and potentially drawing-boggling if you’re not careful — 
array of settings. Figure 14-5 shows the settings on the Lines tab, which I’ve 
modified from the AutoCAD defaults to conform to one office’s drafting 
standards.
Fortunately, the dimension preview that appears on all tabs — as well as 
on the main Dimension Style Manager dialog box — immediately shows the 
results of most setting changes. With the dimension preview and some 
trial-and-error changing of settings, you can usually home in on an acceptable 
group of settings. For more information, use the dialog box help feature: 
Just hover your mouse pointer over the setting that you want to know more 
about.
 
Before you start messing with dimension style settings, it’s important to know 
what you want your dimensions to look like when they’re plotted. If you’re not 
sure how it’s done in your industry, ask others in your office or profession, 
or look at a plotted drawing that someone in the know represents as being a 
good example.

296
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
The following sections introduce you to the more important tabs in the New/
Modify Dimension Style dialog boxes and highlight useful settings. Note that 
whenever you specify a distance or length setting, you should enter the 
desired plotted size. For dimensions created with annotative styles, these are 
the actual paper (plotted) sizes. For dimensions with non-annotative styles, 
AutoCAD scales all these numbers by the overall scale factor that you enter 
on the Fit tab.
Following lines and arrows
The settings on the Lines tab and the Symbols and Arrows tab control the 
basic look and feel of all parts of your dimensions except text. Use these tabs 
to change the type and size of arrowheads or the display characteristics of 
the dimension and extension lines.
Tabbing to text
Use the Text tab to control how your dimension text looks — the text style 
and height to use (see Chapter 13) and where to place the text with respect 
to the dimension and extension lines. You may want to change the Text Style 
setting from the default Arial TrueType font to the more traditional Romans.
shx font. The default Text Height is too large for most situations — set it 
to 1/8", 3mm, or another height that makes sense. Figure 14-6 shows one 
company’s standard text settings.

Whip your

297
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
 
If you’re not opposed to defacing books, get out a bright red marker and put a 
circle around this warning (unless you borrowed the book from the library, 
of course). Here goes: You must define the text style that you specify for a 
dimension style with a height of 0 in the Text Style dialog box. (See Chapter 13 
for more information about variable-height and fixed-height text styles.) If you 
specify a fixed-height text style for a dimension style, the text style’s height 
will override the Text Height setting in the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog 
boxes. Use a zero-height style to avoid the problem — and bear in mind that 
using nonzero-height text styles in dimensions is one of the most common 
mistakes made by new AutoCAD users.
 
Industry or company standards usually dictate the size of dimension text. 
(For example, 1/8" or 3mm is common in the architectural industry.) In any 
case, make sure you pick a height that’s not too small to read on your smallest 
check plot.
The Text tab in the New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box sports a View 
Direction option. When set to Left-to-Right, horizontal dimension text reads 
right way up, and vertical text reads from the right side of the drawing. This 
is nearly always what you want, but occasionally you might need to rotate an 
entire drawing view by 90 degrees so it fits your drawing sheet (maybe you 
draw elevator shafts?), and at such times, some of your dimension text may 
read the wrong way around. You can create a whole AutoCAD 2011 dimension 
style for this, and you can also modify the view direction of individual 
dimensions in the Properties palette (see Chapter 6 for more on object 
properties).
Getting fit
The Fit tab includes a bunch of confusing options that control when and 
where AutoCAD shoves the dimension text if it doesn’t quite fit between the 
dimension lines. The default settings leave AutoCAD in “maximum attempt at 
being helpful” mode — that is, AutoCAD moves the text, dimension lines, and 
arrows around automatically so that things don’t overlap. If these guesses 
seem less than satisfactory to you, try the modified settings shown in Figure 
14-7: Select the Over Dimension Line, Without Leader radio button under 
Text Placement and the Draw Dim Line between Ext Lines check box under 
Fine Tuning. (You can always move the text yourself by grip editing it, as I 
describe in the section “Editing dimension geometry,” later in this chapter.)
 
Even at its most helpful, AutoCAD sometimes makes a bad first guess about 
how you want your dimension text and arrows arranged. If you’re having 
problems getting the look you want, don’t flip your wig — flip your arrows to 
the other side of the dimension lines by selecting the dimension, right-clicking, 
and choosing Flip Arrow from the menu.

298
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Most important, the Fit tab includes the Annotative check box, as shown in 
Figure 14-7. Using annotative dimensions, as I recommend in this chapter, will 
make your dimensioning go a lot more smoothly!
 
Figure 14-7: 
Keep Fit

forget the

Annotative check box
 
Just as with text, as I explain in Chapter 13, you can choose between three 
different methods for dimensioning your drawings:
 ✓ 
You can dimension in model space using annotative dimensions. 
Assign annotation scales to the dimensions, and they change size as you 
change Annotation scales on the status bar. I think this system has the 
most to offer both new and experienced users.
 ✓ 
You can dimension in model space with non-annotative dimensions. 
If your drawing includes areas of different scales, you can create 
multiple dimension styles, one for each scale. This is probably the least 
convenient — although the longest established — method, especially in 
a drawing with multiple scale views.
 ✓ 
You can dimension in paper space using either annotative or 
non-annotative dimensions. Select the Scale Dimensions to Layout radio 
button on the Dimension Style Manager’s Fit tab and draw dimensions in 
a paper space layout.

299
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
 
I recommend that you get comfortable with annotative dimensioning in model 
space first. If you later want to try dimensioning in paper space, look in the 
AutoCAD online help system; from the Home page, choose User’s 
Guide➪Annotate Drawings➪Dimensions and Tolerances➪Use Dimension 
Styles➪Set the Scale for Dimensions. As for old-style (that is, non-annotative) 
dimensioning, it’s still part of the program, and many offices will probably 
keep doing it that way for a while to come.
 
The Use Overall Scale Of setting corresponds to the DIMSCALE system 
variable, and you’ll hear AutoCAD drafters refer to it as such. When either 
Scale Dimensions to Layout (for paper space layout dimensioning) or 
Annotative (for rescalable model space dimensioning) is selected, DIMSCALE 
is automatically set to 0. For more information about additional dimension 
scale options, look up the DIMSCALE system variable in the AutoCAD online 
help system.
Using primary units
The Primary Units tab gives you highly detailed control over how AutoCAD 
formats the characters in the dimension text string. You usually want to set 
the Unit format and Precision and maybe specify a suffix for unitless numbers 
if it’s not clear from your drawing what units you’re using. You may also 
change the Zero Suppression settings, depending on whether you want 
dimension text to read 0.5000, .5000, or 0.5. (“Zero Suppression!” also 
makes a great rallying cry for organizing your fellow AutoCAD drafters.)
AutoCAD 2010 introduced an interesting tweak to dimension text in 
dimension subunits. If the main unit of measure on your drawing is meters, 
rather than have a bunch of smaller distances dimensioned as, say, 0.450, 
you could create a centimeter subunit so that any dimension less than 1 
meter would be shown in centimeters. So in this example, such a dimension 
would read as 45cm rather than 0.45. Now (personal opinion alert), that’s 
pretty clever programming, but in every office I’ve ever worked in, there’s 
a very strict drafting standard that says that all dimensions on a drawing 
must be in the same units — in other words, in a drawing with meters as the 
dimension unit, 0.45 would be correct, and 45cm would be incorrect. Check 
your own office standards before you incorporate this new feature, which 
you can find on the Primary Units tab of the New/Modify Dimension Style 
dialog box.
Other style settings
If your work requires that you show dimensions in two different systems 
of measure (such as inches and millimeters), use the Alternate Units tab to 
turn on and control alternate units. If your work requires listing construction 
tolerances (for example, 3.5 +/–0.01), use the Tolerances tab to configure 

300
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
the tolerance format that you want. Unlike subunits (described in the 
preceding paragraph), alternate units display both dimensions at once; 
subunits replaces one unit (say, meters), with another unit (say, centimeters).
 
The New/Modify Dimension Style dialog box Tolerances tab settings are for 
adding manufacturing tolerances (for example, +0.2 or -0.1) to the text 
of ordinary dimensions — the kind of dimensions I cover in this chapter. 
AutoCAD also includes a separate TOLERANCE command that draws special 
symbols called geometric tolerances. If you need these symbols, you probably 
know it; if you’ve never heard of them, just ignore them. Look up Geometric 
Tolerance dialog box on the Index page of the AutoCAD online help system for 
more information.
Drawing Dimensions
Whew! The hard part is getting it to look right. After you’ve copied or created 
a suitable dimension style, you’re ready to dimension. Fortunately, adding 
dimensions to a drawing with existing dimension styles is usually pretty 
straightforward.
When you want to dimension something in AutoCAD, you can either select 
the object, such as a line or polyline segment, or select points on that object, 
such as the endpoints of the line or polyline segment. If you select an object, 
AutoCAD finds the most obvious points on it to dimension, such as the 
endpoints of a line. If you choose to select individual points instead, use 
object snaps (see Chapter 7). When you change the size of the object (for 
example, by stretching it), AutoCAD automatically moves the dimension’s 
origin points and updates the dimension text to show the new length.
 
If you don’t use object snaps or another AutoCAD precision technique to 
choose dimension points, the dimension text probably won’t reflect the 
precise measurement of the object. This lack of precision can cause serious 
problems. When in doubt, OSNAP to it!
When you set up a new drawing and you want to use annotative dimensions, 
make sure the Annotative box is selected on the Fit tab in the New/Modify 
Dimension Style dialog box (refer to Figure 14-7). For a new drawing with 
non-annotative dimensions, change the Use Overall Scale Of setting on the Fit 
tab so that it matches the drawing scale factor. Before you draw any dimensions 
in a drawing that you didn’t set up, check this setting to make sure it’s correct.
 
The AutoCAD dimensioning commands prompt you with useful information at 
the command line or dynamic input prompts. Read the prompts during every 
step of the command, especially when you’re trying a dimensioning command 
for the first time.

301
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
Lining up some linear dimensions
Linear dimensions are the most common type of dimensions, and horizontal 
and vertical are the most common of those. The following example demon-
strates all the important techniques for creating horizontal and vertical 
linear dimensions, as well as aligned dimensions (which are similar to linear 
dimensions):
 
1. Use the LINE command to draw a non-orthogonal line — that is, a line 
segment that’s not horizontal or vertical.
 
 An angle of about 30 degrees works well for this example.
 
 If you want to apply dimensioning to an object other than a line, use 
these steps as a general guideline, filling in the appropriate commands 
and data as applicable to your drawing.
 
2. Set a layer that’s appropriate for dimensions as current.
 
 Just as with text, it’s a good idea to have a dedicated layer for dimensions 
in every drawing. See Chapter 6 for details on setting a layer as current.
 
3. Set a dimension style that’s appropriate for your needs as current.
 
 Choose an existing dimension style from the Dimension Style drop-down 
list on the Annotation panel slideout on the Ribbon’s Home tab, or 
create a new style by using the procedure in the section “Creating and 
managing dimension styles,” earlier in this chapter.
 
 
4. On the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel, click the lower half of the 
Dimension split button and choose Linear, or type DLI and press 
Enter.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify first extension line origin or <select 
object>:
 
5. To specify the origin of the first extension line, snap to the lower-left 
endpoint of the line by using endpoint object snap.
 
 If you don’t have endpoint as one of your current running object snaps, 
specify a single endpoint object snap by holding down the Shift key, 
right-clicking, and choosing Endpoint from the menu. (See Chapter 7 for 
more about object snaps.)
 
 AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify second extension line origin:
 
6. To specify the origin of the second extension line, snap to the other 
endpoint of the line by using endpoint object snap again.

302
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 AutoCAD draws a horizontal dimension — the length of the displacement in 
the left-to-right direction — if you move the crosshairs above or below 
the line. It draws a vertical dimension — the length of the displacement 
in the up-and-down direction — if you move the crosshairs to the left or 
right of the line.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you:
Specify dimension line location or
[Mtext/Text/Angle/Horizontal/Vertical/Rotated]:
 
7. Move the mouse to generate the type of dimension you want, 
horizontal or vertical, and then click wherever you want to place 
the dimension line.
 
 AutoCAD draws the dimension.
 
 When you’re specifying the dimension line location, you usually don’t 
want to object snap to existing objects — you want the dimension line 
and text to sit in a relatively empty part of the drawing rather than bump 
into existing objects. If necessary, temporarily turn off running object 
snap (for example, click the OSNAP button on the status bar) in order to 
avoid snapping the dimension line to an existing object.
 
 If you want to be able to align subsequent dimension lines easily, turn 
on Snap Mode and set a suitable snap spacing — more easily done than 
said! — before you pick the point that determines the location of the 
dimension line. See Chapter 4 for more information about Snap Mode.
 
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 to create another linear dimension of the 
opposite orientation (vertical or horizontal).
 
 
9. On the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel, click the lower half of the 
Dimension split button and choose Aligned from the flyout menu, or 
type DAL and press Enter.
 
 The prompt includes an option to select an object instead of picking two 
points (you can use this technique with the Linear Dimension command, 
too):
Specify first extension line origin or <select 
object>:
 
10. Press Enter to choose the Select Object option.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you:
Select object to dimension:
 
11. Select the line or other object that you want to dimension.
 
 AutoCAD automatically finds the endpoints of the line and uses them 
as the extension line origin points (that is, the defpoints), as shown in 
Figure 14-8. (The broken extension line is created with the DIMBREAK 
command, which I describe in the section “More fine tweaking,” later in 
this chapter.)

Making dimensions annotative
If you’ve created your dimensions using an annotative style, you can set 
them up so that they change to the appropriate plotted (paper) size when 
you change the drawing’s annotation scale. The process is the same for 
dimensions as it is for text (covered in Chapter 13) or for hatching (covered 
in Chapter 15). Refer to Chapter 13 for details.
Drawing other kinds of dimensions
After you have the hang of ordinary linear dimensions, you should be able to 
master other common dimension types quickly. Draw some lines, arcs, and 
circles and try the other dimension commands on the Home tab’s Annotation 
panel or the fuller set on the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel. You’ll find 
more dimension commands on the Dimension toolbar (see “Finding your 
dimension tools,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions on loading it).
 
If you want to be super-efficient, learn the three-letter aliases for the 
dimension commands you use the most.

304
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 To draw a series of side-by-side dimensions whose dimension lines are 
perfectly aligned, use the DIMCONTINUE command. To draw an overall 
dimension above one or more smaller dimensions, use DIMBASELINE. To 
draw a dimension that does not show the actual measured distance that’s 
indicated by the dimension value, use DIMJOGLINE. See Figure 14-9 for 
examples of these and other dimension types.
 
The QDIM (Quick DIMension) command provides a quick way to draw lots of 
dimensions that, when necessary, can automatically format themselves into 
continued and baseline dimensions in one fell swoop. You can find QDIM on 
the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel in both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT.

DIMBASELINE (DBA)
Editing Dimensions
After you draw dimensions, you can edit the position of the various parts 
of each dimension and change the contents of the dimension text. AutoCAD 
groups all the parts of a dimension into a single object.
Editing dimension geometry
The easiest way to change the location of dimension parts is to use grip 
editing, which I describe in Chapter 10. Just click a dimension, click one of its 
grips, and maneuver away. You’ll discover that certain grips control certain 

305
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
directions of movement. In general, selecting a dimension displays grips at 
the text, the ends of the dimension lines, and the defpoints. Experiment for a 
few minutes to see how they work.
If you want to change the look of a component of a specific, individual 
dimension (for example, substitute a different arrowhead or suppress an 
extension line), use the Properties palette. (See Chapter 11 for more on the 
Properties palette.) All the dimension settings in the New/Modify Dimension 
Style dialog boxes (see “Adjusting style settings,” earlier in this chapter) are 
available in the Properties palette when you select one or more dimensions.
More fine tweaking
In manual drafting, it’s considered bad form to cross object lines (that is, 
real geometry) with dimension lines or extension lines. Dimension Break 
(DIMBREAK) prompts you to select a dimension and then an object to break 
it. In Figure 14-8, earlier in this chapter, the right extension line of the 3.50 
horizontal dimension is broken by the lower extension line of the 1.50 
vertical dimension.
The Dimension Space (DIMSPACE) command applies a specified separation 
between existing linear or angular dimensions. Spacing dimensions equally — 
other than by using the DIMBASELINE command as they’re created — 
requires tedious manipulation with Snap and MOVE.
 
If you select one or more dimensions and right-click, the menu displays a 
number of useful options for overriding dimension settings or assigning a 
different style.
 
When you change a setting in the Properties palette, you’re overriding the 
default style setting for that dimension. If you need to make the same change 
to a bunch of dimensions, it’s usually better to create a new dimension style 
and assign that style to them. You can use the Properties palette or the 
right-click menu to change the dimension style that’s assigned to one or more 
dimensions.
You can use the Properties palette to turn on AutoCAD’s background mask 
feature, described in Chapter 13, for the text of individual dimensions: Select 
the dimensions, display the Text area in the Properties palette, and find the 
Fill Color item. Click in the list box, scroll down, and select Background to 
use the drawing background color (which usually gives the best results). To 
ensure that dimension text lies on top of other objects, use the DRAWORDER 
or TEXTTOFRONT command — see Chapter 13 for more information.
 
The AutoCAD EXPLODE command on the Home tab’s Modify panel will blow 
a dimension to smithereens — or at least into a bunch of line and multiline 
text objects. Don’t do it! Exploding a dimension makes it much harder to 
edit cleanly and eliminates AutoCAD’s ability to update the dimension text 
measurement automatically.

306
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Editing dimension text
In most cases, you shouldn’t have to edit dimension text. Assuming that you 
draw your geometry accurately and pick the dimension points precisely, 
AutoCAD displays the right measurement. If you change the size of the 
associated object, AutoCAD updates the dimension and its measurement. 
However, you may occasionally want to override the dimension text (that is, 
replace it with a different measurement) or add a prefix or a suffix to the true 
measurement.
AutoCAD creates dimension text as a multiline text (Mtext) object, so 
dimension text has the same editing options as ordinary text. Unfortunately, 
the right-click menu for dimension objects doesn’t include a Text Edit option. 
You can use the Text Override field in the Properties palette or type ED (the 
keyboard shortcut for the DDEDIT command) to edit dimension text in the 
In-Place Text Editor.
AutoCAD displays the true dimension length as text in the actual dimension (and 
keeps the text up to date if you change the size or location of the object). You 
can override the true length by typing a specific length or other text string. 
You can preserve the true length but add a prefix or suffix by inserting <> 
(that is, the left and right angled bracket characters) as a placeholder for the 
dimension value. For example, if you enter <> Max., and the actual distance 
is 12.00, AutoCAD displays 12.00 Max. for the dimension text. If you later 
stretch the object so that the actual distance changes to 14.50, AutoCAD 
automatically changes the dimension text to read 14.50 Max. Now you can 
appreciate the importance of drawing and editing geometry precisely!
 
Avoid the temptation to override the default dimension text by replacing the 
angled brackets with a numeric value. Doing so eliminates AutoCAD’s ability 
to keep dimension measurements current, but even worse, you get no visual 
cue that the default distance has been overridden (unless you edit the 
dimension text). If you’re overriding dimension text a lot, it’s probably a sign 
that the creator of the drawing didn’t pay enough attention to using precision 
techniques when drawing and editing. I’m not going to point any fingers, but 
you probably know whom to talk to.
Controlling and editing dimension 
associativity
When you add dimensions by selecting objects or picking points on the 
objects by using Object Snap modes, AutoCAD normally creates associative 
dimensions, which are connected to the objects and move with them. This 
is the case in new drawings that were originally created in any version of 
AutoCAD starting with 2002.

307
 Chapter 14: Entering New Dimensions
 
If you have to work on drawings created or last edited in versions older than 
AutoCAD 2002, you must set the DIMASSOC system variable to 2 before 
AutoCAD 2011 will create associative dimensions. An easy way to make this 
change for the current drawing is to open the Options dialog box (click the 
Application button and choose Options from the bottom of the Application 
Menu), click the User Preferences tab, and turn on the Make New Dimensions 
Associative setting. Be aware that this setting affects only new dimensions 
that you draw from now on — to make existing non-associative dimensions 
associative, use the DIMREASSOCIATE command described in the following 
list. Look up DIMASSOC system variable in the AutoCAD online help system for 
more information.
 
You aren’t likely to need any of these three commands very often, but if you 
do, look up the command name in the online help system:
 ✓ 
DIMREASSOCIATE: If you have dimensions that aren’t currently 
associative (probably because they were created in older versions 
of AutoCAD) or are associated with the wrong objects, you can use 
the DIMREASSOCIATE command to associate them with points on the 
objects of your choice. DIMREASSOCIATE can be found on the Annotate 
tab’s Dimensions panel slideout, or you can just type DRE and press 
Enter.
 ✓ 
DIMDISASSOCIATE: You can use the DIMDISASSOCIATE (DDA) 
command to sever the connection between a dimension and its 
associated object.
 ✓ 
DIMREGEN: In a few special circumstances, AutoCAD doesn’t 
automatically update geometry-driven associative dimensions. (Maybe 
Autodesk should call them “usually fully awake but occasionally asleep 
at the wheel associative dimensions.”) In those cases, the DIMREGEN 
(no command alias) command will fix things.

▶ Using annotative hatching
▶ Choosing hatching boundaries
▶ Editing hatches
D
rafters often use hatching to represent the type of material that makes 
up an object, such as insulation, metal, concrete, and so on. In other 
cases, hatching helps emphasize or clarify the extent of a particular element 
in the drawing — for example, showing the location of walls in a building plan 
or highlighting a swampy area on a map so you know where to avoid building 
a road. Figure 15-1 shows an example of hatching in a structural detail.
As I mention in Chapter 13, hatching is another component of AutoCAD’s 
annotative objects. Hatch patterns have a scale factor (as I explain in the 
“Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale” section, later in this chapter) and can 
be created so that the hatch scale updates as the annotation scale changes.
An AutoCAD hatch is a separate object that fills a space, has an appearance 
dictated by the hatch pattern assigned to it, and by default is associated 
with the objects that bound the space, such as lines, polylines, or arcs. If you 
move or stretch the boundaries, AutoCAD normally updates the hatching to 
fill the resized area.

310
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
Figure 15-1: 
A big batch 
o’ hatch.
 
 
Hatch patterns are defined by external files named acad.pat or acadlt.pat 
(imperial units), or acadiso.pat or acadltiso.pat (metric units). Each 
file includes definitions for eight ANSI hatch patterns (mostly variations on 
diagonal lines), 14 ISO patterns, and 50 other predefined patterns. (I recommend 
you avoid the ISO patterns for the same reason as I suggested you stay clear 
of ISO linetypes in Chapter 6.) You can create your own hatch patterns — the 
online help system’s Customization Guide explains how — or you can buy 
libraries of custom hatch patterns. Any patterns not defined in acad.pat or 
acadiso.pat are referred to as custom patterns.
 
Hatching in AutoCAD has progressed dramatically over the last half-dozen 
releases. We’ve gone from a keyboard-only command, through several 
different iterations of the Hatch dialog box, and now in AutoCAD 2011 we 
have (what else?) a contextual Ribbon tab for hatching. Among the other 
Hatch improvements I describe in this chapter are:
 ✓ 
Hatch preview: Simply start the HATCH command and move your 
mouse over the drawing. AutoCAD presents a preview of the current 
hatch pattern as you moved over each closed area.
 ✓ 
New hatch properties: Hatches — even solid hatches — can be 
transparent, and all hatch objects can have a separate background 
color.
 ✓ 
Send Hatches to Back: This new variant of the DRAWORDER command 
lets you gather every hatch object in your drawing and send them all 
behind other drawing objects.

311
 Chapter 15: Down the Hatch
 ✓ 
Mirrored hatches: A new system variable (MIRRHATCH) lets you mirror 
drawing geometry that includes hatches without mirroring the hatch 
angle.
 ✓ 
Gradient fills: These have long been part of the full version of AutoCAD 
but now AutoCAD LT gets them too.
 
Don’t go overboard with hatching. The purpose of hatching is to clarify, 
not overwhelm, the other geometry in the drawing. If your plots look like a 
patchwork quilt of hatch patterns, it’s time to simplify.
 
Hatching is another kind of annotation of your geometry, similar in purpose 
to text and dimensions. As I describe at the beginning of Chapter 13, you’ll 
usually be more efficient if you save annotation for later in the drafting 
process. Draw as much geometry as possible first and then hatch the parts 
that require it. In other words, batch your hatch.
Batten Down the Hatches!
This section outlines the steps you use to add hatching to a drawing with the 
Hatch Creation contextual Ribbon tab, as shown in Figure 15-2. You can use 
this information to get started quickly with hatching. When you need more 
information about any part of the process, jump to the relevant sections of 
“Pushing the Boundary (of) Hatch,” later in this chapter.
 
Figure 15-2: 
The Hatch 
Creation 
contextual 
Ribbon tab.
 
The following steps show you how to hatch an enclosed area by using the 
“pick points” method of selecting the hatch area:
 
1. Open a drawing containing geometry that forms fully closed 
boundaries, or draw some boundaries by using the drawing 
commands described in Chapters 8 and 9.
 
 The areas you want to hatch should be completely enclosed. The 
CIRCLE, POLYGON, and RECTANG commands, and the LINE and PLINE 
commands with the Close option, make great hatch boundaries (see 
Chapters 8 and 9 for details).

312
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 
2. Start the HATCH command by typing H and pressing Enter. 
Alternatively, click the Hatch button on the Draw panel of the 
Ribbon’s Home tab.
 
 The Hatch Creation contextual Ribbon tab as seen in Figure 15-2 
appears.
 
3. Select any predefined or custom hatch pattern from the Pattern 
drop-down list on the Properties panel, or the Hatch Pattern button 
on the Pattern panel.
 
 If you chose User Defined, you don’t need to choose a pattern. Custom 
patterns appear at the end of the predefined patterns; if you don’t have 
any custom patterns on your system, ZIGZAG will be the last one listed.
 
4. Specify an Angle and Scale for the hatch pattern. (Or, if you chose 
User Defined in Step 3, specify Angle and Spacing.)
 
 See the section, “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” later in this 
chapter, for more information.
 
5. Select hatch options as required.
 
 For this example, leave the Annotative button unselected. Try it the 
old-fashioned way first and then have a look at the “Hatching for the 21st 
century” section later in the chapter.
 
 Don’t confuse Annotative with Associative, even though both are 
polysyllabic words that start with A and are right next to one another in 
the Hatch Creation tab’s Options panel. Annotative hatch objects rescale 
themselves when you change the annotation scale in model space or in 
a viewport. Associative hatch objects (enabled by default) update to the 
new area when you change the hatch boundary.
 
 By default, when you select a number of closed areas and then press 
Enter, the hatched areas will be created as a single object; choose 
Create Separate Hatches on the Options slideout panel if you want to 
be able to modify each hatched area individually. Set the Draw Order 
drop-down list to specify whether the hatch objects are in front of or 
behind the hatch boundary or other drawing objects (see Figure 15-3).
 
6. Move the crosshairs over the area you want hatched.
 
 As you move the crosshairs over the drawing, the hatch pattern and 
other options you chose in the preceding steps are displayed over every 
closed area where the crosshairs pause. The following prompt appears 
at the command line:
Pick internal point or [Select objects/seTtings]:

313
 Chapter 15: Down the Hatch
 
7. Pick a point inside the boundary of the area you want to hatch.
 
 AutoCAD analyzes the drawing and highlights the boundary that it finds.
 
8. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the 
menu to indicate that you’re finished selecting points.
 
 AutoCAD hatches the area inside the boundary.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Hatch 
options for 
every 
occasion.
 
AutoCAD is still reluctant to hatch supposedly closed areas where even a 
speck of daylight gets through, but AutoCAD 2011 at least shows you where 
you need to fix a leaky boundary. The Hatch routine displays one or more 
red circles at gaps in the not-quite-enclosed area you want to hatch. Even if it 
won’t fix the gaps, it does show you where you should fix them.
Pushing the Boundary (of) Hatch
The remainder of this chapter shows you how to refine the techniques 
presented in the preceding section. I describe how to copy existing hatching, 
take advantage of the various options in the Hatch and Gradient dialog box 
(which offers a bit more control than the Hatch Creation Ribbon tab), and 
choose more complicated hatching boundaries.

314
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
Hatch from scratch
An alternative to the Ribbon is the Hatch and Gradient dialog box as shown 
in Figure 15-4. You don’t see your hatch object updating as you change 
settings the way you do with the Ribbon, but you do have a bit more control 
over what you’re going to end up with. To display the Hatch and Gradient 
dialog box, click the dialog box launcher (the teeny arrow at the right end of 
the Options panel of the Ribbon’s Hatch Creation tab).
You can use predefined, user-defined, or custom hatch patterns. Most of the 
time, you’ll choose either predefined or user-defined hatch patterns, unless 
some generous soul gives you a custom pattern.
 
By default, the right third of the Hatch and Gradient dialog box is hidden; to 
see the additional hatch options at the right side of the dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 15-4, click the More Options arrow beside the Help button.
Pick a pattern, any pattern: Predefined hatch patterns
To use AutoCAD’s predefined hatch patterns, select Predefined from the 
Type drop-down list at the top of the Hatch tab in the Hatch and Gradient 
dialog box. This selection sets the stage for choosing the hatch pattern.
Catch a hatch: Copying hatch properties
One slick way to hatch is by using the Match 
Properties button on the Options panel of the 
Hatch Creation tab, or the Inherit Properties  
button in the Hatch and Gradient dialog box, to  
copy hatch properties from an existing hatch 
object. Think of it as point-and-shoot hatching.  
If someone — such as you — added some
 
hatching in the past that’s just like what you 
want to use now, click the Inherit Properties or 
Match Properties button and pick the existing 
hatching.
Inherit Properties (Match Properties) updates 
the hatch pattern settings in the Hatch and
 
Gradient dialog box to make them the same
 
as the existing hatch pattern object that you 
picked. You can use the cloned hatch pattern 
specifications as they are or modify them by 
making changes in the Hatch and Gradient
 
dialog box.
Consistency is a good thing in drafting,
 
especially in computer-aided drafting, in which 
some or all your drawing may be used for a
 
long time. Thus, it’s good to use the same hatch 
patterns, scales, and angles for the same
 
purposes in all your drawings. Find out whether 
your project, office, company, or profession has 
hatching standards that apply to your work.

315
 Chapter 15: Down the Hatch
 
Figure 15-4: 
The Hatch 
tab of the 
expanded 
Hatch and 
Gradient 
dialog box.
 
You specify a predefined hatch pattern in one of two ways:
 ✓ 
Pattern drop-down list: If you know the name of the hatch pattern, 
select it from the Pattern drop-down list. The list is alphabetical, except 
that SOLID (that is, a solid fill) is at the very beginning.
 ✓ 
Pattern button: If you don’t know the pattern’s name or if you prefer 
the visual approach, click the Pattern button (the tiny button with the 
ellipsis [three dots] to the right of the Pattern drop-down list and 
pattern name) to display the Hatch Pattern Palette with pattern 
previews and names.
Figure 15-5 shows the some of the Other Predefined hatch patterns, which 
cover everything from Earth to Escher to Stars.
 
Hatch patterns whose names begin with AR- are intended for architectural and 
related industries and use different scaling factors than the non-AR patterns.
After you’ve selected a pattern, specify angle and scale, as I describe in the 
section, “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” later in this chapter.
 
Although you may not guess it, AutoCAD treats filling an area with a solid 
color as a type of hatching. Simply choose SOLID from the top of the Pattern 
drop-down list.

316
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
Figure 15-5: 
Plenty of 
hatch 
patterns.
 
Like any other object, a solid hatch takes on the current object color — or 
the current layer’s color if you leave color set to ByLayer. Therefore, check 
whether the current object layer and color are set appropriately before you 
use the Solid hatching option (see Chapter 6 for details).
 
AutoCAD 2011’s new transparency object property is probably most useful 
when applied to solid hatches. You can use transparent solid hatches to 
demarcate areas on architectural floor plans or aerial photographs of project 
sites. In addition to the settings I list in the preceding paragraph, make sure 
the current object or layer transparency is set correctly too.
It’s up to you: User-defined hatches
A user-defined hatch pattern makes a hatch pattern out of parallel lines. Use 
this option to create a simple pattern and specify the space between the lines 
in paper units for annotative hatches or drawing units for non-annotative 
hatches. For example, you can hatch a wall in a building plan with an 
annotative user-defined pattern and specify that the hatch lines be 1/8" apart.
After you choose User Defined from the Type drop-down list in the Hatch and 
Gradient dialog box, you specify the angle and spacing of the lines. You can 
select the Double check box to achieve a crosshatching effect (two perpendicular 
sets of hatching lines). User-defined patterns require that you enter an angle 
and spacing, not angle and scale.

317
 Chapter 15: Down the Hatch
Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale
Predefined and custom hatch patterns require that you enter the angle and 
scale for AutoCAD to generate the hatching. Usually, you won’t have any 
trouble deciding on an appropriate angle, but a suitable scale can be tricky. 
Because (with a few exceptions) AutoCAD’s hatch patterns don’t represent 
real objects, you don’t have to be that precise about scaling them — you can 
just make them look good. But where do you start?
The answer to that question depends on whether you’re using AutoCAD’s 
annotative hatching or the old-style, non-annotative hatching. If you’re an 
up-to-the-minute CAD gal or guy, check out the next section, “Hatching for 
the 21st century.” For non-annotative hatching, you need to calculate the 
hatch scale based on the drawing scale factor, as described in Chapter 4. As 
a general rule, hatch patterns look best at somewhere between one-half and 
three-quarters of the drawing scale factor. For example, the EARTH 
pattern (in the Other Predefined tab of the Hatch Pattern Palette, as shown in 
Figure 15-5 and as used in an actual drawing back in Figure 15-1) looks pretty 
good in a full-scale (1 = 1) drawing with a hatch scale of 0.75. If you’re adding 
EARTH pattern hatching to a 1" = 1'–0" detail (drawing scale factor equals 12), 
try using a hatch scale of 0.75 × 12, or 9.0. Using a consistent multiplier like 
0.5 or 0.75 applied to the drawing scale factor ensures that hatching looks 
consistent (that the spaces between the lines are the same) at all scales when 
you plot.
 
Autodesk created the hatch patterns whose names begin with AR- particularly 
for use in architectural drawings, and unlike the non-AR patterns, they do 
represent real objects such as brick and roof shakes. The AR-patterns were 
designed with a final hatch scale of 1.0 in mind, but in some cases, you’ll have 
to adjust up or down in order to achieve a suitable scale.
Hatching for the 21st century
With annotative hatching, you start with the paper scale (because that’s 
where all your fancy CAD geometry is going to end up) of 1:1. Once again, 
most patterns look better at between half and three-quarters of the paper 
scale, so try setting the hatch scale to, say, 0.75. The following steps explain 
how to create annotative hatching:
 
1. Open a drawing containing geometry that forms fully closed boundaries, 
or draw some boundaries by using the drawing commands described 
in Chapters 8 and 9.

318
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 The areas you want to hatch should be completely enclosed. The 
CIRCLE, POLYGON, and RECTANG commands, and the LINE and PLINE 
commands with the Close option, make great hatch boundaries (see 
Chapters 8 and 9 for details).
 
2. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 6.
 
3. Start the HATCH command by typing H and pressing Enter. 
Alternatively, click the Hatch button on the Draw panel of the 
Ribbon’s Home tab.
 
 AutoCAD prompts:
Pick internal point of [Select objects/seTtings]:
 4. 
Type T to select the seTtings option and press Enter.
 
 The Hatch and Gradient dialog box as seen in Figure 15-4 appears.
 
5. Choose Predefined, User Defined, or Custom from the Type drop-down 
list.
 
 Predefined works best for most purposes. See the “Hatch from scratch” 
section, earlier in this chapter, for details.
 
6. If you chose Predefined or Custom in the previous step, select any 
predefined or custom hatch pattern from the Pattern drop-down list or 
the Hatch Pattern button just to the right of it.
 
 If you chose User Defined, you don’t need to choose a pattern.
 
7. Specify an Angle and Scale for the hatch pattern. (Or, if you chose 
User Defined in Step 5, specify Angle and Spacing.)
 
 See the previous section, “Getting it right: Hatch angle and scale,” for 
more information.
 
8. In the Options area of the dialog box, select the Annotative check box.
 
 This time, you’re going to create annotative hatch objects.
 
9. Click the Add: Pick Points button.
 
 The Hatch and Gradient dialog box (temporarily) disappears, and your 
drawing reappears with the following prompt at the command line:
Pick internal point or [Select objects/seTtings]:
 
10. Pick a point inside the boundary of the area you want to hatch.
 
 AutoCAD analyzes the drawing and decides which boundaries to use. 
In a complex drawing, this analysis can take several seconds. AutoCAD 
highlights the boundary that it finds and previews the hatched area.

319
 Chapter 15: Down the Hatch
 
11. Right-click anywhere in the drawing area and choose Enter from the 
menu to indicate that you’re finished selecting points.
 
 AutoCAD hatches the area inside the boundary. If you’ve correctly 
created an annotative hatch object, you see the annotative object 
symbol (the end of a triangular drawing scale) beside the crosshairs if 
you move your crosshairs over the hatch.
 
12. Select the hatch object; then right-click and choose Annotative Object 
Scale➪Add/Delete Scales to assign annotative scales to the hatch object.
 
 The Annotation Object Scale dialog box appears and shows a list of all 
annotative scales assigned to the selected object. In the case of a new 
hatch object, the only scale listed will be the current annotation scale; if 
you’re doing this in a new drawing that will probably be 1:1, the default 
value.
 
13. In the Annotation Object Scale dialog box, click Add.
 
 The Add Scales to Object dialog box appears, displaying a list of all 
drawing scale values stored in the drawing.
 
14. Select the desired scales from the list, holding down the Ctrl key to 
select more than one, and then click OK.
 
 The Annotation Object Scale dialog box reappears, with the scales you 
added displayed in the list box.
 
 Don’t go overboard and select every scale in the list — select only the 
scales you’re likely to use.
 15. 
Click OK.
 
 After you’ve assigned annotative scales to a hatch (or any annotative) 
object, you see a pair of triangular annotative object symbols. Don’t 
worry — although you are seeing double, you’ve done it right!
 
16. Open the Annotation Scale drop-down list on the application or drawing 
status bar and select one of the scales you added to the object.
 
 The annotative hatch objects will change their spacing as you change 
the annotation scale. If you select a scale from the list that you didn’t 
assign to the object in Step 14, the hatch reverts to the default 1:1 scale.
Figure 15-6 shows two versions of the same drawing, dressed up with 
annotative and non-annotative hatch patterns. As the annotation scales 
displayed on the drawing status bars show, the annotative hatches change 
their scale while the non-annotative hatches remain unchanged. Before 
annotative hatching first appeared in AutoCAD 2008, the only way to get the 
effect in these two views was to create two separate layers, one for each 
hatch scale, and hatch the object twice.

Do fence me in: Defining hatch boundaries
After you specify the hatch pattern, angle, and scale you want to use, you 
define the boundary (or boundaries) into which you want to pour that hatch 
pattern in one of two ways:
 ✓ 
Picking points within the area(s) you want hatched
 ✓ 
Selecting objects that surround those areas
The actual operation involved in using either of these options is confusing to 
most people. You’ll probably need a little practice before you get used to it.
The idea behind either definition option is simple when applied to simple 
areas — that is, closed areas with no additional objects inside them. To 
define the hatch boundary for a simple area, do one of these two things:
 ✓ 
Click the Add: Pick Points button in the Hatch and Gradient dialog box 
and then click a point inside the boundary.
 ✓ 
Click the Add: Select Objects button and select one or more objects that 
form a fully closed boundary.

321
 Chapter 15: Down the Hatch
This simple hatching gets more complicated if you have one closed object 
inside another, as in Figure 15-7. The AutoCAD hatch preview and a bit of 
experimentation will clarify all these potentially puzzling permutations.

indicates a

Point inside a simple area

Select a single boundary object

another nested inside

As I warn earlier in this chapter, boundaries must be completely closed before 
AutoCAD will hatch them. That’s one of the reasons you should employ the 
precision techniques from this book whenever you draw or edit objects. If the 
lines surrounding your boundary don’t either meet exactly or cross, AutoCAD 
scolds you with an A Closed Boundary Could Not Be Determined error message.
 
The A Closed Boundary Could Not Be Determined error message means that 
you need to repair lines or other objects so they’re a fully closed boundary. 
Sometimes you can use the FILLET command with a zero fillet radius to force 
two lines to meet exactly. Another possibility is to use grip editing to align 
one endpoint precisely with another. Chapter 10 discusses these two editing 
techniques.
 
AutoCAD 2010 made grip-editing non-associative hatches a breeze — in fact, 
they became easier to manage than associative hatches. AutoCAD 2011 adds 
grip functions that make associative and non-associative hatches easy to edit. 
Hovering your mouse pointer over the new round center grip gives you quick 

322
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
access to changing the hatch origin, angle, and scale, all without running the 
HATCHEDIT command. Don’t be misled by the Stretch option on the right-
click menu though — you can only move a hatch with this option.
Have palette, will hatch
With tool palettes, described in Chapter 2, you can create click-and-drag 
hatch palettes. With a hatch palette, you click a tool (a swatch) and drag into 
an enclosed boundary to hatch the area. If your hatching needs are simple, 
you can create a tool palette for the patterns and scales you often use. See 
hatches, adding to tool palettes in AutoCAD’s online help for more information.
Editing Hatch Objects
Editing an existing hatch pattern is simple once you’re familiar with the 
Ribbon’s Hatch Creation tab. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the hatch object.
 
 AutoCAD opens the Hatch Editor contextual Ribbon tab and displays the 
hatch object’s current settings.
 
2. Make any desired changes and watch the real-time preview as you do. 
When you’re happy, click Close Hatch Editor to keep the changes.
Alternatively, you can use the Properties palette (described in Chapter 6) to 
make most existing hatch pattern changes — by default, AutoCAD opens the 
Properties palette as well as displaying the Hatch Editor tab when you double-
click a hatch object. The Properties palette is especially good for changing 
several hatches at once. And in AutoCAD 2011, you can use the Quick 
Properties panel to do the same thing even more efficiently.
 
Without even opening the Hatch Editor tab, you can make one hatch look 
like another by using the Match Properties button on Clipboard panel of the 
Ribbon’s Home tab.
The multitude of options in the Hatch Creation and Hatch Editor Ribbon tabs 
let you tweak your hatch patterns in all sorts of useful and semi-useful ways. 
You can easily set a new origin point for hatch objects, you can hatch areas 
that are not fully visible on-screen, and you can optionally hatch multiple 
boundaries at one go and have the hatches treated as individual objects.
 
You can find the area of any hatch object by simply selecting the hatch object 
and then opening the Properties palette. The area is listed in the Geometry 
section, near the bottom of the palette.

espite the infinitesimally small number of offices without a computer 
(or two) on every desk, many people still want or need to work with 
either easily readable electronic drawings (can you spell PDF?) or actual, 
dead-tree paper drawings. You may need to give hard-copy prints or PDFs to 
your less savvy colleagues who don’t have AutoCAD. You may want to make 
some quick paper prints to pore over during your bus ride home. You may 
even find that checking drawings the old-fashioned way — with a hard-copy 
print and a red pencil — turns up errors that managed to remain hidden on 
the computer screen.
Whatever the reason, you’ll want to print drawings at some point — probably 
sooner rather than later. Depending on where you are in a project, plotting is 
the pop quiz, mid-term, or final exam of your drawing-making semester. This 
chapter helps you ace the test.
You Say Printing, I Say Plotting
Plotting originally meant creating hard-copy output on a device that was capa-
ble of printing on larger sheets, such as D size or E size (or A1 or A0 for the 
metrically inclined), that measure several feet (or a meter or more) on a side. 
(See Chapter 4 for information about drafting paper sizes.) These plotters 
often used pens to draw, robot-fashion, on large sheets of vellum or drafting 

324
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
film. The sheets could then be run through diazo blueline machines — 
copying machines that create blueline prints — in order to create less-
expensive copies. Printing meant creating hard-copy output on ordinary 
printers that used ordinary-sized paper, such as A size (letter size, 8-1/2 x 
11 inches) or B size (tabloid or ledger size, 11 x 17 inches) — that’s A4 or A3 
for you metric folk.
Nowadays, AutoCAD and most CAD users make no distinction between plot-
ting and printing. AutoCAD veterans usually say “plotting,” so if you want to 
be cool, you can do so, too.
Whatever you call it, plotting an AutoCAD drawing is considerably more 
complicated than printing a word processing document or a spreadsheet. 
CAD has a larger range of different plotters and printers, drawing types, and 
output procedures than other computer applications. AutoCAD tries to help 
you tame the vast jungle of plotting permutations, but you’ll probably find 
that you have to take some time to get the lay of the land and clear a path to 
your desired hard-copy output.
Get with the system
One of the complications you face in your attempts to create a hard copy 
is that AutoCAD has two distinct ways of communicating with your plotters 
and printers. Operating systems, and the programs that run on them, use a 
special piece of software called a printer driver to format data for printing and 
then send it to the printer or plotter. When you configure Windows to recog-
nize a new printer connected to your computer or your network, you’re actu-
ally installing the printer’s driver. AutoCAD, like other Windows programs, 
works with the printers you’ve configured in Windows. AutoCAD calls these 
system printers because they’re part of the Windows operating system.
But AutoCAD, unlike other Windows programs, can’t leave well enough alone. 
Some output devices, especially some larger plotters, aren’t controlled very 
efficiently by Windows system printer drivers. For that reason, AutoCAD 
comes with specialized non-system drivers (that is, drivers that are not 
installed as part of the Windows system) for plotters from companies such 
as Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, and Océ. These drivers ignore the tidy rules for 
communicating with Windows printers in order to get things done a bit more 
quickly and flexibly.
Most of the time, using already-configured Windows system printers is easi-
est, and they work well with many devices — especially devices such as 
laser and inkjet printers that print on smaller paper. However, if you have 
a large format plotter, you may be able to get faster plotting, better plot 
quality, or more plot features by installing a non-system driver. To find out 
more, choose Driver and Peripheral Guide➪Use Plotters and Printers on the 
AutoCAD online help system’s home page.

325
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
Configure it out
For now, you should simply make sure that AutoCAD recognizes the devices 
that you want to use for plotting. The following steps show you how:
 
1. Launch AutoCAD and open an existing drawing or start a new, blank 
drawing.
 
2. Choose Options on the Application Menu, or type OP and press Enter, 
to open the Options dialog box; then click the Plot and Publish tab.
 
3. Click the drop-down arrow to view the list just below the Use as 
Default Output Device option, as shown in Figure 16-1.
 
 The list includes two kinds of device configurations, designated by two 
tiny, difficult-to-distinguish icons to the left of the device names:
 
• A little printer icon with a sheet of white paper coming out the top 
indicates a Windows system printer configuration.
 
• A little plotter-with-legs icon with a piece of paper coming out 
the front indicates a non-system (that is, AutoCAD-specific) 
configuration.
 
 The non-system configuration names always end in .pc3 because 
they’re stored in special AutoCAD Plotter Configuration version 3 
files. So, if you can’t distinguish the difference between the icons, 
look for the .pc3 at the end of the name.
 
4. Verify that the list includes the printers and plotters that you want to 
have available in AutoCAD.
 
 If not, how you add one depends on your operating system:
 
• In Windows XP, choose Start➪Printers and Faxes and click the Add 
a Printer link under Printer Tasks on the left side of the window.
 
• In Windows Vista, choose Start➪Control Panel➪Hardware and 
Sound➪Printers➪Add a Printer, and then click Add a Local Printer.
 
• In Windows 7, choose Start➪Devices and Printers➪Add a Printer, 
and then click Add a Local Printer.
 
 If your printer isn’t in the default Windows list, cancel the wizard and 
hunt down a driver disk that came with your printer, or better yet, 
download the current driver from the printer manufacturer’s Web site.
 
5. Choose the output device that you want to make the default for new 
drawings.
 
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and retain any changes that you 
made in the previous step.

Non-system printers
 
You use the AutoCAD Plotter Manager’s Add-a-Plotter Wizard to create non-
system driver configurations. (Choose Plotter Manager on the Plot panel of the 
Ribbon’s Output tab to display an Explorer window containing a shortcut to 
the wizard.) This wizard is similar to the Windows Add Printer Wizard; if you 
can handle adding an ordinary printer in Windows, you can probably handle 
adding a non-system plotter configuration to AutoCAD. When you complete the 
wizard steps, AutoCAD saves the information in a PC3 (Plotter Configuration 
version 3) file. If you add an HP Designjet printer or certain Océ wide format 
printers, you will be advised by the Add-a-Plotter Wizard to exit and instead 
install the device as a Windows system printer (for more information, choose 
Driver and Peripheral Guide➪Use Plotters and Printers➪Set Up Plotters and 
Printers from the online help system’s home page). Many people find that the 
standard drivers work fine, but as I mention later in this chapter, custom driv-
ers may include additional paper sizes as well as other handy settings.
A Simple Plot
Okay, so you believe me. You know that you’re not going to master AutoCAD 
plotting in five minutes. That doesn’t change the fact that your boss, 
employee, wife, husband, construction foreman, or 11-year-old daughter 
wants a quick check plot of your drawing.

327
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
Plotting success in 16 steps
Here’s the quick, cut-to-the-chase procedure for plotting a simple drawing — a 
mere 16 steps! This procedure assumes that you plot in model space — that 
is, that clicking the Model button on the status bar shows you the drawing 
in a way that you want to plot. (I cover plotting paper space layout tabs in 
the section “Plotting the Layout of the Land,” later in this chapter.) This pro-
cedure doesn’t deal with controlling plotted lineweights — see the “Plotting 
Lineweights and Colors” section, later in this chapter, for those details. It 
should, however, result in a piece of paper that bears some resemblance to 
what AutoCAD displays on your computer monitor.
Follow these steps to make a simple, not-to-scale, monochrome (black-and-
white) plot of a drawing:
 
1. Open the drawing in AutoCAD.
 
 
2. Click Model (not the MODEL/PAPER button) on the status bar to 
ensure that you’re plotting the model space contents. If you have the 
Model and Layout tabs displayed, rather than the status bar buttons, 
click the Model tab.
 
 I explain model space and paper space in Chapters 4 and 5, and how to 
plot paper space layouts in the section “Plotting the Layout of the Land,” 
later in this chapter.
 
3. Zoom to the drawing’s current extents; click the Zoom Extents button 
on the Navigation bar (if necessary, click the tiny down-arrow below 
the Zoom button and choose Zoom Extents from the menu). Or, type Z, 
press Enter, then type E and press Enter again.
 
 The extents of a drawing consist of a rectangular area just large enough 
to include all the objects in the drawing.
 
 
4. To display the Plot dialog box, click the Plot button on the Quick 
Access toolbar.
 
 
 The Plot dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-2.
 
5. In the Printer/Plotter area, select a device from the Name drop-down 
list.
 
6. In the Paper Size area, select a paper size that’s loaded in your printer 
or plotter.
 
 Make sure that the paper size is large enough to fit the drawing at the 
scale at which you want to plot it. For example, if you want to plot a 
D-size drawing, but you have only a B-size printer, you’re out of luck — 
unless you resort to multiple pieces of paper and lots of tape.

328

dialog box.
 
More Options button
 
7. In the Plot Area area (sponsored by the Department of Redundancy 
Department), select Extents from the What to Plot drop-down list.
 
 If you set your drawing limits as I demonstrate in Chapter 3, you can 
select Limits instead to plot the drawing area that you defined. The 
Window option — that is, plot a window whose corners you pick — is 
useful when you want to plot just a portion of your drawing.
 
8. In the Plot Offset (Origin Set to Printable Area) area, select the Center 
the Plot check box.
 
 Alternatively, you can specify offsets of zero or other amounts in order 
to position the plot at a specific location on the paper.
 
9. In the Plot Scale area, either select the Fit to Paper check box or dese-
lect Fit to Paper and specify a scale (by choosing from the drop-down 
list or typing into the two text boxes).
 
 For most real plotting, you’ll plot to a specific scale, but feel free to 
select the Fit to Paper check box for now. If you do want to plot to a spe-
cific scale, see the “Instead of fit, scale it” section later in this chapter 
for guidance.
 
10. Click the More Options button (at the bottom-right corner of the dialog 
box, next to the Help button).
 
 The Plot dialog box reveals additional settings, as shown in Figure 16-3.

329
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
 
Figure 16-3: 
The 
expanded 
Plot dialog 
box.
 
 
11. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area, choose monochrome.
ctb or monochrome.stb from the drop-down list.
 
 AutoCAD may ask you if you want to “Assign this plot style table to all lay-
outs?” Answer Yes to make monochrome.ctb (or monochrome.stb) the 
default plot style table for the paper space layout tabs as well as the Model 
tab, or answer No to make the change apply only to the current tab.
 
 The “Plotting with style” section, later in this chapter, describes plot 
style tables.
 
12. In the Plot Options area, make sure that the Plot with Plot Styles 
check box is selected and that the Save Changes to Layout check box 
is deselected, as shown in Figure 16-3.
 
 Leaving the Save Changes to Layout check box deselected tells AutoCAD to 
use any plot settings changes that you make only for this plot — AutoCAD 
will revert to the original plot settings the next time you plot the drawing.
 
 After you become confident with plotting, you may want to select this 
check box so that AutoCAD does save your plotting settings changes as 
the default. Alternatively, click the Apply to Layout button to make the 
current plot settings the default for future plotting of this tab (that is, 
the Model tab) in this drawing.
 
13. In the Drawing Orientation area, choose Portrait or Landscape.
 
 The icon (the letter A on a sheet) in the lower-right corner may help you 
decide on the right orientation. If not, the full preview in the next step 
will tell you for sure.
 
14. Click the Preview button and check that the drawing displays on the 
paper at the correct orientation and size, as shown in Figure 16-4; then 
right-click and choose Exit to return to the Plot dialog box.

330
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
Figure 16-4: 
A preview of 
coming plot-
tractions.
 
 
15. If you found any problems in the preview, adjust the plot settings (for 
example, Plot Area, Plot Scale, or Drawing Orientation) and repeat the 
preview until the plot looks right.
 
16. Click OK to create the plot.
 
 When AutoCAD finishes generating and sending the plot, it displays a 
Plot and Publish Job Complete balloon notification from the status bar. 
If you decide that you don’t want to see these notifications, right-click 
the Plot/Publish Details Report Available icon near the right end of the 
status bar and deselect Enable Balloon Notification.
There — 16 steps, as promised. If for some reason your plot didn’t work, well, I 
warned you that AutoCAD plotting was complicated and temperamental! Read 
the rest of this chapter for all the details about the numerous other plotting 
options that can cause plotting to go awry. If you’re in a big hurry, turn directly 
to the troubleshooting section, “Troubles with Plotting,” later in this chapter.
Preview one, two
One of the keys to efficient plotting is liberal use of AutoCAD’s preview fea-
ture. (To maintain political balance, I recommend conservative use of some 
other AutoCAD options elsewhere in the book.)

331
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
The postage stamp–sized partial preview in the middle of the Plot dialog box 
is a quick reality check to make sure your plot fits on the paper and is turned 
in the right direction. If the plot area at the current scale is too large for the 
paper, AutoCAD displays thick red warning lines along the side(s) of the 
sheet where the drawing will be truncated.
Click the Preview button to see a full preview in a separate window. You see 
exactly how your drawing lays out on the paper and how the various line-
weights, colors, and other object plot properties will appear. You can zoom 
and pan around the preview by using the right-click menu. (Any zooming or 
panning that you do won’t affect what area of the drawing gets plotted — 
zooming and panning is just a way to get a better look at different areas of the 
plot preview.)
Instead of fit, scale it
In most real plotting situations, you want to plot to a specific scale rather 
than let AutoCAD choose an oddball scale that just happens to maximize the 
drawing on the paper. And if you’re going to plot the Model tab of a draw-
ing to scale, you need to know its drawing scale factor. Chapter 4 describes 
setup concepts, and Chapter 13 provides some tips for determining the scale 
factor of a drawing that someone else created.
If your drawing was created at a standard scale, such as 1:50 or 1/4" = 1'–0", 
then you simply choose the scale from the handy Scale drop-down list in the 
Plot dialog box. If your scale isn’t in the list, type the ratio between plotted 
distance and AutoCAD drawing distance into the two text boxes below the 
Scale drop-down list, as shown in Figure 16-5. The easiest way to express the 
ratio usually is to type 1 in the upper box and the drawing scale factor in the 
lower box. (See Chapter 4 for more information.)
 
Your CAD manager may have added uncommon scales or removed scales 
from the Scale drop-down list that your company never uses. If you’re design-
ing espresso machines in Milano, for example, you’ll probably never need to 
plot your drawings at 1/128" = 1'–0".
Creating half-size plots for some purposes is common in some industries. To 
plot model space half-size, double the drawing scale factor. For example, a 
1/8” = 1’–0” drawing has a drawing scale factor of 96, which is equivalent to a 
plot scale of 1 = 96. To make a half-size model space plot of it, specify a plot 
scale of 1 = 192 (or choose 1/16” = 1’–0” from the Scale drop-down list).
 
Even if you work with drawings that are created to be plotted at a specific 
scale, plotting with a Fit to Paper scale may be the most efficient way to make 
a reduced-size check plot. For example, drafters in your office might create 
drawings that get plotted on D-size sheets (24 x 36 inches), whereas you have 
access to a laser printer with a B-size (11 x 17 inches) paper tray. By plotting 

332
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
the D-size drawings scaled to fit on B-size paper, you end up with check plots 
that are slightly smaller than half size. You won’t be able to measure distances 
on the check plots with a scale, but you can give them a visual check for over-
all correctness.

Plotting the Layout of the Land
In the section “Plotting success in 16 steps,” earlier in this chapter, I show 
you how to plot the model space representation of your drawing by making 
sure that the Model tab is active when you open the Plot dialog box. In most 
industries, however, model space plotting went the way of the dodo 20 years 
ago. Paper space gives you many additional options for controlling the look 
of your output without having to modify the underlying geometry. So most of 
the time, you will want to plot a paper space layout instead.
 
Paper space is the environment that’s specifically designed for outputting 
hard copy of your drawings. If you need a refresher on paper space or layouts, 
have another look (or a first look!) at Chapter 5.

333
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
The path to paper space 
layout plotting success
As I explain in Chapter 5, AutoCAD gives you two alternative ways of switch-
ing between full-screen model space and the paper space layouts stored in 
the drawing. If you choose to display the Model and Layout tabs, you simply 
click the appropriate tab to select the one you want. If instead you hide the 
Model and Layout tabs, use the Model and Layout buttons, plus Quick View 
Layouts, on the status bar. For the complete lowdown on using Quick View 
Layouts, refer to Chapter 5. In this section, I explain using this feature to print 
your paper space layouts.
Plotting a paper space layout is pretty much like plotting model space except 
that you need to find the appropriate layout first and make sure that its tab is 
selected before you open the Plot dialog box, as follows:
 
 
1. Click Quick View Layouts on the status bar and scroll through the 
image panel.
 
 
 The Quick View image panel opens in the lower part of the drawing area 
and displays a preview panel of model space and each layout stored in 
the drawing.
 
2. Move your mouse pointer across the images in the Quick View panel 
and pause over the image of the layout you want to plot.
 
 As you move your mouse over each image, icons appear: Publish at the 
upper-right corner and Plot at the upper left. I describe the PUBLISH 
command briefly in Chapter 20. In this chapter, I’m sticking with PLOT.
 
3. Click the Plot button in the upper-left corner of the image panel of the 
layout you want to plot.
 
 The Plot dialog box appears with the name of the layout to be plotted 
displayed in the title bar. (In Figure 16-6, I’m plotting a layout named 
D-Size Layout.)
 
 If no one has set up a layout yet, AutoCAD creates a default layout. (If 
the Show Page Setup Manager for New Layouts setting on the Display 
tab of the Options dialog box is turned on, you’ll see the Page Setup 
Manager dialog box first — just click the Close button.) The default 
layout probably won’t be useful for real projects, but you can use it 
to find out about the layout plotting procedure. Refer to Chapter 5 for 
instructions on creating a real layout.
 
4. Specify a Printer/Plotter Name and a Paper Size.
 
 If you don’t have a printer capable of outputting larger than letter- or 
tabloid-sized sheets, you can still experiment by selecting a device that 
outputs to file, such as DWG To PDF.pc3.

334
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
5. In the What to Plot drop-down list, choose Layout, as shown in 
Figure 16-6.
 
 The Layout option is available only when plotting a layout tab; Limits is 
available only when plotting the Model tab.
 
6. Specify the Plot Offset (such as 0 in both the X and Y directions).
 
 Specifying the Plot Offset as 0 in both X and Y directions places the 
lower-left corner of the plotted drawing at the lower-left corner of the 
printable area.
 
7. In the Plot Scale area, select 1:1 from the Scale drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 16-6.
 
 One of the big advantages of layouts is that you don’t need to know 
anything about drawing scale in order to plot the drawing — hence the 
name paper space. Figure 16-6 shows the proper settings for plotting a 
layout.
 
Figure 16-6: 
Settings for 
plotting a 
paper space 
layout.
 
 
 To create a half-size plot of a layout, select 1:2 from the Scale drop-down 
list. In addition, select the Scale Lineweights check box (click the More 
Options button if necessary) in order to reduce lineweights proportion-
ally. (I cover plotting lineweights in the next section.)

335
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
 
 If you find that the layout is too big for your plotter’s largest paper size 
at a plot scale of 1:1, you can select Extents from the What to Plot drop-
down list and then select the Fit to Paper check box in the Plot Scale 
area. Alternatively, you can close the Plot dialog box and fix the problem 
if you want to have a paper space layout that permanently reflects a new 
paper size. Use the Page Setup dialog box to modify the layout settings, 
or copy the layout and modify the new copy.
 
8. Click the More Options button and change any additional plot options 
that you want to.
 
 Refer to Steps 11 through 13 in the earlier section, “Plotting success in 
16 steps.”
 
9. Click the Preview button, ensure that the drawing displays on the 
paper at the correct orientation and size, and then right-click and 
choose Exit to return to the Plot dialog box.
 
 If you found any problems in the preview, change your plot settings and 
preview again until it looks right.
 
10. Click OK to create the plot.
Plotting Lineweights and Colors
In previous sections of this chapter, I help you gain some plotting confidence. 
Those sections show you how to create scaled, monochrome plots with 
uniform lineweights in model space or paper space. Those skills may be all 
you need, but if you care about controlling plotted lineweights and colors or 
adding special effects such as screening (plotting shades of gray), read on.
Plotting with style
Plot styles provide a way to override object properties with alternative plot 
properties. (See Chapter 6 for information about object properties.) The 
properties include plotted lineweight, plotted color, and screening (plotting 
shades of gray). Figure 16-7 shows the full range of options. Plot styles come 
in two exciting flavors:
 ✓ 
Color-dependent plot styles
 ✓ 
Named plot styles
Color-dependent plot styles are based on the standard way of plotting in ear-
lier versions of AutoCAD (before AutoCAD 2000), whereas named plot styles 
provide a newer way.

336
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
Figure 16-7: 
Editing 
a color-
dependent 
plot style 
table.
 
It’s remotely possible that you won’t need to bother with plot styles. If the 
drawings you want to plot have layer and object properties (especially line-
weight) that reflect how you want objects to plot, you can dispense with plot 
styles. But most people and most drawings use plot styles, so you should at 
least be familiar with them.
A couple of common reasons for using plot styles are to
 ✓ 
Map screen colors to plotted lineweights. If this idea seems completely 
loony to you, try to suspend judgment until you’ve read the “Plotting 
through thick and thin” section, a bit later in this chapter.
 ✓ 
Create screened lines on monochrome plots. Lines that are screened 
display in various shades of gray, not black. Drafters sometimes use 
screened lines to de-emphasize secondary objects that otherwise would 
overwhelm the main objects in the drawing. Screening is expressed as 
a percentage, with 100 percent being completely black and 0 percent 
being invisible.
Using plot styles
If you want objects in your drawing to plot with properties that differ from 
their display properties, you need plot styles. For example, you can plot with 
different lineweights or colors from the ones you’re using for display pur-
poses. Or, as I mention in the preceding section, you may need to map dis-
play colors to plotted lineweights. AutoCAD groups plot styles into plot style 
tables, each of which is stored in a separate file.

337
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
Color-based plot styles live in color-dependent plot style table (CTB) files, and 
they map the 255 AutoCAD display colors to 255 plot styles. AutoCAD auto-
matically attaches the color-dependent plot styles to every object, based 
on — you guessed it — the object’s color. (Are those AutoCAD programmers 
brilliant, or what?) Color-dependent plot style tables mimic the old color-
mapped-to-lineweight plotting approach of AutoCAD R14 and earlier releases; 
this remains the most common method in most companies.
Named plot styles were introduced in AutoCAD 2000, and are object prop-
erties, just like color, linetype, and lineweight. Named plot styles live in 
(wouldn’t you know it?) named plot style table (STB) files. After you’ve cre-
ated a named plot style table, you create one or more plot styles and give 
them any names you like. Then you can assign the named plot styles to 
layers or to individual objects. (See Chapter 6 for more information about 
object and layer properties.)
To use the plot styles in a plot style table (whether they’re color-dependent 
or named), you must attach the plot style table to model space or a paper 
space layout. The attached plot style table affects plotting only for that 
layout or for model space. This approach lets you plot the same drawing in 
different ways by attaching different plot styles to different tabs.
You can attach a plot style to model space or a paper space layout by select-
ing its image in the Quick View Layouts panel and opening the Plot dialog 
box, or by right-clicking over an image and choosing Page Setup Manager, 
then clicking the Modify button. Choose the plot style table name in the Plot 
Style Table (Pen Assignments) area of the expanded Page Setup or Plot dialog 
box. See the section “Controlling plotted lineweights with screen colors,” 
later in this chapter, for an example.
 
When you start a new drawing in the usual way — that is, by using a template 
drawing (see Chapter 4) — the template drawing’s plot style behavior deter-
mines whether you can choose CTB or STB files. If you want to change from 
color-dependent plot styles to named plot styles (or vice versa) in a particular 
drawing, use the CONVERTPSTYLES command.
Creating plot styles
If you’re lucky, someone will provide you with the plot files you need. If that’s 
the case, you must put the CTB or STB files in your Plot Styles folder in order 
for AutoCAD to recognize them. (To find the location of your Plot Styles 
folder, open the Options dialog box, choose the Files tab, and look for the 
Printer Support File Path➪Plot Style Table Search Path setting.)
If you’re not lucky, you’ll need to be smart — that is, you’ll want to know how 
to create your own plot style table files. Here’s how:

Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
 
1. Click the Application button to open the Application Menu, choose 
Print, and then choose Manage Plot Styles.
 
 
 The Plot Styles folder opens in a separate Windows Explorer window.
 
2. Double-click the Add-a-Plot Style Table Wizard program shortcut.
 
3. Read the opening screen and then click Next.
 
4. On the Add Plot Style Table – Begin page, choose the Start from 
Scratch option or one of the other three options if you want to start 
with settings from another file. Then click Next.
 
 The remaining steps in this procedure assume that you chose Start from 
Scratch. If you chose another option, simply follow the wizard’s prompts.
 
 If the creator of a drawing provides you with an AutoCAD R14/AutoCAD 
LT 98 PC2 (version 2) or AutoCAD R12/AutoCAD LT 95 PCP (version 
1) file, choose the Use a PCP or PC2 File option. With this option, the 
wizard imports color-to-plotted-lineweight settings automatically.
 
5. On the Add Plot Style Table – Pick Plot Style Table page, choose 
whether you want to create a color-dependent plot style table (CTB 
file) or a named plot style table (STB file). Then click Next.
 
 Choose Color-Dependent Plot Style Table in order to map screen colors 
to plotted lineweights. Choose Named Plot Style Table in order to create 
named plot styles that you can apply to layers or objects.
 
6. On the Add Plot Style Table – File Name page, type a name for the 
new CTB or STB file and then click Next.
 
7. Click the Plot Style Table Editor button on the Add Plot Style Table – 
Finish page.
 
 The Plot Style Table Editor dialog box opens to the Form View tab if 
you’re creating a color-dependent plot style table (refer to Figure 16-7), 
or to the Table View tab if you create a named plot style table.
 
 If you choose a named plot style in Step 5, the Plot Style Table Editor 
dialog box opens in Table View, with one plot style named Normal in the 
first data column, a blank column to its right, and Add Style and Delete 
Style buttons at the bottom. New named plot styles that you create con-
tinue to be added in columns to the right of the previous column. For 
more information, click the Help button in the Plot Style Table Editor.
 
8. If you created a color-dependent plot style table, assign Lineweight, 
Screening, or other plot properties to each color that’s used in the 
drawing. If you created a named plot style table, click the Add Style 
button and then assign plot properties to each of the named styles that 
you create.
 
 To determine which colors are used in a drawing, switch to the AutoCAD 
window and open the Layer Properties Manager palette by clicking the 
Layer Properties button located on the Layers panel of the Ribbon’s 
Home tab.

339
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
 
 To change a setting for all colors or named styles, select them all first by 
clicking the first color or named style, holding down the Shift key, scroll-
ing to the end of the list, and then clicking the last color or named style. 
Any subsequent changes you make get applied to all the selected colors 
or named styles.
 
9. Click the Save & Close button to close the Plot Style Table Editor 
dialog box. Then click Finish to complete the steps for the wizard.
 
 The Plot Styles folder now displays your new CTB or STB file.
 
10. Close the Plot Styles folder by clicking the X in its title bar.
Creating your first plot style table can be a harrowing experience because 
you have so many options. Just remember that your most likely reason for 
creating one is to map screen colors to plotted lineweights (as I describe in 
greater detail in the next section). Also remember that you may be able to 
minimize your effort by getting a CTB or STB file from the person who cre-
ated the drawing that you want to plot.
 
In Chapter 6, I recommend that you limit yourself to the first nine Standard 
AutoCAD Colors when defining layers, and not a patchwork of the 255 colors 
that AutoCAD makes available. If you follow my advice, your work to create 
a color-dependent plot style table will be much reduced because you’ll have 
to assign plot properties for only 9 colors, rather than worrying about 255 of 
them.
 
For systematic testing of your CTB files, you can download the file named 
plot_screening_and_fill_patterns.dwg from www.autodesk.com/
autocad-samples (LT users, feel free to help yourselves to this file too — 
it’s not included with the downloads at www.autodesk.com/autocadlt-
samples). This drawing shows an array of color swatches for all 255 AutoCAD 
colors. The layouts (such as Grayscale and Screening 25%) demonstrate how 
different CTB files attached to the same layout produce radically different 
results.
 
Named plot styles hold a lot of promise, but there are at least a couple of 
places — dimensions and tables — where they don’t work as well as tradi-
tional color-based plotting. Dimension properties allow you to assign differ-
ent colors to dimension lines, extension lines, and text. The purpose for this 
is to allow different parts of a dimension object to print with different line-
weights; for example, you can have your dimension text print with a medium 
lineweight, the same as your annotation text, while keeping extension and 
dimension lines to a fine lineweight. But because named plot styles are based 
on objects or layers, you don’t have that lineweight control over individual 
dimension components. The same limitation applies to tables, where you can 
set your text to be one color and your grid lines to be another.

340
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
If you really get carried away and decide to take advantage of the 16 million-
odd colors in AutoCAD’s True Color or Color Book modes, you’re not going 
to be controlling lineweights with color-dependent plot styles. CTB plot 
styles affect the lineweights only of objects that use the traditional 255 colors 
of the AutoCAD Color Index set. If you want True Color or Color Book colors, 
use object lineweights or named plot styles to control plotted lineweight.
Plotting through thick and thin
Long ago, manual drafters developed the practice of drawing lines of different 
thicknesses, or lineweights, in order to distinguish different kinds of objects. 
Manual drafters did it with different technical ink pen nib diameters or with 
different hardnesses of pencil lead and varying degrees of pressure on the 
pencil. Because a computer mouse usually doesn’t come with different diam-
eters of mouse balls, the AutoCAD developers had to figure out how to let 
users indicate lineweights on-screen and on a plot. They came up with two 
different ways to indicate lineweight:
 ✓ 
Mapping on-screen colors to plotted lineweights. I describe this 
common approach in Chapter 6.
 ✓ 
Displaying lineweights on-screen to match what the user can expect to 
see on the plot. This approach first appeared in AutoCAD 2000.
Plotting with plodders
Color-as-color and lineweight-as-lineweight  
seem like great ideas, but Autodesk knew when 
it added object lineweights back in 1999 that 
longtime users of AutoCAD weren’t going to  
abandon the old colors-mapped-to-lineweights 
approach overnight. Thus, you can still control  
plotted lineweight by display color in AutoCAD.
AutoCAD veterans, by and large, have chosen 
to stick with the old way for now. They’ve done 
so for a variety of reasons, including inertia, 
plotting procedures and drawings built around  
the old way, third-party applications that don’t 
fully support the newer methods, and the
 
need to exchange drawings with clients and 
subcontractors who haven’t upgraded. In
 
summary, the ripple effect of those who need 
to or want to continue using colors-mapped-
to-lineweights is lasting a long time. Don’t be 
surprised if you find yourself going with the flow 
for a while.
The default setting in AutoCAD 2011 is to
 
plot object lineweights, so that’s the easiest  
method if you don’t have to consider the histori-
cal practices or predilections of other people 
with whom you exchange drawings. Mapping 
screen colors to lineweights requires some ini-
tial work on your part, but after you’ve set up 
the mapping scheme, the additional effort is  
minimal.

341
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
Controlling plotted lineweights with object lineweights
Plotting object lineweights is trivial, assuming that the person who created 
the drawing first took the trouble to assign a lineweight property to layers 
or objects (see Chapter 6 for details). Just make sure that the Plot Object 
Lineweights check box in the expanded Plot dialog box is selected. You may 
also want to deselect the Plot with Plot Styles check box because plot styles 
can override the object lineweights with different plotted lineweights. You 
can also make these settings in the Page Setup dialog box for the appropriate 
Layout or Model tab. To access the Page Setup Manager, right-click the Quick 
View Layouts button on the status bar and choose Page Setup Manager.
 
If you want object lineweights to control plotted lineweights, make sure that 
the Plot Object Lineweights check box is selected in the Plot Options area 
of the Plot or Page Setup dialog box. If you don’t want to plot the lineweights 
assigned to objects, you must deselect both the Plot Object Lineweights 
and Plot with Plot Styles check boxes in the Plot or Page Setup dialog box. 
Selecting Plot with Plot Styles selects Plot Object Lineweights as well.
Controlling plotted lineweights with screen colors
To map screen colors to plotted lineweights, you need a color-dependent 
plot style table (CTB file), as I describe in the section “Plotting with style,” 
earlier in this chapter. If you’re plotting a drawing created by someone else, 
that someone else may be able to supply you with the appropriate CTB file 
or, at least, with a PCP or PC2 file from which you can create the CTB file 
quickly. At the very least, the creator of the drawing should be able to give 
you a printed chart showing which plotted lineweight to assign to each 
AutoCAD screen color. Use the instructions in the “Plotting with style” sec-
tion to copy or create the required CTB file.
 
Unfortunately, no industry-wide standards exist for mapping screen colors to 
plotted lineweights. Different offices do it differently. That’s why it’s so useful 
to receive a CTB, PCP, or PC2 file with drawings that someone sends you.
After you have the appropriate CTB file stored in your Plot Styles folder, 
follow these steps to use it:
 
 
1. Click the Quick View Layouts button on the status bar to open the 
Quick View Layouts panel. Move the mouse pointer to the image of 
model space or the layout that you want to plot.
 
 As you move the pointer over each image panel, icons for the PLOT and 
PUBLISH commands appear at the upper corners.
 
2. Click the Plot button in the upper-left corner of the selected image.
 
 The Plot dialog box opens. Click the More Options button if the dialog 
box doesn’t open in Expanded mode, as shown in Figure 16-8.

342
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
3. In the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area on the Plot dialog box, 
select the CTB file from the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 16-8.
 
 This action attaches the plot style table (CTB file) to the Layout or 
Model tab that you clicked in Step 1.
 
Figure 16-8: 
Selecting 
a plot 
style table 
that maps 
screen 
colors to 
plotted line-
weights.
 
 
4. Click the Apply to Layout button.
 
 AutoCAD records the plot setting change with the current layout’s con-
figuration information. Assuming that you save the drawing, AutoCAD 
uses the CTB that you selected as the default plot style when you (or 
other people) plot that layout in the future.
 
5. Continue with the plotting procedures described earlier in this chapter.
If your drawing uses a named plot style table instead of a color-dependent 
plot style table, you follow the same procedure, except that you select an 
STB file instead of a CTB file in Step 3.
 
You can tell whether the current drawing was set up to use color-dependent 
plot styles or named plot styles by looking at the Properties panel on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab. If the upper-right drop-down list is grayed out, shows 
ByColor, and doesn’t display a tooltip, the drawing uses color-dependent plot 
styles. If this list isn’t grayed out and displays the Plot Style tooltip, the draw-
ing uses named plot styles.

343
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
Plotting in color
Plotting the colors that you see on-screen requires no special tricks. In the 
absence of a plot style table (that is, if you selected None from the drop-
down list in the Plot Style Table [Pen Assignments] area in the Plot or Page 
Setup dialog box), AutoCAD sends color information as it appears on-screen 
to the plotter. As long as your output device can plot in color, what you see 
should be what you get.
If you attach a plot style table to the layout that you’re plotting (as described 
in the previous section), you can — if you really want to — map screen 
colors to different plotted colors. In most cases, you don’t want that kind of 
confusion. Instead, leave the Color property in the plot style table set to Use 
Object Color.
When in doubt, send it out
Whether you plot to scale or not, with differ-
ent lineweights or not, in color or not, consider  
using a service bureau for some of your plot-
ting. In-house plotting on your office’s output 
devices is great for small check plots on faster  
laser or inkjet printers. Large-format plotting, 
on the other hand, can be slow and time con-
suming. If you need to plot lots of drawings, you 
may find yourself spending an afternoon load-
ing paper, replenishing ink cartridges, and trim-
ming sheets.
Good plotting service bureaus have big, fast, 
expensive plotters that you can only dream
 
about owning. Also, they’re responsible for bab-
ysitting those fancy devices, feeding them, and 
fixing them. As a bonus, service bureaus can 
make blueline prints from your plots if you need 
to distribute hard-copy sets to other people.
The only downside is that you need to coor-
dinate with a service bureau to make sure it 
gets what it needs from you and can deliver the 
kinds of plots you need. Some service bureaus  
plot directly from your DWG files, while others 
ask you to make PLT (plot) files. Some service 
bureaus specialize in color plotting, while
 
others are more comfortable with monochrome 
plotting and making blueline copies.
When you’re choosing a service bureau, look 
for one that traditionally has served draft-
ers, architects, and engineers. These service 
bureaus tend to be more knowledgeable about 
AutoCAD, and they should have more plotting 
expertise than the desktop publishing, printing, 
and copying shops.
Whomever you choose, do some test plots well 
before the day that important set of drawings is 
due. Talk to the plotting people and get a copy  
of their plotting instructions. Have the service 
bureau create some plots of a couple of your 
typical drawings and make sure they look the 
way you want them to.
If you do lots of plotting with a service bureau,  
look into whether you can charge it to your
 
clients as an expense (just like bluelines or
 
copying).

344
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
If your goal is not to plot color, make sure that you set the Color property for 
all plot styles to Black. If you try to plot colors on a monochrome device, you 
may find that objects appear in various shades of gray, with lighter colors 
mapped to lighter shades of gray and darker colors to darker shades of gray. 
This process of mapping colors to shades of gray is called dithering, and it usu-
ally is not what you want in a CAD drawing. To override it, use the Plot Style 
Table Editor, as described in the section “Creating plot styles,” earlier in this 
chapter, to set the Color option for all colors to Black. (The default setting is 
Use Object Color.) If you don’t already have a plot style table that you want to 
use, select monochrome.ctb for color-based plot styles or select mono-
chrome.stb for named plot styles — both of which come with AutoCAD — 
from the drop-down list in the Plot Style Table (Pen Assignments) area of the 
Plot dialog box.
 
To see the full range of AutoCAD colors available on your plotter, or to see 
how a particular plot style table affects plotting, open and then plot the 
sample file plot_screening_and_fill_patterns.dwg which you can 
download from www.autodesk.com/autocad-samples. The Screening 
100% layout in this drawing contains color swatches for all 255 AutoCAD 
colors (and this file is available to AutoCAD LT users as well).
It’s a (Page) Setup!
Page setups specify the plotter, paper size, and other plot settings that you 
use to plot a particular layout or the model space of a drawing. AutoCAD 
maintains separate page setups for model space and for each paper space 
layout. When you click the Apply to Layout button in the Plot dialog box 
(or select the Save Changes to Layout check box and then click OK to plot), 
AutoCAD stores the current plot settings as the page setup for the current 
layout.
You can also give page setups names and save them. The advantage of doing 
so is that you can switch quickly between different plot settings and copy 
plot settings from one drawing layout to another. Named page setups are 
stored with each drawing, but you can copy them from another drawing into 
the current one with the Page Setup Manager dialog box (described later in 
this section).
If you want to get fancier, you can create named page setups in order to plot 
the same layout (or model space) in different ways, or to copy plot settings 
from one layout to another or one drawing to another. Click the Add button 
in the Page Setup area of the Plot dialog box to create a named page setup 
from the current plot settings. After you create a named page setup, you can 
restore its plot settings by choosing it from the Page Setup Name drop-down 
list.

345
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
For even greater control, right-click Quick View Layouts on the status bar and 
choose Page Setup Manager to create, change, and copy page setups. In the 
Page Setup Manager dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-9, you can create new 
page setups and modify existing ones. Click the Modify button to open the 
Page Setup dialog box, which is almost identical to the Plot dialog box. The 
primary difference is that you’re changing plot settings rather than actually 
plotting. The Set Current button copies the page setup that you’ve selected 
on the Page Setups list to the current layout tab. With the Import button, you 
can copy a layout from another drawing or drawing template (DWT) file.

Continuing the Plot Dialog
In previous sections of this chapter, I cover most of the important options in 
the Plot dialog box. This section reveals a few more fine points that will make 
your plotting life easier. I don’t cover every minute, obscure, useful-only-at-
cocktail-party-discussions detail. (And if this sounds like your kind of cocktail 
party, remind me that I’m busy that night!) I do point out some occasionally 
useful options that will increase your vocabulary when you’re communicat-
ing with the Plot dialog box.
 
Use the Plot dialog box’s tooltips to find out more about any part of the 
dialog box:
 
1. Hover your mouse pointer over the part of the dialog box that you want 
to know more about.

346
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 
2. Press F1 or click the Help button at the bottom of the dialog box if the 
pop-up help isn’t enough.
 
3. For a more conceptual take on plotting, click the Learn about Plotting 
link to view the Quick Start to Plotting section of the online help.
The following list explains most of the remaining controls, check boxes, and 
lists in the Plot dialog box:
 ✓ 
Printer/Plotter: As I describe in the section “Configure it out,” earlier 
in this chapter, you use the Name drop-down list to select the Windows 
system printer or non-system driver configuration that you want to use 
for plotting.
 
 Clicking the Properties button opens the Plotter Configuration Editor 
dialog box, with which you can change media (type of paper) and other 
properties that are unique to the currently selected plotter or printer. In 
particular, you can define custom paper sizes.
 
 As if AutoCAD’s Plot dialog box settings weren’t overwhelming enough, 
depending on your plot device, you may also have to deal with the 
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box. Some plotter drivers hide impor-
tant settings in this dialog box. To access them, you typically click the 
Custom Properties button near the bottom of the Plotter Configuration 
Editor dialog box. For example, if you’re using the enhanced Windows 
system driver for HP plotters, available at www.designjet.hp.com, 
you can click the Custom Properties button and then the More Sizes 
button to specify which paper sizes are available to you on the Paper 
Size drop-down list of the main Plot dialog box.
 
 To make matters even more confusing, if you make any changes in the 
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box, AutoCAD prompts you to save 
the changes to a separate PC3 file. You should choose Save Changes 
to the Following File (that is, create a new AutoCAD-specific configura-
tion that includes the revised settings) and type a configuration name 
that you’ll recognize later. When you want to plot with custom settings, 
remember to choose the AutoCAD-specific PC3 configuration near the 
end of the Printer/Plotter Name drop-down list, and not the original 
Windows system printer configuration near the beginning of the list.
 ✓ 
Plot to File: If you need to plot to a file, rather than directly to your plot-
ter or network printer queue, select the Plot to File option. When you 
click OK to plot, AutoCAD asks you for a plot filename and location. You 
may need to use this option to create files to send to a plotting service 
bureau.
 
 AutoCAD 2009 added DWFx to its ePlot options. DWFx is a flavored ver-
sion of DWF that conforms to Microsoft’s XPS page description language. 

347
 Chapter 16: The Plot Thickens
For most people, the handiest thing about this format is that if you plot 
to DWFx, the resulting file can be displayed — in Windows Vista and 
later — in Windows Explorer.
 
 Plotting to the DWG to PDF.pc3 file creates versions of your drawing 
files that can be opened and viewed in the free and widely available 
Adobe Reader software.
 ✓ 
Plot Stamp On: Use this option to turn on and off and configure the 
contents of a text string that AutoCAD adds automatically to the corner 
of each plot. The plot stamp can include useful information, such as the 
drawing filename and plot date and time.
 ✓ 
Plot Area: Specify the area of the drawing to plot. Your choices include 
Display, Extents, and Window, regardless of whether you’re plotting a 
paper space layout or model space. If you defined named views in the 
drawing, AutoCAD adds a View option. The additional choice is Layout 
for a paper space layout or Limits for model space.
 • 
Display: The drawing as it’s currently displayed in the drawing 
window (including any empty space around the drawing objects).
 • 
Extents: The rectangular area containing all the objects in the 
drawing.
 • 
Limits (full-screen model space only): The model space area that 
you may or may not have specified when you set up the drawing. If 
you did not specifically set your drawing’s limits (as I demonstrate 
in Chapter 3), then plotting limits will give unpredictable results. 
Use one of the other options instead.
 • 
Layout (Layouts only): The paper space area you defined when you 
set up the layout.
 • 
Window: A rectangular area that you specify.
 • 
View: A named view which you select from a drop-down list. 
(Chapter 12 describes named views and how to create them.)
 
 Usually, you’ll choose to plot Layout in paper space. For model space, 
the choice depends on how the drawing was set up and what you want 
to plot. If you’re trying to plot a drawing in which the limits weren’t set, 
try Extents instead. Use Window or View if you want to plot just a por-
tion of model space.
 ✓ 
Plot Offset: A plot offset of X=0 and Y=0 positions the plot at the lower-
left corner of the plottable area. If you want to move the plot from this 
default position on the paper, enter non-zero numbers or select the 
Center the Plot check box. (The Center the Plot check box is not avail-
able if you select Layout from the What to Plot drop-down list.)

348
Part III: If Drawings Could Talk 
 ✓ 
Shaded Viewport Options: If your drawing includes viewports show-
ing shaded or rendered 3D models, use this area to control the plotted 
appearance.
 ✓ 
Plot Options: The Plot Object Lineweights and the Plot with Plot Styles 
check boxes control whether AutoCAD uses the features described in 
the “Plotting with style” and “Plotting through thick and thin” sections, 
earlier in this chapter.
 
 The Hide Paperspace Objects check box controls whether AutoCAD 
hides objects that are behind other objects when a 3D model is dis-
played in a viewport. 
 ✓ 
Plot Upside-Down: Select this check box if you want to rotate the plot 
180 degrees on the paper. (It’s a handy option for plotting in the south-
ern hemisphere or for avoiding having to cock your head at an uncom-
fortable angle as you watch plots come out of the plotter.)
AutoCAD normally generates plots in the foreground — that is, the plot-
ting process takes over the program for the entire time that the program is 
creating the plot. AutoCAD 2011 includes a background plotting feature that 
returns control of the program to you more quickly. If you have a reasonably 
fast computer with adequate memory, turn on this feature in the Options 
dialog box: Type OPTIONS (OP) and press Enter, click the Plot and Publish 
tab, and in the Background Processing Options area, select Plotting.
 
If you want to automate plotting for a batch of drawings, check out AutoCAD’s 
sheet sets feature. One of the tasks that sheet sets are designed to accomplish 
is the publishing of a set of drawing sheets at one fell swoop. If this sounds like 
your ticket to plotting bliss, go to the online help system and choose User’s 
Guide➪Organize Drawings and Layouts➪Work with Sheets in a Sheet Set.
Troubles with Plotting
No matter how many times you read this chapter or how carefully you study 
the AutoCAD documentation, you’ll occasionally run into plotting problems. 
You’re especially likely to encounter problems when trying to plot other 
people’s drawings because you don’t always know what plotting conventions 
they had in mind. (Plotting conventions aren’t where spies meet; they’re a 
standardized approach to plotting issues.) Table 16-1 describes some of the 
more common plotting problems and solutions.

Possible Solution
Nothing comes out 
of the plotter (system 
printer driver).
Check whether you can print to the device from other 
Windows applications. If not, it’s not an AutoCAD 
problem. Try the Windows Print Troubleshooter 
(Windows XP: Start➪Help and Support➪Printing 
and Faxing➪Fixing a Printing Problem➪Printing 
Troubleshooter; Windows Vista and Windows 7: 
Start➪Help and Support, type printing troubleshoot-
ing in the Search box and press Enter, then click 
Troubleshoot Printer Problems or Open the Printer

Nothing comes out of 
the plotter (non-sys-
tem printer driver).
Choose Plotter Manager on the Plot panel of the 
Ribbon’s Output tab, double-click the plotter configura-
tion, and check the settings.
Objects don’t plot the 
way they appear on-
screen.
Check for a plot style table with weird settings or try 
plotting without a plot style table.
Objects appear 
ghosted or with 
washed-out colors.
In the plot style table, set Color to Black for all colors.
Scaled to Fit doesn’t 
work right in paper 
space.
Change the What to Plot drop-down list from Layout to 
Extents.
The HP-enhanced 
Windows system 
driver that you down-
loaded from HP’s Web 
site doesn’t have the 
right paper sizes (for 
example, no architec-
tural paper sizes).
In the Plot dialog box’s Printer/Plotter area, click the 
Properties button to display the Plotter Configuration 
Editor dialog box, click the Custom Properties button 
(near the bottom), and then click the More Sizes button 
to specify the standard and custom paper sizes.
Something else is 
wrong.
Check the plot log: Click the Plot/Publish Details Report 
Available icon near the right end of the status bar and 
look for error messages.

fter you get the lines and text right, you may be 
justified in thinking that your work in AutoCAD is 
done. But AutoCAD enables you to do so much more! 
Blocks and external references help you manage data 
within drawings, between drawings, and across a network. 
Parametric drawing lets you maintain the intent of your 
designs. If you plan to share drawings (whether among 
your own projects, with people in your office, or with 
folks in other companies), you need to think about 
consistency in presentation and drawing organization.
The Internet is the biggest ongoing swap meet in human 
history, and AutoCAD offers some unique trading 
possibilities — and potential pitfalls — via e-mail and the 
Web. With the information in this part, you’ll be teaching 
AutoCAD how to give and receive in no time.

hapter 11 shows you how to copy objects within a drawing or even to 
another drawing. That’s one way to use AutoCAD to improve drafting 
efficiency. You can copy a DWG file and then modify it to create a similar 
drawing — an even better productivity booster, as long as you’re in the 
habit of making similar drawings. But all those are baby steps compared to 
the techniques that I cover in this chapter and Chapter 18: treating draw-
ings, parts of drawings, drawings saved in Web format (DWF, or Design Web 
Format), PDFs, MicroStation DGN files, and raster images as reusable and 
updateable modules. If you want to make drafting production more efficient 
with AutoCAD, you want to know how to use blocks, xrefs, PDFs, DWFs, 
DGNs, and raster files.
A block is a collection of objects grouped together to form a single object. 
You can insert this collection more than once in the same drawing, and when 
you do, all instances of the block remain identical. By redefining the block 
definition, you can automatically change all instances of the block insertion 
(officially called a block reference) at once. Although a block lives within a 
specific drawing, you can transfer copies of it into other drawings. And you 
can add fill-in-the-blank text fields, called attributes, to blocks.
You can create single line or multiline attributes; in addition to having more 
than one line, multiline attributes have many of the formatting options of mul-
tiline text. And blocks both with and without attributes can be defined as anno-
tative objects to boot. (See Chapter 13 for a rundown on annotative objects.)
In this chapter, I present the ABCs of blocks — basic creation and insertion, 
adding attributes, and getting rid of block definitions you no longer need or 
want. In Chapter 18, I show you how to make even more of already-created

drawing data, including several flavors of external reference files (including 
PDFs and MicroStation DGN files) and raster images.
Blocks, along with external references, DWF and PDF underlays, raster 
images, and DGN files, enable you to reuse your work and the work of others, 
giving you the potential to save tremendous amounts of time — or to cause 
tremendous problems if you change a file on which other people’s drawings 
depend. Use these features when you can to save time, but do so in an orga-
nized and careful way so as to avoid problems.
 
How you use blocks and xrefs depends a lot on the profession and office in 
which you work. Some disciplines and companies use these drawing organiza-
tion features heavily and in a highly organized way, but others don’t. Ask your 
colleagues what the local customs are and follow them.
Rocking with Blocks
First, a little more block theory and then you can rock right into those blocks. 
To use a block in a drawing, you need two things: a block definition and 
one or more block insertions. AutoCAD doesn’t always make the distinction 
between these two things very clear, but you need to understand the differ-
ence to avoid terminal confusion about blocks. (Maybe this syndrome should 
be called blockheadedness?)
A block definition lives in an invisible area of your drawing file called the 
block table. (It’s one of those sets of named symbols that I describe in 
Chapter 6.) The block table is like a book of graphical recipes for making dif-
ferent kinds of blocks. Each block definition is like a recipe for making one 
kind of block. When you insert a block, as described in the section “Inserting 
blocks,” later in this chapter, AutoCAD creates a special object called a block 
reference. The block reference points to the recipe and tells AutoCAD, “Hey, 
draw me according to the instructions in this recipe!”
Although a block may look like a collection of objects stored together and 
given a name, it’s really a graphical recipe (the block definition) plus one or 
more pointers to that recipe (one or more block references). Each time you 
insert a particular block, you create another pointer to the same recipe.
The advantages of blocks include
 ✓ 
Grouping objects together when they belong together logically: You 
can draw a screw using lines and arcs and then make a block defini-
tion out of all these objects. When you insert the screw block, AutoCAD 
treats it as a single object for purposes of copying, moving, and so on.

355
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
 ✓ 
Saving time and reducing errors: Inserting a block is, of course, much 
quicker than redrawing the same geometry again. And the less geometry 
you draw from scratch, the less opportunity there is to make a mistake.
 ✓ 
Efficiency of storage when you reuse the same block repeatedly: If you 
insert the same screw block 15 times in a drawing, AutoCAD stores the 
detailed block definition only once. The 15 block references that point 
to the block definition take up much less disk space than 15 copies of all 
the lines, polylines, and arcs.
 ✓ 
The ability to edit all instances of a symbol in a drawing simply by mod-
ifying a single block definition: If you decide that your design requires a 
different kind of screw, you simply redefine the screw’s block definition. 
With this new recipe, AutoCAD then replaces all 15 screws automatically. 
That’s a heck of a lot faster than erasing and recopying 15 screws!
 ✓ 
Varying the appearance of block references by using dynamic blocks: 
If your design requires a different kind of screw, you simply change 
the view of the screw to the other kind (assuming, of course, you’ve 
defined your screw as a dynamic block). Every instance of the screw in 
the drawing could show a different kind of screw. And that’s a heck of 
a lot more efficient than creating 15 different block definitions! For the 
lowdown on creating, inserting, and manipulating dynamic blocks, open 
the online help system and choose User’s Guide➪Define and Reference 
Blocks➪Add Behaviors to Blocks (Dynamic Blocks).
 Blocks 
aren’t as great for drawing elements used in multiple drawings, how-
ever, especially if several people are working on and sharing parts of drawings 
with one another. That’s because blocks, after they get into multiple drawings, 
stay in each drawing; a later modification to a block definition in one drawing 
does not automatically modify all the other drawings that use that block. If 
you use a block with your company’s logo in a number of drawings and then 
you decide to change the logo, you must make the change within each draw-
ing that uses the block.
 
If all you need to do is group some objects so that you can more easily 
select them for copying, moving, and so on, use AutoCAD’s Group feature. 
Type GROUP (or the command alias G) and press Enter to open the Object 
Grouping dialog box in AutoCAD or the Group Manager dialog box in AutoCAD 
LT. Then select some objects, click the New button in AutoCAD or the Create 
Group button in AutoCAD LT, and type a name for the group. When you’re 
editing drawings that contain groups, press Ctrl+Shift+A to toggle “group-ness” 
on or off. If you’ve toggled group-ness on, picking any object in a group selects 
all objects in the group. If you’ve toggled it off, picking an object selects only 
that object, even if it happens to be a member of a group. For more informa-
tion, visit the online help index.

356
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Creating block definitions
To create a block definition from objects in the current drawing, use the 
Block Definition dialog box. (The other way to create a block definition is by 
inserting another drawing file into your current drawing as a block, which I 
explain in the next section.) The following steps show you how to create a 
block definition by using the Block Definition dialog box:
 
 
1. On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Create button on the Block panel.
 
 
 The Block Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 17-1).
 
Figure 17-1: 
The Block 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
 
 Pay attention to layers when you create the objects that make up a 
block. As a rule, block geometry created on most layers retains the 
color, linetype, lineweight, transparency, and plot style properties of 
those layers. The exception to the rule is object geometry created on 
Layer 0. If you create a block using geometry drawn on Layer 0, when 
you insert the block, it takes on the features of the layer into which it’s 
inserted.
 
2. Type the block definition’s name in the Name text box.
 
 If you type the name of an existing block definition, AutoCAD will warn 
you when you click OK at the end of the process and ask if you want to 
replace that block definition with the new objects you select. This pro-
cess is called block redefinition.
 
 To see a list of the names of all the current blocks in your drawing, open 
the Name drop-down list.

357
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
 
3. Specify the base point (also known as the insertion point) of the block, 
using any of the following methods:
 
• Enter the coordinates of the insertion point in the X, Y, and Z text 
boxes.
 
• Click the Pick Point button and then select a point on the screen. 
(In this case, use an object snap or other precision technique, 
as described in Chapter 7, to grab a specific point on one of the 
block’s objects.)
  
The base point is the point on the block by which you insert it later, as I 
describe in the next section.
 
 Use an obvious and consistent point on the group of objects for the base 
point, such as the lower-left corner, so that you know what to expect 
when you insert the block.
 
4. Click the Select Objects button and then select the objects that you 
want as part of the block.
 
 AutoCAD uses the selected objects to create a block definition and dis-
plays an icon showing those objects next to the block name. Figure 17-2 
shows the base point and group of selected objects during the process 
of creating a new block definition.
 
Figure 17-2: 
Building a 
block.
 
Base point
 
5. In the Objects area, select one of the radio buttons to tell AutoCAD 
what to do with the objects used to define the block: retain them in 
place, convert them into a block instance, or delete them.
 
 The default choice, Convert to Block, is usually the best. See Step 9 for a 
description of what happens with each choice.
 
6. Specify the insert units to which the block will be scaled in the Block 
Unit drop-down list.
 
 When you or someone else drags the block from one drawing into 
another via the DesignCenter palette (see Chapter 6) or Tool Palettes 

358
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
(described later in this chapter), the units you specify here and the units 
of the drawing you’re dragging into will control the default insertion 
scale factor.
 
 Three additional features in AutoCAD’s Block Definition dialog box give 
you even more control over what happens to your blocks as they’re 
inserted:
 • 
If the Annotative check box is selected: You can assign multiple plot-
ted drawing scales to the block and then display the inserted block 
at the different scale representations by choosing one from the 
Annotation scale list on the status bar. I explain the nuts and bolts 
of annotative objects in Chapter 13.
 • 
If the Scale Uniformly check box is selected: Blocks will be inserted 
with the same X, Y, or Z scale factors. (Scale Uniformly is automati-
cally selected if Annotative is selected.)
 • 
If the Allow Exploding check box is selected: Blocks can be exploded 
during or after their insertion in a drawing.
 
7. Enter a description for the block in the Description text area.
 
 You don’t have to enter a description to create a block, but it’s not a bad 
idea. Think like a database manager and enter a useful description that 
will identify the block to yourself and others.
 
8. Make sure that the Open in Block Editor check box is deselected.
 
 You don’t need to use the Edit Block Definition dialog box unless you’re 
going to add dynamic features to the block (visit the online help to find 
out more about dynamic blocks).
 
9. Click OK to complete the block definition process.
 
 AutoCAD stores the block definition in the current drawing’s block table. 
The radio buttons you choose from in Step 5 do the following:
 
• If you selected the Convert to Block radio button (the default) 
in Step 5, AutoCAD creates a block reference pointing to the new 
block definition — the objects look the same on-screen, but now 
they’re an instance of the block rather than existing as separate 
objects. Most of the time, this is your best choice.
 
• If you selected the Retain radio button, the objects remain in place 
but aren’t converted into a block reference — they stay individual 
objects with no connection to the new block definition.
 
• If you selected the Delete radio button, the objects disappear (but 
the block definition still gets created).
 
When you define a block, you can include a special kind of variable text object 
called an attribute definition. When you insert a block that contains one or 
more attribute definitions, AutoCAD prompts you to fill in values for the text 
fields. Attributes are useful for variable title block information (sheet number, 

359
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
sheet title, and so on) and symbols that contain different codes or callouts. I 
describe how to create and use attribute definitions later in this chapter.
 
Keep your common symbol drawings in one or more specific folders that you 
set aside just for that purpose. You may want to use one of the following tech-
niques to develop a library of symbols that you use frequently:
 ✓ 
Create a separate DWG file for each block.
 ✓ 
Store a bunch of symbols as block definitions in one drawing and use 
DesignCenter to import block definitions from this drawing when you 
need them.
Inserting blocks
AutoCAD provides a number of ways to insert a block or a whole drawing 
file, but the most commonly used and most flexible is the Insert dialog box. 
Here’s the procedure for inserting a block:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 6.
 
 It’s a good idea to insert each block on a layer that has something to do 
with the block’s geometry or purpose:
 
• If all the objects in the block definition reside on one layer, it’s usu-
ally best to insert the block on that layer.
 
• If the block geometry spans several layers, choose one of them to 
insert the block on.
 
 If any of the block definition’s geometry was created on Layer 0, that 
geometry will inherit the color, linetype, and other object properties of 
the layer that you insert the block on. It’s like the chameleon changing 
color to match its surroundings or a politician changing his position to 
match the day’s opinion polls.
 
 
2. On the Ribbon’s Home tab click the Insert button on the Block panel.
 
 
 The Insert dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-3.
 
3. Enter the block definition name (or external filename) by using one of 
the following methods:
 
• Use the Name drop-down list to select from a list of block defini-
tions in the current drawing.
 
• Click the Browse button to select an external DWG file and have 
AutoCAD create a block definition from it.
 
 You can use an external drawing to replace a block definition in your 
current drawing. If you click Browse and choose a file whose name 
matches the name of a block definition that’s already in your drawing, 

360
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
AutoCAD asks you to confirm the update and, if you agree, updates the 
block definition in your drawing with the current contents of the exter-
nal file. This process is called block redefinition, and AutoCAD automati-
cally updates all the block references that point to the block definition.
 
Figure 17-3: 
The Insert 
dialog box.
 
 
4. Enter the insertion point, scale, and rotation angle of the block.
 
 You can either select the Specify On-Screen check box in each area 
to specify the parameters on-screen at the command prompt, or type 
the values you want in the text boxes in the Insertion Point, Scale, and 
Rotation areas.
 
 Select the Uniform Scale check box to constrain the X, Y, and Z scaling 
parameters to the same value (which is what you want in almost 
all cases).
 
5. If you want AutoCAD to create a copy of the individual objects in the 
block instead of a block reference that points to the block definition, 
select the Explode check box and click OK.
 
6. If you selected the Specify On-Screen check box for the insertion 
point, scale, or rotation angle, answer the prompts on the command 
line to specify these parameters.
After you insert a block, all the objects displayed in the block reference 
behave as a single object. When you select any object in the block reference, 
AutoCAD highlights all the objects in it.
 
Another way to insert a block is to drag a DWG file from Windows Explorer 
and drop it anywhere in the current drawing window. AutoCAD then prompts 
you to choose an insertion point and optionally change the default scale factor 
and rotation angle. Similarly, you can drag a block definition from the Blocks 
section of the DesignCenter palette and drop it into the current drawing 
window. (Chapter 6 describes DesignCenter.)

361
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
AutoCAD provides one additional way of inserting blocks: the Tool Palettes 
window, which is described in Chapter 2. As is true of using a tool palette for 
hatching (Chapter 15), you first must create and configure appropriate tools. 
The easiest method is right-clicking a drawing in DesignCenter and choosing 
Create Tool Palette. A new tabbed page is added to the Tool Palettes window, 
containing all the block definitions from the drawing that you right-clicked. 
Simply click and drag a tool to insert its corresponding block into a drawing. 
Dragging blocks from a tool palette doesn’t give you the chance to specify 
a different insertion scale, nor can you use all AutoCAD’s precision tools to 
specify the insertion point precisely — you may need to move the block into 
place after inserting it. I recommend that you first master the other block 
insertion methods described in this chapter — especially the Insert dialog 
box and DesignCenter palette. Then if you find yourself inserting the same 
blocks frequently, consider creating a tool palette containing them. Check 
out the AutoCAD online help system for more information.
 
Although the preceding paragraph refers to the Tool Palettes window, palettes 
in AutoCAD are not like regular windows or dialog boxes. They are modeless, 
which means they can stay open while you carry on with other tasks outside 
them. The official programmer-ese term for palettes is enhanced secondary 
window, or ESW for short. (I think I’m sticking with palettes.)
 
Be careful when inserting one drawing into another. If the host (or parent) 
drawing and the inserted (or child) drawing have different definitions for 
layers that share the same name, the objects in the inserted drawing take 
on the layer characteristics of the host drawing. For example, if you insert a 
drawing with lines on a layer called Walls that’s blue and dashed into a draw-
ing with a layer called Walls that’s red and continuous, the inserted lines on 
the Wall layer will turn red and continuous after they’re inserted. The same 
rules apply to linetypes, text styles, dimension styles, table styles, multileader 
styles, and block definitions that are nested inside the drawing you’re insert-
ing. As you probably remember from when you were little . . . parents rule!
 
If you need to modify a block definition after you’ve inserted one or more 
instances of it, use the Block Editor (BEDIT command); choose Edit on the 
Home tab’s Block panel. Look up BEDIT in the AutoCAD online help system.
Locate Using Geographic Data is an option in AutoCAD 2011’s Insert dialog 
box. Geographic data refers to locating drawing geometry with reference 
to specific locations on planet Earth (so far) defined in one of a number of 
recognized global coordinate systems. This feature promises to be very big 
in the civil engineering community, or possibly for very large architectural 
projects, where a ground-based coordinate system is in place. If it sounds like 
something you need, look in the online help (and visit your local dealer or 
training center for further direction).

362
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Attributes: Fill-in-the-blank blocks
You may think of attributes as the good (or bad) qualities of your significant 
other, but in AutoCAD, attributes are fill-in-the-blank text fields that you can 
add to your blocks. When you create a block definition and then insert it 
several times in a drawing, all the ordinary geometry (lines, circles, regular 
text strings, and so on) in all the instances are exactly identical. Attributes 
provide a little more flexibility in the form of text strings that can be different 
in each block reference.
For example, suppose that you frequently designate parts in your drawings 
by labeling them with a distinct number or letter in a circle for each part. If 
you want to create a block for this symbol, you can’t simply draw the number 
or letter as regular text using the MTEXT or TEXT command. If you create a 
block definition with a regular text object (for example, the letter A), the text 
string will be the same in every instance of the block (always the letter A). 
That’s not much help in distinguishing the parts!
Instead, you create an attribute definition, which acts as a placeholder for a 
text string that can vary each time you insert the block. You include the attri-
bute definition when you create the block definition (refer to the “Creating 
block definitions” section, earlier in this chapter). Then each time you insert 
the block, AutoCAD prompts you to fill in an attribute value for each attribute 
definition.
When they were first introduced, and for a long time afterward, block attri-
bute values were limited to a single line of variable text with a maximum of 
255 characters. AutoCAD 2008 and later support multiline attributes; as well 
as offering more than one line, multiline attributes have many of the format-
ting options of multiline text. For more information on creating and inserting 
blocks with multiline attributes, visit the online help system index.
 
The AutoCAD documentation and dialog boxes often use the term attribute to 
refer indiscriminately to an attribute definition or an attribute value. I attribute a 
lot of the confusion about attributes to this sloppiness. Just remember that an 
attribute definition is the text field or placeholder in the block definition, and 
an attribute value is the specific text string that you type when you insert the 
block.
Attribute definitions
You use the Attribute Definition dialog box to create attribute definitions 
(clever, eh?). The procedure is similar to creating a text string except that 
you must supply a little more information. Create attribute definitions with 
the following steps:

363
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
 
1. Change to the layer on which you want to create the attribute 
definition.
 
2. Choose Define Attributes on the Home tab’s Block panel slideout to 
run the ATTDEF command.
 
 The Attribute Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-4.
 
 You rarely need to use any of the first four Mode settings (Invisible, 
Constant, Verify, or Preset). Just leave them deselected. If you’re curious 
about what the modes do, hover your mouse pointer over an item and, 
if that’s not enough information, use the dialog box Help button to find 
out more.
 
Figure 17-4: 
The 
Attribute 
Definition 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Select or deselect the Lock Position check box.
 
 If Lock Position is selected, the attributes can’t be relocated within 
the block reference — the whole thing is treated as a single object. 
Deselecting Lock Position allows attributes to be moved by dragging 
their grips, without moving the block reference as a whole.
 
4. Select or deselect the Multiple Lines check box.
 
 Selecting Multiple Lines in the Mode area disables the “Default” text box 
and displays a button to open the Multiline Editor. You don’t get the 
whole panoply of formatting options that you get in the MTEXT com-
mand’s In-Place Text Editor, but you can overscore or underscore text, 
and a right-click menu lets you import text, assign a background mask, 
or choose from a number of other options. Refer to the online help 
system for more information.

364
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
5. In the Attribute area, type values for the tag (the unique identifier for 
the attribute), the user prompt, and the default value.
 
 The name you type into the Tag text box can’t contain any spaces. The 
Prompt and Default text boxes may contain spaces.
 
 Attribute values can include automatically updating fields, such as date, 
filename, or system variable setting. Click the Insert Field button to the 
right of the Default text box to insert a field. See Chapter 13 for more 
information.
 
6. (Optional) If you selected the Multiple Lines check box in Step 4, click 
the Multiline Editor button (it shows three periods) to enter the multi-
line default attribute value and add any formatting; then click OK.
 
 The value you enter here is the default text stored in the attribute defini-
tion, and you can change it when you insert the block.
 
7. In the Text Settings area, specify the Justification, Text Style, 
Annotative property, Text Height, Rotation, and Boundary Width 
(the last for multiline attributes only).
 
 The text properties for attribute definitions are the same as those for 
text objects — see Chapter 13.
 
8. Select Specify On-Screen to choose an insertion point for the attribute 
definition.
 
 An attribute definition’s insertion point is like a text string’s base point. 
Remember to use snap, object snap, or another precision tool if you 
want the eventual attribute values to be located at a precise point.
 
9. Click OK to create the attribute definition.
 
10. Repeat Steps 1 through 9 for any additional attribute definitions.
 
 If you need to create a series of attribute definitions in neat rows, create 
the first one using Steps 1 through 9 and then select the Align Below 
Previous Attribute Definition check box for the subsequent definitions. 
To make a series of non-adjacent attributes, create the first one using 
Steps 1 through 9 and then copy the first attribute definition and edit the 
copy with the Properties palette. You can prevent your attributes from 
being dragged around the block by selecting the Lock Position check 
box in the Attribute Definition dialog box.
Block definition containing attribute definitions
After you create one or more attribute definitions — and any other geometry 
that you want to include in the block — you’re ready to create a block defini-
tion that contains them. Follow the steps in the section “Creating block defi-
nitions,” earlier in this chapter.

365
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
At Step 4 in the section “Creating block definitions,” you can select any attri-
bute definitions before or after you select the other geometry. However, you 
should select each attribute definition one by one (clicking each attribute 
definition rather than selecting multiple attributes with a selection window) 
in the order that you want the attribute value prompts to appear in the Edit 
Attributes dialog box (see Figure 17-5 in the next section). If you don’t select 
the attributes one by one, your block and attributes will still work, but the 
order of the attribute prompts in the Edit Attributes dialog box may not be 
what you want.
 
You can use the Block Attribute Manager to reorder the attribute definitions 
in a block definition. Choose Manage Attributes on the Home tab’s Block panel 
slideout. You also can use this dialog box to edit other attribute definition set-
tings, such as the prompt, text style, or layer.
Insert a block containing attribute definitions
After you create a block definition that contains attribute definitions, you 
insert it just like any other block. Follow the steps in the section “Inserting 
blocks” earlier in this chapter. At the end of the steps, AutoCAD displays the 
Edit Attributes dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-5. The dialog box contains 
one row for each of the attribute definitions and has any default values filled 
in. You simply edit the values and then click OK.
 
Figure 17-5: 
The Edit 
Attributes 
dialog box.
 
 
The ATTDIA (ATTribute DIAlog box) system variable controls whether 
AutoCAD prompts for attribute values in a dialog box (ATTDIA=1) or at 
the command line (ATTDIA=0). If you insert a block and see command line 
prompts for each attribute value, type a value and press Enter for each attri-
bute value. When you return to the Command prompt, type ATTDIA, press 

366
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Enter, type 1, and press Enter again. When you insert blocks with attributes 
in this drawing in the future, AutoCAD displays the Edit Attributes dialog box 
instead of prompting you at the command line.
Edit attribute values
After you insert a block that contains attributes, you can edit the individual 
attribute values in that block reference with the EATTEDIT command. Click 
the Edit Attributes flyout on the Home tab’s Block panel, choose Single, and 
click any object in the block reference. AutoCAD displays the Enhanced 
Attribute Editor dialog box with the current attribute values, as shown in 
Figure 17-6. The most common attribute editing operation is to edit the text 
value — that is, the text string that appears in the block reference. You also 
can change properties of the attributes, such as layer and text style.
 
Figure 17-6: 
The 
Enhanced 
Attribute 
Editor dialog 
box.
 
Many people use attributes in the way I’ve described so far — as fill-in-the-
blank text fields in blocks. But attributes also can serve as data extraction 
tools. For example, you can export attribute values, such as part numbers 
and quantities, to a table object in AutoCAD or to a text, spreadsheet, or 
database file for analysis or reporting.
Extracting data
 
 Selecting Extract Data from the Linking & Extraction panel on the Ribbon’s 
Insert tab starts the Data Extraction Wizard. You can find out much more 
about this specialized function in the online help. Check out User’s Guide➪
Share Data between Files➪Extract Data from Drawings and Spreadsheets. 
And, LT users, although you don’t have this command, you can still extract 
attribute information to space- or comma-delimited text files by using the 
Attribute Extraction dialog box. For more information, visit the online help.

367
 Chapter 17: The ABCs of Blocks
Exploding blocks
In regular block definitions (not dynamic blocks), the objects in each block 
reference act like a well-honed marching squadron: If you move or otherwise 
edit one object in the block reference, all objects move or change in the same 
way. Usually this cohesion is an advantage, but occasionally you need to 
break up the squadron in order to modify one object without affecting the 
others.
 
 To explode a block reference into individual objects, click Explode on the 
Home tab’s Modify panel or type X and press Enter, and then select the block 
reference. When you explode a block reference, AutoCAD replaces it with all 
the objects — lines, polylines, arcs, and so on — specified in the block defini-
tion. You then can edit the objects individually or perhaps use them to make 
more block definitions.
 
If you explode a block that contains attributes, the attribute values change 
back to attribute definitions. This usually isn’t the sort of change that you 
want. If you really need to explode the block reference, you’ll probably want 
to erase the attribute definitions and draw regular text strings in their place. 
If you’ve installed the AutoCAD Express Tools (not available in AutoCAD LT), 
you can perform this task automatically with the BURST command. Just type 
BURST and press Enter.
Purging unused block definitions
Each block definition slightly increases the size of your DWG file, as do other 
named objects such as layers, text styles, and dimension styles. If you delete 
(or explode) all the block references that point to a particular block defini-
tion, that block definition no longer serves any purpose.
 
 You should run the PURGE command periodically in each drawing and purge 
unused block definitions. Click the Application button to open the Application 
Menu, choose Drawing Utilities on the left side, then choose Purge to display 
the Purge dialog box. Click the Purge All button to purge all unused named 
objects in the current drawing.
 
PURGE isn’t only for blocks — you can also remove empty layers, blank text 
strings, zero-length lines, and unused style definitions. In Figure 17-7, the 
Purge dialog box shows the unused dimension, multileader, and text styles 
that can be removed from this drawing with a click of the Purge All button.

n Chapter 17, I introduce blocks as collections of object geometry that 
are treated as single entities in AutoCAD. In that chapter, I also describe 
giving blocks a little more oomph by adding attributes — changeable text tags 
that can differ with each insertion. Other than that kind of slight variation 
though, the blocks I describe in Chapter 17 tend to be pretty static.
But blocks don’t have to be static creations. Instead of having a half-dozen 
regular blocks for a half-dozen different door sizes, you can create a single 
dynamic block that includes all those sizes. Unlike a regular block, in which 
every instance of a particular block is geometrically identical, each instance 
of a dynamic block can display geometric variations. For example, you can 
insert one furniture block three times and have one instance display as a 
sofa, one as a loveseat, and one as an armchair. I introduce block authoring — 
the process for creating and editing dynamic blocks — in this chapter.
An external reference drawing, or xref, is like an industrial-strength block. An 
xref is a pointer to a separate drawing outside the drawing you’re working 
on. When you attach a reference drawing, it appears on-screen and on plots 
as part of your drawing, but it continues to live as a separate document on 
your hard drive or network. If you edit the externally referenced drawing, the 
appearance of the drawing changes in all drawings that reference it.
A raster image file stores a graphical image as a series of dots. Raster 
files are good for storing photographs, logos, and other images, whereas 
AutoCAD vector files are good for storing geometrical objects such as lines 
and arcs, along with text and other annotations for describing the geometry. 
Sometimes it’s handy to combine raster images with AutoCAD vector files 
by attaching them to your drawing files, and the External References palette 
makes the process straightforward.

370
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
Before AutoCAD 2007, external references meant AutoCAD drawing files (and 
only AutoCAD drawing files) that you attached to your current drawing. 
Images were (and still are) raster graphics files that you attached in a similar 
way but with a different command. In AutoCAD 2007 and later, External 
References is the name of the palette with which you attach and manage not 
only externally referenced AutoCAD drawings (xrefs) and 2D MicroStation 
DGN drawing files, but also image files and DWF or PDF underlays. (DWF 
stands for Design Web Format; a DWF is a “lightweight” version of a DWG file 
intended for design review or posting on a Web site.) I discuss attaching DWFs 
or PDFs as external references at the end of this chapter, and describe the 
Web functions of DWFs in Chapter 20.
Both AutoCAD 2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011 enable you to attach DGN files 
to current drawings via the External References palette. DGN files are draw-
ing files created by one of AutoCAD’s major competitors: MicroStation from 
Bentley Systems. (You can also import and export DGN drawing data in 
both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT.) If you’re new to AutoCAD, you’re not so 
likely to encounter DGN files unless you’re working for a large company that 
exchanges a lot of drawings with partners and consultants. For more informa-
tion on DGN files in AutoCAD 2011, enter DGN Files in the Search box at the 
top of the online help Home page.
As I mention in Chapter 17, blocks, external references, DWF underlays, PDF 
underlays, raster images, and DGN files enable you to reuse your work and 
the work of others, giving you the potential to save tremendous amounts of 
time — or to cause tremendous problems if you change a file on which other 
people’s drawings depend. Use these features when you can to save time, but 
do so in an organized and careful way so as to avoid problems.
Theme and Variations: Dynamic Blocks
You can add variety to your blocks by making them dynamic. The two most 
useful applications for dynamic blocks are multiple presentations of similar 
objects and manipulation of components within individual block inserts.
There’s no question that AutoCAD’s dynamic blocks feature gives a great deal 
of flexibility to block creation and insertion. But it’s also a very complicated 
system, with its own set of commands and system variables. I recommend 
that you become very familiar with the regular block creation and insertion 
techniques I describe in Chapter 17 before you tackle dynamic blocks.
 
Spend some time planning your dynamic blocks. Sketch out the geometry 
for each variation in appearance (or visibility state) and decide where the 
common base point should be. Unless you’re a lot smarter than I am, you’ll 
probably find that creating dynamic blocks is complex enough without trying 
to design your blocks as you go.

371
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
Now you see it . . .
If your drawing shows six different kinds of windows, one approach is to 
create six different standard blocks to represent them all. Alternatively, you 
can create a single dynamic block and define visibility states to cover all six 
different types. The following steps show you how to make your blocks do 
double (or sextuple?) duty by using the Edit Block Definition dialog box:
 
1. Open a drawing that contains some block definitions you’d like to 
combine, or draw some simple geometry to make some similar types 
of objects.
 
 You can create dynamic blocks from scratch, or you can work with exist-
ing standard (that is, non-dynamic) block definitions. Figure 18-1 shows 
a drawing with three non-dynamic blocks.
 
Figure 18-1: 
Three 
blocks to 
make three 
seats.
 
 
 
2. On the Block panel of the Home tab, choose Edit to open the Edit 
Block Definition dialog box.
 
 
3. In the Block To Create Or Edit box, specify a new block name or select 
<Current Drawing> and then click OK to display the Block Editor 
window.
 
 The Block Editor is a special authoring environment with its own Ribbon 
tab plus a passel of command-line commands. You also have access to the 
rest of the Ribbon tabs, so you can draw and edit just like you’re in the 
regular drawing window. The background color is different from the draw-
ing editor’s background color to help you remember where you are.
 
 The Block Editor tab’s Geometric, Dimensional, and Manage panels (see 
Figure 18-2) are elements of AutoCAD2011’s parametric drawing feature. 

372
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
(AutoCAD LT doesn’t fully support parametric drawing, so it lacks the 
Geometric and Dimensional tabs and gets a mini-version of the Manage 
tab.) In this book, I don’t have room to cover parametric constraints in 
dynamic blocks, but I do cover parametric drafting in Chapter 19. The 
concepts are pretty similar to adding parametric features to dynamic 
blocks.
 
 If you enter a new block name, AutoCAD displays an empty block-
authoring environment where you draw geometry or insert existing 
blocks. If you instead select Current Drawing, AutoCAD places all draw-
ing objects inside the block authoring environment.
 
4. Create some geometry for the first visibility state. Alternatively, click 
the Home tab, choose Insert on the Block panel, and select an existing 
block definition to serve as the first visibility state.
 
 When creating geometry from scratch, pay attention to where the 
common base point should be. Although you use different blocks to 
assemble a multiple-view block, they should all have the same base 
point (0,0 is a good one for blocks). You don’t want your chairs jumping 
around between different insertion points!
 
5. If you inserted an existing block in Step 4, deselect all three Specify 
On-Screen check boxes, make sure that the Explode check box is not 
selected, and then click OK.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5, drawing or inserting all the necessary geometry.
 
 At this point, your drawing screen may look pretty strange (see Figure 
18-2). Don’t worry; you’re going to fix it up in the next steps.
 
7. Click the Parameters tab of the Block Authoring Palettes and then 
click Visibility Parameter.
 
 If the palettes aren’t open, click Authoring Palettes on the Manage panel 
on the highlighted Block Editor contextual tab of the Ribbon.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the parameter location.
 
8. Click to place the parameter marker somewhere other than the base 
point location you chose in Step 4.
 
 AutoCAD places a parameter marker at the selected point and returns to 
the command line. As shown in Figure 18-2, the label Visibility1 appears 
next to the Visibility Parameter marker, and a yellow Alert symbol indi-
cates that no action has been assigned to the parameter yet. The con-
trols on the Ribbon’s Visibility panel become active.
 
 The parameter location you specify will be the spot on the block where 
the dynamic block option grip will be displayed. It’s not crucial where 
you locate this point, but try to pick a sensible location on the object. If 
you specify the same point for the parameter location as the base point 
for the block, you may have a hard time selecting the dynamic option 
grip.

9. Click Visibility States on the Visibility panel. Click Rename and 
change VisibilityState0 to something more descriptive. Click OK.
 
 As is the case with other named objects in AutoCAD, it’s good proce-
dure to assign useful, descriptive names rather than accept the default 
generic labels.
 
10. On the Visibility panel, click the Make Invisible button. At the Select 
Objects prompt, select the geometry or block inserts that should be 
invisible in the current visibility state — that is, those that are not 
associated with the current visibility state — and then press Enter.
  
AutoCAD prompts
Hide for current state or all visibility states 
[Current/All] <Current>: C
 
11. Click Visibility States again and then click New to create a new vis-
ibility state. In the New Visibility State dialog box, enter a descriptive 
name. Select the Show All Existing Objects in New State radio button 
and then click OK.
 
 All your geometry should reappear.

374
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
12. Repeat Steps 9 and 10 to create additional visibility states associated 
with the remaining geometry or blocks.
 
 The geometry or block insert associated with the last-created visibility 
state should be visible on-screen.
 
13. Click Close Block Editor on the Ribbon. Save the changes to your new 
block or to <Current Drawing>.
 
 AutoCAD displays an alert box asking if you want to save changes to your 
block. Click Cancel to return to the block editor or Discard the Changes 
to close the Block Editor without saving your changes. Click Save the 
Changes to update the block and exit. AutoCAD closes the block author-
ing environment and returns to the standard drawing editor window.
 
AutoCAD 2011’s Block Editor tab includes a Test Block tool that lets you see 
what your finished product will look like without the hassle of closing the 
editor and inserting or manipulating the block inside the drawing editor. Test 
Block displays the geometry and lets you try different parameters; then easily 
return to the Block Editor to tweak your masterpiece. You’ll find the Test 
Block button on the Open/Save panel of the Block Editor contextual tab.
Lights! Parameters!! Actions!!!
You can modify the appearance of individual instances of the same block by 
defining parameters and actions to move, rotate, flip, or align parts of them. 
You can adjust the block’s appearance as you insert it or at any time after-
ward. The following steps show you how to use the Block Editor to add some 
action to a block definition:
 
1. Open a drawing that contains some block definitions whose appear-
ance you’d like to spice up a little, or draw some simple geometry that 
might make a suitably dynamic block.
 
 Action parameters are most effective in block definitions that contain 
groups of related objects — for example, an office desk and chair or a 
furniture arrangement.
 
2. On the Block panel of the Ribbon’s Home tab, choose Edit to open the 
Edit Block Definition dialog box.
 
3. In the Block To Create Or Edit box, type a new block name or select 
<Current Drawing>, and then click OK.
 
4. Create some geometry or insert some blocks. When you insert blocks, 
remember to make sure that the Explode check box at the lower-left 
corner of the Insert dialog box is not selected, and then click OK.
 
 Draw the geometry or insert the blocks in a group such that you can insert 
the finished arrangement into your drawings — for example, Figure 18-3 
shows the creation of a dynamic block for a coffee shop or cafeteria.

375
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
 
5. Repeat Step 4 until you’ve drawn all the needed geometry or inserted 
all the necessary blocks.
 
6. Click the Parameters tab of the Block Authoring Palettes and then 
click Rotation Parameter.
 
 AutoCAD prompts you to specify the parameter location.
 
7. Click to place the parameter marker somewhere on the object geom-
etry other than the base point location.
 
 If you specify the same point for the parameter location as the base 
point for the block, you may have a hard time selecting the dynamic 
option grip.
 
8. AutoCAD places a parameter marker at the selected point and returns 
to the command line, prompting you to specify the radius of the rota-
tion parameter and the default rotation angle.
 
 The parameter marker’s label appears next to the rotation parameter 
marker.
 
9. Click the Actions tab of the Block Authoring Palettes and then click 
Rotate Action. Select the Rotate Parameter, select the objects that 
should be modified when the grip is used, and specify a point for the 
action’s label.
 
 AutoCAD returns to the command prompt. At this point, it’s fine to go 
with default values and on-screen pick points.
 
10. Repeat Steps 6 through 9, trying different parameters and actions.
 
 For example, choose a Point Parameter and a Move Action.
 
 Figure 18-3 shows a set of block components, several of which have 
action parameters assigned to them. After the block is inserted, you can 
manipulate the components to which you’ve added parameters to vary 
the appearance of the blocks. I explain how a little later in this chapter.
 
11. Click Close Block Editor on the Ribbon and save or discard your 
changes.
 
 AutoCAD closes the block-authoring environment and returns to the 
standard drawing editor window.
Manipulating dynamic blocks
After a dynamic block has been inserted in a drawing, you can select it 
and modify its display through a special set of custom grips. (That’s what 
AutoCAD calls them, so I’m following suit.)

376
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
Figure 18-3:

When you select a non-dynamic block, you see a single grip at the insertion 
point. When you select a dynamic block, you see at least two — and maybe 
more — custom grips, as well as the insertion point grip. The custom grips 
usually look different from the regular object grips, but not always, so take 
care when clicking grips.
The following steps show you how to make your dynamic blocks do the 
things you just spent all this time teaching them to do:
 
1. Insert a few blocks that contain some dynamic parameters, such as 
visibility or action parameters.
 
 If your block inserts don’t have any action parameters, go to Step 4.
 
2. Select a block that includes some action parameters.
 
 The block insert displays a number of grips (see Figure 18-4). If the 
insert displays only a single square grip, it isn’t a dynamic block.
 
3. Click one of the custom grips — for example, clicking a round grip 
opens the rotation parameter of the object. Rotate the component as 
required.

menu.
 
 For additional information on manipulating actions and visibility states, 
look up Dynamic Blocks in the online help system.
Dynamic blocks, as I’ve suggested more than once, are a powerful — and 
complicated — feature. Prior to AutoCAD 2010, the Block Authoring Palettes 
contained 10 selectable parameters, 8 actions, and 20 parameter sets. 
AutoCAD 2010 added 12 geometric constraints and 6 dimensional con-
straints. I’m thinking of writing a new book called AutoCAD Block Authoring 
For Dummies (although, truth be told, it may never happen). Until I do, 
AutoCAD’s online help system is your best resource for more information on 
all the possibilities of dynamic blocks. The quickest and most direct way to 
AutoCAD’s own help is to type Dynamic Blocks into the Search box on the 
program title bar.
Going External
In AutoCAD, an xref, or external reference, is a reference to another, external 
drawing file — one outside the current drawing — that you can make act as 
though it’s part of your drawing. Technically, a reference is simply a pointer 
from one file to another. The xref is the actual pointer, but many people call 
the combination of the pointer and the external file the xref.

378
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
In AutoCAD2011, external drawing files are just one of five different file types 
you can attach to your current drawing by using the Select Reference File 
dialog box. You use this dialog box to attach externally referenced AutoCAD 
drawings (xrefs), raster image files, DWF files, PDF files, and MicroStation 
DGN drawing files.
 
 Use the Attach button on the Insert tab’s Reference panel to open the Select 
Reference File dialog box. When you attach an external drawing to your cur-
rent drawing, you become the host of the external file. No need to break out 
the cocktails and canapés though . . . it’s actually your current drawing that’s 
doing the hosting and in AutoCAD, it’s called (what else?) the host drawing. 
You can think of the attached xrefs as guests, but most of the time they’re 
pretty well-behaved ones, and like the best of guests, they go away as soon as 
you want them to.
Xrefs have a big advantage over blocks: If a drawing is inserted as a block 
into another drawing, its geometry doesn’t change if the original drawing is 
changed in any way — it always looks the way it looks when it’s inserted. 
If that drawing is attached as an xref, however, AutoCAD will automatically 
update every host drawing to which it’s attached when the host drawing is 
reopened. You can also manually reload the changed xref if you don’t want to 
close and reopen the host drawing.
When you open a drawing that contains xrefs, AutoCAD displays a little 
symbol (which looks like papers with a binder clip) on the right end of the 
status bar. This symbol alerts you to the fact that some of the things you see 
in the drawing are actually parts of other, xrefed drawings. If an xref changes 
while you have the host drawing open (because you or someone else opens 
and saves the referenced drawing), the status bar xref symbol displays an 
External Reference Files Have Changed balloon notification. Simply 
click the Reload link in the balloon notification to show the updated xrefs. (If 
you want to change how AutoCAD checks for changes, look up XREFNOTIFY 
in the online help.)
Another advantage that xrefs have over blocks is that their contents aren’t 
stored in your drawing even once. The disk storage space taken up by the 
original drawing (that is, the xref) isn’t duplicated, no matter how many host 
drawings reference it. This characteristic makes xrefs much more efficient 
than blocks for larger drawings that are reused several times.
You can always buy a larger hard drive, however, so the storage issue isn’t 
crucial. The key benefit of xrefs is that they enable you to organize your 
drawings so that changes you make to a single drawing file automatically 
“ripple through” all the host drawings into which it’s xrefed. This benefit is 
even greater on larger projects involving multiple drafters, each of whose 
work may be incorporated in part or in whole in the work of others.

379
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
 
The automatic update feature of xrefs is a big advantage only if you’re orga-
nized about how you use xrefs. Suppose that an architect creates a plan draw-
ing showing a building’s walls and other major features that are common to 
the architectural, structural, plumbing, and electrical plan drawings. The 
architect then tells the structural, plumbing, and electrical drafters to xref this 
background plan into their drawings so that everyone is working from a con-
sistent and reusable set of common plan elements. If the architect decides to 
revise the wall locations and updates the xrefed drawing, everyone will see 
the current wall configuration and be able to change their drawings. But if the 
architect absentmindedly adds architecture-specific objects, such as toilets 
and furniture, to the xrefed drawing, or shifts all the objects with respect to 
0,0, everyone else will have problems. If different people in your office share 
xrefs, create a protocol for who is allowed to modify which file when, and 
what communication needs to take place after a shared xref is modified.
Becoming attached to your xrefs
Attaching an external reference drawing is similar to inserting a block, and 
almost as easy. Just use the following steps:
 
1. Set an appropriate layer current, as described in Chapter 6.
 
 It’s a good idea to insert xrefs on a separate layer from all other objects. 
Note that if you freeze the layer an xref is inserted on, the entire xref dis-
appears. (This behavior can be either a handy trick or a nasty surprise.)
 
2. If the External References palette isn’t already open, click its icon (it 
looks like a sheaf of papers with a bulldog clip and a silhouetted user) 
on the Palettes panel of the View tab to open it.
 
 The toolbar at the top of the palette lets you attach an external DWG file, 
a DWF underlay, a PDF underlay, a MicroStation DGN drawing file, or a 
raster image file. I cover attaching images and DWFs or PDFs later in this 
chapter. If you need to attach DGN files, visit the online help.
 
3. Click Attach DWG. (Click the down arrow if the tooltip offers to attach 
something else — see Figure 18-5.)
 
 The Select Reference File dialog box appears.
 
4. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, and then click 
Open.
 
 The Attach External Reference dialog box appears.

5. Specify the parameters for the xref in the dialog box.
 
 Parameters include the insertion point, scaling factors, location based 
on geographic data, and rotation angle (I describe geographic location 
briefly in Chapter 17). You can set these parameters in the dialog box 
or specify them on-screen, just as you can do when inserting a block, as 
described earlier in this chapter.
 
 You can select the Attachment or Overlay radio button to tell AutoCAD 
how to handle the xref. The choice matters only if you create a draw-
ing that uses xrefs, and then your drawing is, in turn, used as an xref. 
Attachment is the default choice, and it means that the xrefed file will 
always be included with your drawing when someone else uses your 
drawing as an xref. Overlay, the other choice, means that you see the 
xrefed drawing, but someone who xrefs your drawing won’t see the over-
laid file. By choosing Overlay, you can xref a map, for example, to your 
drawing of a house but not have the map show up when someone else 
xrefs your house drawing. (That person can xref the map, if need be.) I 
recommend that you use the default Attachment reference type unless 
you have a specific reason to do otherwise.

381
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
 
 The Path Type drop-down list provides more flexibility in how the xref’s 
path gets stored. See the “Forging an xref path” section, later in this 
chapter, for more information. For now, I recommend that you choose 
Relative Path instead of the default Full Path.
 6. 
Click OK.
 
 The externally referenced file appears in your drawing.
 
In drawings that contain a lot of xrefs, it can be difficult to locate the one you 
want. AutoCAD 2011 adds an enhancement to the External References palette: 
When you select an object that’s part of an xref in the drawing area, the xref’s 
name highlights in the External References palette. And likewise, selecting an 
xref in the External References palette highlights the attached file geometry in 
the drawing editor.
Layer-palooza
When you attach or overlay an xref, AutoCAD adds new layers to your cur-
rent drawing that correspond to the layers in the xrefed DWG file. The 
new layers are assigned names that combine the drawing name and layer 
name; for example, if you xref the drawing MYSCREW.DWG, which has the 
layer names GEOMETRY, TEXT, and so on, the xrefed layers will be named 
MYSCREW|GEOMETRY, MYSCREW|TEXT, and so on. By creating separate 
layers corresponding to each layer in the xrefed file, AutoCAD eliminates the 
potential problem with blocks I warn you about in Chapter 17, when layers 
have the same name but different color or linetype in the two drawings.
Creating and editing an 
external reference file
To create a file that you can use as an external reference, just create a draw-
ing and save it. That’s it. You can then create or open another drawing and 
create an external reference to the previous one. The xrefed drawing appears 
in the host drawing as a single object, like a block insert. In other words, if 
you click any object in the xref, AutoCAD selects the entire xref. You can 
measure or object snap to the xrefed geometry, but you can’t modify or 
delete individual objects in the xref — you open the xref drawing in order to 
edit its geometry.
The XOPEN command provides a quick way to open an xrefed drawing 
for editing. You just start the command and pick any object in the xref. 
Alternatively, you can select the xref in the External References palette and 

382
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
then right-click and choose Open to open one or more xrefs for editing. See 
the “Managing xrefs” section, later in this chapter, for more information.
 
 An alternative to opening the xrefed file when you need to edit it is to use the 
REFEDIT command. REFEDIT (short for Reference Edit) lets you edit the exter-
nal file from within the host drawing, rather than having to open the refer-
ence in its own window. Look up REFEDIT in the AutoCAD online help system 
index.
 
With several xrefs attached to your drawing, it can be difficult to tell which 
objects belong to the drawing you’re currently editing, and which are part of 
the xref. For several releases it’s been possible to fade a reference file while 
using REFEDIT. In AutoCAD 2011, you can fade your xrefs at all times, not just 
when you’re editing them, as follows:
 
1. Open a drawing containing an external reference drawing.
 
 Alternatively, you can attach a drawing to your current drawing by 
following the steps in the “Becoming attached to your xrefs” section, 
earlier in this chapter.
 
2. On the Insert tab, click the Reference panel label to open the Reference 
slideout.
 
 The Reference slideout also contains the Reference Edit button which 
runs the REFEDIT command described in the previous section.
 
 
3. Click the Xref Fading button to toggle reference fading off and on.
 
 
4. Drag the Xref Fading slider to increase or decrease the level of fading 
in the reference file.
 
 The default value is 70; increasing the value toward 90 (the maximum) 
increases the degree of fading, while lowering it reduces the fade level.
Forging an xref path
When you attach an xref, AutoCAD, by default, stores the xref’s full path — 
that is, the drive letter and sequence of folders and subfolders in which the 
DWG file resides — along with the filename. This default behavior corre-
sponds to the Full Path setting in the Path Type drop-down list. (Figure 18-6 
shows the three xref path options.) Full Path works fine as long as you never 
move files on your hard drive or network and never send your DWG files to 
anyone else — which is to say, it almost never works fine!
At the other end of the path spectrum, the No Path option causes AutoCAD not 
to store any path with the xref attachment — only the filename is stored. This 
is the easiest and best option if the host drawings and the xrefs reside in the 

383
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
same folder. However, if the host and the xref are in different folders, you have 
to browse to find the reference file every time you open the host drawing.
 
Figure 18-6: 
Follow the 
path less 
traveled 
when you 
attach an 
xref.
 
If you prefer to organize the DWG files for a particular project in more than 
one folder, you’ll appreciate AutoCAD’s Relative Path option, as shown in 
Figure 18-6. This option permits xrefing across more complex folder struc-
tures but avoids many of the problems that the Full Path option can cause. 
For example, you may have a host drawing, H:\Project-X\Plans\First 
floor.dwg, that xrefs H:\Project-X\Common\Column grid.dwg. If you 
choose Relative Path, AutoCAD will store the xref path as ..\ Common\
Column grid.dwg instead of H:\Project-X\Common\Column grid.dwg. 
Now if you decide to move the \Project-X folder and its subfolders to a 
different drive (or send them to someone else who doesn’t have an H: drive), 
AutoCAD can still find the xrefs.
 
When you use Relative Path, you’ll see xref paths that include the special 
codes . and .. (single and double period). The single period means this host 
drawing’s folder, and the double period means the folder above this host draw-
ing’s folder.
You can report on and change xref paths for a set of drawings with the 
AutoCAD Reference Manager (not in AutoCAD LT). See Chapter 20 for more 
information.
 
If all these path options and periods leave you feeling punchy, you can keep 
your life simple by always keeping host and xref drawings in the same folder 
and using the No Path option when you attach xrefs.

Managing xrefs
The External References palette includes many more options for managing 
xrefs after you attach them. Many of these options are hiding in right-click 
menus. Important options include
 ✓ 
List of external references: You can change between the List view and 
Tree view of your drawing’s external references just by clicking the 
appropriate button at the top of the palette (refer to Figure 18-5). You 
can resize the columns by dragging the column dividers or re-sort the 
list by clicking the column header names, just as in Windows Explorer.
 ✓ 
Unload: Right-click an xref and choose Unload to make the selected 
xref disappear from the on-screen display of your drawing and from any 
plots you do of it, but retain the pointer and attachment information. 
Right-click again and choose Reload to redisplay an unloaded xref.
 ✓ 
Reload: Right-click an xref and choose Reload to force AutoCAD to 
reread the selected xrefed DWG file from the disk and update your draw-
ing with its latest contents. This feature is handy when you share xrefs 
on a network and someone has just made changes to a drawing that 
you’ve xrefed.
 ✓ 
Detach: Right-click an xref in the External References palette and choose 
Detach to completely remove the selected reference to the external file 
from your drawing.
 ✓ 
Bind: Right-click an xref and choose Bind to bring the selected xref into 
your drawing and turn it into a block. You might use this function, for 
example, to roll up a complex set of xrefs into a single archive drawing.
 
 In many offices, binding xrefs without an acceptable reason for doing 
so is a crime as heinous as exploding blocks indiscriminately. In both 
cases, you’re eliminating an important data management link. Find out 
what the policies are in your company. When in doubt, keep yourself out 
of a bind. And even when you do have a good reason to bind, you gener-
ally should do it on a copy of the host drawing.
 ✓ 
Open: Right-click an xref and choose Open to open one or more xref 
drawings in separate drawing windows. After you edit and save an xref 
drawing, return to the host drawing and use the Reload option in the 
External References palette to show the changes.
None of these options (other than opening and editing the xref) affects the 
xrefed drawing itself; it continues to exist as a separate DWG file. If you need to 
delete or move the DWG file that the xref refers to, do it in Windows Explorer.
 
The fact that the xrefed drawing is a separate file is a potential source of 
problems when you send your drawing to someone else; that someone else 
needs all the files that your drawing depends on, or it will be useless. Make 
sure to include xrefed files in the package with your drawing. See Chapter 20 
for a procedure.

385
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
Both AutoCAD 2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011 include an additional xref feature 
called xref clipping. You can clip any kind of externally referenced file or a 
block insertion so only part of it appears in the host drawing. In addition to 
the XCLIP (for DWGS) and IMAGECLIP (for raster images) commands in ear-
lier AutoCAD (but not AutoCAD LT) versions, the new releases add PDFCLIP 
and DGNCLIP. Finally, the new CLIP command bundles all reference types 
into one command.
Blocks, Xrefs, and Drawing Organization
Blocks and xrefs are useful for organizing sets of drawings to use and update 
repeated elements. It’s not always clear, though, when to use blocks and 
when to use xrefs. Applications for xrefs include
 ✓ 
The parts of a title block that are the same on all sheets in a project.
 ✓ 
Reference elements that need to appear in multiple drawings (for exam-
ple, wall outlines, site topography, column grids).
 ✓ 
Assemblies that are repeated in one or more drawings, especially if the 
assemblies are likely to change together (for example, repeated framing 
assemblies, bathroom layouts, and modular furniture layouts).
 ✓ 
Pasting up several drawings (for example, details or a couple of plans) 
onto one plot sheet.
 ✓ 
Temporarily attaching a background drawing for reference or tracing.
On the other hand, blocks remain useful in simpler circumstances. Situations 
in which you might stick with a block are
 ✓ 
Components that aren’t likely to change.
 ✓ 
Small components.
 ✓ 
A simple assembly that’s used repeatedly but in only one drawing.
 ✓ 
When you want to include attributes (variable text fields) that you can fill 
in each time you insert a block. Blocks let you include attribute defini-
tions; xrefs don’t. Refer to Chapter 17 for the lowdown on attributes.
Everyone in a company or workgroup should aim for consistency as to when 
and how they use blocks and xrefs. Check whether guidelines exist for using 
blocks and xrefs in your office. If so, follow them; if not, it would be a good 
idea to develop some guidelines.

386
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Mastering the Raster
AutoCAD includes four more xref-like features: the ability to attach raster 
images, DWF files, PDF files, and DGN files to drawings. I cover DWF and PDF 
files in the next section and refer you to the online help if you should find 
some DGN files on your hands. The image feature is useful for adding a raster 
logo to a drawing title block or placing a photographed map or scene behind 
a drawing. A raster, or bitmapped, image is one that’s stored as a field of tiny 
points.
Most AutoCAD drawings are vector files. A vector drawing is a graphic file 
defined by storing geometrical definitions of a bunch of objects. Typical 
objects include a line, defined by its two endpoints, and a circle, defined by its 
center point and radius. Vector-based images are typically smaller (in terms of 
the disk space they occupy) and more flexible than raster images but also are 
less capable of displaying visually rich images, such as photographs.
Raster images often come from digital cameras or from other programs, such 
as Photoshop. Raster images also can come into the computer from some 
kind of scanner that imports a blueline print, photograph, or other image.
Whether you’re doing your own scanning or having a service bureau do it for 
you, you need to know that AutoCAD handles most of the popular image file 
formats, including: the Windows BMP format; the popular Web graphics for-
mats GIF and JPEG; common print formats like PCX, PNG, and TIFF; and the 
less popular DIB, FLC, FLI, GP4, MIL, RLE, RST, TGA, and several even more 
obscure ones.
Here are three scenarios in which you could incorporate raster images in 
your drawing:
 ✓ 
Small stuff: You can add logos, special symbols, and other small images 
that you have in raster files.
 ✓ 
Photographs and maps: You can add photographs (such as a future 
building site) and maps (for example, showing the project location).
 ✓ 
Vectorization: To convert a raster image into a vector drawing by tracing 
lines in the raster image, you can attach the raster image in your drawing, 
trace the needed lines by using AutoCAD commands, and then detach the 
raster image. (This procedure is okay for a simple raster image; add-on 
software is available, from Autodesk and others, to support automatic or 
semiautomatic vectorization of more complex images.)
Using raster images is much like using external references. The raster image 
isn’t stored with your drawing file; a reference to the raster image file is 
established from within your drawing, like an xref. You can clip the image 
and control its size, brightness, contrast, fade, and transparency. These con-
trols fine-tune the appearance of the raster image on-screen and on a plot.

387
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
 
When you attach raster images, you have to make sure that you send the 
raster files along when you send your drawing to someone else.
Attaching an image
Follow these steps to bring a raster image into AutoCAD:
 
1. If the External References palette isn’t already open, click its icon on 
the Palettes panel of the View tab to open it.
 
 Use the drop-down list on the first toolbar button to attach a drawing, 
an image, a DWF file, a PDF file, or a DGN file.
 
2. Click Attach Image and locate the image file you want to attach.
 
 The Select Reference File dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-7.
 
Figure 18-7: 
The Select 
Reference 
File dialog 
box.
 
 
3. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, and then click Open.
 
 The Attach Image dialog box appears.
 
 Click the Show Details button in the Attach Image dialog box to see more 
information about the resolution and image size of the image you’re 
attaching.
 
4. Specify the parameters for the attached image in the dialog box.
 
 Parameters include the insertion point, scale factor, and rotation angle. 
You can set these parameters in the dialog box or specify them on-
screen, similar to what you can do with blocks and external references, 
as described earlier in this chapter.
 
 The Attach Image dialog box includes the same Full Path, Relative Path, 
and No Path options as those for attaching xrefs. (See the “Forging an 
xref path” section, earlier in this chapter.)

388
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 5. 
Click OK.
 
 The image appears in your drawing.
 
6. If you need to ensure that the raster image floats behind other objects 
in the drawing, select the raster image, right-click, choose Draw 
Order, and then choose Send to Back.
 
 The DRAWORDER command provides additional options for which 
objects appear on top of which other objects. If you need this kind of 
flexibility, look up DRAWORDER command in the AutoCAD online help 
system.
Maintaining your image
You manage the images in your drawing with the External References palette. 
You can view a list of image files that appear in the current drawing, detach 
(remove) image references, and unload and reload images when needed. You 
can’t bind an image to your drawing; it always remains an external file.
You can clip images so that only part of the image is displayed in your draw-
ing. Choose Clip on the Insert tab’s Reference panel and follow the prompts 
to clip the image. You can have multiple overlapping or distinct pieces of any 
number of images in your drawing, and only the parts you need are loaded 
into memory when you have your drawing open.
 
Raster image files often are larger than DWG files of corresponding complex-
ity; raster file size can affect performance within AutoCAD because the raster 
file loads into memory when you’re working on your drawing. Some work-
arounds speed up operations:
 ✓ 
Attach raster images late in the production process.
 ✓ 
Create a lower-resolution version of the raster file, just large enough to 
create the desired effect in your drawing.
 ✓ 
Right-click over an image in the External References palette and choose 
Unload to temporarily hide an image without losing the attachment 
information.
In addition, raster files can increase the time that AutoCAD takes to generate 
plots (and the plot file sizes) dramatically. Before you settle on using large 
raster files in your AutoCAD drawing, do some testing on zooming, editing, 
and plotting.

389
 Chapter 18: Going Dynamic and External
You say PDF, I say DWF
Adobe’s PDF format has been around for a very long time, and for a while, it 
seemed like Autodesk was trying to supplant it with its own “universal” file 
format — DWF. That didn’t happen, but if you can’t beat them . . . AutoCAD 
now includes a very acceptable PDF printer driver, and both PDF and DWF 
are suitable candidates for external reference files.
DWF stands for Design Web Format. You could think of a DWF as “DWG Lite” 
because it looks just like a drawing file and contains some of the actual draw-
ing file data. I talk more about the Web side of DWFs in Chapter 20; in this 
section, I explain how you can use DWFs as well as PDFs as reference files in 
your own drawings. (Some people call DWF files dwiffs, but I’m going to hold 
off on that one until I start hearing DWG files called dwiggs.)
You create both DWFs and PDFs from within AutoCAD in one of two ways. 
Either choose Plot and select a DWF or PDF option in the Printer/Plotter 
name list, or choose Print➪Batch Plot from the Application Menu and select 
DWF, DWFx, or PDF in the Publish To area of the Publish dialog box. Both 
file types are compact and secure: You can’t edit either PDFs or DWFs in 
AutoCAD. Both formats are ideal for two purposes: You can post DWFs or 
PDFs on the Web, and you can send your drawings to consultants and cli-
ents in a form that they can’t mess up. You can attach PDFs or DWFs to your 
drawing files in pretty much the same way you attach drawings as external 
references. DWFs and PDFs attached to drawing files are referred to as DWF 
underlays or PDF underlays.
As with DWF and DGN attachments, you can object snap to entities in the 
PDF underlay by enabling the Snap to Underlays function in the Reference 
panel slideout on the Insert tab. Setting PDF parameters is virtually identical 
to setting DWF parameters, and you can attach a PDF to your drawing using 
exactly the same steps as the ones that follow.
The previous sections show how to attach a DWG and a raster image. Follow 
these steps to attach a DWF (or a PDF!) file as an underlay:
 
1. If the External References palette isn’t already open, click its icon on 
the Palettes panel of the View tab to open it.
 
 The toolbar at the top of the palette lets you attach an external file as 
an xref, a raster image file, or a DGN or DWF underlay. I cover attaching 
xrefs and images earlier in this chapter. See the online help for informa-
tion on attaching DGN files.

390
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
2. Click Attach DWF or Attach PDF and locate the file you want to attach.
 
 The Select Reference File dialog box appears.
 
3. Browse to find the file you want to attach, select it, and then click 
Open.
 
 The Attach DWF Underlay or Attach PDF Underlay dialog box appears.
 
4. Specify the parameters for the DWF or the PDF in the dialog box.
 
 Parameters include specifying a sheet, the insertion point, scaling fac-
tors, rotation angle, and path type (see Figure 18-8). You can set these 
parameters in the dialog box or specify them on-screen, just as you can 
do when inserting a block, attaching an xref, or attaching an image, as 
described earlier in this chapter.
 
Figure 18-8: 
The Attach 
PDF 
Underlay 
dialog box.
 
 5. 
Click OK.
 
 The externally referenced DWF or PDF file appears in your drawing.
 
Neither PDF nor DWF files are as precise as DWGs — that’s why they’re a lot 
smaller. When using object snaps to locate points in DWFs, you may see the 
word approximate on the Object Snap tooltip. If this is a problem, you can 
increase the precision of your DWF file when you create it.

Call the Parametrics!
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing parametric drawing
▶ Understanding constraints
▶ Applying geometric and dimensional constraints
▶ Using inferred constraints
▶ Editing parametric drawings
A
utoCAD 2010 included a set of parametric drawing tools and, offhand, 
I can’t think of a more significant new feature in recent years. (Don’t 
worry, I’m going to offer a definition of parametric in just a few more para-
graphs.) In fact, if you work primarily in 2D, and especially if you’re in the 
manufacturing business, the addition of parametrics to AutoCAD (and, to a 
very limited degree, to AutoCAD LT) is probably the most significant new fea-
ture ever.
If you know what I’m talking about, you’re probably pretty interested in find-
ing out more about what you can do with parametrics. If, on the other hand, 
you think parametrics are the folks who show up when you dial 911, the fol-
lowing paragraphs should straighten you out.
Maintaining Design Intent
Parametric (rule-based) drawing is by far the best way of enforcing design 
intent in 2D drafting. Design intent in AutoCAD 2011 (or any other engineering 
software) means that when drawings are edited — this part made wider, that 
hole made larger — all the attached or related objects behave in a predict-
able way that honors the designer’s intentions when she created the drawing 
in the first place.
Before AutoCAD 2010, there was simply no way of maintaining the design 
concepts that went into a drawing. You could use AutoCAD’s drawing and 
editing commands to draw accurate, precise plans, sections, and details, but 
as far as AutoCAD was concerned, they were just a bunch of lines and circles.

392
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Take, for example, that base plate drawing example in Chapter 3. Maybe 
the engineer has had a second look and determined that those 1 1/2 inch 
(38mm for the metric crowd) bolts aren’t quite up to the job — they need to 
be changed to 1 3/4 inch (44mm). To revise the drawing using AutoCAD in 
the traditional way, you draw a new, larger circle for the bolt and erase the 
old one. Now the nut is too small, and so is the hole in the plate (maybe you 
can’t see it, but you know and I know it’s there). There’s a whole lot of editing 
required to fix this drawing.
In AutoCAD 2011, you can add some intelligence to those lines and circles by 
applying constraints to them. For example, you could apply a dimensional 
constraint to the bolt circle and the hole circle such that the hole circle is 
always 1/16" (2mm) bigger than the bolt circle. And while you’re at it, you’d 
probably want to apply a concentric geometric constraint between the circles 
so that whenever the bolt circle moved, the hole circle moved with it.
Now that is intelligent design!
Defining terms
As you might have guessed, the adjective parametric is derived from the noun 
parameter (and so endeth today’s English lesson). If you look up parameter 
in most dictionaries, you’ll get an explanation in terms of pure math — and 
that’s waaaay deeper than you need to go. For the purposes of making draw-
ings in AutoCAD, think of a parameter as a rule — and therefore think of para-
metric drawing as rule-based drawing.
AutoCAD’s parametric rules — officially they’re called constraints — fall into 
two categories:
 ✓ 
Dimensional constraints: Based on dimensioned distances on or 
between objects or points on objects. For example, you could apply a 
dimensional constraint to two lines that represent a wall thickness so 
that regardless of where you moved them or how you rotated them, they 
would always be 6" apart.
 ✓ 
Geometric constraints: Based on object types and relationships 
between objects; different object types have different potential con-
straints. For example, you can apply a concentric constraint to an arc 
and a circle so that when you move one, it maintains its position in rela-
tion to the other.
 
Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT support constraints, but as is usually the 
case, the feature is limited in LT. If you use the full version, you can create 
and modify geometric and dimensional constraints, as I describe in the steps 
in this chapter. If you’re using LT, you can’t create either type of restraint, 
but you can work with existing constraints in drawings that were created in 

393
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
the full version. Figure 19-1 shows the difference between the AutoCAD and 
AutoCAD LT Parametric tabs.
 
If you’re using AutoCAD LT, or if you just want to check out some ready-made 
parametric possibilities, you can download the sample drawing datasets from 
either www.autodesk.com/autocad-samples or www.autodesk.com/
autocadlt-samples. The parametric samples are architectural_
example-imperial.dwg, civil_example-imperial.dwg, and 
mechanical_example-imperial.dwg.

Constrain yourself
You can apply dimensional or geometric constraints to new geometry as you 
create it, or you can assign constraints to existing geometry in old drawings. 
You can even convert existing associative dimensions to dynamic dimen-
sional constraints. The following sections describe the available constraints 
in each of the two categories. I start with dimensional constraints, as they’re 
conceptually a little easier to understand, and they nearly all have analogs to 
regular dimension commands (which I cover in Chapter 14).
Understanding Dimensional Constraints
The normal practice in AutoCAD is to create some geometry — of course, 
using all the precision techniques I discuss in Chapter 7 — and then apply 
dimensions as I describe in Chapter 14. Assuming that you’re using fully asso-
ciative dimensions, you can then edit the geometry and watch the dimen-
sions update automatically. The length of the line or the radius of the circle 
are in control, and those dimensions are called driven dimensions because 
they change when the object geometry changes.
Dimensional constraints, unlike regular AutoCAD dimensions, are driving 
dimensions, which means that when you change the value of a dynamic 

394
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
dimension on a line, the line changes to match — in other words, the length 
of the line is being driven by the dimension, not the other way around.
There are only eight dimensional constraint options, but they cover all the 
bases. Table 19-1 lists them and describes their purposes.

Practice a little constraint
 
The objects you add to your drawing from the Dimensional panel are not the 
same as the dimension objects you add from the Annotate tab. Dimensional 
constraints are driving dimensions — that means when you change the value 
of one of these dimensions, the geometry changes.
 
A lot is happening behind the scenes as you apply parametric constraints. You 
can get a great sense of how these constraints work at keeping your drawing 
objects in order by trying the STRETCH command on objects after you apply a 
constraint to them.

395
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
The following steps present a very simple example of dimensional constraints:
 
1. Start a new drawing and make the Ribbon’s Parametric tab current.
 
 Turn on some appropriate precision drawing aids on the status bar, 
such as Snap, Ortho, and Osnap.
 
2. Draw some reasonably precise geometry using some of those preci-
sion techniques I describe in earlier chapters.
 
 In the following example, I’ve used the RECTANG and CIRCLE commands 
to draw the geometry you see in Figure 19-2. The rectangle is 10 units 
square, and the 2.5-unit-radius circle is deliberately drawn away from 
the middle of the square.
 
 
3. On the Dimensional panel of the Parametric tab, click the top part of 
the Linear split button.
 
 
 A linear dimension icon appears beside the pickbox and AutoCAD 
prompts you to specify the first constraint point or pick an object.
 
 Just like the DIMLINEAR command, the Linear dimensional constraint 
tool is inferential — which way you drag the crosshairs controls whether 
you get a horizontal or vertical dimension. Also, just like DIMLINEAR, 
you can press Enter at the command prompt and select an object to 
dimension.

4. Press Enter at the command prompt to confirm you want to select an 
object and then select the bottom horizontal line segment.
 
 If you see red markers at the midpoint and ends of the bottom line, you 
didn’t press Enter, and you’re in point selection rather than object selec-
tion mode.
 
 AutoCAD generates a preview of a dimensional constraint and prompts 
you for a location.
 
5. Click to locate the dimension position.
 
 AutoCAD draws a dimensional constraint with a highlighted text field 
displaying the dimension name (d1 in this example) and the value 
returned by AutoCAD. You could type a new value in the edit box, but 
for now, just press Enter to confirm the value and the dimension loca-
tion (see Figure 19-3).
 
 If your dimensional constraints disappear as soon as you place them, 
click the Show All button on the Parametric tab’s Dimensional panel as 
shown in Figure 19-3.

 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
 
 Dimensional constraints are not regular dimension objects — they’re 
not going to plot, so it doesn’t really matter where you put them or what 
they look like. I show you how to turn dimensional constraints into prop-
erly styled, plottable dimensions in the next section.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 and add a dimensional constraint to the right verti-
cal edge of the rectangle.
 
 AutoCAD draws a second dimensional constraint, this one named d2.
 
As you mouse over the Linear button, you can see that unlike its Aligned 
neighbor, it’s split into two parts. You can force a linear dimensional con-
straint to be either horizontal or vertical (rather than dependent on the direc-
tion in which you drag your crosshairs) by clicking the bottom part of the 
Linear button and making your choice from the flyout.
Making your drawing even smarter
If this were a traditional mechanical drawing that followed the rules of draft-
ing, those two dimensions would be enough — whoever is reading your draw-
ing understands that if sides are parallel and perpendicular, a dimension on 
one side applies to the opposite side as well. But in this chapter, I’m talking 
about intelligent drawings that respect design intent, not dumb collections of 
lines and circles, even if they do follow the rules of drafting!
If you try stretching the rectangle in various ways, you can see that only the 
bottom and right sides are constrained to 10 units in length. You could add 
two more linear dimensional constraints to the unconstrained sides, but then 
you’d have to remember to edit both dimensions. Rather than constraining 
both sides to be 10 units long, the way to maintain design intent is to make 
both sides equal in length.
 
You can make the two sides equal using either dimensional or geometric con-
straints. It’s sometimes a good idea to apply some geometric constraints to 
your drawing so objects are at least a little locked down. In fact, in a real-world 
workflow, you’d be using both geometric and dimensional constraints as you 
produce your design.
I cover geometric constraints in a little more detail in the “Understanding 
Geometric Constraints” section, later in the chapter, but for now, I’m going to 
apply three geometric constraints so the drawing behaves more predictably.
 
 
 
1. On the Geometric panel of the Parametric tab, click Fix (the padlock 
icon) and click the lower-left corner of the rectangle.

398
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
 
2. On the Geometric panel, click Horizontal and click the bottom side of 
the rectangle. Then click Vertical and click the left side.
 
 Icons appear near the drawing geometry, showing that those three geo-
metric constraints are active (see Figure 19-6 a few pages ahead).
 
 I explain those icons — and geometric constraints, in general — in the 
next section, but I’m going back to dimensional constraints to finish this 
drawing.
 
3. On the Dimensional panel of the Parametric tab, click Linear and add 
a dimensional constraint to the top horizontal line.
 
4. Click to locate the dimension, type d1, and press Enter when AutoCAD 
prompts for the dimension text.
 
 Instead of having numeric values like the first two linear constraints, this 
new dimensional constraint displays fx: d3=d1.
 
 The main part of this expression sets the d3 dimension to equal the 
value of the d1 dimension. The fx: is there just to remind you that other 
variables in other dimensions are being referenced.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, this time adding a constraint to the vertical line 
at the left and entering d2 as the dimension text.
 
 All four dynamic dimensional constraints display their name plus a value 
or expression.
 
Dimensional constraints have names as well as values. They can also include 
expressions or formulas. You can set the default appearance of dynamic 
dimensional constraints by clicking the dialog-box launcher (the little arrow at 
the right end of the Dimensional panel label) to open the Constraint Settings 
dialog box with the Dimensional tab active (see Figure 19-4). The options are
 ✓ 
Name: The first linear dimension is named d1, the second d2, and so 
forth. You use the dimension names in expressions.
 ✓ 
Value: The numeric value that you enter into the dimensional constraint 
or that AutoCAD enters if you don’t override it.
 ✓ 
Name and Expression: The dimension name shown as equal to an 
expression. The expression can be a value, as in this example, or it can 
be a formula.

Using the Parameters Manager
Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT include the Parameters Manager palette, 
accessible on the Manage panels of their Ribbon’s Parametric tab. You can 
use the Parameters Manager to give all those dimensional constraints more 
sensible names than d1 and d2, but even more usefully, you can enter expres-
sions instead of plain numeric values, as I explain in the following steps.
 
 
1. Click Parameters Manager in the Manage panel.
 
 
 The Parameters Manager palette appears, showing a list of dimensional 
constraints currently applied in the drawing (see Figure 19-5).

 In Figure 19-5, the Expression column shows the numeric values I speci-
fied for d1 and d2 and the expressions I entered for d3 and d4. The 
read-only Value column shows the calculated value. You can’t change a 
value in the Value column; you can only edit the cells in the Expression 
column.
 
2. In the d1 row, click in the Expression field to highlight the current 
value (10 in this example), then click again and type a new value. For 
example, type 13 and press Enter.
 
 The rectangle resizes itself in the drawing editor, and because the d3 
constraint on the top side was made equal to the d1 constraint on the 
bottom side, both sides change equally.
 
 Next, use an equation as an expression.
 
3. In the d2 row, click in the Expression field to highlight the current 
value and then type an expression. For example, type d1*0.75 and 
press Enter.
 
 The read-only Value column as well as the drawing geometry show that 
the new d1 distance of 13 has been multiplied by 0.75 and is now 9.75 
(see Figure 19-6).
 
Figure 19-6:

constraints

Parameters 
Manager.
 
 
4. Close the Parameters Manager.
 
 Finally, constrain the circle so its center is always at dead center of the 
rectangle, no matter how the rectangle’s size changes.
 
5. Apply a horizontal dimensional constraint from the upper-left corner 
of the rectangle to the center of the circle. Locate the dimension and 
then type d3/2 and press Enter.
 
 Because the rectangle is now dimensionally constrained on all four 
sides, it doesn’t really matter which corner you start from. And note that 
you don’t have to type the whole expression d5=d3/2. AutoCAD knows 
what you mean!

401
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
 
6. Repeat Step 5, this time adding a vertical constraint from one of the 
corners to the center of the circle. Locate the dimension and then 
type d4/2.
 
 Figure 19-7 shows the object geometry with all constraints added in this 
section. Who knew that drafting could be such fun?

AutoCAD 2011 adds parameter filters to the Parameters Manager palette. 
Right-click any parameter and choose Show Filter Tree, or click the double 
right arrow at the top left of the palette to open the Filters pane. Click the 
funnel icon in the toolbar to create a new filter group, then simply drag and 
drop parameters into the group. Figure 19-8 shows the two constraints added 
in Steps 5 and 6 dragged into a new group filter.

Dimensions or constraints — 
have it both ways!
After all that hard work adding dimensional constraints to your drawings, 
it would be a downright shame to have to go back and apply regular dimen-
sions, wouldn’t it? Well — you don’t have to — you can make dimensional 
constraints look and behave like regular dimensions. You can go the other 
way too and make your regular dimensions act like dimensional constraints.
Dimensional constraints are available in two flavors:
 ✓ 
Dynamic constraints: The default form. Dynamic constraints appear 
gray with a padlock icon next to them in the drawing area. You can make 
them appear and disappear by clicking Show All in the Dimensional 
panel. They don’t plot, and they resize as you zoom in and out of the 
drawing so they’re always legible.
 ✓ 
Annotational constraints: This form is controlled as an object property, 
so you have to set it in the Properties palette. Annotational constraints 
do plot, don’t resize as you zoom in and out, and don’t disappear as you 
toggle the Show All button on and off. Annotational constraints conform 
to dimension style settings.
 
The dimension name format of annotational constraints can be set to 
Name, Value, or Name and Expression, just like dynamic constraints (refer to 
Figure 19-4 for another look at the Constraint Settings dialog box). If you’re 
going to plot your drawing with annotational constraints, remember to reset 
the format so it doesn’t show the dimension name or the expression.
Here’s how to turn dynamic dimensional constraints into annotational 
constraints.
 
1. Open a drawing that contains some geometry with dimensional 
constraints.
 
 You can also start a new drawing, draw some simple geometry, and add 
a dimensional constraint to two.
 
2. Select a dynamic constraint, right-click, and choose Properties.
 
 The Properties palette opens with the object properties of the selected 
dimensional constraint listed in table form.
 
3. Click in the Constraint Form field and in the drop-down list, change 
Dynamic to Annotational (see Figure 19-9).
 
 The dynamic constraint becomes annotational and takes on the appear-
ance of the current dimension style. If you change the dimension style 
in the Properties palette, the annotational constraint updates to the new 
dimension style format.

403
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
 
Figure 19-9: 
Turning 
dynamic 
constraints 
into annota-
tional ones.
 
 
 You can go the other way too, from regular dimension objects to dimen-
sional constraints.
 
4. Add a linear, radius, diameter, aligned, or angular dimension to your 
drawing geometry.
 
 Nearly every type of dimension object has a parametric analog; the 
exceptions are arc length, jogged radius, jogged linear, and ordinate 
dimensions.
 
 
5. Click Convert in the Dimensional panel, select one of the dimension 
types in Step 4, and press Enter.
 
 
 The Dimensional Constraint text box displays as soon as you click an 
associative dimension, and the dimension becomes a dynamic con-
straint as soon as you press Enter.
 
The only clue that a dimension is an annotational constraint rather than a 
regular old associative dimension is the padlock icon that appears next to the 
dimension value. You can turn off the display of the padlock in the Constraint 
Settings dialog box, but I recommend you leave it on. It doesn’t plot anyway, 
and you might decide to delete the dimension without realizing it’s controlling 
your object geometry.

404
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Understanding Geometric Constraints
Adding geometric constraints to object geometry may take a little getting 
used to because it’s unlike anything AutoCAD has offered before.
In a few cases, AutoCAD’s geometric constraints have equivalent object 
snaps. There are tangent, parallel, and perpendicular object snaps and 
tangent, parallel, and perpendicular geometric constraints. The difference 
between these relations as object snaps and geometric constraints is that 
constraints are persistent.
For example, you can draw a line at any angle, start another line, turn on par-
allel object snap, and create a second line that’s parallel to the first. But then 
you can easily rotate either line so they’re no longer parallel. If, however, you 
apply a parallel constraint to the second line, it will rotate with the first line, 
always maintaining that parallel relation until you delete the constraint.
There are 12 geometric constraints you can apply to your drawing objects, 
and the easiest way to apply them is by clicking buttons on the Geometric 
panel of the Ribbon’s Parametric tab. Table 19-2 presents a list of the geomet-
ric constraints and explains their function.

Text objects can now be geometrically constrained (this is right up there 
with my favorite new features in AutoCAD 2011). You can apply horizontal or 
vertical constraints to text, and you can make text parallel, perpendicular, or 
collinear with lines. Anyone who’s had to label utility lines on civil engineering 
drawings in earlier releases (who. . . moi??) so the text aligns with the linework 
will be very happy with this one!
Applying a little more constraint
If you’re using the full version of AutoCAD (not AutoCAD LT), you can geo-
metrically constrain drawing objects by clicking buttons on the Geometric 
panel of the Parametric tab. In the following steps, I show you how to get 
started with geometric constraints.
 
1. Start a new drawing. Make the Ribbon’s Parametric tab current and 
turn off Snap, Ortho, Polar, Osnap, and Otrack at the status bar.
 
 For real drafting, you probably want to use these precision aids, but for 
this example, you get a better sense of parametrics with a really impre-
cise drawing.

406
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
2. Draw some linework using the PLINE command and add a couple of 
circles.
 
 Draw something similar to Figure 19-10 if you want to follow closely.
 
 Every drawing is going to be tackled differently, and it’s a good idea to 
think ahead and figure out the most efficient way to apply the constraints 
you need so that your design intent is maintained. In this example, I want 
to end up with two concentric circles in the middle of a square.
 
 As I mention earlier, you’ll find it a lot easier to apply constraints if at 
least one point on the geometry is fixed in space. In many cases, one of 
the first constraints you should think about applying is Fix, the one that 
constrains a point to one location in the drawing area.
 
 In this example, I’m going to lock one of the endpoints of the polyline 
into position.
 
Figure 19-10: 
Random 
shapes that 
badly need 
constrain-
ing.
 
 
 
3. Click Fix in the Geometric panel and then click a point you want to fix 
in space.
 
 
 A blue padlock icon is displayed beside the pickbox, and the red pick 
point marker appears when you’re over a point you can constrain (see 
Figure 19-11). In this example, I click one of the endpoints on the poly-
line. A padlock icon appears in the constraint bar indicating the end-
point of the polyline segment is fixed in place.

407
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
 
Figure 19-11: 
Locking 
down an 
object in 
drawing 
space.
 
 
 With at least one point on the geometry fixed in place, I start constrain-
ing the geometry by closing the gap in the linework.
 
 
4. Click Coincident in the Parametric tab’s Geometric panel.
 
 
 You use a coincident constraint to make two points coincide. A blue 
coincident icon appears near the pickbox and, as you move your cross-
hairs over an object, a marker appears over relevant points — in the 
case of lines or polyline segments, at the endpoints and midpoint.
 
 Use appropriate drawing commands based on your design intent. I use 
a polyline in this example because the ends of the segments are already 
coincident-constrained by being part of a single polyline object. If I draw 
this shape with lines, I have to apply individual coincident constraints to 
each corner.
 
5. Click an endpoint on the first polyline segment you want to connect 
and then click an endpoint on the second segment.
 
 The endpoint of the second polyline segment jumps to the endpoint of 
the first line, and a small blue square — the marker for coincident con-
straints — appears at the intersection. (If you don’t see the little blue 
square, click Show All in the Geometric panel.)
 
 Next, I apply some orthographic parameters so my linework starts to 
look a little more like a rectangle.
 
 
6. Click Horizontal in the Parametric tab’s Geometric panel and then 
click a line or polyline segment you want to be aligned with the draw-
ing’s X-axis.

408
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
 The segment realigns itself horizontally from the endpoint nearest to 
where you picked the line (unless a Fix constraint is added first), and 
a horizontal constraint marker — officially called a constraint bar — 
appears near the object.
 
 
7. Click Vertical to align a line or polyline segment with the drawing’s 
Y-axis.
 
 
 The segment realigns itself at 90 degrees to the horizontal segment, and 
a constraint bar showing a vertical constraint appears. With one hori-
zontally and one vertically constrained line segment, you’re halfway to a 
geometrically precise rectangle!
 
 Because rectangles have parallel and perpendicular sides, next I apply 
those constraints to my linework.
 
 
8. Click Parallel in the Parametric tab’s Geometric panel, click the 
vertically constrained line segment, and then click the line segment 
opposite.
 
 Because there’s already a vertical constraint applied to one segment, it 
doesn’t matter which line you pick first. If neither line had an existing 
constraint, the second line you picked would become parallel to the 
first line.
 
 Always keep your design intent in mind as you think about which con-
straints to apply and when to apply them. As a general rule, it’s good to 
start with the most important and drill down to the least important. And, 
as I remind you above, applying a fix constraint early in the game can 
prevent your geometry rearranging itself in ways you don’t expect.
 
 To make the final side of the almost-rectangle orthogonal with the other 
three, I could use another parallel constraint and click the bottom 
line. However, I don’t want to wear out my Parallel button, so I’ll use 
Perpendicular on the final segment.
 
 
9. Click Perpendicular on the Geometric panel, click either of the verti-
cal sides, and then click the non-orthogonal side.
 
 
 Again, because three of the four sides are already constrained to hori-
zontal and vertical, it doesn’t matter which segment you pick first.
 
 To delete a constraint, move the mouse pointer over the constraint 
marker to display the constraints bar (see Figure 19-12), right-click and 
choose Delete.
 
 From four nonorthogonal, not even closed line segments, applying a 
handful of constraints yields a perfect rectangle — but I really want a 
square! Here’s where the equal constraint comes in.
 
 10. Click Equal on the Geometric panel, click the bottom side, and then 
click either of the vertical sides.
 
 
 A perfect square! Now I want to constrain those circles.

409
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!
 
Figure 19-12: 
Constraining 
to orthogo-
nal.
 
 
 My design intent in this example is to have the circles be concentric and 
to locate their centers in the exact center of the rectangle. First the easy 
part: Making the circles concentric.
 
 11. Click Concentric in the Geometric panel, click one circle, and then 
click the other.
 
 
 The two circles are concentrically constrained (try saying that ten times 
in a hurry!), and a new constraint bar appears in their vicinity. Try 
moving one circle by clicking it and watch the other tag along.
 
 As I suggested, concentric was the easy constraint. I’d love to be able to 
use the Mid Between 2 Points object snap and just click two diagonally 
opposite corners to locate the circles dead center in the rectangle.
 
 However, you can constrain only objects or points on objects, so I’m 
going to have to add some construction geometry in order to maintain 
my design intent.
 
12. Draw a line between diagonally opposite corners using Endpoint 
object snaps and then apply coincident constraints between the end-
points of this line and the corners of the rectangle (see Figure 9-13).
 
 Draw construction geometry on a separate layer and set that layer to 
NoPlot in the Layer Properties Manager. If you don’t want to even see it, 
let alone not plot it, you can turn off your construction geometry layer 
or even freeze it — the geometric constraints will still work.

410

Figure 19-13:

13. Click Coincident in the Geometric panel. Click either circle so the 
parametric marker appears in the center, move the pickbox over the 
construction line, and click when the parametric marker is over the 
midpoint of the line.
 
 You’re done (whew!). You can test your design intent by using the 
STRETCH command on the corner of the rectangle that doesn’t display 
a little square, blue coincident icon. As you drag the corner, you should 
see the two circles moving too, always maintaining their position in the 
middle of the rectangle (see Figure 19-14).
 
Parametrics was a new feature in AutoCAD 2010, but it gets a considerable 
enhancement in AutoCAD 2011 with the addition of inferred constraints. A 
new status bar button (to the left of the Snap button) toggles Infer Constraints 
mode off and on. When inferred constraints is enabled, you don’t even have 
to specifically apply geometric constraints. For example, in AutoCAD 2010, if 
you wanted to make sure the endpoint of a line was always coincident with 
the center of a circle, you had to select the Coincident tool and click the two 
points. With inferred constraints, AutoCAD automatically applies a coincident 
constraint to these two points. Inferred constraints are a powerful addition to 
parametric drafting in AutoCAD 2011, but I recommend  you first make your-
self familiar with manually applying constraints as I show in this chapter.

411
 Chapter 19: Call the Parametrics!

Autoconstrain yourself!
 
 The geometric constraints listed in Table 19-2 are meant to be applied one at 
a time. It’s great to have that flexibility, but it can be pretty darned time-
consuming to go around a complex object, trying to figure out what the best 
constraint option would be and then applying it.
The Auto Constrain button on the Parametric tab’s Geometric panel can 
apply a whack of constraints to a selection of objects with a single click — 
but before you execute that single click, it’s worth taking a look at the Auto 
Constrain settings. Click the dialog box launcher (the little arrow at the right 
end of the Geometric panel label) to open the Constraint Settings dialog box 
and make the AutoConstrain tab active (see Figure 19-15). Choose which 
constraints you want to apply automatically, and what order you want them 
in the list so the ones that should take precedence have a higher priority. 
Auto Constrain works only with geometric constraints, not with dimensional 
constraints.
The three buttons at the right side of AutoCAD’s Geometric panel — and the 
only buttons on AutoCAD LT’s Geometric panel — are for controlling the vis-
ibility of geometric constraint markers. Show All shows them all, and Hide All 
(surprise!) hides them all. Use the Show button to display the constraints on 
selected objects. This last button is a little clunky. It would be nice to be able 
to hover over an object and have the constraints show, but you actually have 
to click an object and then press Enter to see any results.

Although in this chapter, I present the two varieties of parametric constraints 
separately, you’ll get the most mileage from this feature when you incorporate 
both geometric and dimensional constraints with all those other precision 
techniques I tell you about in Chapter 7. In fact, if you start a drawing using 
Snap, Ortho, Osnap, and other precision techniques before you start adding 
dimensional and parametric constraints, you’ll be well on the way to creating 
a library of intelligent drawings that maintain your design intent.

U
nless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 20 years, you know 
that the Internet is causing major changes in the way people work. 
Because of the Net, most of us communicate differently, exchange files more 
rapidly, and phone out for pizza less frequently.
In this chapter, I show you how and when to use AutoCAD’s Internet features. 
I also cover how the Internet features can connect with traditional CAD tasks, 
such as plotting. The emphasis of this chapter is on useful, no-nonsense ways 
to take advantage of the Internet in your CAD work.
The Internet and AutoCAD: An Overview
As with all things Webby, the Internet features in AutoCAD are a hodgepodge 
of the genuinely useful, the interesting but still somewhat immature or dif-
ficult to use, and the downright foolish. In this chapter, I steer you toward 
features and techniques that are reliable and widely used today and away 
from features that (to put it kindly) might not be ready for prime time. On 
the other hand, a few of today’s questionable features may become the reli-
able, commonplace ones of tomorrow. I give you enough context to see how 
everything works and where it may lead. Table 20-1 summarizes AutoCAD’s 
Internet features and tells you where in this book to find more information.

Sending Strategies
E-mail and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) have largely replaced blueline prints 
and overnight delivery as the standard means of exchanging drawings. 
Some companies even use specially designed Web-based services, such as 
Autodesk’s Buzzsaw, as a repository for project drawings from all the com-
panies working on a particular project. Whether you’re exchanging drawings 
in order to reuse CAD objects or simply to make hard-copy plots of someone 
else’s drawings, you need to be comfortable sending and receiving drawings 
electronically.

416
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Sending and receiving DWG files doesn’t differ much from sending and receiv-
ing other kinds of files, except for the following:
 ✓ 
DWG files tend to be bigger than word processing documents and 
spreadsheets. Consequently, you may need to invest in a faster Internet 
connection. For instance, if you still rely on dialup modem access to 
the Internet, you may want to consider upgrading to broadband access, 
such as DSL or cable.
 ✓ 
You can easily forget to include all the dependent files. I tell you in the 
next section how to make sure that you send all the necessary files — and 
how to pester the people who don’t send you all their necessary files.
 ✓ 
It’s often not completely obvious how to plot what you receive. Read 
Chapter 16 and the “Bad reception?” section, later in this chapter, to 
solve plotting puzzles.
 
Whenever you send DWG files together, follow the Golden Rule of Drawing 
Exchange: “Send files unto others as you would have them sent unto you.” 
That means sending all the dependent files along with the main DWG files, 
sending plotting support files (CTB or STB files — see Chapter 16), and includ-
ing a description of what you’re sending. And ask the recipient to try opening 
the drawings you sent right away so you both have more time to respond if 
there’s any problem.
Send it with ETRANSMIT
Many people naively assume that an AutoCAD drawing is always contained in 
a single DWG file, but that’s often not the case. Each drawing file created in 
AutoCAD can contain references to other kinds of files, the most important of 
which are described in Table 20-2. Thus, before you start exchanging draw-
ings via e-mail or FTP, you need a procedure for assembling the drawings 
with all their dependent files.

problems within the drawing. If, on the other hand, you forget to send xrefs 
or raster graphics that are attached to your main drawing, the objects con-
tained on those attached files simply will be gone when the recipient opens 
your drawing. Not good!
 
Table 20-2 doesn’t exhaust the types of files that your DWG files might refer 
to. Custom plotter settings (such as custom paper sizes) may reside in PC3 or 
PMP files. If you use sheet sets, a DST file contains information about the sheet 
structure. An FMP file controls some aspects of font mapping. Look up sheet 
sets and the FONTALT and FONTMAP system variables in the AutoCAD online 
help system for detailed information.
Rapid eTransmit
Fortunately, AutoCAD’s ETRANSMIT command pulls together all the files that 
your main DWG file depends on. Follow these steps to assemble a drawing 
with all its dependent files by using ETRANSMIT:
 
1. Open the drawing that you want to run ETRANSMIT on.
 
 If the drawing is already open, save it. ETRANSMIT requires that any 
changes to the drawing be saved before you proceed.
 
 
2. Click the Application button and choose Send.
 
 
 The Create Transmittal dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-1.
 
3. On the Files Tree or Files Table tab, remove the check mark next to 
any file that you want ETRANSMIT not to copy with the main drawing.
 
 Unless you have assigned custom font mapping, you can omit the Acad.
fmp file.

Figure 20-1:

eTransmit.
 
 
4. Select a transmittal setup from the list.
 
 Transmittal setups contain settings that control how ETRANSMIT pro-
cesses the drawings and creates the transmittal package. Click the 
Transmittal Setups button to create new or modify existing setups. 
The default Standard transmittal setup works fine for many purposes, 
except that you probably want to turn on the Include Fonts setting, as 
described in the next paragraph. In any case, you should view the set-
tings (click the Modify button) just to see what options you can change 
if you need to later.
 
 If you want AutoCAD to include SHX and TTF font files, including any 
custom fonts that you’re using, you must turn on the Include Fonts set-
ting in the transmittal setup. (Click Transmittal Setups, click Modify, and 
check the Include Fonts check box.) Note, however, that many SHX and 
TTF files are custom fonts, which work like licensed software. Sending 
them to others is just like sharing your AutoCAD program DVD with 
others. No, I don’t mean that it’s easy and fun; I mean that it’s illegal and 
unethical. Before you send a custom font file to someone else, find out 
the licensing restrictions on the font and work within them.
 
5. Click the View Report button.
 
 You see a report listing the files that ETRANSMIT will copy, along with 
warnings about any files that it can’t locate.
 
6. Review the report and make sure that ETRANSMIT was able to find all 
the files.

419
 Chapter 20: Drawing on the Internet
 7. 
Click OK.
 
 ETRANSMIT displays a file dialog box so that you can specify the name 
and location of the transmittal package.
 8. 
Click Save.
 
 ETRANSMIT creates the transmittal package (which is a Zip file by 
default). Zipping creates a single, tidy package of all your DWG, raster 
image, plot style table, and font files.
FTP for you and me
FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a simple but robust protocol for copying files 
over the Internet. A computer that’s connected to the Internet can act as 
an FTP server, which means that part of its hard disk is accessible over the 
Internet. The person who configures the FTP server can place restrictions so 
that only people who enter a particular logon name and password can see 
and download files. FTP overcomes the file size limitations that often occur 
with e-mail.
Because of all these FTP benefits, it’s increasingly common for people at 
larger companies to place drawing files on their company’s FTP site and tell 
you to go get them. This approach relieves them of having to e-mail you the 
files, and relieves you of waiting for that 10 MB e-mail download when you 
least expected it.
In most cases, the person making the files available to you via FTP will send 
you a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that looks like a Web page address, 
except that it starts with ftp:// instead of http://. If you open your Web 
browser and enter the FTP URL into the address field, the browser connects 
to the FTP site, asks you for a location and name to use for the file when it 
gets copied to your system, and begins downloading the file. If the FTP site 
uses password protection, you’ll have to enter a logon name and password 
first.
If you want fancier FTP download options, you can use an FTP utility such as 
CuteFTP (www.cuteftp.com).
Bad reception?
Other sections in this chapter focus on sending files to others. What happens 
when you’re on the receiving end? Not everyone will be as conscientious as 
you are about following the Golden Rule of Drawing Exchange. You’ll receive 
drawings with missing dependent files and no information or support files for 
plotting.

420
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
When you receive an e-mail message or FTP download containing drawings 
(zipped, I hope!), copy the file to a new folder on your hard disk or a network 
disk and unzip the files.
 
Check at least a few of the drawings in the package to make sure that all the 
xrefs, fonts, and raster image files were included. You can perform this check 
by opening each main drawing in that folder. After you open each file, press 
the F2 key to view the AutoCAD text window and look for missing font and xref 
error messages of the following sort:
Substituting [simplex.shx] for [helv.shx].
Resolve Xref “GRID”: C:\Here\There\Nowhere\grid.dwg
Can’t find C:\Here\There\Nowhere\grid.dwg
A Substituting . . . message indicates that AutoCAD couldn’t find a 
font and is substituting a different font for it. A Can’t find . . . mes-
sage indicates that AutoCAD couldn’t locate an xref. Any missing raster files 
appear as rectangular boxes with the names of the image files inside the 
rectangles. Missing DWFs appear as an error message at the insertion point. 
Alternatively, you can open the External References palette, which reveals 
any missing referenced files. (See Chapter 18 for details.)
Write down each missing file and then tell the sender to get on the ball (in a 
nice way, of course) and send you the missing pieces. While you’re at it, tell 
that person to buy this book and read this chapter! Or buy it for them yourself!
 
If you receive drawings with custom TrueType font files (files whose exten-
sions are TTF), you must install those files in Windows (not AutoCAD) before 
Windows and AutoCAD will recognize them. Refer to your Windows version’s 
online help for instructions on installing fonts.
Help from the Reference Manager
In Chapter 18, I warn you about the complications of xref paths and the 
potential perils of AutoCAD not being able to locate xrefs if you move proj-
ect folders around or transfer drawings to or from someone else. A similar 
danger exists for raster image files and DWF/DWFx, DGN, and PDF underlays 
(Chapter 18) and for font files (Chapter 13). The ETRANSMIT command, 
described in the section “Rapid eTransmit,” earlier in this chapter, does a 
good job of gathering dependent xrefs, raster files, and font files, but it can’t 
gather what AutoCAD can’t locate.
AutoCAD’s Reference Manager utility (not included with AutoCAD LT) is a 
real lifesaver if you find yourself suffering from file path perils — whether 
they occur in your own company or when sending files to or receiving them 
from others.

421
 Chapter 20: Drawing on the Internet
Reference Manager is a separate program, not a command inside AutoCAD. 
Follow these steps to launch the utility from your Windows desktop:
 1. 
Choose Start➪All Programs➪Autodesk➪AutoCAD 2011➪Reference 
Manager.
 
 The Reference Manager program opens, as shown in Figure 20-2.
 
Figure 20-2:

2. Click the Add Drawings button to add one or more DWG files to the 
Drawings pane on the left.
 
 Navigate to the folder that contains the drawings you want to send, 
select them, and click Open.
 
3. In the Reference Manager – Add Xrefs dialog box, choose Add All 
Xrefs Automatically Regardless of Nesting Level.
 
 The Reference Manager processes the drawings and displays all refer-
enced objects in its right pane.
 
4. Click Export Report to create a text report listing all the dependent 
files and their paths, or click Edit Selected Paths to modify paths of 
selected reference files.
 
 Click the Help button in Reference Manager to find out more about the 
utility’s capabilities.
 
If you always keep parent and child DWG files in the same folder — the sim-
plest approach to dealing with xref paths — you probably won’t need to use 
the Reference Manager.

Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Design Web Format — Not 
Just for the Web
Earlier in this chapter, I explain how you can exchange drawings via e-mail 
and FTP. That’s all the Internet connectivity that many AutoCAD users need, 
but if you’re curious about connecting drawings to the Web or sharing draw-
ings with people who don’t have AutoCAD, this section is for you.
The AutoCAD Web features are built on three pieces of technology:
 ✓ 
A special “lightweight” drawing format called DWF that Autodesk origi-
nally developed especially for putting drawings on the Web.
 ✓ 
An updated, XML-compliant version of the DWF format called DWFx that 
can be viewed using the Microsoft XPS Viewer that’s built in to Windows 
Vista and Windows 7 or available as a plug-in for Windows XP.
 ✓ 
A free program from Autodesk called Autodesk Design Review 2011 that 
enables anyone to view, mark up, and print DWF files without having 
AutoCAD.
All about DWF and DWFx
The AutoCAD DWG format works well for storing drawing information on 
local and network disks, but the high precision and large number of object 
properties that AutoCAD uses make for comparatively large files.
To overcome this size problem and encourage people to publish drawings 
on the Web, Autodesk developed an alternative lightweight vector format for 
representing AutoCAD drawings: DWF (Design Web Format). A DWF file is a 
more compact representation of a DWG file. DWF uses less space — and less 
transfer time over the Web and e-mail — because it’s less precise and doesn’t 
have all the information that’s in the DWG file.
 
DWFx is a version of regular DWF that’s compliant with Microsoft’s XML 
Paper Specification (or XPS for short — had your fill of alphabet soup yet?). 
Everything about DWF in this chapter also applies to DWFx. The DWFFORMAT 
command determines whether the PUBLISH, 3DDWF, and EXPORT commands 
output to DWF or DWFx. If this sounds like something that might be important 
in your work, look up DWFFORMAT in the online help system. Windows Vista 
and Windows 7 include an XPS Viewer, and the long and the short of this fea-
ture is that drawings plotted to DWFx can be viewed automatically in these 
Windows versions without AutoCAD or any special viewing software.

423
 Chapter 20: Drawing on the Internet
You can create DWF or DWFx files from your drawings and send those files to 
people who don’t have AutoCAD. Your recipients can view and plot the DWF 
files after they download the free Autodesk Design Review 2011 program, 
which is available on Autodesk’s Web site, www.autodesk.com.
 
DWFs and DWFxs can be used just like external references. Here’s one more 
file type — and one more reason — to use Reference Manager or ETRANSMIT 
to package up your drawings before you send them out. For more on DWF/
DWFx underlays, see Chapter 18.
ePlot, not replot
A DWF file captures a single, plotted view of your drawing, so, unlike a DWG 
file, it can provide a clear-cut snapshot of what you want to see on paper. 
With a DWG file, on the other hand, you have to provide lots of information 
to other people — drawing view, scale, plot style settings, and so on — in 
order for them to get the same plotting results that you did.
Potential ePlotting scenarios include the following:
 ✓ 
Architects and other consultants on a building project periodically 
upload DWF files to the project Web site. Architects and engineers with 
some minimal CAD knowledge can review the drawings on-screen and 
create their own hard-copy plots, if necessary. Principals and clients 
who don’t want anything to do with CAD, or even with computers, can 
have their employees create hard-copy plots for them to examine.
 ✓ 
When Internet-savvy people need hard-copy prints of your drawings, 
you e-mail a zipped file containing DWF files, along with the URL for 
Autodesk Design Review and simple instructions for creating plots from 
the DWF files. (Be ready to walk them through the process by phone the 
first time or two to reduce anxiety on everyone’s part.)
 ✓ 
A CAD plotting service bureau encourages its customers to send DWF 
files instead of DWG files for plotting. The DWF files are much smaller and 
require less intervention on the part of the service bureau’s employees.
 
Autodesk hopes to establish ePlot and the DWF/DWFx format as a standard 
for CAD documents similar to what Adobe’s PDF has become for word pro-
cessing documents. It remains to be seen whether ePlotting will become a 
popular way to generate hard-copy output (although DWFx will certainly push 
it that way). In particular, many people outside CAD-using companies don’t 
have access to large-format plotters. They’re limited to 8-1/2 x 11-inch — or, 
at best, 11 x 17-inch — reduced-size check plots. Consequently, many people 
won’t be able to plot your DWF files to scale and may not even be able to plot 
them large enough to read everything.

424
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
Don’t be afraid to try ePlotting with colleagues inside or outside your com-
pany, but don’t become too dependent on it until you see whether the rest 
of the CAD world shares your enthusiasm. Otherwise, you risk becoming the 
only one who’s willing to use your DWF files for plotting — in which case, the 
next version of the feature will be called mePlot.
Making DWFs with ePlot
As I describe in the preceding section, AutoCAD treats DWF files like elec-
tronic plots, or ePlots. You create a DWF file from the current drawing just 
as if you were plotting it to a piece of paper, as I describe in Chapter 16. 
The only difference is that, in the Plot dialog box’s Printer/Plotter area, 
you choose one of two plotter configurations: DWF6 ePlot.pc3 or DWFx 
ePlot (XPS Compatible).pc3, as shown in Figure 20-3. When you do so, 
AutoCAD automatically turns on the Plot to File setting. Then, when you click 
OK to generate the ePlot, AutoCAD displays a dialog box in which you specify 
a filename and location for the DWF file that gets created. The location can be 
a folder on a hard drive or a Web server.
 
Figure 20-3: 
“Look ma, 
no paper!” 
Plotting to a 
DWF file.
 
 
When you make DWFs with ePlot, pay particular attention to the Scale set-
ting in the Plot Scale area. If you’re creating a DWF simply for viewing in a 
browser, you can select the Fit to Paper check box rather than worry about a 
specific plot scale. If you want to enable others to plot your DWF file to scale, 
as described earlier in this chapter, you need to choose the desired plot scale 
factor. Chapter 16 describes how to choose an appropriate plot scale factor.

425
 Chapter 20: Drawing on the Internet
Making DWFs (or plots) with PUBLISH
The ePlot method of creating DWF files described in the previous section 
works fine for single drawings. But if you want to create DWF files for a lot of 
drawings or plot a bunch of drawings the good ol’ fashioned way (on paper, 
that is), you can use the Publish dialog box, as shown in Figure 20-4, to speed 
the process.
 
You access PUBLISH from the AutoCAD 2011 Application Menu — click the 
Application button, choose Print (not Publish!), and then Batch Plot. PDF 
is also a PUBLISH output option, and practically everything I describe here 
applies to both DWF and PDF.
 
Figure 20-4: 
Hot off the 
presses: 
AutoCAD’s 
Publish dia-
log box.
 
Although the Publish dialog box is wired to support DWF, DWFx, and PDF as 
well as regular (paper) plotting, for now, more people are likely to use it for 
paper plotting. (An alternative use is creating plot files to send to a plotting 
service bureau.) But if you do decide to go into large-scale DWF publishing, 
including multisheet DWF or PDF files, use the Publish dialog box, as shown 
in the following steps:
 
1. Click the Application button, choose Print, and then Batch Plot.
 
 The Publish dialog box appears (refer to Figure 20-4). The dialog box 
lists all tabs (model and paper space layouts) of all currently open draw-
ings for plotting. The Publish dialog box refers to each tab as a sheet.

426
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
2. Click the buttons above the sheet list to preview any sheet, add sheets 
from other drawings, remove sheets from the to-be-plotted list, or 
rearrange the plotting order.
 
 With the additional buttons, you can save and recall lists of sheets. See 
Step 4 for more information.
 
3. After you select the sheets that you want to plot, specify whether you 
want to plot them to an actual plotter or plot (PLT) file or to a DWF/
DWFx or PDF file.
 
 You can select a specific plotter configuration for each sheet by choos-
ing a Page Setup in the Sheet List. See Chapter 16 for more information 
about page setups.
 
4. Click the Publish Options button to display a dialog box containing 
additional settings.
 
 Most of these options are of concern only if you’re creating DWF/DWFx 
or PDF files. The one exception is Default Output Directory, which also 
applies to creating plot (PLT) files.
 
5. If you anticipate having to publish the same group of drawings again, 
click the Save Sheet List button to save the current drawings and set-
tings list.
 
6. Click the Publish button to start the process.
 
Don’t confuse the PUBLISH command with the little-used PUBLISHTOWEB 
command. (Don’t worry about starting it accidentally; unless you’re working in 
the AutoCAD Classic workspace, you have to type the whole command name 
to start this command.) The PUBLISH command creates sets of DWF, DWFx, or 
PDF files, plot files, or actual plots. The PUBLISHTOWEB Wizard creates a Web 
page containing images of your drawings. The results of this wizard won’t put 
any Web designers or programmers out of work, but you can use it to create 
primitive Web page paste-ups of your drawings. See PUBLISHTOWEB command 
in the AutoCAD online help system if you’d like to give it a whirl.
Hyper objects
No Web file format would be complete without hyperlinks, and DWF has 
those, too. You can attach a hyperlink to any drawing object in AutoCAD, not 
just to a text string. As you pass the crosshairs over an object with a hyper-
link, the cursor changes from the ordinary pointer to a globe and two links 
of a chain (as in “World Wide Web” and “link,” not “world-wide chain gang”). 
Right-click the object and select the Hyperlink option from the menu, which 
opens your browser and navigates to the URL that’s attached to the object. If 
you create a DWF file that includes objects with hyperlinks, Autodesk Design 
Review 2011 displays them in the DWF file so that you can click to navigate to 
them.

427
 Chapter 20: Drawing on the Internet
Hyperlinks on objects are a clever trick, but they’re of limited practical value 
in most DWG and DWF files:
 ✓ 
The drawing images are so small that it’s difficult to distinguish the 
hyperlink on one object from the hyperlink on another object.
 ✓ 
Most people aren’t used to associating hyperlinks with individual lines 
and other objects. The interface is likely to leave them perplexed.
If you’d like to experiment with hyperlinks on objects, look up HYPERLINK 
command, about in the online help system.
Autodesk Design Review 2011
After you create DWF files, whether with ePlot or PUBLISH, you or the recipi-
ent of your DWF files can use Autodesk Design Review to view and print them. 
(Autodesk Design Review 2011, the current release, is a free viewer from 
Autodesk.) If you send DWFs to people without AutoCAD, they can download 
Design Review 2011 from Autodesk’s Web page, www.autodesk.com.
When you install AutoCAD 2011, the setup program, by default, installs 
Autodesk Design Review 2011, as well. From your Windows desktop, choose 
Start➪All Programs➪Autodesk➪Autodesk Design Review 2011 — or simply 
double-click a DWF file in Windows Explorer to launch the viewer.
The Drawing Protection Racket
Whether you’re sending DWG or DWF files, you may be concerned about 
their misuse (that is, by the wrong people or for the wrong purposes); abuse 
(for example, modification without your consent); or reuse (on other projects 
or by other people without due compensation to you). AutoCAD has two fea-
tures for securing your drawings when you send them to others:
 ✓ 
Password protection: Enables you to lock a DWG or DWF file so that 
only those who type the password that you’ve specified can open, 
insert, or xref it (AutoCAD LT users can’t apply a password, but they can 
open password-protected files. If they know the password, of course!).
 
 Add password protection to drawings only when you really need it:
 
• If you forget the password, you will no longer be able to open the 
drawing. Neither AutoCAD nor Autodesk has any magical way to 
extract the password or unlock the drawing.
 
• After you password-protect a drawing, others can’t insert the 
drawing as a block or attach it as an xref.

428
Part IV: Advancing with AutoCAD 
 
 If you’re using a password, you probably should do it on a copy of the 
drawing that you send; keep an unprotected version for yourself.
 ✓ 
Digital signature: A high-tech way to add an electronic marker to a DWG 
file that verifies that someone approved the drawing. You must first get 
an account with a digital certificate provider, who serves to authenti-
cate you and your computer. Of course, for this feature to be useful, 
you need to send drawings to someone who wants to receive digitally 
authenticated drawings from you (or vice versa) and who has the tech-
nological savvy to deal with digital certificates. For more information, 
see digital signatures, about in the AutoCAD online help system index.
To activate either of these options for the current drawing, open the 
Application Menu and choose Save As, and then choose AutoCAD Drawing to 
display the Save Drawing As dialog box; then choose Tools➪Security Options 
to display the Security Options dialog box before you save the file. If you want 
to add a digital signature and you have a digital ID from a certificate provider, 
enter your information on the Digital Signature tab of the Security Options 
dialog box. If you want to add a password to the current drawing, just type it 
in the text field on the Password tab of the Security Options dialog box.
After you password-protect and save a DWG file, anyone who tries to open, 
insert, or xref it will see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 20-5.
 
Figure 20-5: 
Password, 
please.
 
To password-protect a DWF file, use the PUBLISH command and click the 
Publish Options button in the Publish dialog box. In the DWF Data Options 
section, click Disabled and choose Specify Password, then type your secret 
word into the Password field.
 
Although electronic security features such as the ones described in this sec-
tion can be useful as part of a strategy to protect your work from misuse, 
they’re not a substitute for communicating clearly, preferably in the form of 
written contracts, what constitutes appropriate use of drawings that you send 
to or receive from others.

t’s all been Xs and Ys up until now, but there’s a whole 
new axis out there, and you’re about to shinny up (or 
down) it in this chapter. You say tomayto and I say 
tomahto, you say zee-axis and I say zed-axis . . . never 
mind — we’re not calling the whole thing off.
In the chapters in this part of the book, you discover how 
your AutoCAD designs can escape the bounds of the X,Y 
plane and gain some height as well as length and breadth. 
You give your designs some volume by specifying Z 
coordinates along with X- and Y-values. You can do some 
rapid visualization by changing to one of AutoCAD 2011’s 
predefined visual styles.
AutoCAD provides three different varieties of modeling: 
solid modeling, mesh modeling, and surface modeling. 
The chapters in this part of the book take a look at all 
three. You can plant your designs in real locations too, 
and render them based on that location as well as time 
of year and hour of day. All in all, AutoCAD has taken 
drafting a long way from the drawing board!

▶ Changing the current working plane
▶ Navigating in three dimensions
▶ Applying visual styles
T
he addition of a third coordinate — the z coordinate — releases your 
design work in AutoCAD from the planar world of two dimensions into a 
much more lifelike three-dimensional space. AutoCAD’s 3D capabilities have 
grown by leaps and bounds since AutoCAD 2007 appeared with a souped-
up 3D engine. Not only have its model creation and editing tools advanced; 
AutoCAD is now a dab hand at visualization and rendering. You can view 
your 3D models from any angle, or slice through them to see what they look 
like inside. And finally, since the world of technical drawing is still a two-
dimensional one, you can use AutoCAD’s viewing options to create 2D views 
from 3D models.
 
If you’re an AutoCAD LT user, you’re going to have to sit out most of this chap-
ter. One of the major areas where AutoCAD LT differs from regular AutoCAD 
is in its extremely limited 3D functionality. Even viewing 3D models is much 
more difficult in AutoCAD LT than it need be. LT users can acquire nearly 
all the 3D viewing capabilities of the full version of AutoCAD, but you need a 
separate — and free — program to do so. Just go to www.autodesk.com/
trueview and download DWG Trueview.
This chapter takes a look at some of the tools available in AutoCAD 2011’s 3D 
Modeling workspace and introduces you to many of the general concepts of 
creating 3D objects. You also discover how to look at your model from differ-
ent viewpoints, and how to change the way it appears on-screen.

432
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
3D modeling and visualization is a lot more demanding on computer hardware 
than 2D drafting is. Models tend to be bigger than two-dimensional drawings, 
so you may need more disk space. And you’ll certainly be happier with more 
than the bare minimum of RAM required by 2D AutoCAD. In Chapter 2, I list 
AutoCAD 2011’s system requirements and point out the increased resources 
needed for 3D work.
Understanding 3D Digital Models
There are basically three types of 3D computer model:
 ✓ 
Wireframe models: Consist of edges and vertices only. Although they 
do occupy 3D space, they’re totally unrealistic and difficult to read 
correctly. 
 ✓ 
Surface models: Consist of infinitely thin skins that stretch from edge 
to edge of a model. Basic 3D programs generally create meshed surface 
models; more advanced ones like AutoCAD 2011 use NURBS mathemat-
ics which create far more precise models than the other sort. Due to 
space limitations, I don’t cover surface modeling in AutoCAD 2011 For 
Dummies.
 ✓ 
Solid models: Have edges, surfaces and mass. Solid models are the most 
complex type (although precise surface models can be more difficult to 
construct). Solid models can be assigned physical material properties 
such as steel or aluminum, and so mass, centers of rotation, etc can be 
calculated by the computer and displayed visually.
While surface and solid models are created and modified differently, the 3D 
objects that make up the models are made up of the same subobjects. The 
subobjects that a 3D object is made up of are:
 ✓ 
Vertex: The 3D equivalent of an AutoCAD point object. Vertices are 
defined by a single X,Y,Z coordinate, can exist anywhere in 3D space and 
are located where the edges of a 3D object meet.
 ✓ 
Edge: The boundary of a face and is defined by two X,Y,Z coordinates, 
one at each vertex.
 ✓ 
Face: The surface area bounded by three or more edges.
Figure 21-1 shows a 3D object — a six-sided cubic shape created with 
AutoCAD’s BOX command — and its subobjects.

Tools of the Trade
AutoCAD includes a plethora of tools for creating, editing, viewing, and visu-
alizing 3D models. You can find the most commonly used tools for 3D model-
ing on the 3D Modeling workspace’s Ribbon.
 
AutoCAD 2011 comes with two 3D workspaces: 3D Modeling and 3D Basics. 
I suppose the idea is that if you’re new to 3D, you get your feet wet with the 
Basics workspace and then graduate to the 3D Modeling workspace after 
you’ve gained some experience. My preference is to have the whole enchilada 
available from the get-go. For this book, I will be working exclusively with the 
3D Modeling workspace.
AutoCAD’s 3D environment is a lot like its 2D version, but there are some 
important differences. You should be aware of the following program settings 
and elements:

Hardware Acceleration: Graphics functions such as changing visual 
styles and running 3D Orbit can be processed on the main CPU or, 
if hardware acceleration is enabled, on the graphics card itself. Enabling 
hardware acceleration nearly always improves 3D performance. I 
cover hardware acceleration in the next section.
 ✓ 
Workspaces: AutoCAD 2011 comes with two 3D workspaces; I highly rec-
ommend you use the 3D Modeling workspace (I introduce workspaces in 
Chapter 2). For more about the tools in the 3D Modeling workspace, see 
“Entering the Third Dimension” later in this chapter.
 ✓ 
Drawing Window: The drawing window’s background, crosshairs, and 
dynamic tooltip colors change when you switch between 2D and 3D 
views, or in 3D views, when you switch between parallel and perspective 
projection. Click Options on the Application Menu, select the Display

Part V: On a 3D Spree 
tab, then click the Colors button to access different interface element 
color settings.
 ✓ 
UCS Icon: When working in 3D, the UCS icon shows the orientation of 
the current XY plane and the direction of the Z-axis. For information on 
using the UCS icon, see “Changing Planes” later in this chapter.
Warp speed ahead
The first time it’s started, AutoCAD checks out your graphics card and 
attempts to enable hardware acceleration. Hardware acceleration allows you 
to take advantage of advanced features such as displaying lighting and mate-
rials in real-time. It also improves the overall quality of objects in the drawing 
window and the performance of regenerations. Not all graphics cards are 
supported, and you may well see a balloon message on the status bar telling 
you your card is not certified. 
Autodesk tests a wide range of cards and drivers with each new release. You 
can determine whether your graphics card is supported for AutoCAD by 
visiting the AutoCAD Certification Web site (www.autodesk.com/autocad-
graphicscard).
Entering the third dimension
If you’re new to the 3D game, and you’ve been working in 2D up until now, 
there are a couple of things you need to do in order to start a new 3D model 
in AutoCAD. You have to change the workspace, and then you have to open a 
new file using a 3D template. The following steps explain how:
 
1. Open the Workspaces drop-down list on the Quick Access toolbar, or 
click the Workspace Switching button on the status bar, and choose 
3D Modeling.
 
 Toolbars and palettes flash on and off, and soon AutoCAD settles down 
to display the 3D Modeling Ribbon and the Materials Browser palette.
 
2. Click the Application button and choose New.
 
 The Select Template dialog box appears.
 3
. Choose acad3d.dwt if you’re working in imperial units or acadiso3d.
dwt if you’re working in metric. Click Open.
 
 A 3D modeling space appears (see Figure 21-2).
 
To switch from 3D to the 2D world, simply reverse the steps above.

Unwrapping the Ribbon and 
other modeling tools
Most of AutoCAD’s 3D modeling tools can be accessed from the Ribbon and 
3D-related palettes. The following list describes the Ribbon tabs and palettes 
available in the 3D Modeling workspace (note that not all items in this list are 
visible in Figure 21-2):
 ✓ 
Home tab: Contains a subset of the most frequently used 3D tools for 
creating and editing surfaces and solids as well as user coordinate 
system command options, view tools, 2D drawing and editing com-
mands, and layer tools.
 ✓ 
Solid tab: Contains tools for creating and modifying 3D solids. I show 
you some of the finer points of solid modeling in Chapter 22.
 ✓ 
Surface tab: Contains tools used to create, edit, and analyze NURBS sur-
faces. I introduce NURBS surfaces in Chapter 22.
 ✓ 
Mesh tab: Contains tools used to create and modify meshes. I touch on 
mesh modeling in Chapter 22.

436
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 ✓ 
Render tab: Contains tools to add lighting and materials to a 3D model, 
and generate rendered output. Chapter 23 presents the basics of render-
ing in AutoCAD 2011.
 ✓ 
View tab: Contains tools to navigate, visualize and change the current 
view and UCS of a 3D model. I cover navigation tools, coordinate sys-
tems, and visual styles in this chapter.
 ✓ 
Output tab: Contains tools to output a 3D model to a DWF file or even 
generate a 3D print. I cover plotting 2D drawings in Chapter 16, and out-
putting 3D designs to paper is not significantly different — I refer you 
to the online help for specifics. I don’t cover exporting to 3D DWF or 3D 
printing in this book.
 ✓ 
Materials Browser palette: Used to apply materials to the objects in the 
current model, and to manage materials in saved material libraries.
 ✓ 
Materials Editor palette: Used to apply, create, and modify materials in 
the current model. Chapter 23 introduces you to materials.
 ✓ 
Advanced Render Settings palette: Used to manage rendering presets.
 ✓ 
Visual Styles palette: Used to create, modify, and manage visual styles 
in the current model.
 ✓ 
Lights in Model palette: Used to manage lights in the current model.
 ✓ 
Sun Properties palette: Used to specify the lighting settings for the 
Sunlight system in the current model. 
Modeling from Above
So far in this book, you’ve been working with X- and Y-coordinates only. X- 
and Y-coordinates by themselves define a two-dimensional plane known (logi-
cally enough) as the x,y plane. 
In this and the following two chapters, you supply a third value, a Z-coordinate, 
in order to locate geometry above or below the X,Y plane. You use the same 
methods to specify Cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates as the ones I set out in 
Chapter 7 — you just add a comma and another number. The following tech-
niques can be used to specify points in 3D:
 ✓ 
Coordinate and direct distance entry
 ✓ 
Point filters
 ✓ 
Object snaps
 ✓ 
3D object snaps
 ✓ 
Object snap tracking 

437
 Chapter 21: It’s a 3D World After All
Coordinate input
I introduce you to 2D coordinate entry in Chapter 7. To recap, the input for-
mats are:
 ✓ 
Absolute Cartesian coordinates: Expressed as x,y — the distances along 
the X- and Y-axes from the origin (0,0).
 ✓ 
Relative Cartesian coordinates: Expressed as @x,y — the distances 
parallel to the X- and Y-axes from last point.
 ✓ 
Relative polar coordinates: Expressed as @d<a — the distance and 
angle in the xy plane from the last point.
While you can use these 2D coordinate input methods in 3D, you usually 
have to give AutoCAD just a little more information when you want to work 
in three dimensions. You can use absolute or relative Cartesian coordinates 
by simply adding a Z-coordinate to the end. In addition, there are two 3D-only 
coordinate formats, both based on 2D polar coordinates. You can enter 3D 
coordinates using the following methods:
 ✓ 
Absolute Cartesian coordinates: Expressed as x,y,z. Working with 
absolute coordinates in 3D should look familiar because the input is like 
working in 2D, except you add a Z-coordinate at the end.
 ✓ 
Relative Cartesian coordinates: Expressed as @x,y,z. Relative 
coordinates in 3D work just like they do in 2D, except you add the 
Z-coordinate.
 ✓ 
Cylindrical coordinates: Expressed as @d<a,z. Cylindrical coordinates 
are similar to relative polar coordinates (d is the distance and a the 
angle from the last point in the xy plane) with the addition of a Cartesian 
Z-coordinate to locate the point above or below the xy plane.
 ✓ 
Spherical coordinates: Expressed as @d<a1<a2. Spherical coordi-
nates are also based on relative polar coordinates, but instead of a 
Z-coordinate to specify a location above or below the x,y plane, you 
specify an angle from the x,y plane.
Point Filters
Coordinate entry as described in the previous section is fine if you already 
know the coordinate values or distances in 3D space where you want to 
locate your points. Often, however, you may need to derive 3D points from 
existing geometry without knowing those exact values. Using point filters, 
you can locate new points based on existing points. You can use point filters 
to construct 2D and 3D coordinates.

438
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
When AutoCAD prompts you to specify a point, you can either enter point fil-
ters at the command line, or bring up the right-click menu and choose a filter 
from the Point Filters submenu. After selecting a point filter, specify a point 
to filter out part of the coordinate value and then enter the requested value. 
For example, use the .XY filter to enter your own Z-coordinate value after 
specifying a point on the current working plane.
Object snaps and object snap tracking
 
 
 Object snaps allow you to accurately specify points on existing objects in a 
3D model. You can use object snaps such as endpoints, midpoints and center 
on 3D objects, but AutoCAD also provides a set of object snaps specific to 3D 
modeling.
 
3D object snaps are new in AutoCAD 2011 and they allow you to specify points 
on 3D objects, such as the center of a face or a vertex. Enable 3D object snaps 
by clicking the 3D Object Snap button on the status bar. Right-click the 3D 
Object Snap button and choose the running 3D object snaps you want to use.
 
 Object snap tracking allows you to calculate points that are not on an object 
by using object snap points on existing objects. When working in 3D, you can 
not only track points on the current x,y plane but also along the z axis. While 
tracking points along the z axis, AutoCAD provides feedback in the form of a 
tooltip that lets you know you are moving along the z axis in the positive or 
negative direction.
 
The ELEVATION system variable allows you to specify a height above or 
below the current working plane. When you enter a 2D coordinate, AutoCAD 
uses the value assigned to ELEVATION system variable to create a 3D coor-
dinate. You can set the OSNAPZ system variable to 1, to substitute the 
z-coordinate value of a point specified using an object snap with the value of 
ELEVATION.
Changing Planes
Come fly with me while I explain changing planes in AutoCAD. (Just step 
through this metal detector over here while I x-ray your bags.)
Okay, it’s not that kind of plane. This section covers using the user coordi-
nate system (UCS) to control the current working (or x,y) plane. The UCS 
icon displayed either at the lower-left corner of the drawing window or at the 
origin (0,0,0) shows you the orientation of the current work plane and the 
positive direction of the Z-axis.

439
 Chapter 21: It’s a 3D World After All
Displaying the UCS icon
By default, the UCS icon is displayed in both 2D and 3D views. You can lose 
your bearings pretty easily when working in 3D, and I strongly recommend 
you keep the UCS icon in your sights at all times. If you don’t see a UCS icon, 
you can turn it on in the Options dialog box. Select the 3D Modeling tab, then 
check both Display UCS Icon boxes in the Display ViewCube and UCS area.
 
 In addition to controlling the display of the UCS icon, you can also tweak its 
size, color, and location using the UCS Icon dialog box. To display the UCS 
Icon dialog box, choose UCS Icon, Properties on the Coordinates panel of the 
Home tab.
Adjusting the UCS
Every drawing you create utilizes the world coordinate system (WCS), but 
when working in 3D you will need to use additional working planes. User 
coordinate systems (UCS) are helpful when you need to draw objects on 
work planes other than the WCS. When you work with the UCS you have two 
options: Named and dynamic.
Before you can use a named UCS, you have to create it in AutoCAD using the 
UCS command. The main command options are described in the next para-
graph; once you’ve created a new UCS, use the Save option to give it a name. 
Named UCSs are saved with the drawing and are available at any time (until 
they’re deleted).
Dynamic UCSs are temporary, and are usually active only for the duration 
of a command. You enable Dynamic UCS by clicking the Allow/Disallow 
Dynamic UCS button on the status bar (look for the button labeled DUCS if 
your status bar buttons show text rather than icons). With Dynamic UCS 
enabled, you start an object creation command, then simply move the cross-
hairs over a planar surface (Dynamic UCS only works on planar surfaces). 
AutoCAD creates a temporary, UCS on the face you select.
Name that UCS
Use the UCS command to save a named user coordinate system. The UCS 
command offers ten options to help you define a new UCS. You access the 
UCS command options from the Coordinates panels on either the View or 
Home tabs of the Ribbon.
The following are the most commonly used options of the UCS command. 
After you select one of these options from the Ribbon, follow the command 
prompts at the command line or the Dynamic Input prompt.

440
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 ✓ 
World: Align the UCS to match the world coordinate system (WCS).
 ✓ 
Face: Align the UCS to the face of a 3D solid.
 ✓ 
View: Align the UCS so the xy plane is perpendicular to your current 
viewing direction.
 ✓ 
3 Point: Specify a new origin for the UCS, and then the positive direction 
of the x and y axes.
For more information on all the UCS options, refer to AutoCAD’s online Help 
system.
After you define a UCS you want to use repeatedly, you can use the UCSMAN 
command to display the UCS dialog box. The UCS dialog box allows you to 
save and restore named UCSs. From the UCS dialog box, you can set the work 
plane to one of six orthographic coordinate systems (top, bottom, front, 
back, left, and right) on the Orthographic UCSs tab, and control some of the 
display settings for the UCS icon and UCS save settings on the Settings tab.
The following procedure explains how to save and restore a custom UCS.
 
 
1. Choose Solid tab➪Primitive panel➪Box.
 
 
 The BOX command starts and AutoCAD prompts you to specify the first 
corner.
 
2. At the Specify First Corner of [Center] prompt, specify a point on 
screen.
 
3. At the Specify Other Corner of [Cube/Length] prompt, specify a point 
on-screen.
 
4. At the Specify Height or [2Point] prompt, drag up and click, or enter a 
value.
 
 A 3D solid primitive shaped like a box is created.
 
 
5. On the Coordinates panel of the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the down 
arrow to the right of the View button and choose Face.
 
 
 The UCS command starts with the Face option.
 
6. At the Select Face of Solid Object prompt, select the face on the top of 
the box you created.
 
 The top face should be highlighted. If not, enter N and press Enter to 
go to the next face of the 3D solid. Keep doing this until the top face is 
highlighted.
 
7. At the Enter an Option [Next/Xflip/Yflip] <accept> prompt, press Enter 
to accept the top face.
 
 The UCS is moved to and aligned with the top face of the 3D solid.

441
 Chapter 21: It’s a 3D World After All
 
 
8. On the Coordinates panel of the Home tab, choose UCS, Named UCS.
 
 
 The UCS dialog box is displayed.
 
9. In the UCS dialog box, select Unnamed in the UCSs list.
 
 The Unnamed UCS is the current UCS in the drawing and is listed at the 
very top of the list.
 
10. Right-click Unnamed and select Rename from the shortcut menu.
 
 An in-place editor is displayed that allows you to rename the UCS.
 11. 
Type Boxtop and press Enter.
 
 The Unnamed UCS is renamed (see Figure 21-3).
 
Figure 21-3: 
Naming 
a custom 
UCS.
 
 12. 
Click OK.
 
 The UCS dialog box closes and the new UCS is saved in the drawing.
 
 13. On the Coordinates panel of the Home tab, choose UCS, World.
 
 
 The current UCS is now aligned with the WCS.
 
14. On the Coordinates panel of the Home tab, click in the Named UCS 
drop-down list and choose Boxtop.
 
 The Boxtop UCS is restored.
 
You can select a named UCS from the UCS menu at the bottom of the 
ViewCube. (I fill you in on the ViewCube in the “Taking a spin around the 
cube” section later in this chapter.)

442
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
Using the Dynamic UCS feature
 
 A named UCS allows you to work on different work planes, but it can take a 
bit of effort to set up and that can distract you when you’re focused on 3D 
modeling. With Dynamic UCS, you can focus on modeling, not on creating a 
UCS. To enable or disable the dynamic UCS feature, click the Dynamic UCS 
button on the status bar.
Figure 21-4 shows an example of drawing a circle on the side of a 3D solid. 
When Dynamic UCS is enabled, the face of the 3D solid that the UCS will be 
aligned with is highlighted. Click over the face to align the UCS with the face 
and finish the command. The circle aligned with the face of the 3D solid and 
the previous UCS is restored. You may need to reposition the circle after it is 
drawn.

Navigating the 3D Waters
If you’re brand new to 3D in AutoCAD, you may be wondering how to look at 
whatever it is you’re modeling from whatever angle you desire.
One way to change viewpoints that works in both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT 
is to use the preset views from the Ribbon by selecting the View tab, then 
clicking the down arrow on the 3D Preset Views drop-down menu on the 
Views panel (shown in Figure 21-5) to switch to one of the standard ortho-
graphic 3D views or an isometric view.

443
 Chapter 21: It’s a 3D World After All
 
Figure 21-5: 
3D Preset 
Views drop-
down menu.
 
 ✓ 
The six standard orthographic (straight-on) views are Top, Bottom, Left, 
Right, Front, Back.
 ✓ 
The four standard isometric views are SW (left-front), SE (right-front), 
NE (right-back), and NW (left-back). (An isometric view is one in which 
you see the object from above — or below, but AutoCAD’s standard 
views don’t do below.)
 
An isometric view is not quite a realistic 3D view since all lines that are paral-
lel in reality are also parallel in the view. In a perspective view, lines that are 
parallel in reality appear to meet at a vanishing point, as parallel lines appear 
to do in reality (think of railroad tracks heading across the prairie). The iso-
metric views I mentioned previously are parallel projection views, and you 
can view 3D models using those views in either the full version of AutoCAD or 
AutoCAD LT. 
 
This warning is for AutoCAD LT users (users of the full version of AutoCAD 
don’t need to worry). As I’ve already pointed out, AutoCAD LT can open draw-
ings created in the full version. Those AutoCAD drawings can be saved with 
perspective projection current, and if you open such a drawing in AutoCAD LT, 
you can see it in perspective. You can switch from perspective to parallel pro-
jection by changing the PERSPECTIVE system variable’s value from 1 to 0. Be 
very careful if you do this, because you can’t change it back again! You could 
use UNDO to reverse the change, but if you save the drawing, you’re sunk.
The six orthographic and four isometric views work well for showing 3D 
models of common objects such as mechanical components and buildings. 
(You can also change to plan view, which is a top-down view of either the 
world coordinate system or a user coordinate system.)

444
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
AutoCAD LT includes limited 3D viewing capabilities. The same preset views 
are in both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and there’s also a Viewpoint Presets 
dialog box (DDVPOINT command) in which you set a viewing position by 
specifying angles in and from the XY plane. Finally, there’s the really ugly 
command-line only VPOINT command (Man, that one’s soooo ugly it’s not 
even on the Ribbon!).
Orbit a go, go
 
 Preset views are fine for many 3D modeling tasks, but if you really want to 
have fun, 3DOrbit (not in AutoCAD LT) is your ticket to it. There are two 
orbiter modes: Constrained and Free. Constrained mode is pretty much like 
the Free mode with training wheels.
 
 Free Orbit displays an arcball on the screen — a circle representing a sphere 
around your object. You click various places inside, outside, and on the 
arcball and then drag to change the 3D view. The idea is that you’re spinning 
an imaginary sphere containing your model. As you drag the cursor, 
AutoCAD updates the screen dynamically.
 
You can start Constrained orbiting, the 3DOrbit command, by holding the 
SHIFT key down and then holding the middle mouse button while dragging 
the mouse.
You might also want to experiment with different projection modes:
 ✓ 
Parallel projection is the default AutoCAD projection — lines that are 
parallel in the 3D object remain parallel in the projected view on the 
screen.
 ✓ 
Perspective projection makes objects look more realistic (for example, 
train tracks appear to converge in the distance), but lines that are paral-
lel in the model don’t appear parallel in perspective projection.
If you manage to 3DOrbit out of control so that you no longer see your model, 
right-click to display the 3DOrbit shortcut menu and choose Zoom Extents. 
The Zoom, Pan, and Preset Views options offer other ways of getting your 
model back in your sights.
 
When you start orbiting with no objects selected, AutoCAD tries to update the 
display of everything in your model, and this can take some time. To speed 
things up or to simply regain your bearings, try selecting some objects before 
you start orbiting. Then, AutoCAD updates the display of the selected models 
only. When you exit orbit mode, the entire model redisplays based on the new 
viewpoint.

445
 Chapter 21: It’s a 3D World After All
Taking a spin around the cube
 
 With so much talk about hybrid devices these days, Autodesk decided to 
create its own in the form of the ViewCube. The ViewCube (see Figure 21-6) is 
a cross between a compass and the 3DOrbit command. It’s an interactive tool 
that provides visual feedback about the current viewpoint, allows you to set 
a preset view current or orbit the model, restore a named UCS, and define 
and restore the Home view of a model.

To change the view of the model using the ViewCube you can do one of the 
following:
 ✓ 
Click a corner, edge, or face to align the current view with the same 
viewpoint represented on the ViewCube.
 ✓ 
Click and drag the main area of the ViewCube to orbit the view of the 
model.
 ✓ 
Click one of the roll arrows to rotate the current view 90 degrees.
 ✓ 
Click one of the adjacent face triangles to switch to the adjacent ortho-
graphic view that is indicated by the triangle.
 ✓ 
Click one of the letters (N, E, S, W), or click and drag the compass to 
rotate the view around the center of the drawing.

446
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
The Home view is a special view that you can define so you have a known 
reference view in the model. So if you lose your bearings, you always have a 
way to get back home. You can restore the Home from the ViewCube or the 
SteeringWheels (see the next section) right-click menus.
Gripping the SteeringWheels
 
 SteeringWheels act as a kind of navigation hub that allows you to access sev-
eral different 2D and 3D navigation tools from a single user interface. I intro-
duced the 2D Navigation wheel in Chapter 12 (AutoCAD LT includes only the 
2D Navigation wheel). AutoCAD (the full version) comes with the 2D 
Navigation wheel and three other wheels that are designed to be used with 
3D modeling. The three additional wheels are:
 ✓ 
View Object: Contains tools to center a model in the current view, zoom 
in and out, or orbit around a model.
 ✓ 
Tour Building: Contains tools to move the viewpoint forward and back-
ward, look around the model from a fixed location, and change the eleva-
tion of the current viewpoint.
 ✓ 
Full Navigation: Contains a combination of the tools found on the 2D 
Navigation, View Object, and Tour Building wheels with the addition of 
tools to walk around or fly through a model.
 
All SteeringWheels include a Rewind tool which allows you to restore a previ-
ous view. The Rewind tool is similar to the Previous option of the ZOOM 
command. 
When one of the SteeringWheels is active, move the cursor over the wedge 
that contains the tool you want to use. For many of the tools you must either 
click over the tool, or click and drag to use the tool. Some tools support alter-
nate versions of the tool when you press and hold the Shift key. To get an idea 
as to what each tool does, hover the cursor over the tool to display a tooltip 
message. To learn more about each of the wheels and the tools on them, see 
AutoCAD’s online Help. To display the help specific to the wheels, right-click 
when a wheel is displayed and choose Help from the shortcut menu.
Visualizing 3D objects
It really doesn’t seem like that long ago when the only way of viewing 3D 
models as well as 2D drawings was in wireframe mode. But the last several 
releases have dramatically improved AutoCAD’s visualization capabilities. 

447
 Chapter 21: It’s a 3D World After All
There are almost a dozen different display modes — called visual styles — 
that you can set with the click of a drop-down menu. Figure 21-7 shows the 
default visual styles — and you can add your own if you want — in the Visual 
Styles Manager palette.
 
Figure 21-7: 
Some new 
styles to 
try on.
 
Getting some (visual) style
 
Visual styles are collections of settings that build on the SHADEMODE settings 
found in earlier versions of AutoCAD. AutoCAD 2008 introduced five default 
visual styles, and that number has doubled with AutoCAD 2011 to a total of ten:
 ✓ 
2D Wireframe: AutoCAD’s classic 2D viewing mode: full wireframe, dot-
based grid, the 2D UCS icon, and no perspective.
 ✓ 
Conceptual: An illustrative kind of shaded view. Colors are unrealistic 
and edges are heavy, but you get a good sense of the model’s form.
 ✓ 
Hidden: Looks slightly like a wireframe view (no surfaces are visible) 
but edges behind faces are hidden.
 ✓ 
Realistic: Fully shaded, but not rendered visual style; edges are not 
displayed, and a default ambient lighting highlights the faces with differ-
ent intensities of the object color. Materials and textures are visible if 
they’ve been applied.
 ✓ 
Shaded: Similar to Realistic, but with more subdued lighting. Textures 
do not appear in this visual style.
 ✓ 
Shaded with Edges: The same the Shaded visual style, except Isolines 
are set to be displayed.
 ✓ 
Shades of Gray: Like Shaded, only all object colors are changed to dif-
ferent intensities of gray.

448
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 ✓ 
Sketchy: Visual style that does not apply any shading to the faces of 3D 
objects but give the edges of 3D objects hand sketch look.
 ✓ 
Wireframe: Pretty much the same as 2D wireframe, except for back-
ground color and the 3D rather than the 2D UCS icon. That’s it!
 ✓ 
X-ray: Similar to Shaded with Edges, except Materials and Textures are 
applied like the Realistic visual style and faces are set to 50% opacity.
AutoCAD 2011’s ten preconfigured visual styles are only the beginning. You 
can modify any of the styles or create new ones in the Visual Styles Manager 
palette (see Figure 21-8).

F
or millennia, people have documented the design and construction of 
three-dimensional objects by drawing two-dimensional views of them. 
Most people have continued to use these “classical” methods with CAD draft-
ing because the methods are well understood and work reasonably well. 
After all, if 2D drawing was good enough for guys like Leonardo da Vinci and 
Andrea Palladio, it should be good enough for us, right? 
Nonetheless, for the last decade or so, there’s been a trend of creating 3D 
CAD models and letting the software generate the 2D views more-or-less 
automatically. This approach seems more logical, especially if the project 
documentation requires numerous, complex views of the same object. 3D 
modeling also is an absolute necessity when you want to create rendered 
views for presentation purposes. 
While the AutoCAD’s 3D construction and visualization tools have improved 
dramatically over the years (trust me — you should have seen what they were 
like as recently as AutoCAD 2006!), it’s still a complex process that requires 
sophistication on the part of the AutoCAD user. Although 3D modeling requires 
only one more dimension than 2D drafting, developing 3D CAD models is con-
siderably more complicated. Users must master new techniques and contend 
with the 2D limitations of most display screens and input devices. 
In the previous chapter, I showed you how to move around models that 
others have made, and explained the principles of 3D coordinate systems 
that you need to understand to work in AutoCAD’s 3D environment. This 
chapter introduces you to the concepts, tools, and techniques of AutoCAD 3D 
modeling itself; here you can get your feet wet creating your own 3D objects.

Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
Full 3D support is one of the main differences between full AutoCAD and 
AutoCAD LT. If you’re using AutoCAD LT, you can look at and plot 3D models 
created in AutoCAD, but you can’t do much 3D object creation or editing your-
self. Also, viewing 3D models is less flexible in AutoCAD LT because it lacks 
nearly all the 3D navigation tools in the full version of AutoCAD.
Is 3D for Me?
Traditional 2D drawings provide clues to help the viewer’s mind construct 
a 3D model from the 2D image on paper. Multiple views from different view-
points in 3D space give experienced designers, drafters, and builders the 
information they need to make 3D sense of 2D drawings. Design and drafting 
have succeeded pretty well by using 2D representations as the guide to creat-
ing 3D objects. But at some point, nothing can replace a true 3D model, such 
as in helping someone understand how a building will look when constructed 
or how two parts fit together.
What does using 3D in AutoCAD mean? Fundamentally, it means creating 
models instead of drawings. Rather than generate cross sections of an object 
or individual views of it from certain perspectives, you create a three-
dimensional model of the object. This 3D depiction of each object includes 
all the necessary information for AutoCAD to create a drawing view from any 
point of view. With a properly constructed 3D model, AutoCAD can output 
commands to machines to create actual 3D objects, whether plastic proto-
types carved from a tank of jelly by 3D printers, or an actual bolt, valve, or 
piston created by computer-controlled machine tools. 
As I explain in Chapter 21, AutoCAD can create three types of 3D models: 
Wireframe, Surface, and Solid. In most practical applications of 3D, you select 
one of these types for all or most of the objects in the drawing, based on ease 
of construction and intended use of the model. However, AutoCAD doesn’t 
prevent you from mixing all three types of 3D objects in the same drawing.
After you determine the type of 3D representation to use, you decide on the 
appropriate level of detail and construct the model, using the commands and 
techniques introduced in this chapter. If you need to, you can go on from 
there to create any required 2D and/or rendered views for plotting or viewing 
on-screen.
Getting Your 3D Bearings
The first challenge in 3D modeling is being able to see your three-dimensional 
model on a two-dimensional computer screen. The normal model space view 
on the Model tab in the drawing area shows a single, projected 2D view of 
your model — the top-down, “plan” view by default.

451
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
AutoCAD provides two model space capabilities that enable you to escape 
this visual flatland:
 ✓ 
With viewports, you can carve the model space drawing area into 
smaller rectangular areas, each of which shows a different view of the 
model.
 ✓ 
With viewpoints, you can change the point in 3D space from which you 
look at the model. By setting a different viewpoint in each viewport, you 
can look at several sides of your model at the same time. It’s like looking 
at one of Picasso’s cubist paintings, only more orderly.
No matter how much or how little 3D modeling you’re thinking about doing, 
it’s well worth your while to set up a template. (I fill you in on drawing tem-
plates in Chapter 4.) If you’ve ever started a new drawing, you’re probably 
aware that AutoCAD already comes with a template for 3D modeling named 
acad3d.dwt (or acadiso3D.dwt for the metrically inclined). This is fine as 
far as it goes, but it only shows you a single view of your model. The next sec-
tion explains how to improve on this template.
Creating a better 3D template
Model space viewports enable you to see several views of your model at one 
time, each from a different viewpoint. For this reason, model space viewports 
are especially useful when you’re creating and editing objects in 3D. As you 
draw and edit, the different views help ensure that you’re picking points that 
are located correctly in 3D space.
Chapter 5 discusses viewports in paper space, which are useful for creating 
layouts for use in plots and presentations in both 2D and 3D. Model space 
viewports, cousins of paper viewports, are less flexible but simpler, and are a 
great help in constructing 3D models.
Model space viewports divide the screen into separate rectangles with no 
gaps between them. Unlike with paper space viewports, you can’t move, 
stretch, or overlap them. You can’t plot multiple model space viewports 
(that’s what paper space is for). And, unlike in layouts, a layer that’s visible 
in one model space viewport always is visible in all of them.
 
You may hear or read references to tiled viewports, which is just another 
name for model space viewports. Tiled refers to the way in which model 
space viewports always fill the drawing area, with no gaps and no overlap-
ping allowed. Conversely, paper space viewports are sometimes called float-
ing viewports because you can move them around, leave gaps between them, 
and overlap them.

452
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
The following steps explain how to set up model space viewports and create 
your own 3D modeling template file:
 
1. If you’re not already in the 3D Modeling workspace, click the 
Workspace drop-down in the Quick Access Toolbar and select 3D 
Modeling.
 
 You can also click the Workspace Switching button on the status bar 
and again, select 3D Modeling. If the Materials Browser palette opens, 
close it.
 
2. Click New on the Quick Access Toolbar to open the Select Template 
dialog box.
 
 If a new blank drawing appears and you don’t see the Select Template 
dialog box, someone has assigned a default template to this button in 
the Options dialog box. In that case, click the Application button (the 
Big Red A) and choose New, then choose Drawing from the submenu.
 3. 
Choose acad.dwt (choose acadiso.dwt if metric is your preference), 
and click Open.
 
 Yes, I know there are acad3d.dwt and acadiso3d.dwt templates, but 
trust me — it’s easier to start this setup from a 2D template.
 
 
4. From the Viewports panel on the Ribbon’s View tab, choose New.
 
 
 The Viewports dialog box appears. 
 
5. Choose Four: Left (my preference) or Four: Right from the Standard 
Viewports list box.
 
 The Preview panel shows a large squarish viewport occupying most of 
the work area, with three small squarish viewports stacked on the left 
(or right). The default 2D setup shows the visual style of all four view-
ports as “2D Wireframe.” (I explain visual styles in Chapter 21.)
 
6. From the Setup drop-down, choose 3D.
 
 The visual styles remain as 2D Wireframe, but the view direction (listed 
as “Current” in 2D Setup) is now SE Isometric in the large viewport, 
while the three small viewports show Top, Front, and Right ortho-
graphic views.
 
 When modeling in 3D, it’s nearly always helpful to look at your objects 
in two different ways at the same time. When looking at orthographic 
views, same as with a drafted drawing, you probably want to see all your 
linework. But you can get a better sense of the three-dimensionality of 
your model by looking at it in a shaded view. With multiple viewports, 
you can do both at the same time.

453
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
 
7. In the Preview area, click inside the large SE Isometric viewport, then 
choose Conceptual from the Visual Style drop-down.
 
 You’re almost finished in here. Rather than go through this setup every 
time you want to do some modeling, give your new viewport configura-
tion a name.
 
8. In the New Name box at the top of the Viewports dialog box, enter a 
name — V3D, for example — for the configuration.
 
 Figure 22-1 shows the new, named viewport configuration. After you close 
the Viewports dialog box, you can restore this configuration at any time 
by clicking the Named Viewports tab, choosing V3D, and clicking OK.
 
Figure 22-1: 
Setting up 
a 3D work 
environ-
ment in the 
Viewports 
dialog box.
 
 
9. Click OK to save the viewport configuration and close the Viewports 
dialog box.
 
 In Figure 22-2, I’ve turned off the grid in the three small ortho viewports, 
but whether you leave it on or turn it off is a matter of personal 
preference.
 
 The ViewCube’s Home button can trip you up by changing to a view you 
don’t expect. (I introduce the ViewCube in Chapter 21.) If you want to 
keep the current SE Isometric viewpoint, you need to reset the Home 
view. And because you’ve gone to the trouble of setting up a shaded 3D 
viewport, why not make it a little more realistic and turn on perspective 
mode at the same time?

454
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
Figure 22-2: 
2D and 3D 
all at the 
same time.
 
 
10. In the large 3D viewport, right-click the ViewCube to display its short-
cut menu, then click Perspective With Ortho Faces (see Figure 22-3).
 
 Selecting Perspective shows your orthographic views in perspective 
mode, and usually you don’t want that. Selecting Perspective With Ortho 
Faces resets the projection mode from perspective to parallel when you 
switch to an orthographic view.
 
Figure 22-3: 
Changing 
settings 
in the 
ViewCube’s 
right-click 
menu. 
 
11. Repeat Step 10, this time selecting Set Current View As Home.
 
 Now you can readily return to this viewport configuration, keeping the 
same viewpoint in all viewports, perspective projection in the 3D view-
port, and parallel projection in the orthographic viewports.

455
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
 
 To return to a single viewport later, click in the one whose view you 
want to use, choose Viewport Configurations on the Viewports panel of 
the View tab and select Single from the drop-down menu.
 
 The last thing you need to do is save the configuration you’ve just set up 
as a template (.dwt) file.
 
12. Click Save on the Quick Access Toolbar. On the Files Of Type drop-
down menu, choose AutoCAD Drawing Template (*.dwt) and enter a 
filename. Click Save.
 
 AutoCAD saves your new 3D template file in the same place as your 
other templates so it’s always there for you to select when you want to 
do some serious 3D modeling.
Seeing the world from new viewpoints
When you choose 3D in the Viewports dialog box’s Setup drop-down list, you 
direct AutoCAD to change the viewpoint in each viewport. The default view-
points when you choose a four viewport arrangement are top, front, right, 
and SE (“southeast”) isometric. These viewpoints work well for viewing and 
constructing simple models, but eventually, you’ll probably want to specify 
your own, custom viewpoint in a particular viewport.
In both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, the best — but not the easiest — way 
to change viewpoints is to use the drop-down list on the Views panel of the 
View tab (as shown in Figure 22-4) to switch to one of the standard ortho-
graphic 3D views or an isometric view:
 ✓ 
The six standard orthographic (straight-on) views are Top, Bottom, Left, 
Right, Front, Back.
 ✓ 
The four standard isometric views are SW (left-front), SE (right-front), 
NE (right-back), and NW (left-back). An isometric view is one in which 
you see the object from above, but not too high above — as though you 
were hovering in a low-flying helicopter.
 
The easiest — but not the best — way to change viewpoints is to click one 
of the named faces on the ViewCube (not available in AutoCAD LT). I don’t 
recommend this because the ViewCube is a viewing aid, and nothing but. 
You usually change to an orthographic view because you want to do some 
drawing or modeling there, and for that, your UCS (user coordinate system) 
ought to orient itself with the view (see Chapter 21 for the skinny on UCSs). 
Clicking Front on the ViewCube shows you a nice front view of your model, 
but it leaves the UCS unchanged, and that can make drawing anything difficult. 
Clicking Front on the View tab’s Views panel does change the UCS to Front so 
it matches the view and lets you draw without difficulty.

456
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
Figure 22-4: 
The preset 
views drop-
down menu. 
 
These ten views are called standard because they’re often used in manual 
drafting and rendering work. They work well for showing 3D models of 
common objects such as mechanical components and buildings. (You can 
also change to plan view, which is a top-down view of either the world coor-
dinate system or a user coordinate system. I describe coordinate systems in 
Chapter 21.)
 
The full version of AutoCAD has the ViewCube, the 3DORBIT command, and 
the Shift+Middle button method of changing 3D viewpoints (all are described 
in Chapter 21). AutoCAD LT’s options are much more limited. LT users can 
set nonstandard viewpoints by typing DDVPOINT and pressing Enter. In the 
Viewpoint Presets dialog box that appears, specify the following settings:
 ✓ 
A viewing angle in the XY plane (imagine moving a camera on a dolly 
around an object, while keeping the camera at the same elevation)
 ✓ 
An angle from the XY plane (imagine using a boom to swoop the camera 
up to a different height so that you’re looking at the object from increas-
ingly steep angles)
AutoCAD users can set viewpoints the same way, but it’s grossly inefficient 
compared to the other viewing options.
 
By default, AutoCAD shows 3D models in 2D wireframe mode, even if you’ve 
created surface or solid objects. If you want to better visualize which objects 
are in front of which other objects, especially in an isometric or other non-
orthogonal view, you have a couple of options:
 ✓ 
Select a shaded visual style such as Realistic, Conceptual, or Shades of 
Gray, from the Visual Styles drop-down on the Visual Styles panel of the 
View tab. (See Chapter 21 for the low-down on visual styles.)
 ✓ 
Render the model, as described in Chapter 23.

457
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
 
AutoCAD LT doesn’t include visual styles, because they’re not much use in 2D 
drafting. A drawing saved in a visual style in the full version of AutoCAD does 
display that style when it’s opened in AutoCAD LT — however, there’s no way 
of changing it to 2D wireframe (or anything else) so you can actually work on it. 
From Drawing to Modeling in 3D
This section introduces three techniques for creating 3D objects: drawing 
3D lines and polylines, creating 3D objects from 2D geometry, and creating 
solids. (In AutoCAD LT you can use the first two techniques only.) AutoCAD 
is also very capable at surface modeling, offering both freeform mesh and 
NURBS surfaces. If you’re interested in either of these, check out the online 
help system — on the home page, choose Work with 3D Models, and then 
Create 3D models. Topics include creating surfaces and meshes from scratch, 
and creating solids and surfaces from 2D objects.
 
When you draw 3D objects, just like when you draw 2D objects, put them on 
appropriate layers and use precision techniques to specify each point and dis-
tance. See Chapter 5 for more information.
Drawing basic 3D objects
The most basic forms of 3D geometry are wireframe-like objects created by 
picking points or entering XYZ coordinates. Such objects have no surfaces, 
so look the same in 2D Wireframe mode or a photorealistic rendering. They 
are most useful as paths for sweeps and lofts, or as edges for surface cre-
ation. Such objects include:
 ✓ 
Lines. Lines are really 2D objects; although you can specify different 
z-coordinates for start- and endpoints so they are not coplanar with the 
world coordinate system, each individual segment is based on its own 
2D plane. You can, however, use lines for constructing objects in 3D 
space.
 ✓ 
3D Polylines. Created with the 3DPOLY command. Similar to the 2D 
polylines I describe in Chapter 8, except the vertices of 3D polylines can 
have different z-coordinates (2D polylines must be planar). 3D polylines 
are useful as paths for sweeps or for fly-throughs (I don’t cover walk-
throughs or fly-throughs in this book).
 ✓ 
Splines. Splines are freeform curves, created with the SPLINE command 
and I describe them in a 2D context in Chapter 9. Splines are 3D objects 
and vertices can have different z-values. Splines are a better option than 
3D polylines for sweeps because they can have smoother curves.

458
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 ✓ 
Helixes. Helixes can be either 2D (think of a mosquito coil, or the ele-
ment on an electric range) or 3D (think of Mr. Slinky). Helixes are espe-
cially useful as paths for threaded objects.
You can find the LINE, 3DPOLY, and SPLINE commands on the Draw panel of 
the Ribbon’s Home tab; the HELIX command is on that panel’s slideout. 
 
The 3DPOLY command is similar to the PLINE (plain old 2D polylines) com-
mand. Both commands draw a series of connected line segments, but they 
have different capabilities:
 ✓ 
The 3DPOLY command accepts 3D points for the line segments’ vertices. 
The PLINE command requires that all vertices be in the same plane.
 ✓ 
3DPOLY is limited to straight line segments. PLINE can draw arc seg-
ments and create segments with uniform or tapered width.
 ✓ 
Segments created with 3DPOLY can’t display dash-dot linetypes; 3D 
polyline segments always display as continuous lines. 
The command sequence for drawing 3D segments with the LINE or 3DPOLY 
command is the same as for drawing 2D segments with the LINE command; see 
Chapter 8 if you need a refresher on drawing lines. The only difference is that 
you specify 3D coordinates instead of 2D ones. Figure 22-5 shows an example.
 
Figure 22-5: 
Entering 3D 
coordinates 
to draw a 3D 
polyline.
 

459
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
Creating 2D representations in this way is straightforward, though tedious 
for all but the simplest objects. More important, a wireframe model becomes 
increasingly difficult to decipher as the complexity of the model increases. 
You see a mass of lines representing the edges, and you have difficulty telling 
which parts of which edges are in front of others. To reduce this visual confu-
sion, you need to graduate to surface or solid modeling commands. I intro-
duce you to solid modeling in subsequent sections of this chapter.
Gaining a solid foundation
Solid modeling is in many ways the culmination of 3D CAD. Solids more accu-
rately represent most real-world objects than do wireframes or surfaces. And 
even when representational accuracy isn’t the main issue, it’s easier to con-
struct many kinds of models with solids.
 
Many special-purpose solid modeling programs use a combination of solid and 
surface modeling techniques for maximum flexibility in constructing and edit-
ing 3D models. These kinds of programs — and solid modeling in general — are 
becoming especially popular in mechanical design.
Constructing the basic building blocks — or solid primitives — for a solid 
model in AutoCAD isn’t difficult. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Define a suitable UCS (user coordinate system).
 
 See the “Changing Planes” section in Chapter 21. The UCS controls the 
construction plane and basic 3D orientation of the solid.
 
2. Click the leftmost button on the Modeling panel of the Home tab, and 
then choose a solid primitive from the lower half of the split button.
 
 As shown in Figure 22-6, your choices are Box, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere, 
Pyramid, Wedge, and Torus. 
 
When you see a 3D object in a drawing, you can’t tell by looking whether it’s 
a 2D extruded object, surface mesh, or solid. If you want to find out, open the 
Properties palette and select the object. The drop-down list at the top of the 
palette shows the type of object that you selected.
Drawing solid primitives
Solids are the easiest kind of object to work with if you’re new to 3D. There 
are two types of 3D solid object: 
 ✓ 
Primitive solids: The most basic of 3D building blocks, such as boxes, 
cones, and spheres. Primitive solids are based on simple geometric 
shapes like lines and circles.

460
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 ✓ 
Complex (or compound) solids: Made by combining primitive solids 
and optionally editing them with Boolean operations. The following sec-
tions focus on creating and modifying 3D solids.
 
Figure 22-6: 
Everything 
you need for 
a solid foun-
dation.
 
 
Boolean editing operations (named for the Victorian English mathemati-
cian George Boole) use arithmetic-like functions to combine solid objects or 
remove parts of them. The three primary Boolean commands in AutoCAD are 
UNION, SUBTRACT, and INTERSECT.
Adding the Third Dimension 
to 2D Objects
AutoCAD’s 2D roots run deep. Drafting continues to be the primary focus of 
the program, but recent AutoCAD releases have shifted focus, and the pro-
gram has become more and more adept at 3D modeling. This section invites 
you to take what you probably have an abundance of right now (2D objects) 
and create new 3D objects from them. 
 
The EXTRUDE, LOFT, SWEEP, and REVOLVE commands now support the 
option to create either surface or 3D solids when using closed objects. This 
option makes it much easier when working with surface models rather than 
solids. You can also use an edge or sub-object as a profile/path to create a 
new surface and are no longer limited to planar curves.

461
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
Creating 3D objects from 2D drawings
You can create 3D objects from 2D objects by using a number of different 
techniques. You can add thickness or extrude an open 2D object to create 
a surface, or take multiple 2D cross sections and create a lofted object that 
adapts to the shape and size of each cross section selected. Everything men-
tioned here applies to AutoCAD only (not AutoCAD LT), with the exception of 
the thickness property.
Add thickness to a 2D object
Most 2D objects, such as lines and circles, have a thickness property. 
Changing a 2D object’s thickness property does not create a true 3D object, 
but it does create a pseudo-surface that looks like a 3D surface. These 
pseudo-surfaces can hide objects beyond them, but they do have limitations. 
If you add thickness to a circle, a cylinder is created that is capped on the 
top and bottom. You can change the thickness of a polyline to create an open 
box that has no top or bottom. 
Extrude open and closed objects
 
 Thickness is one way of adding height to an object, but extruding an object is 
usually a better approach. You can extrude open or closed 2D objects to 
create a 3D solid. Extruding a closed 2D object, such as a polyline, spline, 
ellipse, circle, or region, creates a 3D solid; extruding an open 2D object, such 
as a polyline, spline, line, or arc, creates a surface. Figure 22-7 shows exam-
ples of open and closed objects before and after being extruded.
 
Figure 22-7: 
2D to 3D by 
extrusion is 
easy as 
1, 2, 3.
 
To extrude an open or closed 2D object, click Extrude on the Solid panel of 
the Solid tab, or click the Extrude split button on the Home tab’s Modeling 
panel (if you see a button labeled Loft, Revolve, or Sweep, click the lower 
part of the split button and choose Extrude from the drop-down). Use the 
MOde option to control whether you create a surface or 3D solid from a 

462
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
closed object, select the objects you want to extrude, and specify an extru-
sion height or distance to create the 3D solid.
 
The DELOBJ system variable controls whether the 2D objects you use to 
create 3D solids is retained or erased. Most of the time, you probably want 
to keep the source geometry, but the default DELOBJ setting erases it. If you 
want to keep the original 2D geometry, type DELOBJ and set its value to 0. 
(See Chapter 26 for more about system variables.)
Press and pull closed boundaries
 
 The PRESSPULL command allows you to create 3D geometry by extruding a 
closed boundary. PRESSPULL differs from EXTRUDE in that the EXTRUDE 
command requires 2D geometry while PRESSPULL can use closed boundaries 
formed by other 3D solids.
To press or pull within a closed boundary to create a 3D object, click 
Presspull on the Solid tab’s Solid panel, and then click as required to specify 
a closed boundary. After you have clicked in a closed boundary, drag or 
specify the distance on the extrusion you want to create.
Loft open and closed objects
 
 Lofting allows you to select a series of 2D cross-sections to create a surface or 
3D solid. The selected cross-sections are used to define the outer surface 
that’s generated. You must select a minimum of two cross-sections. If you 
select open objects, the resulting loft is a surface; if you select closed objects, 
the resulting loft can be either a surface or 3D solid, depending on the cur-
rent value of the MOde option for the LOFT command.
You can loft objects along a path using guide curves, or just between the 
selected cross-sections (see Figure 22-8). To loft open or closed 2D objects, 
open the Sweep/Loft drop-down on the Solid tab’s Solid panel. Use the MOde 
option to control whether you create a surface or 3D solid from a closed 
object cross-sections, and specify how the loft object should be calculated.
 
Figure 22-8: 
Using cross-
sections 
to create a 
lofted object.
 

463
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
 
After you create a lofted object, you can change the way it’s displayed by 
selecting it and clicking the triangle grip that appears. Select the new display 
option from the pop-up menu that appears.
Sweep open and closed objects along a path
 
 Sweeping is similar to extruding a 2D object, except you must specify a path, 
rather than a height or distance. The object used as the path can be either an 
open or closed 2D object, and can be only a single object (see Figure 22-9). If 
you sweep an open object, the resulting swept object is a surface; if you use a 
closed object, the resulting swept object is a surface or 3D solid based on the 
current value of the MOde option of the SWEEP command.
To sweep an open or closed 2D object, open the Sweep/Loft drop-down on 
the Solid panel of the Solid tab. Use the MOde option to control whether you 
create a surface or 3D solid from a closed object, select the objects to sweep, 
and specify a path for the sweep.
 
Figure 22-9: 
Sweeping 
a closed 
object along 
a path.
 
Revolve open or closed objects around an axis
 
 Revolving allows you to create a surface or 3D solid by turning selected 
objects around an axis (see Figure 22-10). If open objects are selected, the 
resulting revolved object is a surface; if you select closed objects, the result-
ing revolved object is a 3D solid.
To revolve an open or closed 2D object, click Revolve on the Solid panel of 
the Solid tab, or click the Revolve split button on the Home tab’s Modeling 
panel (if you see a button labeled Loft, Extrude, or Sweep, click the lower part 
of the split button and choose Revolve from the drop-down). Use the MOde 
option to control whether you create a surface or 3D solid from a closed 
object, select the objects to revolve, and specify the axis to use.

Modifying 3D Objects
Many of the modification techniques and commands that you use in 2D draft-
ing can be applied to 3D modeling. In addition, a specialized set of 3D editing 
commands is available. These specialized 3D commands can be used on both 
2D and 3D objects. All these commands are located on the Modify panel of 
the Home tab when the 3D Modeling workspace is current.
Selecting sub-objects
3D objects themselves are complex objects that can be made up of several 
hundred — even thousands of — objects. Although these objects never stray 
from their parent, you can access each and every one of them individually 
or in groups through sub-object selection. Sub-object selection allows you 
to select a vertex, edge, or face of a 3D object. After you select a sub-object, 
you can use grip editing and the 3D gizmos to manipulate it. I discuss the 3D 
gizmos in the following section.
To help you select sub-objects, enable sub-object filtering from the Ribbon. 
Sub-object filters are located on the Subobject Selection Filter drop-down on 
the Subobject panel, which appears on the Home and Solid tabs.
 
The new CULLINGOBJ and CULLINGOBJSELECTION system variables help 
limit object selection to the faces that are visible in the current view by ignor-
ing faces around the back of the objects being viewed. By default, both of 
these variables are turned off, so you can select objects in front and behind. 
If you have a complex model, turn culling on. To turn culling on, click Culling 
on the Subobject panel of the Home tab. To turn it off, click the Culling button 
again. The button is shaded blue when the feature is enabled.
 
If you just need to select a face on a 3D object, press and hold the Ctrl key and 
select the face you want to select. This can be faster than turning subobject 
filters on and off.

Working with gizmos
Although you can use the MOVE, ROTATE, and SCALE commands to modify 
3D objects, they can sometimes give unexpected results in 3D. Enter the 
3DMOVE, 3DROTATE, and 3DSCALE commands, which all utilize a gizmo or 
grip tool when a non-orthographic view is current (see Figure 22-11).
 
Figure 22-11: 
Using 
gizmos 
to modify 
objects 
in 3D.
 
Move
Rotate
Scale
The gizmo restricts or constrains movement along the X,Y plane and the 
Z-axis. To use a gizmo, click one of the axes on the tool to restrict movement 
to that axis. You can access the three gizmos by using the following methods:
 ✓ 
3DMOVE: Click 3D Move on the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type 
3DMOVE at the command line.
 ✓ 
3DROTATE: Click 3D Rotate on the Modify panel (Home tab), or type 
3DROTATE at the command line.
 ✓ 
3DSCALE: Click 3D Scale on the Modify panel, or type 3DSCALE at the 
command line.
 
You can also access the Move, Rotate, and Scale gizmos in 3D by selecting 
objects when no command is active. You can set the default gizmo that is 
displayed when you use grips in 3D by opening the Gizmo drop-down in the 
Home tab’s Subobject panel and selecting the gizmo you want to be active. 
Right-clicking over a gizmo allows you to switch between different gizmos 
and constraints. 
More 3D variants of 2D commands
Moving, rotating, and scaling objects are certainly the big three of 3D editing, 
but a number of other 3D variations on 2D editing commands are hiding in 
the wings, awaiting their turn in the spotlight (for more about spotlights, see 
Chapter 23!).
Getting your 3D ducks in a row
Getting objects to align with each other in 3D can be a challenge at times, 
especially if you need to not only move an object in 3D, but also get it to 

466
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
rotate and scale based on the specified alignment. AutoCAD has two com-
mands that can be used to align objects:
 ✓ 
ALIGN: Used to align 2D and 3D objects based on one, two, or three 
pairs of points. Based on the number of pairs of points specified and 
how they’re selected, the ALIGN command might move and rotate the 
selected objects into place. It can also be used to scale objects as well. 
On the Home tab, click to open the Modify panel slideout and choose 
Align. 
 ✓ 
3DALIGN: An improved version of the ALIGN command that includes 
additional options, as well as the ability to move and rotate a copy of the 
selected objects and use Dynamic UCS with the command. Click 3D Align 
on the Modify panel of the Home tab. 
Holding up a mirror
The MIRROR command is limited to working on the X,Y plane. If you want 
to mirror objects in 3D, you need to use the MIRROR3D command. Click 3D 
Mirror on the Modify panel of the Home tab. The MIRROR3D command is 
similar to the MIRROR command, but you can control the plane on which the 
mirroring is performed.
Array, array for 3D modeling
Typically, arrays are 2D, and objects are positioned on the X,Y plane either in 
rows and columns, or rotated around a center point; but with 3D arrays, you 
can create additional objects in the Z direction, which is known as levels. You 
can create both rectangular and polar arrays by using the 3DARRAY com-
mand, just like you can with the ARRAY command.
To create a 3D array, choose 3D Array on the Home tab’s Modify panel. When 
the command starts, select the objects you want to array, and then specify 
which type of array you want to create. Complete the array by following the 
prompts at the command line.
Editing solids
3D solids can be edited in a variety of different ways that other objects can’t 
be. You can use grip-editing to change the shape of 3D solids, or Boolean 
operations on a 3D solid to create complex models. You can fillet and 
chamfer the edges of a 3D solid using the FILLETEDGE and CHAMFEREDGE 
commands.
Using grips to edit solids
Grip-editing is one of the most direct ways to modify an object. To edit a 3D 
solid by using grips, select the 3D solid when no command is running, and 

467
 Chapter 22: From Drawings . . . to Models
then select the grip you want to use to edit the solid. Pay close attention to 
the grip you select; some grips give you control over changing the overall 
size of a solid, whereas others might change only part of a solid, such as the 
face or top radius of a cone. Figure 22-12 shows a pyramid with its top radius 
being editing by using grips.
 
Figure 22-12: 
Grip editing 
a pyramid.
 
Boolean operations
 
 
 As I mention in the “Drawing solid primitives” section earlier in this chapter, 
you can join 3D solids by using the UNION command to create a new 3D solid. 
You can also subtract volume from a 3D solid by using another intersecting 3D 
solid to determine what should be removed with the SUBTRACT command. 
The INTERSECT command can be used to calculate a new 3D solid based on 
the intersecting of two or more 3D solids. See Figure 22-13 for examples. You 
can find these three commands on the Boolean panel of the Solid tab.
 
Figure 22-13: 
Solid primi-
tives on the 
left, and the 
result from 
UNION, 
SUBTRACT, 
and 
INTERSECT 
commands.
 
SUBTRACT
UNION
INTERSECT
Filleting and chamfering
Since fillets and chamfers are common real-world features, it’s logical that 
tools for creating them are available. You can fillet or bevel the edges of a 3D 
solid by clicking the Fillet Edge (or Chamfer Edge) split button on the Solid 
tab’s Solid Editing panel. 

468
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
Both commands allow you to select multiple edges to fillet or bevel. When 
you select an edge, AutoCAD gives you feedback on how the selected edge 
will be affected. Figure 22-14 shows an L-shaped 3D solid that’s been filleted 
and chamfered.
 
Figure 22-14: 
Before and 
after filleting 
and cham-
fering a 3D 
solid. 
 
You can remove a fillet or chamfer by starting the ERASE command and, at 
the Select Objects prompt, holding down the Ctrl key and selecting the fillet 
or chamfer to be removed. For fillets, you may need to also remove nearby fil-
leted corners that might have been created during the application of the fillet.
 
The FILLETEDGE and CHAMFEREDGE commands are new in AutoCAD 2011. 
You can still use the FILLET and CHAMFER commands on 3D solids, but the 
new commands are much more efficient.
Slice
The SLICE command allows you to take an object and cut a 3D solid along the 
given plane. You can slice a 3D solid by using a planar curve such as a circle, 
2D polyline, or a surface, among many others. When you slice a 3D solid, you 
have a choice about which 3D solid is kept — or you could just keep both. 
Figure 22-15 shows a solid that has been sliced in half. To start the SLICE 
command, choose Slice from the Solid Editing panel of the Solid tab. After the 
command is started, specify a 3D solid to slice, an axis or object to define the 
cutting plane, and then finally which new 3D solids to keep.

f you come from a family of farmers, you probably know that rendering is 
what you do to fat to make it into lard. You can breathe a sigh of relief — this 
chapter is not about that kind of rendering! In the computer graphics world, 
rendering is the process of illuminating a set of 3D objects with one or more 
imaginary lights and then creating a more-or-less realistic picture of the results. 
(No, computer programmers didn’t have lard on their minds when they bor-
rowed the word rendering. Hand-drawn pictures of building facades were called 
renderings long before computers got into the act.)
A single example of this technique is called a still rendering. Multiple frames 
strung together produce computer animation. The objects that you see in 
movies such as WALL-E or Shrek are first created as 3D models and then ren-
dered frame by frame — a process that can take immense amounts of time 
even on ultrafast graphics workstations — to produce the beautifully, well-
rendered images you see.
 
AutoCAD is best at creating still enderings. If you want to create photoreal-
istic rendered animations, you need to use other software programs such as 
Autodesk 3ds Max. Even if you use other animation programs, AutoCAD can 
still be useful for developing the initial 3D models.
Rendering has steadily improved in speed and usability as PCs have 
become faster, and programmers have improved their rendering algorithms. 
Rendering of simple scenes is now practical on a mainstream PC, and a 

470
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
fast personal computer can create some impressive images in a reasonable 
amount of time. Rendered images are useful for previewing how your models 
will work in real life and also can be powerful tools for sales and marketing 
communications for your company. A (rendered) picture can be worth quite 
a bit more than a thousand words.
People who do a lot of rendering and want higher quality, photorealistic 
results usually use programs other than AutoCAD to render their models. 
Autodesk 3ds Max, Cinema 4D (Maxon), and AccuRender (Robert McNeel & 
Associates) are three popular photorealistic rendering programs. Most ren-
dering programs can import 3D models from AutoCAD DWG files, but some 
people use specialized 3D modeling programs to do their modeling as well.
Visualizing the Digital World
Rendering allows you to see how a final product might look before it is manu-
factured or built in the real world (see Figure 23-1); it definitely helps to sell a 
concept to a client. While you can show a client a hidden line or shaded view 
of a 3D model, a photorealistic render just helps make it feel that much more 
real when looking at it.
 
Figure 23-1: 
Rendering 
compared to 
Conceptual 
visual style.
 
Before rendering a 3D model, you need to do the following:
 ✓ 
Add lighting to highlight features and define shadows
 ✓ 
Apply materials to 3D objects by face, object, or layer
 ✓ 
Set up a background for your 3D model to be rendered against
All the above mentioned items help to bring realism to a 3D model. This 
chapter focuses on each of these tasks before covering the steps to create a 
rendering.

471
 Chapter 23: On a Render Bender
Adding Lighting
One of the key ingredients in the soup that makes a rendering look good is 
lighting. Lighting helps give a model depth through the use of highlights and 
shadows. Just as in the real world, objects that are closest to the light source 
appear the brightest and those the farthest away appear the darkest.
There are two types of lighting in AutoCAD: Default and user-defined. Default 
lighting, as its name suggests, is on and available in every drawing, and it’s 
what gives some basic form to your 3D model when you click the Render 
button before you add lighting of your own. All types of user-defined lights 
can cast shadows. Most of the tools that you use to create and edit lights are 
located on the Lights and Sun & Location panels on the Render tab.
Default lighting
Over the past few years, AutoCAD’s default lighting has improved in qual-
ity. Prior to AutoCAD 2007, default lighting consisted of a single distant light 
source, always directed toward the target of your current view from behind 
your back. AutoCAD 2007 added a second default light to help increase the 
lighting level, and to balance the lighting in a viewport.
Default lighting can’t cast shadows, so I don’t recommend using it for final 
renderings. It does work pretty well for quick conceptual renderings, how-
ever. You can control the brightness, contrast, and midtones levels for 
default lighting with the slider controls on the slideout of the Lights panel on 
the Render tab of Ribbon (see Figure 23-2).
 
Figure 23-2: 
AutoCAD to 
lights, extra 
brightness 
is a go.
 

472
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
The DEFAULTLIGHTING system variable is used to enable and disable the use 
of default lighting in the current viewport. Set DEFAULTLIGHTING to 0 when 
you want user-defined lighting to render your 3D model. If you are using 
default lighting, the DEFAULTLIGHTINGTYPE system variable controls 
whether one or two default distant lights are used. When set to 0, one default 
light is used; when set to 1, two default lights are used.
User-defined lights
Default lights are fine for quick renderings, but they don’t bring your render-
ings to life in the way that user-defined lights can. User-defined lights are 
lights that you create — with one exception — and modify in your 3D model. 
The only user-definable light type that you can enable and modify, but can’t 
create, is the sunlight system. 
The first time a user-defined light is placed in a drawing, the Lighting – 
Viewport Lighting Mode alert box is displayed, advising you that you need 
to turn off default lighting in order to see light from user-defined sources. 
Click Turn Off the Default Lighting to disable default lighting. (To turn default 
lighting back on, open the Lights panel slideout on the Render tab and click 
Default Lighting.) You should always disable default lighting when using user-
defined lights; otherwise you can end up over-lighting your model, making it 
look unnatural. 
There are two types of user-defined lights that you can create: generic and 
photometric.
 ✓ 
Generic lights: Provide advanced control over how they emit light and 
are much more complex than photometric lights.
 ✓ 
Photometric lights: More convenient to use as they are defined to repre-
sent how lights work in the physical world.
The LIGHTINGUNITS system variable controls whether user-defined lights 
in your drawing are represented as generic or photometric lights. When 
LIGHTINGUNITS is set to 0, generic lights are used. When LIGHTINGUNITS is 
set to 1 or 2, photometric lights are used; 1 indicates American lighting units 
and 2 indicates International lighting units. Lights do not have to be removed 
and added to switch between generic and photometric lights; you just need 
to switch the system variable.
To add a user-defined light to your drawing, click the lower half of the Create 
Light split button on the Lights panel of the Render tab. You can choose from 
four distinct types of lights on the flyout (for the differences between the 
light types, see Figure 23-3):

473
 Chapter 23: On a Render Bender
 
 ✓ 
Point light: Emits light uniformly in all directions, but the emitted light 
falls off the farther it gets from the source. A point light is similar to a 
candle or a lantern. 
 
 ✓ 
Spotlight: Emits light in a specific direction. As light travels further from 
the source, it spreads out in the shape of a cone. You can define the 
hotspot — the brightest part of the emitted light — and the falloff of the 
light. 
 
 ✓ 
Distant light: Emits light along a specified vector and does not decay 
or falloff like other user-defined lights do. A distant light is similar to 
the sun. 
 
 ✓ 
Weblight: A cross between a point light and a spotlight. Weblights are only 
available when using photometric lights and the way they emit light is 
determined by an IES file. IES files are provided by lighting companies for 
use in products like AutoCAD to mimic the lights that they manufacture. 
 
Figure 23-3: 
Lighting 
primitives 
with the 
four types 
of user-
defined 
lights.
 
Point light
Spotlight
Distant light
Weblight
 
I strongly advise you not to use distant lights when using photometric light-
ing. If you decide to ignore this warning, make sure to turn down the intensity 
factor of the distant light to avoid washing out your rendering. 
 
Point lights, spotlights, and weblights can be selected and edited directly in 
a drawing because a glyph is displayed to show where the light is located. 
Distant lights do not have an associated glyph. (A glyph is a nonprinting object 
displayed in a drawing that enables you to select an object that is not part of 
the actual model.)

474
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
Shadows . . . or no shadows?
AutoCAD allows you to define lights that can’t generate shadows. This might 
seem illogical, because shadows are cast when light is obscured by an object. 
This is important because you may want to fill an area with light but not have 
it affect the way shadows are cast.
To control the shadows a light can generate, select a light, then right-
click and choose Properties to open the Properties palette. The Shadows 
option in the General category enables or disables shadow creation from 
the selected light. The Rendered Shadow Details category gives you a large 
degree of creative control over shadow appearance. For more information 
on putting your objects in the shade, open the online help and browse to 
Render Drawings➪Render 3D Objects for Realism➪Basics of Rendering➪Use 
Shadows in Rendering. 
 
You can also control how objects themselves affect shadows. Select a 3D 
object, right-click and choose Properties. In the 3D Visualization category of 
the Properties palette, click the Shadow Display drop-down; you can configure 
your objects to cast shadows, receive shadows, both cast and receive shad-
ows, or ignore shadows altogether.
The Lights in Model palette
In a complex drawing or one in which you might have added a distant light, 
you’ll want to use the Lights in Model palette (see Figure 23-4). The Lights in 
Model palette allows you to select, delete, and access the Properties palette 
for selected lights. To display the Lights in Model palette, click the Lights 
panel launcher (the little arrow at the right end of the Lights panel label).
 
Figure 23-4: 
Ah . . . yes, 
you’re on 
the lights 
list.
 
Sunlight
You can simulate sunlight with the Sun Properties palette (see Figure 23-5). 
Adding sunlight to a drawing allows you to perform sunlight studies as well 
as add some realism to both indoor and outdoor renderings.

475
 Chapter 23: On a Render Bender
 
 The Sun Properties palette allows you to locate the sun’s position based on 
the nearest large city, or by entering latitude and longitude values. You can 
also use Google Earth KML or KMZ files to specify your location. In addition 
to location, you can designate the northern direction in your drawing to get 
the correct daily movement of the sunlight in your drawing. To adjust the 
sunlight in a drawing, open the Sun Properties palette by clicking the Sun & 
Location panel launcher (the little arrow on the panel label).
 
Figure 23-5: 
The Sun

Creating and Applying Materials
Materials can bring your model to life. Materials can be as simple as paint — 
matte or glossy or anywhere between. They can be opaque, transparent, 
reflective or non-reflective. You can apply representations of realistic, real-
world materials like stone, marble, glass, polished metal, fabric . . . the list 
is almost endless. AutoCAD 2011 comes with a material library of literally 
thousands of different material types, and assigning them to objects can be 
as simple as dragging from a palette and dropping on an object. Or it can be 
as complex as you care to make it.
 
Prior to AutoCAD 2011, you created and stored materials in individual draw-
ings, which made them difficult to manage. AutoCAD 2011 introduces the 
Materials Browser which makes managing materials much easier. Partnered 
with the Materials Browser is the new Materials Editor, accessible from a tool 
button in the Materials Browser. 

476
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
 The MATBROWSER command is used to display the Materials Browser pal-
ette (see Figure 23-6), which allows you to create, edit, and manage in the 
current drawing or material libraries. You add materials to your drawing in 
one of two ways, using a preconfigured material or create a custom material.
Follow these steps to create and manage a new material:
 
1. Choose Render tab➪Materials➪Materials Browser.
 
 The Materials Browser palette is displayed.
 
2. On the Materials Browser palette, in the upper-left, click Create a 
Material and then choose the material template you want to start with. 
For example, choose Metallic Paint.
 
 The Materials Editor palette is displayed (see Figure 23-6).
 
Figure 23-6:

texture to 
a 3D model 
with the

palette 
and the

Materials Browser palette
Materials Editor palette
 
 
3. On the Materials Editor palette, click in the Name field located below 
the preview of the material and enter a name.
 
 
4. Enter new values in the appropriate attributes for the material.
 
 The attributes you can edit vary based on the type of material template 
you choose to start with. When you’ve finished editing the material, you 
can close or hide the Materials Editor palette. The material is automati-
cally added to the current drawing.
 
5. Optionally, you can save the material in a library if you want to use 
it in more than one drawing. On the Materials Browser palette, at the 
bottom, click Manage, then select Create New Library.
 
 The Create Library dialog box is displayed.

477
 Chapter 23: On a Render Bender
 
6. Enter a name and location for the new library. Click Save.
 
7. On the Materials Browser palette, drag the custom material you cre-
ated onto the name of the new library.
 
 Now you can access the material from any drawing. You can create 
categories if you want to manage multiple materials within a library. In 
the Materials Browser, right-click the library name and choose Create 
Category, and then enter a name for the new category. After the cat-
egory is created, simply select the material from the right side of the 
Materials Browser and drag it to the new category.
 
You can open the Materials Editor directly from the Ribbon by clicking the 
Materials panel launcher (the little arrow at the right end of the Materials 
panel label).
Which materials you use in a model depends on what you’re trying to repre-
sent. For example, you might choose to make a material semitransparent to 
communicate an idea rather than a true material selection. After you create 
a material, you can apply it to the objects in your 3D model. You can apply 
materials to objects in the following ways:
 ✓ 
By Layer: Globally assign materials to all objects on a particular drawing 
layer by assigning a material to the layer. To assign materials by layer, 
open the Materials slideout on the Render tab and choose Attach By Layer. 
 ✓ 
By Object: Assign materials to an object by selecting the object, then 
right-clicking the material you want to assign in the Materials Browser 
palette. From the right-click menu, choose Assign to Selection. You can 
also drag and drop a material from the Materials Browser palette onto 
an object in a drawing or change an object’s Material property using the 
Properties palette.
 ✓ 
By Face: Assign materials to individual faces of a 3D solid. Select a face 
using Subobject filtering by holding down the Ctrl key and selecting the 
face you want to apply a material to. Once the face is selected, right-
click the material you want to assign in the Materials Browser palette, 
then choose Assign to Selection.
Defining a Background
While your model might now be looking a little more realistic with some user-
defined lighting and custom materials assigned to it, its setting might look a 
little . . . empty. You can assign backgrounds to fill that empty space beyond 
the 3D model in your scene. A background is a property of named views, and 
you can set them up in the View Manager dialog box (I cover the VIEW com-
mand and View Manager dialog box in Chapter 12). You can define a back-
ground as a solid color, a gradient (two or three colors), a raster image, or a 
sky with a sun (available only when using photometric lighting).

478
Part V: On a 3D Spree 
 
 Follow these steps to create a new named view and assign a background to it:
 
 
1. On the Views panel of the View tab, click Named Views.
 
 The View Manager dialog box appears. 
 
2. Click New to display the New View/Shot Properties dialog box.
 
 For a refresher on creating named views, refer to Chapter 12.
 
3. In the Background area, click the Default drop-down and choose an 
option to override the default background, then click OK.
 
 Choose Solid or Gradient if you want a studio-type scene, or choose 
Image if you have a suitable raster image to highlight your model. Any of 
these options displays the Background dialog box where you make your 
settings (see Figure 23-7). Choose Sun & Sky if you want to place your 
model in the great outdoors (and it’s always fair weather in AutoCAD!). 
Choosing the last option displays the Adjust Sun & Sky Background 
dialog box, as seen in Figure 23-8.
 
4. After the background is defined, select the view from the Views tree 
and click Set Current.
 
5. When the View Manager closes, the new background should be 
displayed.
 
 For more information on the View Manager, see Chapter 12.

mand at the command line to display the Background dialog box.

Rendering a 3D Model
Now that you’ve added lights, applied materials, and defined a background 
for your 3D model, you’re ready to press the magic button! Clicking Render 
tells AutoCAD to round up all the materials and apply them to the objects 
and faces to which they’re assigned. After materials are assigned, the back-
ground is applied to the current viewport, then finally AutoCAD calculates 
light and shadows based on all those property settings you made earlier in 
the chapter. 
 
 By default, rendering is performed in the Render Window (see Figure 23-9). 
To start rendering your virtual fat into digital lard (and how’s that for a grisly 
image?), click Render on the Render tab’s Render panel (another offering 
from the Department of Redundancy Department).
To help make rendering as easy as possible, AutoCAD comes with five 
render presets. A render preset is a configuration of rendering settings that 
you can use to get predictable results when rendering a model. The presets 
range in quality of output, from Draft, through Low, Medium, and High, to 
Presentation quality.
To set a render preset current, choose the Render Presets drop-down on the 
Render tab’s Render panel. Choose Manage Render Presets at the bottom of 
the Render Presets drop-down to open the Render Presets Manager dialog box. 
The Render Presets Manager allows you to create and edit custom render pre-
sets. You can start with an existing render preset when you create a new one.
If the render presets don’t seem to offer the look you’re striving for, you can 
experiment with the Advanced Render Settings palette (see Figure 23-10). 
Once you get the settings you like, you can save them to a render preset.

In addition to rendering a still image with the RENDER or RENDERCROP 
commands, you can create an animated walkthrough of your model using 
the ANIPATH. To find out more about creating animations, see the AutoCAD

Autodesk’s Discussion Groups
Although there are still some independent, newsreader-based discussion 
groups out there, the majority of the AutoCAD action nowadays happens 
on Autodesk’s own moderated discussion groups. These are user-to-user 
groups, but even so, you frequently see Autodesk employees jumping in to 
answer questions in their areas of expertise — sometimes on their own time!
To see what’s there, point your browser to www.autodesk.com/discussion. 
There are product-based discussion groups for AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT.

Autodesk’s Own Bloggers
Several of Autodesk’s employees run their own blogs through the company’s 
servers, and they’re chockablock with tips, techniques, and some occasionally 
highly entertaining digressions. For a list of all Autodesk’s blogs, go to www.
autodesk.com/blogs. The AutoCAD-based blogs I highly recommend are 
Shaan Hurley’s Between the Lines, Heidi Hewitt’s AutoCAD Insider, and Lynn 
Allen’s Blog (that’s what it’s called, honest!).
Autodesk University
Autodesk University is an annual event, sponsored by Autodesk, that usually 
runs for three or four days in the late autumn. For the last few years, the 
location has alternated between Orlando, Florida, and Las Vegas, Nevada. 
The days are filled with educational sessions in a dozen or more different 
disciplines, and the nights are filled with socializing and taking in the local 
attractions. Check out http://au.autodesk.com to find out how to 
schmooze like a pro and come home a guru!
The Autodesk Channel on YouTube
If you use Google to search the Web for solutions to particular AutoCAD 
issues, it’s pretty likely you’ve already discovered YouTube’s Autodesk 
Channel. There are dozens and dozens of video clips here that cover not only 
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, but other Autodesk products like Inventor and 
Revit. You can subscribe and receive e-mail notifications of new videos every 
couple of weeks. Check it out at www.youtube.com/autodesk.
The World Wide (CAD) Web
I’m reluctant to list any specific sites; I just went looking for an old favorite, 
and it’s not there any more. Your search engine will be your best friend here. 
Apart from Autodesk’s own Web presence, there are thousands upon thousands 
of other sites scattered around the world. Search on AutoCAD tutorials for 
online exercises, or try AutoCAD blogs for some independent views and 
opinions as well as tips and tricks for using AutoCAD.

Your Local ATC
Autodesk’s Authorized Training Centers, or ATCs, are located around the 
world in both private institutions and public colleges and institutes. At an 
ATC, you attend scheduled, instructor-led classes where you learn AutoCAD 
from the ground up. Courses are designed for rank beginners or experienced 
users who want to learn the latest customization techniques. To find the 
location of your nearest ATC, browse to www.autodesk.com/atc.
Your Local User Group
AutoCAD has had an incredibly loyal following in the quarter-century since 
its initial release. There are many reasons for this, but one of the main ones 
was the especially enthusiastic individuals who would arrange to meet up 
one evening a month and talk about what they’d discovered they could do 
with AutoCAD. Those folks are still out there — although some are a bit 
grayer and more wrinkled than they used to be — and they still love to get 
together and talk about AutoCAD. And most are especially welcoming to 
newcomers! My own local group, the Vancouver AutoCAD Users Society 
(www.vaus.org), happens to be the oldest user group in existence, and 
its newsletter grew and grew until it became Cadalyst magazine (Longitude 
Media, LLC)! To find a nearby group, enter “AutoCAD user group” and your 
city in your browser’s search box.
AUGI
AUGI (the acronym for Autodesk User Groups International) is the umbrella 
organization for the global user group community. You don’t even have to 
belong to a group to participate — individuals can join too, and membership 
is free. AUGI is probably best known for the annual wish list it presents to 
Autodesk; the list is compiled from requests from members for changes or 
new features in AutoCAD. It’s often the case that top wish list items find their 
way into new releases of AutoCAD, so here’s another place where you can 
help to shape future releases. Browse to www.augi.com to find out more.

Books
Although I’d like to fill you in on all the wonders of AutoCAD, there’s only so 
much I can do in a 400-page book. As I explain in the introduction, I simply 
don’t have the space to cover things like data linking and customization (not 
that either of those are of much use to AutoCAD LT users anyway). There are 
dozens of books on AutoCAD — just go to www.amazon.com and search on 
AutoCAD if you don’t believe me! For a more comprehensive look at AutoCAD 
(which a thousand pages allows!), have a gander at Ellen Finkelstein’s 
AutoCAD 2011 and AutoCAD LT 2011 Bible (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Chapter 25
Ten Differences between 
AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
T
his book is aimed at users of both the full version of AutoCAD and 
AutoCAD LT. Throughout the text, you can find icons in the margin that 
highlight places in my descriptions or steps that are significantly different 
between the two versions.
Rather than make you go through the entire text (not that it wouldn’t be a 
highly rewarding task!) looking for tidbits of information, in this chapter, I gather 
the ten most significant differences between the two versions.
Price
Most important to many people — especially if you exclusively work in 2D 
drafting and don’t see a need to spend a lot of time learning AutoCAD’s 
customization languages — is the much lower cost of AutoCAD LT. You can 
buy either version online (visit www.autodesk.com and click Purchase, then 
Shop Online) and in the first month of 2010, AutoCAD listed at $3,995 and 
AutoCAD LT at $1,200.
3D Abilities
This may be the most significant difference for some users. If you want to 
model in 3D, you have no choice but to use the full version. In AutoCAD LT, 
you can open and view 3D models created in the full version of AutoCAD, but 
you can’t edit them or create new ones. The only 3D construction you can 
do in AutoCAD LT is to apply a thickness property to linework. (In AutoCAD, 
thickness means perpendicular to the drawing plane; don’t confuse it with 
width, which applies to objects on the drawing plane.)

488
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
And even if you can open 3D models from the full version in AutoCAD LT, 
it’s not easy to view them. There are only a limited number of preset viewing 
positions, unlike the full version where you can rotate or orbit around your 
model to your heart’s content.
Finally, because AutoCAD LT is really a 2D drafting program, there are no 
visualization or presentation capabilities, unlike the full program which 
has several built-in visual styles like Conceptual and Realistic as well as a 
humongous materials library for rendering models.
Customization Options
This one is also a biggie for many people. Talk to seasoned AutoCAD users 
at work or your local user group, and you’ll find that the key to happiness 
is being able to customize AutoCAD so it does what they want with the 
minimum amount of time or effort. The full version of AutoCAD supports 
a number of Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. These include 
AutoCAD’s very own programming language — AutoLISP — and its marginally 
friendlier sibling Visual LISP, ActiveX Automation, and compiled language 
programming using ObjectARX or Microsoft’s .NET framework.
Although you can do fairly simple customization in AutoCAD LT — for 
example, creating or modifying toolbars, writing scripts, or using custom 
hatch patterns or linetypes — none of the higher-level programming 
described in the preceding paragraph is possible in LT.
Express Tools
The Express Tools are a set of officially unsupported but nevertheless pretty 
reliable “bonus” commands. The Express Tools are an optional item when 
you install AutoCAD, but I highly recommend you choose to include them. 
There are additional drawing and editing commands, a far more elaborate 
hatch routine than the regular HATCH command, and commands for working 
with blocks and xrefs, text, dimensions, and layouts.
Because most of the Express Tools are written using the APIs mentioned in 
the earlier “Customization Options” section, they won’t work in AutoCAD LT. 
On the positive side, sometimes a few of the Express Tools are moved into 
the core of the AutoCAD executable; because they’re not using one of those 
APIs I mention earlier, they can be made available to AutoCAD LT. For example, 
AutoCAD LT now includes a number of layer tools that had previously been 
Express Tools.

 Chapter 25: Ten Differences between AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT
Sheet Sets
Sheet sets provide a way of packaging drawing sets for distribution and 
plotting or publishing. A typical AutoCAD project can include dozens of 
drawings, scores of sheets, lots of layouts, copious cross-drawing references, 
and more than a few people working on those components at once. How do 
you create, manage, update, plot, and generally keep a handle on all that stuff 
without going crazy? One answer is AutoCAD’s sheet sets feature.
Sheet sets allow projects to be managed automatically; drawings get 
numbered correctly, title-block information is entered correctly, and sheet 
indexes can be created with the click of a button.
Sheet sets, introduced in AutoCAD 2005, are not included in AutoCAD LT.
Standards Checking
Like sheet sets, standards checking is deemed by Autodesk to fall in the 
realm of the big players who are far likelier to be using the full version of 
AutoCAD rather than AutoCAD LT. With standards checking, you configure 
a DWS file (that is, a DWG file set up with your standard layers, text and 
dimension styles, layouts, and so forth), and then compare your current 
drawing, or drawings done by outside consultants, with that DWS file to 
ensure they conform to your office standards.
Data Extraction
As I explain in Chapter 17, attributes are variable text strings that you create 
as part of a block definition. The data in the attributes can be edited or 
extracted easily in regular AutoCAD, and nearly as easily in AutoCAD LT 
(AutoCAD LT lacks the full version’s Data Extraction Wizard, which extracts 
information from objects and attributed or non-attributed blocks.) If being 
able to use all the data in your AutoCAD drawings, choosing the full version 
would be a better bet.
MLINE versus DLINE
Here’s a case where AutoCAD LT beats its big sibling! AutoCAD (full version) 
includes an extremely unwieldy command called MLINE for drawing multiple 

490
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
lines. You can draw multiple parallel lines in the same way you pick points 
for the LINE command, but multilines are unintuitive to configure and pretty 
darned difficult to edit.
AutoCAD LT doesn’t have MLINE, but it does have a different command 
called DLINE. DLINE (as in Double LINE) may not draw more than two parallel 
lines, and it can’t add colored fills, but it’s logical to use and much easier to 
edit. And sorry, AutoCAD users (I’ve been waiting to write that for the whole 
book!), but you don’t have DLINE.
Profiles
Throughout the book I make reference to the Options dialog box. This is the 
place where you make both drawing-specific and system-wide settings so 
you can configure the program to work the way that you want. In the full 
version of AutoCAD you can save these settings as named profiles, and 
switch between them on the Profiles tab of the Options dialog box. For 
example, you can have one profile with a white drawing background, and 
another with a dark background. Or you can have different profiles that point 
to different client support files. If more than one person shares a computer, 
each person can have his or her own profile.
Only in the full version, though — there is no Profiles tab in AutoCAD LT’s 
Options dialog box, because AutoCAD LT does not support profiles. Any 
changes you make to LT’s options become the current defaults, but they 
can’t be saved and restored later.
Reference Manager
Reference Manager is a free-standing program, not part of AutoCAD or 
AutoCAD LT. If you have the full version installed, you’ll find Reference 
Manager on the Windows Start menu. Reference Manager helps you make 
sure that any dependent files (for example, font files, images, or xrefs) are 
included when you ship a set of files anywhere. There’s no technical reason 
why AutoCAD LT shouldn’t include the Reference Manager. But it doesn’t.

Chapter 26
Ten System Variables to Make 
Your Life Easier
S
ystem variables are settings that AutoCAD checks before it decides how 
to do something. For example, if you set the system variable SAVETIME 
to 10, AutoCAD automatically saves your drawing file every ten minutes; 
if you set SAVETIME to 60, the time between automatic saves is one hour. 
Hundreds of system variables control AutoCAD’s operations.
To change the value of a system variable, just type its name at the AutoCAD 
command prompt and press Enter. AutoCAD displays the current value of the 
system variable setting and prompts for a new value. Press Enter to confirm 
the existing setting, or type a value and press Enter to change the setting.
Being able to change system variables by typing their names is a boon to 
power users and occasionally a necessity for everybody else. The only problem 
is finding or remembering what the names are. In most cases, you’ll be told 
what system variable name you need to type — by me in this book or by the 
local AutoCAD guru in your office.
 
Here are the three kinds of system variables:
 ✓ 
Those saved in the Windows Registry: If you change this kind of system 
variable, it affects all drawings when you open them on your system, but 
not necessarily on other computers.
 ✓ 
Those saved in the drawing: If you change this kind of system variable, 
the change affects only the current drawing, but on any computer.
 ✓ 
Those that aren’t saved anywhere: If you change this kind of system 
variable, the change lasts only for the current drawing session.
The System Variables section of the online help’s Command Reference tells 
you which kind of system variable each one is. There are several hundred 
system variables, but understanding the ten listed in this chapter will go a 
long way to making you a happy CADster.

492
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
APERTURE
APERTURE controls how close the crosshairs must get to an object before 
an object snap marker displays (I discuss object snaps in Chapter 7). You 
can set APERTURE at the command line anywhere from 0 to 50 pixels, or you 
can set it in the Options dialog box by adjusting a slider to a maximum of 20 
pixels. The initial value is 10, but I find 20 pixels is just about right for me. 
APERTURE is stored in the Windows registry.
DIMASSOC
DIMASSOC controls how AutoCAD’s dimension objects are created (see 
Chapter 14 for the lowdown on dimensioning). When DIMASSOC is 0, 
AutoCAD creates exploded dimensions of separate lines, 2D solids, and text. 
You really don’t want to work on DIMASSOC=0 drawings. When DIMASSOC=1, 
dimensions are referred to as non-associative — that means that they’re 
single objects, but they usually don’t update if you change an object’s size. 
When DIMASSOC=2 (the default), AutoCAD creates fully associative dimensions.
You can set this value at the command line or select the Make New 
Dimensions Associative check box in Options➪User Preferences. If you work 
with older drawings, you’ll likely find that the DIMASSOC value is 1, which is 
the best that versions prior to AutoCAD 2002 could manage. The DIMASSOC 
setting is stored in the drawing.
MENUBAR
When MENUBAR is 1, AutoCAD’s traditional classic menu bar displays below 
the program title bar. If MENUBAR is set to 0 (the default) the menu bar 
doesn’t display. MENUBAR is set automatically when you switch between the 
AutoCAD Classic and 2D Drafting & Annotation workspaces.
 
If you feel in need of training wheels while you get used to the Ribbon, 
displaying the classic menu bar is a good approach. (I describe the differences 
between the traditional AutoCAD Classic and the newer Ribbon-based 
workspaces in Chapter 2.)

493
 Chapter 26: Ten System Variables to Make Your Life Easier
MIRRTEXT
You’ve got to love it when a system variable name gives a clear indication 
of what it does (ROLLOVERTIPS, anyone?). You’ll frequently want to build 
up a drawing by mirroring already-drawn components of it. That’s what the 
MIRROR command does, but unfortunately, if text or dimensions are included 
in what you’re mirroring, those end up being reversed as well. Having to use 
a mirror to read the text on your drawing is counterproductive, so you can 
invoke MIRRTEXT to fix things. When MIRRTEXT is 0 (the default), text is 
mirrored along with everything else; setting it to 1 means everything gets 
mirrored but the text still reads the right way around. MIRRTEXT is stored in 
the drawing.
OSNAPZ
Sometimes drawing in 3D can be a little puzzling, especially if you’re looking at 
3D objects in orthographic views. Say you have a wireframe cube that you’re 
looking at in Plan view, and you want to draw a line between two diagonal 
corners on the top of the cube. Using object snaps to pick the corners, as often 
as not you’ll find that you have a line that’s not on the plane of the top of the 
box, but starts at a top corner and ends at a bottom corner. One way around 
this problem is set the OSNAPZ variable appropriately. By default, OSNAPZ 
is set to 0, which means AutoCAD will find the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinate of 
the snapped-to point. But often you don’t want this. Set OSNAPZ to 1, and 
AutoCAD replaces the Z-value of the picked point with the current elevation — 
or the Z-value of the first point picked.
Since OSNAPZ only affects drawing in three dimensions, it’s not available in 
AutoCAD LT.
PICKBOX
The pickbox is the little square box that the crosshairs turn into when 
AutoCAD prompts you to select something. You control pickbox size by 
setting a value in pixels for the PICKBOX variable. The initial setting of 

494
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
PICKBOX is 3, which is fine for a lower screen resolution like 1024 x 768. But 
when you start running at higher resolutions — or when your hair is grayer, 
your face more wrinkled, and your vision not quite as acute as it once was, 
a higher setting might be more useful. My old laptop computer ran at 1600 x 
1200 resolution, and I had to set PICKBOX to 5 to be able to use it effectively. 
My newer desktop runs at 1280 x 1024, and PICKBOX=4 is fine for that. But 
I’ve just acquired a new tablet PC that runs at 1400 x 1050, and I’m back to 
PICKBOX=5 for this one. As they say, your mileage may vary.
REMEMBERFOLDERS
Sometimes you don’t want AutoCAD to start in the same Documents folder 
where every other program stores its files. Maybe you work on a number 
of projects and would like a separate desktop icon for each to start in a 
particular folder. REMEMBERFOLDERS is your ticket to nirvana. By default, 
it’s set to 1, which means it defaults to storing files in My Documents (just 
plain Documents in Windows Vista and Windows 7). Set it to 0, and it will 
open from and save to the folder you specify in your desktop icon when you 
start, and the last folder you visit as you work. REMEMBERFOLDERS is a 
permanent setting that’s stored in the Windows registry (permanent, that is, 
until you change it to something else).
ROLLOVERTIPS
You were waiting for this one, weren’t you? ROLLOVERTIPS controls the 
tooltip-like message boxes you see when you hover the mouse pointer over 
objects in the drawing editor. If ROLLOVERTIPS is 1, mousing over your 
drawing displays a temporary panel showing the object type with its layer, 
color, and linetype.
You can get double-duty from this command. Not only can you key it into 
AutoCAD, but if you have a dog named Tips, you can use it to teach him a 
neat pet trick! ROLLOVERTIPS is stored in the Windows registry. (And believe 
it or not — and I’ll bet you won’t — there’s another system variable called 
NOMUTT! Could that be AutoCAD-ese for BAD DOG TIPS!?

495
 Chapter 26: Ten System Variables to Make Your Life Easier
TOOLTIPS
Tooltips themselves are the little text boxes that appear (by default, anyway) 
when you hover your mouse pointer over a toolbar or Ribbon button, or 
just about anywhere in a dialog box. Tooltips are really useful when you’re 
getting to know your way around a program, but when you have a sense of 
where things are, they can get in the way. By default, TOOLTIPS is set to 1, 
which means they display when you hover the pointer over something. Set 
TOOLTIPS to 0 if you don’t want to see them again. The TOOLTIPS setting is 
stored in the Windows registry.
VISRETAIN
If you work with xrefs (refer to Chapter 18), you know the potential for 
competing layer properties. Sometimes you want your xref to look different 
from your current drawing so you can tell which is which. You can change 
layer colors of xrefs in the Layer Property Manager, but whether you have 
to do that every time you open a drawing with an attached xref depends on 
the setting of the VISRETAIN system variable. When VISRETAIN is set to 0, 
the layer properties in the xref take precedence, which means you would 
have to make those changes every time you opened the host drawing. When 
VISRETAIN is set to 1 (the default value), changes to layer properties you 
make in the host drawing remain intact every time you open that host 
drawing; however, those changes have no effect on the external file itself. 
The VISRETAIN value is stored in the current drawing.
