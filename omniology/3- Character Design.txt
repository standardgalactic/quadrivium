If the characters in a game have depth, complexity, consistency, mystery, humanity,
and charm, then they are going to feel real to the player, and that helps the whole
game world feel real, and allows the player to suspend his or her disbelief and get
lost in the world. Everything the player does will be more exciting if they’re doing it
for someone, or with someone, or in opposition to someone who feels real. Simply
put, good character design helps the player to have what we all know can be an
amazing, unforgettable experience. This book is not just about making great charac-
ters, but also about making great games.
—from the foreword by Tim Schafer, Double Fine Productions
Katherine Isbister skillfully draws upon various psychological constructs elevating
game development to a more comprehensive level. Taking a Psych 100 class? This
book transforms the sometimes stuffy theories of Freud, Skinner, Rogers, and
Maslow into fresh and entertaining relevancy as the author weaves these ideas into
game content. The next time you play a favorite video game, read this book—that
game will take on a whole new light and who knows? You may be able to ace that
psychology final.
—Pauline Pedersen, Course Director, Full Sail Real World Education
The notion of using psychological principles in games continues to be of great inter-
est to the games industry, but few researchers have been able to discuss in depth how
psychological research can actually be applied to game design. Katherine Isbister’s
book not only makes complex psychological concepts accessible to the games commu-
nity, but also demonstrates its application in current games through the use of con-
crete examples (on retail products), and possible design tips and recommendations.
—Randy Pagulayan, PhD, User Research Lead, Microsoft Game Studios
Katherine Isbister has crafted a text that covers a far greater scope of psychological
concerns than I would’ve previously thought possible, and each area of psychology
she covers has the potential to bring games to a higher level. For any individual
studying, teaching, or working in Game Design this is a must-have text.
—Robin Koman, Associate Course Director, Full Sail Real World Education
A valuable tool for applying effective principles of psychology to create readable, enter-
taining, and high-impact game characters—a must-have for today’s game developer.
—Andrew Stern, co-creator of the interactive drama Façade and 
the virtual pets Dogz and Catz
Well researched and perceptive, this book offers new insights on creating more emo-
tionally engaging game characters. If you have ever been curious about the psychol-
ogy behind better character design, this book is a must read!

Better Game Characters by Design

The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Interactive 3D Technology
Series Editor:David H.Eberly,Geometric Tools,Inc.
The game industry is a powerful and driving force in the evolution of computer technology. As the
capabilities of personal computers, peripheral hardware, and game consoles have grown, so has the
demand for quality information about the algorithms, tools, and descriptions needed to take advan-
tage of this new technology. To satisfy this demand and establish a new level of professional refer-
ence for the game developer, we created the Morgan Kaufmann Series in Interactive 3D Technology.
Books in the series are written for developers by leading industry professionals and academic
researchers, and cover the state of the art in real-time 3D. The series emphasizes practical, working
solutions and solid software-engineering principles. The goal is for the developer to be able to imple-
ment real systems from the fundamental ideas, whether it be for games or for other applications.

Katherine Isbister is an associate of the Social and Behavioral Research Laboratory
and an associate professor in the Department of Language, Literature and Commu-
nication at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Her research focus is social psycho-
logical and affective approaches to HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), with special
attention to games and other leisure and social technologies. In autumn 2004, she
established the Games Research Lab at Rensselaer. Initial studies in the lab have
explored the social and physical aspects of party games. She has presented insights
from this research at the Game Developers Conference and at the DiGRA (Digital
Games Research Association) conference.
Before joining the RPI faculty, Katherine developed and taught a course in Stan-
ford University’s HCI series—Designing Characters for Computer Games—now part
of Rensselaer’s games curriculum. She has also created and exhibited games-related
artwork in venues including San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts,
Toronto’s Design Exchange, and San Jose’s Works Gallery. See www.simgallery.net
for an overview of this artwork which is a collaboration with sculptor Rainey
Straus.
Katherine is also part of the European Network of Excellence project HUMAINE,
devoted to evolving appropriate usability and evaluation strategies for assessing
affective interfaces. As part of this work, she has an ongoing research collaboration
with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1999, she was
selected as one of MIT Technology Review’s “100 Young Innovators” most likely to
shape the future of technology.

Not to sound too much like a grumpy old man, but when I was in college we didn’t
have courses in game design. Oh, I thought we did. There was a class in the course
catalog that was called “Game Theory.” I excitedly signed up for it, even while
wondering in the back of my mind why it was being taught by a statistics professor.
And then I found out. On the first day we looked at a little chart that calculated all
the possible outcomes for a game of “rock, paper, scissors.” And then at another
chart for a variation of that game, something like “blind rock, paper, scissors.” And
“Spanish rock, paper, scissors,” and “rock, paper, scissors if everybody has three
hands.” And so on. FOR AN ENTIRE SEMESTER.
I don’t want to bum anybody out who teaches game theory for a living, but for
crying out loud that stuff is boring. And after all was said and done, I’m still no bet-
ter at that stupid game.
Maybe that is why I am, to this very day, a little uncomfortable around academ-
ics when they are talking about video games. Or maybe it is just because of the
drastically different perspectives we have on the whole medium. I spend all day
wading through the neck-high muck of games and the ugly business of making
them, so it’s always strange to talk with people at universities and to hear them dis-
cuss games as abstract, distant concepts. It often sounds to me as if they are scien-
tists looking through a powerful telescope at a fascinating, amusing, mysterious,
and primitive life form they’ve just found on a distant planet—a planet that many
of us have been living on for years.
Don’t get me wrong—I love to see games talked about in a serious academic set-
ting. I’m just saying I don’t always feel like I fit in. It’s like I’m attending a zoology
lecture, hoping no one notices that I’m wearing a bloody butcher’s apron and carry-

(Wait—is that too many similes in a row? Once I get started it’s hard to stop. It’s
like eating potato chips. Or rolling a snowball down hill. Or . . .)
But then I was invited down to Stanford to visit Katherine Isbister and her class
full of students. Amazingly, these students were studying not just game design, but
character design for games. A topic near and dear to my heart! I had no idea this kind
of thing went on. How amazing! And what good news for the future, right? If kids in
college today are studying character design for games, then maybe the industry will
be flooded with fresh talent just dying to make better characters and better games!
(Not to say anything bad about games today—except that the characters in them are
really flat and boring and derivative clichés most of the time. But I digress.)

FOREWORD

FOREWORD
Anyway, the point is that I met Katherine and was surprised to find someone in
academia who really plays games! And really likes games! I think you can see that
in her book. Katherine’s examples are from games that she has obviously played,
and you have probably played as well. Her advice comes from first-hand knowledge
of what makes games fun.
Katherine discusses character design not just in terms of what is interesting to
dissect, but also in terms of what will actually enhance the game experience. After
all, we’re not just making up characters for the sake of showing off, right? Well,
maybe we’re doing that just a little bit. But mostly we’re trying to make a rich expe-
rience for the player. If the characters in a game have depth, complexity, consis-
tency, mystery, humanity, and charm, then they are going to feel real to the player,
and that helps the whole game world feel real, and allows the player to suspend his
or her disbelief and get lost in the world. Everything the player does will be more
exciting if they’re doing it for someone, or with someone, or in opposition to some-
one who feels real. Simply put, good character design helps the player to have what
we all know can be an amazing, unforgettable experience. This book is not just
about making great characters, but also about making great games.
So if you are reading this in college, pay attention! And be happy that you have
books like this and classes like the one you are in because we didn’t back when I
was in school! (Bangs cane on ground. Puffs angrily on long, gnarled pipe.) And if
you’re reading this because you’re in the games industry, well, be happy that you
get free sodas at work.

PREFACE
This book is an introduction to psychological principles that have direct applications
to improving game character design. Designers can use these principles to make
characters that are more socially and emotionally powerful for the player and that
are also more fun, engaging, and believable—all qualities that help enhance the
game-play experience.
Reading this book will help any design team learn what great character designers
do instinctively. Each chapter includes relevant examples from games with out-
standing, often award-winning character designs, highlighting how the principles
can be applied. Checklists and other tools make it simple to build psychological
considerations into the design process itself; those looking for a quick overview can
take a glance at Chapter 10, which arrays all the design suggestions in the book
along the typical development timeline.
The desire to write this book emerged from my own work during the last ten
years or so in the research field of embodied conversational agents. My projects in
graduate school, as a postdoctoral researcher in Japan, and in subsequent years in
both industry and academe convinced me that social psychology offers important
lessons for anyone trying to design engaging imitation humans. Most design books
written about creating characters seem to come out of the animation, filmmaking,
and fiction traditions. None of these media are interactive (except for the occasional
experimental form). As I learned when crafting characters for both task-based and
entertainment applications, engagement and believability emerge in large part
through the interaction. The surface impact of a character’s movement, appearance,
and words cannot really be separated from consideration of how these unfold in
relation to the user/player’s actions.
When designing, I found myself increasingly applying principles I’d learned dur-
ing graduate school from social psychology and other related fields. When I got
stuck, I’d burrow into the research literature to look for inspiration and for clues as
to why something was not working. This book is my effort to save you, the reader,
from this labor. It is a walk through those theories and working principles that I
found most helpful in creating characters.
The Value of Improving Characters with Psychology
There are plenty of things to worry about in the game-design process, and there are
already models and advice books from cinema and fiction writing that can be

drawn upon when creating a game’s characters. Why add another layer of complex-
ity? Will this really help?
Have you ever played a game in which the cut scenes seemed boring, tiresome,
annoying, or one in which you found yourself trying to ignore the player character
in order to get more immersed in game play? In these cases, the development team
wasted effort on crafting characters for you to enjoy that instead became nuisances.
I believe we can lay the blame for these frustrations at the door of those who use
film, fiction, or other passive, linear-media design principles as their primary guide-
lines. Using these principles can produce well-wrought dialogue, emotionally evoca-
tive cut scenes, or startlingly lifelike motion in a character, but it does not address
the core of the experience—the player’s active and unfolding engagement with the
game world and the characters within it. A character in a game should reveal itself
in relation to the player and his or her actions and motivations. The player’s charac-
ter is that person’s physical, social, and emotional suit within the game. A non-
player character (NPC) exists most vividly for the player in the moments in which
she or he interacts with the character. To craft truly integrated and engaging charac-
ters, we must begin with goals in mind for the player’s experience of the characters.
The great value of using a psychological approach is that we do not have to
invent the design principles for crafting character interactions (and managing first
impressions) from “scratch.” Generations of social scientists have closely observed
how people perceive and engage with one another, and these findings turn out to
be extremely valuable rules of thumb and inspirations for character designers.
Using the principles in this book can help take the guesswork out of character
design—making it far more likely that a game’s characters will be appealing both at
the surface level and also within the ongoing context of game play itself, where a
character is truly judged by players. Better character interactions make the game more
appealing, and that encourages the kind of word-of-mouth marketing that all game
publishers hope for. Making choices based on the player’s social experience of charac-
ters will also help eliminate wasted development time spent on assets that the player
is eager to skip. And it can broaden the audience of a game by including players who
care more about social interaction than the hard-core gamer might (see Part II for a
discussion of taking multiple audiences into account when designing characters).
How to Read This Book
Here are some suggestions to help guide busy readers in getting the most from this
book:
• For those new to game design. If this book is a textbook for a class you are tak-
ing, or if you are new to the field and reading to gain a general mastery, you will
want to read from beginning to end. The concepts build upon one another, and
this will give you the best framework for engaging with character design in a

PREFACE
thoughtful way. This is true regardless of which specialty you think you do have
or will acquire (programming, art, writing, etc.). The principles in this book are
part of an integrated approach. You may find the exercises at the end of each
chapter particularly helpful.
• For seasoned professionals. You may want to start with a look at Part V, which
provides an overview of where the ideas in this book can be incorporated into
the existing development process and also offers some rationales for why it is
worthwhile to include these steps in a tight development timeline. You may also
want to browse each section’s introduction to get a high-level view of the con-
cepts that will be discussed. This will help you to scan for things that are directly
relevant to the issues you are having at the moment.
You will probably find the material in this book most helpful during the prepro-
duction stages of a project, when the overall design vision of a game is still flexi-
ble. However, Part III will be quite useful during production for those creating
character assets, and the principles in the rest of the book will certainly still be
helpful in tweaking and refining character interactions during production itself.
• For those unfamiliar with games. Perhaps you picked this book up thinking the
ideas might be relevant to your design work in another area besides gaming. You
will probably particularly benefit from reading the game descriptions in the
Appendix, and from watching the video clips on the accompanying DVD, to help
you gain context for the range of game genres and character-design options there
are in the games space.
A Note about Psychology and Its Many Subfields
It is worth clarifying that this book draws primarily from social psychology, which
is the empirical study of how people interact socially with one another, with an
emphasis on the individual as the unit of study (as opposed to looking at groups).
Social psychologists look at the ways we form impressions of one another, biases
that affect how we perceive others, and the mechanisms of social interaction in gen-
eral, among other related topics. This is only one of the subfields of psychology.
Others may also be helpful to the design of games, and perhaps even to the design
of characters, but are beyond the scope of this book. Here is a breakdown of some
of the most relevant strands of thought in and near the social sciences that are not
covered in this book:
• Neuropsychology. Work at the nexus between neuroscience and psychology. As sci-
entists learn more about the chemistry and biological structuring of the brain itself,
they are working to link these findings to observable differences in behavior and in
thinking. Research in this area includes investigating the physiological workings of
emotions, blood flow in the brain and what it can indicate about brain function,
neurotransmitters and other brain chemistry and how altering them can change
xxi

PREFACE
functioning, and related concerns. It’s possible that game researchers may begin to
use some of this knowledge to influence how they evaluate gaming experiences
(see Chapter 11, Evaluation, for a mention of brain imaging and emotion).
• Cognitive psychology/science. Work in which the focus is understanding thought
processes, often incorporating the use of computer modeling to better under-
stand how thought unfolds. Cognitive scientists try to understand perception,
attention, and action, and their findings have a great deal of relevance to general
game design issues—understanding how a player thinks and using this knowl-
edge to anticipate and test ideas for game physics, graphics behavior, game-play
mechanisms, enemy AI construction, and related design choices.
• Behaviorism. An older (and somewhat discredited) approach to understanding
human psychology from a purely behavioral standpoint. Psychologists in this line of
research were reacting to the highly theoretic and often untestable approaches of
the psychoanalytic tradition (i.e., Freud and his colleagues). The most extreme
behaviorists thought that human behavior could be infinitely modified and adapted
through manipulation—the stereotypical rat in a maze experiments are a part of this
tradition. There is some value in understanding this work for game designers
because behaviorists spent a great deal of time investigating reward structures—
exactly what sorts of reward schedules would produce the best response. This turns
out to be applicable to the design of game levels and powerups and so forth. (Power
up: Item which the player can acquire that provides additional strengths or abili-
ties.) http://www.gamaSutra.com/features/20010427/ hopson-01.htm
• Sociology and anthropology. Social sciences that examine social interaction with
a focus on aggregate groups and systems. These areas of research may be espe-
cially helpful in thinking about social interaction and community formation
among large groups, such as those found in massively multiplayer online role-
playing games (MMORPGs).
• Media studies/humanist approaches. There is substantial scholarship offering a
critical perspective on the cultural function of media such as games, which seeks
to elucidate individuals’ relationships to media, technologies, and to each other
in a broader sense. Learning more about these areas may help define the socio-
cultural impact of games. Relevant work includes discussion of gender and race
stereotypes and games, violence and notions of play that are supported or
frowned upon by society at large, and the like.

PARTOne
First Impressions
What Is Covered and Why
Part I starts where players first experience characters—with first impressions.
Bad first impressions can be difficult to overcome, so the conscious management
of any first encounter is important. Social psychologists have devoted much study
to impression formation and how it works among human beings. Chapters 1 and 2
provide the reader with a foundation for making choices about the appearance and
early behavior of characters. Using these principles will enhance later game-play
experience of these characters and the level of overall social and emotional engage-
ment with the game itself.
Who Will Find Part I Most Useful
Part I will be of greatest value to game designers, artists, and animators. Program-
mers, audio specialists, and dialogue writers may also find it interesting, though
there are few design tips specifically related to their work.
Overview of Key Concepts
Attractiveness
Chapter 1 addresses what makes someone “attractive” from a psychological
point of view and how this can influence player impressions of characters in
surprising ways.

Chapter 1 also includes a discussion of the babyface effect—the tendency to react
to adults with babyish features as if they were childlike. The chapter examines
babyface cues in detail and how they impact choices about character design.
Stereotypes
Chapter 1 concludes with a discussion of stereotypes—how they function psycho-
logically and the benefits and limitations they impose. It covers ways character
designers use stereotypes to make characters more immediately accessible, memo-
rable, and surprising. Chapter 1 concludes with an interview of Gonzalo Frasca, a
game designer who made interesting use of stereotypes in his online simulation
titled September 12.
Practical Questions:Friendliness,Dominance,and Personality
Chapter 2 moves one step deeper into impression formation, addressing practical
questions that arise when meeting someone new: Is “the other” a friend or a foe?
Just where are they in the pecking order in relation to myself? And what sort of
person are they to try to work alongside? The chapter discusses cues of friendliness,
dominance, and personality in detail and offers tactics for making the best use of
these important social signals.

Take-Aways from Part I
After finishing these chapters the reader should have a good feel for the psychology
of first impressions and will be better able to take apart just why characters in com-
petitors’ games either do or don’t seize player attention artfully. The reader will
leave with tools for making good use of these psychological principles in character
design. A warning: Reading this section may have the side effect of making the
reader curiously aware of what is happening when next meeting someone new—a
form of double consciousness that plagues social psychologists as well.

CHAPTER
One
Social Surface
1.1
What Is Covered and Why
This book begins where players will begin with characters: the moment in a social
encounter before the first word is spoken—the first glance—surface impressions.
Human beings automatically and instinctively apply interpretive strategies from the
moment they lay eyes upon one another. Players do the same with game characters.
Knowing how and why the social surface works can help designers make wise
choices about the physical appearance and early game behavior of characters.
This chapter describes some powerful social biases that can have an impact on a
player’s first impressions of characters. Surface effects discussed in this chapter
include attractiveness, the babyface effect, and stereotypes, with illustrations of
their use in games from various genres: Jak and Daxter, The Legend of Zelda: The
Windwaker, Twisted Metal: Black, and Leisure Suit Larry 7. The chapter ends with
design tips for making use of social surface effects and an interview with Gonzalo
Frasca, a game developer and researcher who explores stereotypes in September 12,
a flash-based simulation “toy.”

The Psychological Principles
1.2.1
Reacting to Social Surface
Appearance profoundly affects how a person will be perceived and treated by
others. This sometimes uncomfortable truth is the subject of countless fictional
works (Cyrano de Bergerac, The Elephant Man, and others). People cannot seem
to help reacting to the surface of another person, in predictable and suprisingly
enduring ways, even in the face of contradictory information emerging from ongoing
interaction. The saying “beauty is only skin deep” would not exist if we did not
think it necessary to struggle past this bias.
Take a moment to look at Figures 1.1–1.3, considering the questions below each
to directly experience the effects discussed in the chapter before reading further.

1.2.2
Attractiveness
A glance at any Hollywood movie poster seems to underscore the power of
attractiveness—even when the subject matter is a gritty, everyday life situation,
the cast members are extremely attractive. Studies have shown that many qualities
are attributed to people with attractive features—sometimes referred to as the halo
effect. These qualities include being seen as warmer, kinder, stronger, more sensi-
tive, more outgoing, more socially persuasive and dominant, and even smarter than
others. It’s even the case that attractive people get more lenient sentences in court,
and they may get preference in hiring decisions.
These effects occur not just for supermodels or movie stars but for regular people
with “attractive” features. Most people would prefer to work with the man on the
left in Figure 1.4. Why? Because he has the more attractive features of the two.
His healthy, symmetrical face and body and straight profile are features that have
been shown to produce higher attractiveness ratings. His strong chin is a mature
facial feature often associated with attractiveness in men. His counterpart on the
right, with asymmetry in body and features, a snaggle-toothed smile, unhealthy skin,
Which of these men is most likely to be a successful executive? Which would you want running
a company that you worked for?
FIGURE
1.3

CHAPTER ONE • SOCIAL SURFACE
weak chin, and convex profile is loaded with cues that have led to lower ratings
of attractiveness.
Why do human beings have such a powerful bias toward those who are
attractive? Some researchers feel it may be a part of the evolutionary process—that
attractiveness is an indicator of healthiness. A person with asymmetry, obvious
signs of disease, or a profile that indicates they may have trouble keeping their teeth
in the long run would be a less attractive companion. Other researchers point out
that gazing at attractive features puts people in a positive frame of mind from which
they are more likely to evaluate anything about the person, or even what’s happen-
ing in general, more positively.
Whatever the reason, it is the case across cultures that myriad traits considered
positive tend to be associated with more attractive people. Of course, what is
considered attractive, beyond the basic traits listed above, can vary widely across
cultures as shown in Figure 1.5. From eyebrow piercings to lip plates, human
beings have evolved culturally and historically specific modifications of what
“ideal” beauty is, and these traits also come into play when making an attractive-
ness judgment.

Notions of beauty can vary widely between cultures.
Jak and Kira (Figure 1.6), from Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, are
good examples of attractive characters—healthy, and with symmetrical features and
straight profiles. Jak’s strong chin and relative height are additional markers of
masculine attractiveness. It is important in this game that the player identifies with
Jak, as he is the player character, and that the player finds Kira attractive, as she is
Jak’s love interest. Making them both conventionally attractive improves the odds
of this happening for the player. Most videogame heroes and heroines are attractive,
and this encourages the player to see them as smarter, stronger, kinder, and more
socially skilled—all benefits of the halo effect.

CHAPTER ONE • SOCIAL SURFACE
Contrast Jak and Kira with Sweet Tooth the Clown from Twisted Metal: Black
(Figure 1.7). His unhealthy complexion, puffy eyes, enlarged teeth, and sparse (and
flaming) hair are quite unattractive. Sweet Tooth is the worst of the cast of evil
murderers in this game, all of whom are meant to be delightfully awful for the
player. Here, cues of unattractiveness are used to create repugnance in the player,
which is instrumental in creating the proper mood in the game. Sweet Tooth’s
appearance also helps underscore his dissociation from everyday society—he is
visually frightening and unappealing, making it plausible that he would become an
outcast and an evil figure.
1.2.3
Babyfaces
Most people assume that the woman on the left in Figure 1.8 would be a better nurse
than a doctor. They see her as likely to be warmer, and perhaps less accountable
for her actions. Why? She has classic babyface features. Her large eyes and pupils,
small chin, high eyebrows and forehead, small nose, and full lips and cheeks, all
resemble the features of an infant. The woman on the right has smaller eyes, a
stronger chin, lower thicker eyebrows and lower forehead, larger nose with promi-
ment bridge, and thinner lips—all qualities of a more biologically mature face.
The human bias is to assume that those who have babyfaces will be warmer and
more trustworthy but also may be more dependent, less responsible, and more
submissive and manipulable. Psychologists call this an overgeneralization: attribut-
ing traits of a child to adults with childlike features. The babyface bias has been
shown to affect judgments of people from infancy to old age. The babyface effect
transcends cultural and even species lines—people find baby animals just as cute
and nurturable as baby humans.

1.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Why is this so? As with attractiveness, some researchers posit that there are
powerful evolutionary forces in play—it is very important to nurture infants, so
humans have adapted to have powerful and immediate responses to baby features
that encourage them to care for babies and to inhibit any aggression toward them. It
has been demonstrated in other species that a baby with mature features does not
get cared for as well as other babies and may be rejected. Research on premature
infants—ones who are born with smaller eyes and less chubby cheeks—has also
shown that nurturing impulses and liking are lower when looking at a preemie’s
face than at a full-term infant’s face.
In any case, there is documentation across cultures showing that those with
babyface features evoke more nurturing and trust, and are more readily absolved
of responsibility. This extends even to granting babyfaced people more lenient
sentences in criminal convictions.
Many game characters have exaggerated babyfaces. Here are two examples
in Figure 1.9: Daxter, from Jak and Daxter; and Link, from The Legend of Zelda:
The Windwaker. Both have the large eyes, small chins, round cheeks, high eye-
brows, and large head size typical of a baby. Early videogame designers used these
proportions so that players could still make out a face onscreen, despite limited res-
olution. But these designs have persisted into the era of high polygon count 3D

environments. This may be because such characters take advantage of the babyface
effect, evoking additional player sympathy and warmth and reducing expectations.
1.2.4
Stereotypes
Most people say that the man at the bottom right in Figure 1.10 is most likely to be
a successful executive. They may also guess that the man at the bottom left could
be an executive but is perhaps not as successful. The top two men are far less likely
to be first choices for a successful executive.
Why? The man at the bottom right displays stereotypical cues that read “execu-
tive”—his clothes and grooming are expensive and meant to impress and intimidate.
His height is something associated (for males) with responsibility and social
dominance—qualities a high-powered leader has to project. The man at the bottom
left also wears the proper uniform, but his height may indicate that he will have a
tough time being taken seriously. The two middle figures, with their frumpy casual
dress, are far less likely to fit into a corporate environment.
To the extent that you made any judgment about these images, you made
it based on stereotypes—schemas or prototypes in your memory that associate a
pattern of cues with a typical set of qualities in a person. These cues can include
dress, build, posture, grooming, age, gender, race, style of speaking and moving, as
well as the company in which a person is seen.
Stereotypes are a sensitive subject, and for good reason—they are powerful social
tools that guide unconscious decisions that can perpetuate an inequitable situation.
Once a stereotype has been “primed” in a person’s mind, he or she tends to look for
and mostly see the qualities in a person that support that stereotype, overlooking
qualities that do not fit. This happens below the level of awareness. It has been
observed in research settings, for example, that some people who state they are not

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
at all racist (and do not think of themselves as racist at a conscious level) can have
racially biased, stereotype-driven, unconscious reactions nonetheless.
Despite their drawbacks, stereotypes do serve an important purpose—they help
people make quick assessments so that they do not have to evaluate each person
completely “from scratch.” The unconscious process of comparing what is seen
with prototypes already in the mind and then using matches to make assumptions
about that person, saves time and effort. This is important, given the short window
of time normally available when meeting someone new. Stereotypes also help make
everyday social encounters more comfortably predictable. If we and others adopt a
given stereotypic code in our dress and behavior, we can be pretty confident that
we will be “read” the way we have planned.
Game character designers rely heavily on stereotypes, a fact that has generated
critique (see the Fair Play Report mentioned in Section 1.7, Further Reading, at the
end of this chapter). Yet in a fast-paced game environment it can be helpful for a
player to draw upon stereotypes to gauge a character’s intentions and likely actions.
For example, the endless hoards of enemies in many games work because they capi-
talize on the human tendency to assign common traits to those who display similar
cues (as in Figure 1.11).

CHAPTER ONE • SOCIAL SURFACE
Some games take advantage of stereotypes, while remaining fresh for players, by
importing unlikely types into the gaming environment. The Leisure Suit Larry series
is a good example. Larry, an unexpected choice for a heroic player-character,
derives comic value and appeal through leveraging a cultural stereotype: the aging
bachelor (Figure 1.12).
Good designers also build memorable characters by taking well-worn stereotypes
and crafting characters that have a few traits that go against type. Consider these
two examples of pirate characters that break stereotype shown in Figure 1.13.

16
1.3
Design Pointers
Here are a few simple rules of thumb for leveraging social surface effects in
character design.
1.3.1
Make (Almost) Everyone Attractive
In most games, every character, even the villain, has attractive features.
A game like Twisted Metal: Black, which seeks to evoke an uneasy and dis-
turbing atmosphere, is the rare exception. Given the notion that looking at
attractive faces makes people feel more positive in general, this bias makes
sense. A designer wants players to get a positive feeling from playing the
game. Even villains can add to this effect through their attractive features. Use
unattractive features sparingly, and be aware of their effects on the player’s
social impressions of characters.
1.3.2
Use Babyfaces to Inspire Care and Warmth,Not Respect
Babyfaced characters will be seen as socially warm and appealing and will
evoke a caring response, but they are not perceived as socially dominant. So
use these features with care. A babyfaced player-character is probably not an
appropriate choice, for example, for getting the player to feel extremely domi-
nant and competent.
1.3.3
Trigger Stereotypes for Speed and Break Them for Depth
Stereotypes are a great way to leverage things a player already knows, thereby
suggesting how to react to a character. If creating hoards of enemies, or minor
roles for NPCs (non-player characters), consider leveraging real-life or media
stereotypes that are familiar to the player. One important caveat to keep in
mind: make sure to consider whether a stereotype will inadvertently alienate
someone in your audience. (Audience factors will be discussed further in
Part II.)
When using stereotypes, particularly for major characters such as the player’s
character, consider breaking the stereotype with a few odd traits, or choosing
one that has not often been used in games. Both of these tactics are likely to
create richer, more memorable experiences for players.

of computer game research. In 2003, he and a team from newsgaming.com pub-
lished a Flash-based “toy world” that inspired great discussion and debate in the
games research community. Titled September 12, the simulation offers the player a
chance to “explore some aspects of the war on terror,” through choosing to shoot

(or not shoot) terrorists depicted wandering among civilians in a village. Here is
what he had to say about the use of stereotypes in September 12.
Q: Many games make use of stereotypical qualities (uniforms; physical character-
istics such as size, gender, muscles, skin color) to show the player who is a “good
guy” and a “bad guy.”September 12 seems to use some of these qualities (terrorists
carrying guns, the sounds of women wailing) in different ways. . . . Could you talk
about your intentions here?
Since this game is intended to provide a broad panorama, with over a 100 characters
onscreen, we wanted to make it easy for players to grasp the differences between
civilians and terrorists. Therefore, we made all the civilians in tones of blue (which
contrasts well with the yellow sandy background). Since the terrorists are radical,
we played with the colors black and white, in order to show how they view the world.
We also included dogs (very few). At first, it was just for fun, but later we had to decide
if people would turn into terrorists because somebody killed their dogs. Of course,
we thought it was too far-fetched, and they are the only nonterrorist characters that
you can kill and nobody will mourn. But the fact that there are so few dogs in the
game catches the attention of the player and gives the game a little bit extra. I recall a
player saying “Take that,Osama Bin Lassie!”Some could say that this is a bit risky because
it takes the focus away from my “message.” Well, I disagree. The so-called “message”
is there, and I think almost everybody was able to understand my intentions, even if
several times the interpretations were somehow unexpected. Once the players under-
stood what the game was aiming at, many kept playing with it just as a little fun
shoot-them-up. I think that that is natural, too, and does not go against the goal of
editorial videogames.
Of course,most of the criticism was because many players thought that the game was
taking sides. It certainly was, but not the side of terrorists.The problem with this game is
that it does not show terrorists performing terrorist acts. On the other hand, I think that
both in the media and in the videogames we do have plenty of depictions of terrorists
as being the bad guys. My focus was on the civilian victims, not on the terrorists. These
people keep getting killed as “collateral damage” and that only fuels the birth of more
terrorism (the working title of this game was “The Birth of Terror,” maybe an allusion to
Griffith’s movie.Later I stumbled onto “September 12,”and I thought it did the job pretty
well in order to connect all the attacks as a succession of events (I kill you, then you kill
me,then I kill you back,and so on).
Q: Who do you want the player to empathize with in this game? How did you control
this with choices you made about the characters (if at all)?
Maybe I could say that there are some Brechtian elements in the game. I wanted players
to be able to take a critical distance from the game. This is why we didn’t want to have
graphics that were too “videogamy”and that influenced us as well in the choice of colors.
I think that one of the most important devices is the target. At first, it looks like a sniper
target, supposedly for a “surgical” kind of attack. And that is what a lot of players

1.4
INTERVIEW: GONZALO FRASCA
expected,based on their comments.But instead of shooting a single bullet,it sends out a
missile that makes a big mess, killing not only the target but a lot of the surrounding
people.In addition to that,I included a timer to prevent people from shooting constantly.
This pisses off a traditional player, but during those few seconds, I hope that he is able
to think about what is going on in this game. And based on all the feedback that I got,
it worked as expected.
This is my favorite comment about the game, posted by somebody at
GameGirlAdvance.com:
Interesting. . . . I found myself first thinking “Wow,this is a lot of work to go to in order to
say one ‘little’ thing.” Which led me to believe that that’s not what the authors were
trying to do.Which led me to think about the fact that I don’t necessarily care what the
authors were trying to do; it’s how I incorporate it into my own context that is what
matters more to me. Which led me to realize that even a simple simulation gives me
room to actively participate in creating meaning in a different way than static textual or
visual presentations like editorials and cartoons. Which led me to think more deeply
about these issues [. . .]
That path of thought was exactly what I was looking for.
Q: It is interesting that ordinary citizens can morph into terrorists after a bombing
within the game.What were you hoping to show with this transition?
We explored different visual techniques in order to show the transition. Yesterday
night, I was watching the news on TV about a Palestinian who blew himself up in
a bus, killing 11 people, including children. Later they showed a letter that the
young man left behind, saying that he decided to do that in order to avenge the
death of nine Palestinians killed earlier that week. What I wanted to show is simply
this circle of terror that seems to not have an ending. We tried a traditional morph
between the two characters, but we felt it was not clear enough.The technique that we
ended up using flashes back and forth between the two characters, and I think works
pretty well. We certainly wanted to avoid written text. It had to be done with visuals
and audio.
Q: Have you gotten responses to the game from anyone in the Muslim community?
If so, did they comment at all upon the figures in the game—the depictions of
the people?
Hard to tell. The only Arab responses were from Arabs living in the Western world
(notably the States).They were just about a dozen, so I am not sure if they can count as
relevant, but all of them loved the game. I recall one of them saying:“It’s just like that.”
I did not get any comments/criticisms about the depictions of the people, so I assume
they were not bothered by the stereotypes in clothing, etc. (That is one of the design
advantages of a cartoony look. If I had aimed at a more realistic kind of illustration, I am
sure the situation would have been different.)
19

CHAPTER ONE • SOCIAL SURFACE
Q: With the distant point of view (as in many games), the player may feel a bit
detached from the individuals she or he is acting upon. Did you think about this as
you created the game? How (if at all) did you try to counteract or to play with this
tendency?
From the beginning, I wanted to provide the “big picture” of the situation.That explains
the perspective. In addition to this, it makes a statement about how these people are
usually attacked (by a detached target, from very far away, in order to avoid messy face-
to-face involvements). What I wanted to convey with this game is a behavior (violence
produces more violence), and I think that it can become clear if you see it happening
not only once but several times within a small world such as my fictional Middle
Eastern village.
I believe that one of the most overhyped ideas in game design is immersion.
Immersion is good if you want to be outside of the real world, but in order to explore
reality you need to break it. However, political games cannot do without immersion
(in order to break immersion, first you need people to get immersed). So most of
the techniques that I used tried to play back and forth between this getting “inside”
and“outside”of the game.
Q: Any other thoughts about your design work and stereotypes—particularly in
terms of character-design choices?
My goal was to state that you can’t combat violence with more violence and that’s
it. I didn’t want to say that either side is good or bad or to reflect any specific view
about Arabs, Muslims, Israelis, Jews, Americans, U.S. foreign policy, etc. (even though,
since the game is open ended, each player will fill in the blanks by herself). That is
quite funny, because when I started thinking about the game, in late 2002, what I had
in mind was basically the War on Terror in Afghanistan. But a lot of people saw in it a
depiction of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the current war on Iraq.Another interesting
thing is that the game’s launch (late September) happened at the same time that
the Iraq war was resulting in more and more American casualties and the U.S. public
started wondering if so many body bags were worth it. A lot of people read the game in
this way,too.
With videogames, and particularly with open-ended simulations, the author
simply sets the limits and certain parameters. It is a genre where you have to trust
your players and, more importantly, be aware that games, unlike stories, do not
have to hit their target always. A joke or a story, you either get it or you don’t. But
games are about repetition, so you may experience a lame match of a great game,
only to later have great experiences with it. My advice to designers: trust your players
and don’t worry too much if they read the game differently from what you intended;
the fact that they can read it personally means that they can construct with it
something that is important to them, and that is the most clear sign that your game
has succeeded.

Exercises
1.6.1
Babyface Assessment
Photograph five or more familiar faces, and then array these images along
a continuum: clear babyface features to clear mature features. Compare
these images with the people as you know them in social interaction—
can you see differences in people’s demeanor and strategies for getting
along with others that might correlate with the babyface phenomenon?
People whose faces are at either extreme may want to discuss the impact
that this has had (if any) on their own social style and encounters.
1.6.2
Unattractiveness Search
Each person should consider the videogames he or she has played and
try to find examples of characters that could be considered unattractive
by the standards discussed in this chapter. Bring a screenshot of the
character to group discussion, and be ready to talk about what role
this character plays in the game. Is the character’s unattractiveness
appropriate and effective in the game? How so?
1.5
Summary and What Is Next
Chapter 1 began this book’s overview of social psychological theory with a look at
three social surface effects: attractiveness, the babyface effect, and stereotypes. The
chapter ended with a few rules of thumb for making use of these surface effects in
game character design. The next chapter continues the study of first impressions
with a look at some key questions that human beings want answers to when they
begin interacting with another person.

Practical Questions—
Dominance,
Friendliness, and
Personality
2.1
What Is Covered and Why
This chapter begins the discussion of how interaction-based social qualities can be
helpful in guiding character design. Forming an impression of another person is a
practical process. There are some questions a person wants to answer about
another quickly, to help decide how to engage socially. These questions are not
asked consciously or literally; rather, the answers are sought intuitively and surrep-
titiously. Yet if asked, a person could answer these questions about another person
shortly after meeting them, in most cases with surprisingly high accuracy.
On a general level, each social encounter with an unknown person begins with
some rapid assessment of possibilities. Among the questions in mind are two primal
ones: Is the other person a friend or foe? How powerful is she or he in relation to
me? This chapter examines why this is so, how people make assessments of these
qualities in others, and how this should impact game character design.
On an individual level, each person has characteristic patterns of reaction to oth-
ers and the world. From the first encounter, others look for these patterns and
develop an impression of how this person will react to them and to the world—
“personality.” Social psychologists have identified some core personality traits that
describe the major differences among people, and this chapter will present these
and discuss their implications for character design.
Players ask these social questions when they encounter a game character for the
first time. The player wants to know what to expect: How will this guy react in a
crisis? Is he on my side as I go through this world? Does he have powers I can use?

24
Is he flaky or dependable? This chapter helps to bring to the surface why character-
design tactics that take these questions into account work so well. The tactics
described make it possible for any designer to create strong character interactions
on a more consistent basis. Examples from Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy
and Grim Fandango help to illustrate the points made. The chapter ends with spe-
cific design pointers for using dominance, agreeableness, and personality traits.
2.2
The Psychological Principles
2.2.1
Agreeableness and Dominance
To understand how social impressions form, it is helpful to step back for a moment
to consider the underlying motivations for social interaction. Why do people inter-
act with one another? From a functional point of view, human beings interact so
that each person’s basic physiological and safety needs are met. Children rely on
parents to provide food, shelter, and protection; adults work together to meet these
basic needs.
Even when there is plenty to eat and a safe environment, people interact looking
for love, a sense of belonging, and self-esteem. Each person develops an identity
through engagement with others and through contributions to the larger social
group. Being social serves many needs.
Figure 2.1 shows a hierarchy of needs proposed by Abraham Maslow. He
believed that people worked their way up this pyramid, tending to focus on
“higher” needs only once the lower ones had been addressed. Notice that safety

comes before love and belonging. Using this framework, it makes sense that “Is this
person friendly toward me?” is one of the first social questions asked. Making a
solid assessment of friendliness has an impact on a person’s well being and maybe
even his or her survival.
Closely intertwined with this first question is a second one: “How socially power-
ful is this person in relation to me?” Social power determines how large a threat
someone may be, or if they are helpful, in what ways they may help. For example,
someone might be very hostile toward you but not very powerful and hence not
much of a threat.
Human beings share an interest in the answers to these two questions with other
primates. There is strong evidence from animal studies that quick assessment of
potential threat, and fine attunement to hierarchy are traits that ensure survival
within primate social structures (see [Mazur December 1985] for more details on
primate studies). Psychologists have studied these two social questions in human
behavior, creating names for them: agreeableness and dominance. These qualities
emerged as primary social variables within two different areas of psychology: the
study of interpersonal behavior and the study of personality.
Social psychologists studying interpersonal interaction realized through observa-
tion and experimentation that descriptions of how people interact could be arrayed
in an interpersonal circumplex. The two axes of this circle are dominance and agree-
ableness. Figure 2.2 shows where various social stances fall along these two dimen-
sions. It turns out that these two variables are a powerful organizing principle with
which to understand social encounters.
In a parallel effort, personality psychologists gave out questionnaires (for self-
rating and for rating others) made up of traits that describe people’s personalities,
then looked for patterns and clusters in rankings, using statistical analysis. Two of
the stable personality factors from multiple studies in this area are extroversion and
agreeableness. Figure 2.2 shows that extroversion is a combination of dominance
and agreeableness. So the two research areas ended up converging upon similar pic-
tures of the social qualities of human beings. (For a longer discussion of the inter-
section of these two sets of research concepts, see [McCrae and Costa 1987]. For a
broader discussion of the application of these variables to creating media, see
[Reeves and Nass 1996].)
Thus, the two practical social questions—Is this person friendly? How powerful
are they?—can be reframed using two concepts from psychology literature:
• Agreeableness. Cues that a person is socially receptive and friendly.
• Dominance. Cues that a person believes they are, can, or should be higher in the
social status hierarchy.
This is not to say that there are not many other qualities human beings investi-
gate about one another as they interact, but these are among the first, for survival
reasons. People are remarkably quick about reading these qualities in others, and

CHAPTER TWO • PRACTICAL QUESTIONS—DOMINANCE, FRIENDLINESS, AND PERSONALITY
from very subtle signals. For example, a person can be shown a brief clip (one or
two minutes) of a stranger on videotape, without sound, and then can say reliably
if the stranger is generally socially dominant or not (DePaulo and Friedman 1989).
Interestingly, people are often not fully aware that they send and receive such sig-
nals. Sometimes, a researcher will ask participants in a study if they noticed cues of
dominance and friendliness, and they will say “no,” yet their answers on a ques-
tionnaire as well as their behavior will indicate that they did in fact notice and
interpret the cues accurately (Isbister and Nass 2000; DePaulo and Friedman 1989).
Human beings seem to notice these qualities below the level of everyday awareness.
As an example, consider Figure 2.3. What would it be like to talk to the person
on the left? How about the person on the right? You are picking up subtle indicators
of agreeableness and dominance as you make these decisions. The next two subsec-
tions will go into more detail about specific signals of each of these qualities.

2.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Agreeableness
How does a person telegraph friendliness and willingness to engage? They do so
with face, body, and voice, as well as the overall pattern of behavior toward the
other person. All of these signals work together to create a general impression
in the person who is being approached. Part III goes into more detail about each
element of the social equipment that a person uses to communicate. This chapter
uses agreeableness and dominance as an introduction to how all these cues work
together. Please be aware that these cues can be modulated by cultural differ-
ences—for example, interpretation of friendliness cues depends upon culture.
A very friendly Japanese person may seem much more subdued than a very
friendly Brazilian person to an American because of local differences in norms for
the range of gestures and facial expressions used to indicate friendliness. Cultural
differences and how they affect character design will be discussed further in Part II.
Cues of agreeableness (drawn from U.S.-based research) include (see also
Table 2.1):
• Face. A friendly person will probably have a smile on their face or at least the
hint of a smile in their eyes. They will make eye contact, but they will not be
giving an intense stare.

Which of these people would you prefer to interact with? You are probably reading cues of
dominance and agreeableness in order to make your answer.

CHAPTER TWO • PRACTICAL QUESTIONS—DOMINANCE, FRIENDLINESS, AND PERSONALITY
• Body. A receptive person will have a relaxed, open posture. If already sitting or
standing near another, they are likely to be closer than someone who is indiffer-
ent. They may also lean forward during conversation.
• Voice. A friendly person will use a warmer and more energetic tone of voice than
someone who is indifferent.
• Overall engagement patterns. A friendly person will acknowledge the other, and
will use all of their social equipment to signal that it is okay to interact.
A friendly person will be open to whatever social moves are made, and will not
be negative or judgmental. A friendly person will try to get in sync with the other
person, unconsciously adjusting movement speed, postures, and gestures to
mesh well with those of the other person.
It helps to highlight cues of friendliness to see cues of the alternatives: hostility
or outright indifference.
In Figure 2.4, the friendly person on the left has a relaxed posture and small
smile; the hostile person at center approaches and engages with energy, but instead
of warmth, openness, and calm, displays tension and hostility through face, gaze,
and body. The indifferent person on the right shows with their face, body, and voice
that they are not at all engaged and want no contact.
The character design in Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is an example
of the clear use of agreeableness cues. By the time the player has watched the first

cut-scene*, she has a clear idea of who among the nonplayer characters are friends
or foes.
For example, Kira is quite obviously friendly to Jak (the player’s character). Kira
is the daughter of Jak’s mentor, the Green Sage. She is introduced in the game’s
opening cut-scene as someone who can help Jak accomplish his goals by providing
tools and know-how. In Figure 2.5, and in Clip 2.1 from the DVD that accompanies
this book, you can easily spot the cues of friendliness. Kira is smiling, leaning
toward, and gazing at Jak, with a relaxed, open body posture. In the clip, her tone
of voice is warm and energetic. All these cues send a clear message to the player
that this character is on the player’s side.
29
*Cut-scene: Cut-scenes or cinematics are prerendered animated sequences used in games to help
frame the story and motivation for the player of the game. During most cut-scenes, no actions by
the player are possible. Often cut-scenes can be skipped by players who are not as interested in
the story of the game or who have seen them already in another play session.
Kira’s gaze and open and leaning body posture indicate that she is very friendly toward Jak.

In contrast, enemy characters introduced in the opening cut-scene quickly and
clearly demonstrate their unfriendliness. The menacing stares, frowns, and tensed
body postures of the creatures in Figure 2.6 all indicate hostility. In Clip 2.2, an
enemy creature approaches and attacks Jak. Its frown, stare, and quick and aggres-
sive approach spell out threat. This combination of stare and body language is often
used to signal hostility in games. In Clip 2.3, the creatures that were menacing in
the opening cut-scene are now performing the same kinds of attacks on the player-
character. Everything about their faces, body language, and even their grunts
says “hostile.”
Another game that makes artful use of friendliness cues is Grim Fandango.
In this game, the player must sometimes win the loyalty of a nonplayer-character
(or vice versa). Seeing a noticeable shift in friendliness cues after earning trust is
a source of fun and gratification for the player. For example, in Clips 2.4 and 2.5,
the player-character, Manny, negotiates with the revolutionary Salvador Limones
(Figure 2.7).
Notice the difference in Salvador’s behavior before and after Manny says the
“right” thing to indicate his loyalties (again, in Clips 2.4 and 2.5). Initially, Salvador
shows his skepticism through his closed and incredulous tone of voice. After Manny
signs up for the revolution, Salvador’s smile, tone of voice, and welcoming body
language send a friendly message to the player.
Dominance
How does a person determine whether another person is (or at least thinks they are
or should be) higher in the social hierarchy? There are two general categories of

2.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
cues of dominance. One type is more permanent—the enduring marks of status
(Mazur 1985). These include things such as age, gender, race, family lineage,
profession, health, wealth, physical size and strength, and education. So, for exam-
ple, within mainstream U.S. culture, you might assume someone like George
W. Bush—older, Caucasian, male, wealthy, and from a prominent family—has a
high degree of social dominance. As with friendliness cues, these enduring status
markers vary from culture to culture as well as within subcultures and over time.
There are also more controllable cues of dominance—those in a person’s
face, body, voice, and overall engagement patterns (DePaulo and Friedman 1989;
Mazur 1985) (see also Table 2.2):
• Face. A dominant person makes more eye contact and is comfortable staring.
However, they may look at the speaker less when listening than a less dominant
person would.
• Body. A dominant person takes up more physical space—for example, sitting
with limbs spread out. They may also require more physical space around them.
They may sit or stand at a physically higher level than others. In general, domi-
nant people move their heads less and tend to have calmer body movements
than less dominant people, though their gestures can be more emphatic.
• Voice. A dominant person speaks more loudly and tends to control the conversa-
tion more often than others—taking more turns, setting the tone, and choosing
the topics of conversation.

Cues of dominance and submissiveness in face and body.
It helps, when highlighting cues of dominance, to see cues of the alternative:
submissiveness. Figure 2.8 illustrates these differences.

characters. The player-character (Figure 2.9) is a stereotypically dominant figure—

layer to the impression of submissiveness—hands close to the body, head tilted, and
more frequent smiling (see Clip 2.6 on the DVD).
Both Jak and Daxter and Grim Fandango also use dominance cues for humorous
purposes.
Daxter’s character won the IGDA’s Original Game Character of the Year Award
when the game was released. Daxter has a small body but behaves like the boss.
Daxter uses broad gestures, stares, and takes on others far larger than himself. In
Clip 2.7, he is very loud and dominates the conversation, despite his small size (See
also Figure 2.11). Other characters are not intimidated by him but rather seem to
find him amusing. Players also find Daxter amusing because of the contrast
between his diminutive size and his dominant behavior.
In Grim Fandango, Lucas Arts broke the typical hero mold by casting a relatively
powerless guy low on the status hierarchy as the player’s character (Figure 2.12).

2.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
In the course of the opening cut-scene, the player first sees Manny Calvera in a
rather imposing Grim Reaper outfit—tall and menacing. However, the camera soon
follows Manny behind the scenes at his workplace, where he removes the robe, puts
away the scythe, and reveals stilts that give him his towering height. For the rest
of the game, Manny is the little guy who could. (Clip 2.8 shows the transformation
of Manny.)
In both cases, the designers made use of the human tendency to attune to domi-
nance cues, to create humorous juxtapositions of traits.
2.2.2
Personality
The everyday sense of the word “personality” is a person’s typical patterns of
behavior—what they are like to interact with and how they generally engage with
everyday life and other people. Are they outgoing? Shy? Reliable? Flaky? Silly? Seri-
ous? Describing someone’s personality is a way of telling other people what to
expect when they interact with that person.
Psychologists who have studied personality find it to be a complex and difficult
concept to pin down. Human beings show different sides of themselves in different
situations, and it is difficult to come up with a consistent picture of any one per-
son’s behavior and tendencies. People are also profoundly affected by circum-
stances—behavior is just as much a product of situation as it is of internal traits. So
it is hard to find reliable indicators of personality that do not get affected by circum-
stance and setting.
And yet, we are all able to discuss one another’s personalities in a useful way.
One particular line of personality research focused on these trait descriptions, look-
ing for patterns—for clusters of traits that seemed to indicate an underlying dimen-
sion that was important in describing personality. They found clusters of words that
form consistent factors that seem to hold across cultures. They called these factors
‘the big five’ (see McCrae and Costa for an excellent overview of this research area).
To help people remember the factors, they use the acronym OCEAN, which stands
for openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticisim.
Two of these—extroversion (see discussion of Figure 2.2) and agreeableness—have
already been discussed because they overlap with interpersonal psychology theo-
ries. These also happen to be the most legible traits—easy to spot very quickly in
the first few interactions with another person. The other three traits—openness,
conscientiousness, and neuroticism—manifest themselves over longer interactions
and have to do with a person’s ongoing reactions to the world and others. These
personality traits can be characterized as follows:
• Openness. Open to new experiences, broad-minded, creative, and daring. Most
(though not all) player-characters have this personality trait because part of gam-
ing is diving right in and being open to the next adventure. For example, both

F I G U R E
2.13
Jak (from Jak and Daxter) and Manny (from Grim Fandango) display a high
degree of openness.
• Conscientiousness. Thorough and directed, acts based on planning versus
impulse, follows through on plans. This is a trait that often shows up in
nonplayer-characters (NPCs) that act as guides or mentors to the player (more on
these in Part IV, which highlights NPCs).
• Neuroticism. Tendency to worry, become wrapped up in self-consciousness ver-
sus outward-facing attention, also displays more emotional ups and downs. This
personality trait shows up in memorable and humorous NPCs, such as the ocean
bottom walker in Grim Fandango. (See Figure 2.13; Clip 2.9 shows an interaction
which highlights his charms.)
In contrast to the data on extroversion and agreeableness, there is far less
research consistently linking specific physical cues to these three traits. However,
Chapter 6, which focuses on body cues, includes movement-analysis techniques
that begin to address the expression of these qualities through movement.
Despite the lack of prescriptive advice about specific cues, it should still be
helpful to consider each of the “big five” traits when making design decisions.
Exaggerating or highlighting these traits can help make characters more engaging
and widely appealing because these factors have been shown to be widely legible
and relevant.

2.3
DESIGN POINTERS
37
2.3
Design Pointers
Here are a few techniques for using the social interaction traits in this chapter
in character designs.
2.3.1
Sketch a Relationship Diagram for the Game
One way to bring agreeableness and dominance cues into play is to plan out
the relationships among characters in a game, as well as the evolution of
those relationships. Making a relationship diagram is a quick and easy way to
sketch this out for everyone on the development team to use as a guide. This
need not be a polished diagram—it is meant to serve as a tool during the early
design process.
Put the player-character in the center, and then draw lines out to all the major
characters that will be a part of the game. Along the lines radiating out from
the player’s character to the others, indicate whether each character is friendly
or hostile toward your player-character and whether the character is more or
less dominant. Next, think about shifts in friendliness or status that will
happen during the course of the game between these characters and the
player-character. Circle the lines that will shift, and jot down how and why.
As an example, Figure 2.14 is a diagram for Jak and Daxter, outlining the
major relationships and arranged vertically by dominance.
Doing this exercise helps clarify the social landscape in the game from a
10,000-foot perspective. The diagram itself will be a visual reminder for every-
one on the design team that characters exist in relation to one another. It is
easy when animating, programming, or working on dialogue to forget that this
is the case and create assets that stand well alone but make less sense all
together. Circling the important relationship transition points may also help
to focus efforts during limited development time—planning more storage,
processing, and design and production time for illustrating key transitions in
relationships between characters.
2.3.2
Use Cue Lists to Help Guide Animation and Dialogue Reviews
The friendliness and dominance cue lists (Tables 2.1 and 2.2) can be used as
checkpoints for evaluating animations and voice recordings as a game’s cut-
scenes and in-game asset development progress. They may help everyone
clarify just why a character is not “working.” For example, a transition in
relationship will have much more punch if the cues shift quickly and obvi-
ously all at once—from voice, face, and body. Using the cue checklists can

help ferret out inconsistencies that muddy the player’s impressions of a char-
acter’s reactions.
2.3.3
Know All Five Personality Dimensions for Every Character
When planning out the cast of characters in a game, consider and record
where each falls within the “big five” personality dimensions. Making a char-
acter’s agreeableness and dominance positions clear from the start can help
players interact more intuitively and easily. Highlighting the dimensions that
unfold over time (openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism) can help
give characters more depth. Consider breaking type when crafting a charac-
ter’s personality—what might it be like to have a completely unconscientious
and capricious guide or mentor (e.g., the King in Katamari Damacy, page 61)?
How about an utterly introverted and closed player-character?

Summary and What Is Next
This chapter discussed some impression formation theory most relevant to the
crafting of early encounters with characters, including research on dominance and
agreeableness, and the “big five” theory of personality. Examples from Jak and
Daxter: The Precursor Legacy and from Grim Fandango helped to illustrate the
points made. Readers are encouraged to use the design tools in the chapter to apply
these theories.
Part Two focuses on player characteristics and their impact on character design.

2.5
Exercises
2.5.1
Characters with Personality
Brainstorm NPC (nonplayer-character) ideas that make use of the five
personality factors. Consider the potential for humor and/or drama in
extreme traits—someone very neurotic, someone very open to experi-
ence, someone extremely conscientious. Present your concepts in sto-
ryboard form to others and see if the character traits you aimed for are
legible: Can people easily identify the character’s personality? Is it
appealing to them? Why so? Which details helped them to get a feel for
the trait—visuals, dialogue, situations? How so?
2.5.2
Dominance/Agreeableness Role Play
Form groups of three for this exercise. One person will observe and the
other two will take turns playing a very dominant or very submissive
person. Pick a situation that has a big power differential—boss talking
to employee, lord talking to peasant, and so on. You may want to use
Impro (Johnstone 1979) as a reference book for choosing situations.
Use the cue lists in the chapter to help inspire you, but add your own
improvised actions—movement, posture, facial expressions, and tone
of voice. The third person takes notes about which actions seem to
contribute most to the impression of dominance or submissiveness.
Change roles so that everyone gets a chance to take notes and to play-
act both sides of the spectrum. Come together as a group and compare
notes. Compile a list of successful and interesting dominance and sub-
missiveness cues to use for inspiration when coming up with character
concepts later on.

PARTTwo
Focus on the Player
What Is Covered and Why
Chapters 3 and 4 provide a starting point for designers hoping to reach broader
audiences with their characters, replacing some of the guesswork involved at pre-
sent with recommendations for how to proceed. It is my belief that true cross-gender
and cross-cultural character appeal arises from understanding of and respect for the
differences that shape social perception and behavior.
Psychologists aim to conduct research and produce results that apply to all
human beings, and the findings in this book have been selected with an eye
toward generalizability—forming first impressions, noticing and caring about
dominance and agreeableness, seeking social information from faces, bodies, and
voices, and so forth. Yet within this broader context of being human, there are
important variations. Each person is as unique as a snowflake in their perceptions
and assumptions.
It is impossible to draw an adequate picture of each and every person’s
psychology. Instead, researchers look for results that are generalizable across
all people, and where this fails, they look for variables that help to explain
broad swaths of difference among people. Marketers do the same thing when
researching audiences—they look for broad groups and for variables to help
predict what will appeal to these groups. In both cases, a characteristic that is
true of many people, and which helps predict aspects of their behavior, becomes a
useful tool.
Designers face the same dilemma as researchers and marketers—they
must make choices about characters, knowing that each player will react in a
different way. Descriptive categories employed by marketers, such as gender
or culture, are a start, but segmenting audiences does not solve the problem of
providing useful guidance for designers. Chapters 3 and 4 work to delve deeper
into these broad demographic categories toward a richer understanding of
how these dimensions of a person’s experience impact expectations and per-
ceptions of self and others and toward targeted recommendations for shaping
character designs.
41

42
Who Will Find Part II Most Useful
The concepts and recommendations in these chapters will be especially useful to
designers who shape the early focus of a game and its characters, as well as to project
team leaders and marketers. They will also be useful to team members involved in
character production decisions along the way—artists, programmers, writers, and ani-
mators—as broader audience appeal emerges from the bottom up through design
detail (not just through initial conceptual choices).
Overview of Key Concepts
Both chapters emphasize that demographic variables are a shifting terrain—what it
means to be “Japanese” or to be “female” changes over time and fluctuates even
within a given time period. The two chapters also point out the role that designers
themselves can play in shaping notions of culture, subculture, and gender given
that games have the power to actively transform the social landscape.
Chapter 3 includes interviews with both industry and research figures who deal
with cultural differences in characters, in Chapter 4, several gamers (female and
male) are interviewed about their play preferences to illustrate the individual differ-
ences possible within the broad category of gender.
Culture
Expression and Physical Characteristics
Chapter 3 begins with a discussion of the ways in which everyday social expression
can differ among cultures and subcultures. This chapter also includes a discussion
of differences in appearance, such as ethnic features, and the role these can play in
identification with game characters.

43
Posture and gesture norms for conversation are quite different in Japan and the United States.
Roles and Expectations
Another important factor for character design, and one that varies among cultures
and subcultures, are the roles people learn about and the expectations they form
about how to behave to fit a role. The discussion in Chapter 3 includes some
dimensions along which cultures tend to vary, in terms of role behavior.

44
Media Contexts and Their Impact on Expectations
Chapter 3 also includes a discussion of the ways in which culture is shaped
and reflected in media and the importance of understanding the local media land-
scape when designing characters for a particular audience. This chapter includes
discussion of characters and contexts that have evolved a global reach, including
experiments such as SquareEnix’s Kingdom Hearts, which combines Disney and
anime-style characters.

45
Gender
Nature versus Nurture: Biology and Gender
Chapter 4 begins with a clarification of the concept of gender, making a distinc-
tion between biology and the process by which men and women are socialized to
be masculine or feminine. While a few biological factors that may have an impact
on game play are briefly cited in Section 4.2.2, the bulk of the chapter deals with
the enculturation of being male or female, not with biological differences.
Play Styles
This subsection (page 111) summarizes research investigating differences in the way
girls and boys play that could have an impact on character design choices.
Roles for Girls
One important aspect of enculturation of girls and boys is offering them role models
and fantasy personas that they can imagine being. This subsection (page 115) dis-
cusses the importance of providing accessible fantasy personas for girls, including
providing the capacity to self-generate player-characters to allow for a wider range of
role play.
Reactions to Girls
Chapter 4 also discusses the importance of socially appropriate reactions of NPCs to
female players, particularly in the case of the kinds of interest and attraction cues
that a character uses. Narrow use of sex appeal and gender-based assumptions can
inadvertently skew a game toward a male-only audience.

Take-Aways from Part II
After reading Part II, designers will feel more confident approaching character
design for an audience with members who are not from their own gender and
culture—mostly because they will have a healthy respect for the subtlety and depth
of differences in how people respond socially to game characters. Designers will
also leave with some ideas for how to design games to support both genders and
games that can travel across cultures well. One key message in both chapters is the
need to include a broader base of design-team members from target audiences in
the process, from the very beginning, because designers do best when they create
from and for what they deeply know.

CHAPTER
Three
Culture
3.1
What Is Covered and Why
This chapter offers a brief and targeted introduction to culture as it affects people’s
perceptions and interpretations of one another. Particularly for those who have
never lived in another culture (or in a setting with a diverse population of subcul-
tures), it is dangerously easy to resort to over-simplified stereotypical notions of
what someone from another culture is like, or would like, when designing charac-
ters. My hope is that reading this chapter will eliminate this possibility for the
reader, substituting instead a respect for the complexity and layers of culture and a
desire to incorporate this understanding into character design.
Culture is far too broad a topic to cover coherently in a few pages, so this chapter
focuses on the aspects of culture that relate specifically to the crafting of game char-
acters, with findings that modulate the theory and design practices in the subsequent
sections of the book. The chapter concludes with design recommendations for deal-
ing with culture well when crafting characters and with two interviews—the first
with two localization experts for Sony and the second with researchers who have
been developing characters to train cross-cultural awareness in language learners.
3.2
The Psychological Principles
3.2.1
Culture:Getting Clear on the Concept
In the game industry, discussion of culture is often reduced to reference to nations or
continents—designing for “the Japanese” or for “the European” markets. In fact,
these national and supranational identities are fairly recent in human evolution and
are only one of the many social groupings that make up cultures. In many cases (for
example, in Japan), ethnicity is intertwined with national cultural identity, creating
outsider subcultures of ethnically different groups. Within nations, there are other
identifiable subcultures (for example, the cultural differences between the East
and West coasts in the United States or between the South and the North; or the
contrast between Kanto and Kansai dwellers in Japan). Aspects of a person’s
47

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
environment, personal qualities, and history can have an affect on his or her cultural
identifications. There are subcultures that have economic status, life-stage, gender,
and many other characteristics as their predominant markers of identification.
Each person may simultaneously belong to several cultural contexts. Some of
these transcend national boundaries—consider, for example, the subculture of motor-
cycle bikers, which has members around the globe who share common points of ref-
erence and rituals (see Figure 3.1). There is also the subculture of airline pilots, who
may be from very different national cultures but who share training, procedural
knowledge, and daily experiences that lead to a shared set of assumptions and beliefs.
Culture, even at the national level that we often think of first, is something that
shifts over time. What was true of the typical American or the typical Japanese a
generation ago may not be true today. It is also clear that people as individuals and
as groups can get more familiar with, adjust to, and appropriate one another’s
forms and expectations—in this way blending formerly distinct cultures. For exam-
ple, the proliferation of Japanese gardens in the West, or the global distribution of
American serial television.
Despite all the distinctions among subcultures, there are fundamental qualities
and situations that human beings share that produce similarities among cultures.
Meeting basic survival needs, having and raising children, caring for the sick,
adjusting to changes in the environment, and managing the distribution of labor
and property within groups, are all shared circumstances. The bedrock of culture is
made up of such universal concerns that spring from being human.
What does all this mean for designing culture-appropriate game characters?

subcultures, it is crucial to move past broad stereotypes of national markets toward a
richer understanding of the complexities of culture that can affect player reactions to
design (Figure 3.2 a,b). Here are a few reasons for taking this approach:
• All gamers from any given national culture are not alike. Each culture has clus-
ters of subcultures within it, and it can be misleading to use generalizations
about a single national group as though it was a monoculture.
• The terrain of culture (and games) is always shifting. Cultures change and
blend into one another. What may have been true even five years ago may be
quite different now.
• People of other cultures and subcultures may enjoy culture-hopping. People do
crave knowledge and exposure to one another’s cultures, so it is not necessarily

the case that you need to design to fit each particular culture to create a globally
appealing game. Designs that address basic human issues and qualities can be
appealing even when the details of the characters’ appearance and behavior
come from an unfamiliar subculture.
Given this complex web of culture and subcultures, how is it possible to make good
design decisions? The more you know about which aspects of behavior tend to vary
based upon culture, the more attuned you will be to making good choices in char-
acter design, on a case-by-case basis. Also, there are a few broader patterns that
social scientists have found in cultures that can help to predict how a game’s char-
acters will be perceived. Section 3.2.2 will highlight useful dimensions of difference
and will discuss applicable patterns.
3.2.2
Culture:Research Findings and Characters
The full range of differences in cultural behavior and acculturation across nations
and ethnic and racial groups could and does fill many volumes. The aim here
is to share a few concepts directly related to character design. These can be
divided into
• social norms about expression and physical characteristics,
• social norms about roles and expectations, and
• local media contexts and their impact on expectations and interaction.
Social Norms about Expression and Physical Characteristics
Human beings in every culture share the same basic biological equipment for social
communication: body, face, and voice (discussed in more detail in Part III). While
there is evidence that many aspects of social communication are universal—for
example, the basic emotional expressions of the face (Ekman 1973)—there is
also evidence that cultures develop local norms for modulating these displays. For
example, among mainstream Japanese it is expected that one controls facial expres-
sion, gestures, and tone of voice to a far greater degree than is expected in the United
States. This cultural difference can cause misunderstandings among people—
Americans may perceive Japanese as cold or unemotional; Japanese may perceive
Americans as childish and selfish. It also means that Japanese may attribute greater
emotion to a person based upon a more mild expression (e.g., a slightly sad look
may indicate that a person is in great distress). See Figure 3.4 for a comparison of
conversational distance and gesture.
The use of bowing, and the (by American norms) subdued expression of power-
ful emotions such as grief, come through as culturally Japanese in Final Fantasy X
even when the voices themselves are dubbed into American English (see Figure 3.3).
50

3.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
In addition to an individual’s use of body, face, and voice, there are differences
in how interpersonal distance is handled and how touch is used and what it may
mean. For example, in conversation, people from Arabic cultures tend to stand
far closer to one another than people from the United States might (less than
18 inches), and consider hand-holding between men to be normal and acceptable.
American men may find this closeness and hand-holding quite uncomfortable and
too intimate. Arabic men may find the American tendency to stand further away
and avoid touch to indicate coldness or untrustworthiness.
Social psychologists who specialize in cultural difference have proposed two
dimensions that are useful in understanding these patterns of physical display and of
interpersonal distance—high context and low context (Hall 1976) and individualist
versus collectivist (Hofstede 1980). High-context cultures are those in which commu-
nication happens through indirect cues, such as emotional expressions and body
language, where much that is communicated happens outside words themselves.
Low-context cultures are those in which communication occurs mainly through
what is spoken, where there is an emphasis on overt clarity of message. There is
some evidence linking a preference for overt clarity to a culture’s individualistic
nature. Cultures (such as that of the United States) that value an individual’s inde-
pendence and freedom of expression seem to lean more toward thinking about com-
munication as something that occurs in an explicit way. Collectivist cultures—those
that value the harmony of the group and protecting each person’s feelings during
communication (such as that of Japan)—seem to lean more toward using lots of
nonverbal communication—a method that helps to preserve each person’s “face.”
Researchers have attempted to array many national cultures along these dimen-
sions (e.g., Hofstede 1983), so it might be helpful to take a look at this data to
find out where the countries one is designing for fall along this spectrum. If the

audience includes high-context, collectivist cultural groups, it becomes even more
important to consider local nonverbal communication styles and norms when
designing characters. Ideally, designs and interactions between characters should be
crafted with the help of one or more designers from the audience culture; they will
be in the best position to help tune how relationships are acted out among the char-
acters, to make sure they make sense locally.
Another important cultural factor in social perception and interaction is shared
physical identity. There is research showing that people who look like oneself ethni-
cally are perceived as more socially attractive, are better liked, seem more trustwor-
thy and competent, and are perceived as having the same values as oneself. This
effect seems to carry over to the perception of computer-based characters (Nass,
Isbister, and Lee 2000).
This may become especially important in the design of player-characters who
stand in socially for the player in a game. When games are taken to new cultural
contexts, player characters sometimes get “localized” to reflect this same-as-me
bias. See, for example, Figure 3.5. Crash Bandicoot was redrawn for sale in Japan
with black, instead of green eyes (a feature that would seem far more strange in
Japan than in the United States). The packaging of the U.S. release of the Playsta-
tion 2 game ICO (see Figure 3.6) shows a more Caucasian set of features on the
young boy, who is the player-character, than within the game itself where the
player-character is still a boy with Asian features.
The impossibility of truly reflecting ethnic identities across multiple cultural
groups may help to explain the prevalence of nonhuman characters in games that
travel successfully across cultural borders.

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Social Norms about Roles and Expectations
People rely on social roles to structure interaction possibilities in everyday life: a role
helps guide what is expected of each person and prescribes aspects of what can be
said and how. Each of us plays many roles, depending upon the social situation and
the company we are in. For example, one woman may play the roles of employee,
mother, daughter, sister, and friend, among others. Roles are a part of the social fab-
ric that arises from everyday relationships and situations. Some aspects of these rela-
tionships and situations are universally human—family relationships, getting work
done in an organized way, and relying upon one another for survival. However, the
nuances of social roles vary a great deal among cultural groups (Rosman and Rubel
1989). For example, in some cultures a newly married woman moves in with her
husband and his parents and is expected to fit into their family’s existing social fab-
ric, whereas in other cultures (such as in the United States) the expectation is that a
newly married couple will set up their own independent household. These differ-
ences in expectation in turn set up behavioral expectations in everyday interaction.
One reason social roles differ is that they reflect underlying value systems within
cultures—religious or other beliefs that dictate the “proper” structure of society and
the place of an individual. As a culture or subculture’s values and environmental
context shift, social roles shift accordingly. For example, the import of Confucianism
to Japan in the Middle Ages profoundly shifted social role expectations, reinforcing
a patriarchal (father-as-leader) structure both in families and in the larger political
realm (Ko, et al. 2003).

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
55
Social roles are important to character design because they shape a player’s
expectations about how characters should interact with one another (and the player)
in a game (a topic covered in more detail in Part IV). If a character has a particular
social role, the player will unconsciously apply his or her own cultural expectations
for fulfilling that role and may be confused, annoyed, or alienated if the character
diverges from these expectations without explanation. This may be especially true if
the character looks as if she or he belongs to the player’s own cultural group.
How is it possible to sort through myriad cultural expectations to find patterns
that can have an impact on character social role design in a coherent way? The pre-
viously mentioned cultural dimension of collectivism versus individualism is one
pattern to keep in mind. Valuing group over individual creates very different role
behavior. For example, in Japan (which has a strongly collectivist cultural style) the
boss is seen as someone who should look out for and nurture the group of employ-
ees, who should be present until the last worker goes home for the night. Knowing
about collectivist assumptions can help a design team think through how characters
are behaving with one another and whether they will be compelling and appealing
to people with a background that includes these values.
In Final Fantasy X, supporting Yuna (the Summoner) is the task of the player’s
primary character, Tidus, as well as of other members of the player’s fighting party
(see Figure 3.7). Tidus’s responsibilities suit collectivist expectations for a hero.
In contrast to Tidus, Master Chief of Halo is a traditional tough-guy hero in the
John Wayne and Clint Eastwood American tradition (see Figure 3.8). As the Master
Chief, the player makes decisions alone about what to do next and has the admira-
tion and support of the troops for his fiery independence and know-how. Master
Chief fits individualistic cultural expectations for a hero.
Another dimension that helps make sense of differences in social role expecta-
tions is power distance. Cultures with high power distance tend to support and
accept great differences in individuals’ personal power within the social fabric as a

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
normal part of life. High power-distance cultures have a greater tolerance for use of
coercive tactics and borrowing status from superiors than cultures with low power
distance. People in low power-distance cultures tend to feel that power should be
used only when it is legitimated in some way—when the person is an expert or has
somehow “earned” power. It is easy to see that this difference could have a pro-
found impact on social role behavior of characters. For example, a person from a
high power-distance culture (such as much of India) may not be outraged at a
capricious mastermind villain’s action to the degree that someone from a low
power-distance culture (such as the United States) would be.
One place to look for variance in social roles and values is in the stories told to
children in a culture. Roles and expectations are often embedded in these tales
and can give a clue to someone from outside the culture about expectations. Here,
one Japanese expert in cross-cultural studies shares her surprise when she first saw a
cartoon version of Aesop’s fable of The Grasshopper and the Ants in the United States:
One ant, bigger than the rest, steps out and asks the grasshopper what
happened to his own store of food for the winter. The grasshopper says that it
doesn’t have a store because it was busy singing during the summer. To this the
ant responds: “Since you were so busy singing this summer, I guess you’ll have
to dance for your food this winter!” All the ants laugh and the grasshopper goes
off hungry. . . . The ending of the story I remember is completely different. In the
version my grandmother read to me as a child, the ants invite the hungry
cicadas in when they show up at their mound, and the story ends with the
moral: “All summer long, the ants worked as hard as they could and the cicadas
sang with all their might. Now it was time for the ants and the cicadas to join
together in a winter feast.” . . . The American story demonstrates the impor-
tance of fending for yourself. . . . The point of the American story is that
each person is responsible for his or her own destiny. On the other hand, the
Japanese story about hard work shows how everyone has a role in society, and
encourages the idea of depending on each other in times of need. . . . The lesson

in the Japanese story is that each person is responsible for everyone else. . . . The
American story promotes independence, but the Japanese story, interdependence.
(Yamada 1997, 3–4)
Local Media Contexts and Their Impact on Expectations and
Interaction
Yamada’s surprise at the different endings of the ant and grasshopper/cicada story
illustrates the importance of familiar stories and forms as a backdrop upon which
people experience everyday life (and their interactions with any new person or situa-
tion, including mediated ones). When a player starts up a game for the first time, he
or she is not coming to it with a blank mind. Instead, the player has years of accu-
mulated experiences with media of all kinds and has developed expectations about
what is to come. A player’s cultural and subcultural backgrounds have a profound
effect on how she or he perceives the game because of these existing expectations.
One word psychologists use to describe these expectations is schemas. Schemas are
patterns that a person has learned and can reaccess to help guide perception and
interaction. If an experience matches some of the aspects of a schema, the person
may be “primed” to start using his or her mental model of this type of experience to
predict and plan for what will happen next. For example, if a person enters a restau-
rant she or he will use learned schemas for dealing with waiters and waitresses to
help plan and predict what is to come: first he will show me to my table, then give
me a menu, then take my drink order, and so forth. Problems can arise when a cus-
tomer is from a different culture and does not know the local restaurant schema. This
can cause confusion and misinterpretation of actions by both people. The customer
and the waiter are looking for next actions from the other that do not occur—they are
tripping over the tools which are normally so useful in streamlining interaction.
Because human minds work in this way, a designer ignores the local cultural
media forms at his or her peril. Ideally, a designer should be immersed in the media
landscape of the player audience for which she or he is designing. Even in this time
of global media, there are many important local forms that differ among popula-
tions. Consider manga and anime in Japan, Bollywood musical films, or telenovel-
las in South America. Each of these forms has intricate details that regular con-
sumers know intimately. Anything that evokes these forms must be true to the
details or make knowing reference to them and make sense in contrast to them.
Most successful anime- and manga-style video games come from Japan because it
is very difficult for outsiders to execute the form properly (see Figure 3.9 for an
example of a Japanese anime-style game).
Particular subcultures have their own media landscapes as well and actively con-
tribute to the shaping and reshaping of local and global media cultures. If a design
is targeted toward a distinct subculture, it must reference the media authentic to
that group’s experience while keeping the background noise of mainstream culture
in mind. Full Throttle, an adventure game from LucasArts, combines the biker sub-
culture and American mainstream culture (see Figure 3.10).
57

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Global media have taken such schemas from a local to an international phe-
nomenon. Now it is possible for a form to become part of the cultural landscape of
people from around the world. Global media forms, such as American situation-
comedy television programs, get layered onto local cultural contexts. Games such
as The Sims™ take advantage of the broad saturation of the sitcom form (see 
Figure 3.11a). Player-created content tools have allowed players to add even more
layers of cultural forms onto The Sims itself, for example, anime-style character skins
(see Figure 3.11b).

Commercial game developers have also played with blended forms: for example,
the Kingdom Hearts game combines anime-style characters from SquareEnix’s Final
Fantasy series with Disney characters (see Figure 3.12).
Games themselves have created transcultural media forms—Mario (see Figure 3.13)
and other early platform characters from Japan are recognized all over the world.

Design Pointers
There are no easy answers in designing game characters that have appeal across
cultural groups, and there is little systematic information available either in the
research community or in the game-developer community about what works,
from a general point of view. However, here are some suggestions that may help
aim character designs in a direction that supports transcultural appeal:
• Use simple human universals in character relationships. Everyone has
family struggles. The Japanese game Katamari Damacy (see Figure 3.14)—
which traveled easily from Japan to the United States—features an imperi-
ous father directing his tiny son (the player’s character) to clean up the
mess that he has made. Such a simple situation avoids cultural complexi-
ties yet takes advantage of the powerful emotions that attach themselves to
these familiar social relationships.
• Consider avoiding real races and cultural moments. Cartoonish, nonhuman
characters such as Pokemon, Pacman, and Kirby travel well across national
boundaries. These characters avoid activating ethnicity, and they are
forgiven for behaving in odd ways because they are so clearly not part of

DESIGN POINTERS

the usual human social structure. Their worlds do not correlate to any spe-
cific culture’s time and place. Similarly, alien races from far-distant stars or
mythic races of beings from fantasy literature help avoid localization issues.
Playing these characters is equally alien to all.
• Borrow from existing transmedia. The global media culture can be lever-
aged for game character concepts—hence the proliferation of Hollywood
movie tie-in games. Recognizable characters and types—gangsters, rappers,
martial artists, and the like—take advantage of the fact that most players
can apply what they have learned from other media to know what to
expect from the characters. Social roles, nonverbal cues, and value systems
have already been learned by the player from prior exposure. Designers can
also feel more secure about the success of their designs knowing that play-
ers already enjoy imagining being a part of these worlds.
• Be true to the localization of your characters in their own world. Whatever the
cultural setting is for the characters, make sure to work it out thoroughly and
to have an internally coherent, rich, and realistic social world for the charac-
ters that the design team knows like the backs of their hands. Part of the rea-
son for the success of the Star Wars movie series was the great care its cre-
ators took in working out the details of the Star Wars universe. Players are far
more likely to accept the social dynamics among characters when they are
well grounded in the local setting and values of the world you have crafted.
• Do not try to take on a subculture or media form your team does not know
well. The worst choice you could make would be to try to add a few

elements of an unfamiliar culture or subculture to a game’s characters, or
to try to wholly craft something within a media genre that is not a native
format for the design team. People from the target culture or subculture
will find these attempts jarring and unappealing. There are too many
nuances involved for any team new to a form or a culture to appropriately
include the right social signals. It is simply not possible. Far better to cre-
ate a coherent character social system working from what the designers
know intimately themselves.
• Include designers from the target culture. If the team wants to build for multi-
ple cultures, or wants to build a game that works well for a particular subcul-
ture, the safest way to do this is to include full-fledged design team members
from the target group in the design process, from the beginning. Nothing can
substitute for having a high level of involvement from one (or more) mem-
bers of the target group when the crucial design choices are getting made.
These people can explain why concepts do or do not feel right, can nix obvi-
ous false notes, and can help nudge the design through the iteration cycle.
• Test early and often with members of the target culture. Even when a team
does include members from the target culture, it is important to put ideas
in front of players from that culture as early and often as is feasible.
Remember that cultures are not homogeneous—there will be many per-
spectives within a given group, and it is important to get a range of reac-
tions to ensure that the game’s characters will have the proper appeal.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Q: What about American video game character design? Do you think it’s influenced
by Hollywood movies?
Tsurumi: I think that the influence of Hollywood movies is pervasive throughout the
world. Of course, it influences the Japanese people as well, but for some reason they are
not accustomed to game characters that are derived from similar types found in film.
Quite often Japanese people respond to such characters by just strongly rejecting them.
Hasegawa: From 2002 to 2003 I spoke with many overseas production companies at
the E3 meeting hall and frequently heard something like the following. Even if they
don’t alter their character designs, Japanese games still sell in the overseas market. In
contrast, when overseas production companies gave presentations to Japanese pub-
lishers and distributors, they were often told that their characters were not suitable for
the Japanese market. At that time, I was asked about what types of characters are
acceptable for the Japanese market. Sometime later, a request for a lecture came to
Tsurumi from the GDC offices through Mark Cerny*. It seemed interesting to me, and I
thought I would give it a try.
http://www.cernygames.com/
I don’t mean to say that the Japanese game industry is closed to the world market.
But it does have an image of being pretty biased.While Japanese products are distrib-
uted overseas, overseas products don’t sell in Japan. For example, the production com-
panies with whom we have worked, such as Naughty Dog, which produced Crash
Bandicoot (SCE/Vivendi Universal Games 1996), and Insomniac Games, which made
Spyro the Dragon (SCE 1999) and Ratchet & Clank (SCE 2002), often talked with Tsurumi

In Japan, there is a tendency to not want to publish such information outside of one’s
own company. But when we went to GDC 2003, we felt a responsibility to share some of
our know-how to raise the bar of the entire industry. We felt very good about this, and
were in strong agreement about this matter.
Q: Was the 2003 conference the first GDC you attended?
Hasegawa:Yes.
Tsurumi: I was initially contacted by Mark Cerny. At first I was not sure if I would
attend the conference because I do not speak English very well. But because
Hasegawa is very good at English, I convinced him to attend the conference with me.
Then we were told by Mark Cerny that we should attend without any worries because
at GDC 2003 they would be trying out simultaneous Japanese-to-English interpreta-
tion. Originally we were working on an English manuscript, but now we could just
speak in Japanese. The simultaneous interpretation at the conference was superb; I
did not feel uncomfortable with the discussion as I listened to the translation and
responded in Japanese.
However, due to time constraints we were only able to talk about our ideas in outline.
We introduced several cases,but we could only sketch the fundamentals of our ideas.But
after that, we discussed by email the things we touched upon in our lecture with people
we met at the conference.
Hasegawa: We still get email from game production companies from all over the world.
Just the other day I got an email from a female game designer in Germany.
Q: Hollywood movies are appreciated throughout the world, and even American
movie characters are popular in Japan. For example, C-3PO and R2-D2 from Star
Wars, and various Disney characters. But it’s strange that there is an aversion to
such characters when they appear in video games.
Tsurumi: But there have also been times when the Japanese market had difficulty with
even Disney films.I heard that this was the case for Mulan (1998).
Q: Yes,that’s right.
Tsurumi: The design of the Mulan character was unacceptable for Japanese people.
Hasegawa: It was a little beyond the permissible range of Japanese sensibilities.

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
On the flipside,although the character design work in Pixar’s Finding Nemo (2003) and
The Incredibles (2005) was similar to that of Mulan, they were within the permissible
range of the Japanese. Many Japanese people accepted them without feeling uncom-
fortable at all.
Q: To be sure, the characters in Monsters, Inc. (2001) were easy for me to enjoy. But I
did not think that The Incredibles would be such a hit in Japan.
Tsurumi and Hasegawa:The Incredibles was a fun film.
Hasegawa: But it has already been fifteen years since the advent of the full CG (Com-
puter Graphics) film.The first was Toy Story (1995). Since then there has been a string of
pure CG films, and I think that the Japanese have grown accustomed to them. So if
The Incredibles had been the first of such films to be released in Japan, it might not
have been such a big hit.
Q: That’s right.
Hasegawa: For the past fifteen years full CG films and their character designs have been
easier for Japanese people to accept.And The Incredibles was such a hit because the story
and animation techniques were excellent.
Q: That’s true.
Tsurumi: I might also mention that, with the exception of the father’s character design,
Japanese people may not react differently to the characters appearing in The Incredibles.
Hasegawa: That is true.The father’s face was the most removed from the types that the
Japanese are fond of.
Tsurumi: The father was the only character design that was entirely off the mark. That
might be why it was such a hit in Japan.
Hasegawa: Among the things that we talk about the most is the difference between the
facial structures of Japanese and westerners.The faces of Japanese and other Asian char-
acters look flat, but the cuts of foreign faces, especially Caucasians, are clear, and their
brows are very prominent. From just that one difference people have felt a sense of
incongruity for some time now.
Tsurumi: Suggested, exaggerated, and abstracted faces of Caucasians are facial features
that the Japanese feel no affinity with. Additionally, that is a style or symbol that we are
not very fond of.
There are some things I feel should be emphasized about a character.The distinguishing
feature of the Lilo character in Lilo and Stitch (2003) is her large, South Pacific nose, but
that is a symbolic type that we do not emphasize.The beautiful young girls depicted in
manga and anime are all drawn with small noses.For me, the Lilo character was not cute
at all. But children in Japan loved Lilo too.What I have felt over the years as I worked on
video games is that children are very tolerant of variations of character design.
Hasegawa: They are ready for anything.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Q: That’s true.
Tsurumi: Of course, there are some colors and styles that children prefer. But they are
more tolerant than adults. Conversely, however, when they enter upper school they
become very intolerant.
Hasegawa: I think that in the case of children, perhaps when they see an image of a
character, even if they don’t feel fond of it at first, there are instances that they will like it
when they see the character in action.We have both had such an experience.
Q: Uh-huh.
Hasegawa: However, the moment we see a character, we exclude that object from our
range of interest when we feel that it is something we cannot accept. But in the case of
children, there are times when children go to see a film with their parents at their par-
ents’ recommendation. There are also times when one’s ambivalence about a character
vanishes once they see the work.
When adults like us judge a work based on images of the characters,we are just judg-
ing it before actually seeing it,and,more than children,we are missing out on something.
Maybe that’s because there is nothing like enjoying something once you have seen it.
Tsurumi: I often say that I don’t want to make games for adults.As people grow up,their
tendency to reject things outside of their own interests gets stronger. Indeed, it’s natural
for one’s childhood broad acceptance of things to get narrower the older one gets. But
what if we regularly encounter various forms of expression? For example,when Japanese
children are raised in the United States, don’t they still like various styles of characters
even when they become adults? Isn’t someone working on such comparative research?
Q: A contrary example is the proliferation of Pokémon throughout the United
States. It was often mentioned five or six years ago that Pokémon was a huge hit in
the States due to the prior advancement of anime there. And Pokémon was an ani-
mation for children. On the other hand, this has been done in the Japanese market
by the works of Disney and Pixar.
Tsurumi: In Japan,Pixar films are even popular for adults.I could go on forever about The
Incredibles. For example, the director of that film, Brad Bird, also directed The Iron Giant
(1999).When I observe his direction of The Iron Giant and the design of Mrs.Incredible and
her children’s faces, I can tell that they are all strongly influenced by manga and anime.
Mrs.Incredible and the children are Caucasians,but the design of their faces is reminiscent
of anime and manga characters. Of course, I think that heroes in American comics and
other forms of media have been influenced in the same way.He probably also figured that
if he put out a film with a strong influence from manga and anime in the primary Japan-
ese movie market,he could expect quite a profit.That is what I have thought.
Hasegawa: On the other hand, just at about the time when I left Sega and moved to
SCE, I was told by a Sega marketing woman that,“Pokémon will definitely not be a hit in
the U.S.market.”To be sure,even before Pokémon, anime was starting to gain popularity
67

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
all over the world, and in the U.S. market those works with the typical animation style
were produced for their enthusiasts.That is why she thought that even Pokémon would
not be a hit for the general audience there. She also had a lot of experience in the gam-
ing industry. Actually, I was working with her at Sega. When we were working on the
Genesis console,* she said that in the short clips shown throughout a game and in the
scenes when the faces of the characters are shown close up, their faces are redrawn
from their anime style into a two-dimensional American comic style. I think it was
because she had experienced this before that she told me,“Anime-type representations
of characters such as those in Pokémon will not be accepted by the American market.”
But when Pokémon became a hit, the American market changed in a big way. Of
course, even before Pokémon, anime like Area 88, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
(1986), Akira (1988), and the like had already come out in the States, and gradually what
was once limited to a hard-core enthusiast market spread to the general market. And
then when Pokémon came out,there was suddenly a huge anime boom.
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind

Q: In the field of psychology they also talk about signification. There is research
showing that as we become adults, we selectively choose behavioral patterns that
are appropriate to particular cultures and start to distinguish those patterns from
others. The ability to be receptive to some symbols but not others is innate to our
thinking process.
Hasegawa: Is there research like that?
Tsurumi: I would like to hear more about that. It would be great if such research could
reinforce the hypothesis I have considered all these years.
Q: They research things like this even at corporations like Bandai. They analyze the
factors that determine how children perceive characters.
Hasegawa: Tsurumi often says that the character designs in works for children should be
ones that children can draw easily. For example, if you just arrange three circles of differ-
ent sizes together, it is pretty much recognizable as Mickey Mouse. Sometimes we get
New Year’s cards from children with portraits of Ratchet and Clank.When I look at those
portraits,Ratchet’s eyebrows are emphasized.
Tsurumi: Ratchet’s ears and eyebrows are very special symbols in the Japanese market.
Hasegawa: And the striped pattern of his body, too.The eyebrows of the overseas ver-
sion of Ratchet are much thinner than those of the Japanese version. The texture
of Ratchet’s eyebrows in the Japanese version is thick. There are several reasons for
this. The first reason is that it emphasizes his character. When we were developing

advertisements for Sh gakukan’s Coro-Coro Comic magazine,we were told by the editor
that they wanted the character to have a more physical,visual quality.If we made it that
way, then when children just glanced at the character they would be able to recognize
his type. Also, Japanese characters that are easy to categorize based on such contours
are more popular.

Hasegawa: Also, as I mentioned before, originally the part just below the eyebrows
on the polygon model of Ratchet’s face protruded quite a bit.But when it was made into
a Japanese version, we changed the polygon model of the face by flattening the brow.
Unfortunately, this became a problem when we rendered the CG clips in the game, so in
the end we couldn’t alter the polygon model of the face at all. But we could show the
protruding brow by texturing them with thick growths of eyebrows.
So we were able to make a character that Japanese people would like by just applying
a new texture to the face and not changing the polygon model of the face at all. As a
result,we got New Year’s cards from kids with emphasized eyebrows,and when the char-
acter was introduced by Coro-Coro Comic, there was a caption reading something like,
“The hero with the bushy eyebrows.”With that,the personality of Ratchet quickly caught
on with the children.It was wonderful.
Tsurumi: This was about the time of the first Ratchet & Clank (SCE 2002), when the proj-
ect was started by Insomniac Games, SCEA, and SCEJ.We were discussing several things
then. At that time, not only did the Ratchet character not have eyebrows, he didn’t even
have that striped pattern on his body either.
Hasegawa: This is an alteration of the Sly Cooper (SCE 2003) character (GDC 2003, pres-
entation data #33–35).Ratchet changed in a similar way.
Tsurumi: Initially, he was just a character holding a weapon and had these big pointy
ears. To be honest, when I first saw him, I didn’t understand what he was supposed to
be. When I was looking at the work of the American game designers, I felt that they
were thinking it was fine if the character didn’t look human. But in Japan this didn’t
work. If you don’t understand a character by its appearance, children can’t draw a por-
trait of it, and you can’t cognize the character in your mind. Such characters definitely
won’t be accepted in Japan.We have given this kind of advice to the character design-
ers at Insomniac Games several times.
After they understood what we were telling them, we confirmed that Ratchet is a
very vivacious character and then added the striped pattern to his body. It’s not that
Ratchet is some kind of animal; but if his body had stripes, even though he is not a
tiger, people who saw him would appreciate his wild nature, ferocity, and strength.
Plus, when we darkened his eyebrows, his appearance announced him as a richly
expressive character. We talked about why it was necessary for us to change his
o

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
appearance in this way, and now Ratchet, even outside of Japan, has those eyebrows,
even though they may not be as thick as the Japanese version. We added some other
signature traits to the character,too.
Q: As you were adding these signature traits to the characters, were there any propos-
als or objections from Insomniac Games regarding character traits that they could
not use?
Tsurumi: There were, regarding the degrees in which we wanted to change the charac-
ter. But whether or not he had eyebrows changed the character completely. If Ratchet
had eyebrows and a striped body from the beginning,we could just emphasize them for
the Japanese version. Of course, if they didn’t want to emphasize the eyebrows and
stripes in the U.S.version,then that would have been fine.It is not a matter of the degree
of signature qualities,but a problem of whether or not they are present.
When we exchange ideas about the rough design of the character in the very
beginning, we usually make the character model so that we can change the color of
the eyes, add details, and emphasize or eliminate elements of their outward appear-
ance for different regions.So it’s fine when the degrees of a character’s qualities are not
perfect for Japan.
Q: You mean that you design character models so that they are easy to modify for
different regions?
Tsurumi: That’s correct.
Q: When you were talking about making the alterations, I suppose the word “signa-
ture traits” came up quite a bit. Even in your GDC 2003 lecture, you mentioned that,
in Japan, manga and anime characters are an assemblage of such traits. Tell me a
little more about putting together such traits and bringing characters to life.
Tsurumi: If I start with the fundamentals of this,it all goes back to influence from manga
and anime.First,there is not much of a definite manga style.
Hasegawa: There are a lot of reproductions.
Tsurumi: Yeah.I could explain 60 years of manga history here,but I will just summarize it.
Q: About all the post-Tezuka Osamu* variants,right?
Tsurumi: Yes. In the history of manga design there are many branches that follow in
the footsteps of other writers of genius. The Japanese manga industry, like the Indian
movie industry, is its greatest producer and place of consumption; fundamentally it
begins and ends within the country. So the range of manga writers is very broad, and
among them there are many standards that are important for each age. And, in turn,

those branches father branches of their own. For example, after the 1980s there were
many descendents of tomo Katsuhiro’s style. Urasawa Naoki’s Yawara!, H j Tsukasa’s
City Hunter, etc.They all got their start imitating Otomo’s style and gradually developed
a style of their own.

Tsurumi:Yes.That is the Aoki Y ji style.
Hasegawa: When I first saw Aoki’s pictures, I had a strong aversion to them, but now
I appreciate them as much as anyone else.
Tsurumi: Manga has a visual and dramatic appeal, and the story is very important. So
compared to the world of illustrators, which is a competitive media market based solely
on an illustrator’s ability to draw, even if the images look a little similar they are not criti-
cized much. The designs of Aoki Y ji’s drawings were very suitable when he used
his images to express the world of finance and the reality of the world that most adults
didn’t know about.Also,the target audience was thirty- to forty-year-olds,for whom such
a theme was in demand. So the style of the images was recognized by the market even
more than the work by itself.Although Aoki Y ji passed away,his style has been taken up
by several other manga writers.
Before Aoki Y ji it probably would have been impossible for that image style to have
even been accepted if it had been made into an anime. However, now it is totally possi-
ble for anime.
So, in the manga world there were more than 10 or so such geniuses. However, and
I am excluding manga for young girls here, their branches produced a huge volume of
manga in their styles.
Hasegawa: There was an amateur boom a while back too.Like Miura Jun.

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Tsurumi: The essence of manga has a visual element, too, but ultimately it is about the
writing. First, it has a story, and the image styles that suit the story are chosen later. As
for silent manga, there isn’t much of a market for it in Japan. I mean, it is not a very
important part of it.
In the end,when it comes to authorship and originality,I think if you exclude the work
of the masters,there are still some original elements in the works of the several branches,
and what makes them original are the signature traits of their character designs. There
are only a few original expressions of character movements and layout designs. And in
anime, even when they use just an ordinary character, they still move impressively. You
can’t do that with manga very well.But signature traits are even more important than the
originality of the artwork. I think if you dismantle the expressive framework of manga,
you will end up with an assemblage of character traits.
Hasegawa: When we were writing the manuscript for our GDC 2003 lecture, Tsurumi
and I debated about this several times. And after our lecture we received email from a
lot of people, and from that a new debate emerged. It seemed fresh at the time. For
example, with manga and anime, there are scenes when the protagonist makes his
appearance in an important scene, like when there is a real crisis or something. When
this happens, there is usually a light shining behind the protagonist, and he makes his
appearance as a silhouette.There is nothing unusual about this, but when this happens
you must be able to tell that it is the protagonist only by his silhouette. So in anime it is
fine to just show the character’s movement, but in a game magazine, this can only be
shown to the reader with a picture.That is why the character’s silhouette is more impor-
tant than character details.
For example, if there is a character whose headband is often streaming in the wind,
you will know who it is by just the silhouette. Also, when a character strikes a special
pose,you should be able to tell who it is by the pose alone.It’s kind of like the poses they
do in the kabuki theater.So style is also a character trait.
Q: So we can trace the production that gives a character his signature qualities by
his poses and silhouette all the way back to the kabuki theater in the Edo period?
Hasegawa: That’s right.
Q: Another example of a silhouette expressing a character’s personality is the “justice
scarf” in manga and anime. This word is a playful way of referring to those protago-
nists in manga and anime who wear a scarf all the time. And children understand
that characters who wear a scarf are allies of justice. Also, their portraits are easy to
draw.So a scarf is a symbol for justice.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Hasegawa: Yeah.That’s why I often mention fighting games as an example that is easy to
understand. There are about 12–16 characters, and you need to be able to distinguish
between them all. And we characterize them in an easily comprehensible way as either
small agile characters,big assault characters,main characters,female characters,etc.So,for
example,we make characters that punch with studded gloves,have spiked bracelets,carry
a Buddhist rosary made with huge beads,or have a giant sword,and they are easily recog-
nizable by just their silhouette. When listening to presentations given by overseas game
designers,I often felt that,compared to Japan,the special qualities of their characters,like
where they are from,personality,special skill,if they were a women,etc.,were very weak.*
But lately, realism has become mainstream for games. For example, you can’t make a
very distinctive character silhouette for a game like Metal Gear Solid 3 (Konami 2004).
When we are dealing with something like that in Japan, we describe the character’s pro-
file in greater detail. So you might have this really powerful soldier who is afraid of mice,
or a really beautiful, smart, first-rate female officer, but she is horrible at cooking.We help
players empathize with the characters by adding things to their profile, even if it has
nothing to do with the game’s content.This seems to work.
In contrast to this, the setup of the character profiles in overseas games is just some-
thing like,“This is the main male character, and this is his supporting female character.”
We often say that it is easier for Japanese players to empathize with the characters when
we add things to their profile and they do not just have images of the character to go by.
Tsurumi: Although the fighting game genre is no longer popular, this technique existed
before they were all the rage. From about the time of Street Fighter II, fighting games
started to have a catalogue of characters from which the player could choose. After that,
the number of characters quickly increased, and the categorization of them became
more detailed, but the characters became these things that were difficult to understand.
Only people who were in the know understood them. Profiles, which added appeal to
the characters, disappeared, and for a time it seemed like the variety of characters had
been exhausted.
Hasegawa: Compared to the time of GDC 2003, the degree of acceptance for characters
from overseas markets has started to change.The demand for images of the very typical
Japanese anime style, in both Japan and abroad, has slackened, and also there is now a
tendency to accept something closer to overseas styles.Games for children are an excep-
tion, but visually more stylish games are selling more to hard-core gamers. That is how
the game trends in Japan are changing.
But there is something I realized when I spoke with various people about the depth of
a character’s personality. In Japan, the fact that characters are a complex of symbols has
not changed. If you look at gaming magazines, especially at articles that introduce new
games and in the columns with character profiles, their favorite foods are introduced,
and the spiky hair of the characters is shown. Such a methodology is still practiced for
Japanese games no matter what.
73
*Examples of easily distinguished characters from the fighting action/videogame genre include
Street Fighter II (1991 CAPCOM),Virtua Fighter (1993~SEGA),TEKKEN (1994~NAMCO).

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Tsurumi: Japanese people enjoy things that are loaded with symbols, and because they
are accustomed to distinguishing the meaning of such symbols,they can recognize what
type of person a character is by their unusual hairstyle alone.However, when I was work-
ing on Jak II, I made several comments to American designers about the character’s hair-
style, and they said something like,“Just because he is the protagonist, it would be too
stereotypical to make his hair spiky, so let’s not go there.” Also, even if they understand
that there are several patterns of anime-type hairstyles, they cannot differentiate the
subtle nuances of the variety of character hairstyles found in Japan.Anyone in Japan of a
certain age can understand the diverse meanings of subtle differences of character hair-
styles.Especially people who like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure.
JoJo’s bizarre adventure
http://www.jojo-ova.com/
Hasegawa: In a story that I read during a Japanese lesson when I was in primary school,
there was something that really left an impression on me. I remember it quite well even
today. It mentioned how people, in their own cultural sphere, exhaustively recognize
those things that are very important to them. For example, although we have one word
for snow in Japan, an Inuit has a different word for freshly fallen snow, packed snow, and
pressed snow used for making igloos. And nomadic desert tribes have different names
for standing camels, sitting camels, a camel drinking water, and pregnant camels. But in
Japan we call them all camels and just leave it at that.On the other hand,in Japan we call
the same fish a different name based on how big it is, but in English there is only one
word for them.It is the same when expressing the senses.If you go to France you will see
that they have different ways of saying something based on its type of smell, like “the
smell of a wet dog.”In the same way, the level of sensitivity to the subtleties of a charac-
ter based on their outward appearance is different for every country, but in Japan I feel
that it is comparatively high.
We are also often surprised that American and European developers are viewing the
same characters from a completely different aspect.
When the English version of the manga Area 88 went on sale in the U.S., the eyes of
the protagonist,Kazama Shin,were colored blue on the cover.Of course,this is a mistake,
because the Kazama character is Japanese. But no matter how blue his eyes might be, if
we are told he is Japanese we just ignore the color of his eyes and recognize him as such.
However,several letters from American readers came asking,“If Kazama Shin is Japanese,
then why are his eyes blue?” If Japanese people are told that Kazama Shin is Japanese,
then they will not really care what color his eyes are.They understand that if his eyes are
blue,this is just an expressive technique.But for American readers that was a major prob-
lem.That was really interesting.

Q: Language is the ultimate symbolic system, but images also have a similar symbolic
quality. From the standpoint of someone in the movie industry, such symbols are per-
vasive only in groups that have the same cultural background. So sometimes symbols

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
related to Japanese character design are difficult to convey properly outside of Japan.
Conversely, in the U.S. market there exist many ethnic groups that have their own cul-
tural backgrounds. If we can say that there is an expressive symbol that is common to
them all, then it might be realistic expression, and that is why Hollywood CG has
evolved to be more photo-realistic.
Tsurumi: I suppose that’s right.That is why Hollywood movies are so prolific through-
out the U.S. and the world, too. For example, in Japan, Leonardo DiCaprio was once
called by the nickname Reo-sama. So if we take this into consideration, you are proba-
bly right.
Hasegawa: This may be the reason why,although there are many ardent fans of real Hol-
lywood stars in Japan, they are generally not accepted when they appear as polygon
characters in games.
Tsurumi: Do you think this would change if we made them more realistic?
Hasegawa: Only if it were more realistic.But I don’t extend this criticism to the Jean Reno
character of Onimusha 3 (CAPCOM 2004) when I say this.
Tsurumi: That character is relatively popular In Japan.
Hasegawa: That is because there was already an image of the Jean Reno actor before
the game.
Tsurumi: Of course. And for gamers, the character based on the real actor is the motiva-
tion for them to buy the game.
Hasegawa: If the polygon character is able to act very appealingly in the game,then the
fictional foreign actor may be accepted.
Tsurumi: That we cannot expect appealing acting from the characters in the Onimusha
series is evinced by the Kaneshiro Takeshi character in the first of that series.I’m joking,of
course, but Jean Reno loves Japan, and he has many fans here, so there are a lot of char-
acters that look like Jean Reno in manga and anime. Even if they hadn’t used the Jean
Reno character,his characteristic short hair,glasses,and beard,as they are in Onimusha 3,
was already well known in Japan.
Q: That is a symbol too,right?
Tsurumi: Yeah. And there are a lot of Japanese who imitate his closely shaven head,
glasses, and beard.You know that Jean Reno’s influence has been so great because it is
cool even for people in their thirties to imitate his style.
Q: The Arnold Schwarzenegger style of Terminator 2 (1991) was also popular as a
symbol.Like the combination of his sunglasses and muscular physique.
Tsurumi: There are a lot of Hollywood stars who are accepted as a signifier to the
extent that they are also imitated in manga. For example, can you envision Denzel
Washington,now?
75

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Hasegawa: I know what he looks like, of course. But like during the 2002 World Cup,
there were a lot of Japanese boys who imitated David Beckham’s hairstyle. But Denzel
Washington’s style is not one that everyone wants to imitate.
Tsurumi: Will Smith may be a better example because he has enjoyed popularity in
Japan as a black actor and comedian.
Hasegawa: It used to be Eddie Murphy.
Tsurumi: Yeah. Of course, in the U.S. there are probably many types of black actors and
comedians. But people like me, and middle-aged Japanese women who are fond of
Yong-sama (Yong Joon Bae*),can’t understand such fine categorizations at all.
Q: Yong has his character traits,too,like his glasses,scarf,and hairstyle.
Tsurumi: That’s right. And that is why film devotees say he was great in every one of his
movies.But since I am not the type who watches western films based on who appears in
them,I don’t understand the subtleties of actors and actresses.At most,I am familiar with
Angelina Jolie’s Lara Croft character.
Q: This is like the way a symbol adds meaning to a character in a game,like Ratchet’s
bushy eyebrows, for example. His eyebrows signify an animated personality to
Japanese people.
Hasegawa: That’s right.
Q: A character also gets its significance from things other than its design, such as its
voice. What I think is really interesting is when Ratchet gets hurt in the game, he
screams “Gabeen!”
Tsurumi: Not “gabeen,”“gageen!”
Q: Sorry about that.
Hasegawa: Take a good look at the subtitle of the game.In the second game,the subtitle
was “Ga-ga-ga,Ginga (Milky Way) Commandossu.”But the subtitle for the English version
was “Going commando.”
Q: The subtitle of the English version is pretty ordinary.
Hasegawa: Yeah, it is. The Japanese version emphasized the native phonetic sounds
“ga-gi-gu-ge-go,”and used this in various places.
Tsurumi: The names “Ratchet”and “Clank”are pretty awkward,too.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Q: Why do you suppose they were called Ratchet and Clank?
Hasegawa: Ratchet comes from ratchet wrench. When you turn a ratchet, it makes a
“click,click,click”sound.That is the image from which his name comes.Clank comes from
the sound of a robot or metal parts rolling around and is onomatopoeia for “ka-ching”
and “clank.”
Tsurumi: In the first game,when Ratchet and Clank meet in a spaceship for the first time,
Ratchet asks Clank,“ What is your name?”When Clank is about to reply, “Serial number—,”
their ship strikes something and Clank hits his body against something in the ship,which
produces a “clank”sound.From then on he is nicknamed “Clank.”
Hasegawa: But when we put that into the Japanese version, there were some places
that we couldn’t translate well.
Tsurumi: In the English version it is a nice play on words, but it is not funny at all in
Japanese.
Hasegawa: Since in English when something hits something else it makes a “clank”
sound.That is why he is named Clank.
Tsurumi: So it is strange that the name of the Japanese version is not Ratchet & Gachan,
which would conform with the Japanese onomatopoeia for a metal object hitting some-
thing else.
Q: The shrill “gakin”sound is only in the Japanese version,right?
Tsurumi: Of course.
Q: I felt that really strengthened the image of the Ratchet character.
Hasegawa: That’s where Tsurumi’s talent really comes through.That is what he is best at.
Tsurumi: I want to backtrack a little and mention that because Ratchet and Clank were
originally created as “Ratchet and Clank,” I had no intention of changing their names or
the title. There are many instances of when we changed the names of the protagonists
and it was a failure, but we have changed the names of the supporting characters in
Japanese versions.
Also, in Japan there is an idea that something can have a meaningless name but still
be cool. For example, when Japanese people hear the name “Gundam,” they think of
something big, heavy, and strong.* But with just the names “Ratchet”and “Clank,”some-
thing is missing. So I wanted to add some strong images using sound, especially ones
that are easy to say.
Hasegawa: At first you made quite a fuss about the lack of voiced consonants.

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Tsurumi: Yeah, yeah. So I intentionally changed the word “galactic” to “garakuchikku,”
which has a stronger impact and sounds a little silly. It is full of voiced consonants like
“ga-gi-gu-ge-go.”When we were working on Ratchet & Clank 2, we changed the English
subtitle “Going Commando” to “Ga-ga-ga! Ginga no komand ssu.” The subtitle of the
third game,“Totsugeki! Garakuchikku renj zu”(English version: Up Your Arsenal), doesn’t
have much of a speedy image to it, so in order to strengthen the image, we used a lot of
sound effects like “g n,”“gagaga,” and “gakı¯n.” So we have added a lot of onomatopoeia
throughout the game story.Using a lot of onomatopoeia adds humor to the strength.
Q: I feel that the Clank character is similar to Gonsuke in 21-Emon.
Tsurumi: It definitely is. Clank does resemble Gonsuke in 21-Emon, but I identify him
more with Korosuke from Kiteretsu Daihyakka. Korosuke is quite an arrogant character
and is different from Clank, but I try to put Clank into the frame of a Korosuke-type char-
acter. I wanted an insolent politeness from Clank and so tried to make his lines more
polite. Ultimately, halfway into the project we added the “ssu” to his lines, making them
sound a little informal. I think that is absolutely suitable to Clank. Clank was set up to be
such a character from the beginning.Although in the American version,the character is a
little more polite.

Hasegawa: Clank’s role in the game is pretty much equal to that of Ratchet. In an inter-
view about the second Ratchet & Clank, someone from Insomniac Games said they made
Ratchet & Clank like a “buddy movie.”It’s kind of like 48 Hours. So when you play the Eng-
lish version,the roles of Ratchet and Clank are quite the same.
Tsurumi: But even if they are the same in many respects, Clank does not use contrac-
tions when he speaks,by convention,because he is a robot.
Hasegawa: So instead of “I don’t”he says “I do not.”
Tsurumi: We had Clank speak like a robot from the very beginning. He is on the same
level as Ratchet,but in some ways Clank is like his butler.Since I had been thinking about
such facets of his character, I ultimately decided to add the “ssu” to the end of his lines
too.I have other special rules like that.
Of course, I think that the staff of Insomniac Games follows certain conventions
regarding a character’s speech as well, but since I grew up reading manga and watching
anime,I pretty much follow Koike Kazuo’s* methods of character design.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Q: Is the relationship between Ratchet and Clank in the American and Japanese
versions different?
Tsurumi: No, it’s the same. But their relationship seems more dynamic in the Japanese
version. When we were working on the first game, we were adjusting the translation at
the end of the game so that children, who were its main players, would understand that
sometimes Ratchet is the more dominant character,and sometimes it is Clank.Of course,
the significance of the scenarios is the same as those in the U.S. version. When we were
translating it into Japanese,we altered the nuance of the message a little.
In the beginning of the first game, Ratchet seems like he is going to just protect the
Milky Way in a casual manner, and Clank adopts an unassuming attitude toward him but
later incites him to carry out his role.Halfway through the game,Ratchet’s feeling for jus-
tice is sparked, and Clank is left behind. But in the end, the two of them reconcile, and
they are on equal footing.That is the structure of the narrative.We made it so that their
tone of speech reflected this. Who is dominant in the relationship is always shifting.
Although we say it is like a “buddy movie,”since we translated it so that their relationship
had such dynamics,they are quarrelling all through the game.
This is the part where it becomes difficult to explain this in detail.To do that we would
have to explain each line, otherwise we could not do it justice. But this is how they make
the dialogue structure of manga, and the same technique was used a lot for Dragon
Warrior* (Square-Enix 1987).They used this technique through the seventh game in that
series, but Dragon Warrior 8 (Square-Enix 2004) was like an anime version of the manga
Dragon Ball. I don’t find that to be very interesting.
Dragon Warrior 8
http://www.square-enix.co.jp/dragonquest/eight/
Hasegawa: Incidentally,what Tsurumi has explained thus far became more important as
the game systems evolved. At the time of the first PlayStation, the mouths of characters
moved with a fixed timing, but when PlayStation 2 came out, the character models were
more refined, and when the characters spoke, their mouths were synchronized with the
English dialogue. So with PlayStation all we had to do was translate the lines and adjust
the timing. But with PlayStation 2, some complicated methods for this came about. For
example, when a line in the English script ended with an “a”sound, the Japanese version
had to as well.Tsurumi went through three or four processes when translating their dia-
logue. First there was the direct translation, then a version with some characters added,
and finally it had to be made to match the movement of the model’s lips.All throughout
this process he immerses himself in the mind of the character, and starts mumbling to
himself at about two o’clock in the morning while he is working on it.
Tsurumi: I don’t mumble;I blab in a loud voice.
Hasegawa: And wanders all around the office.

nal writer of manga, and had studied in Koike Kazuo’s cram school (where a person goes after
regular school hours to get really good at a subject) before starting to develop videogames.

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Q: Isn’t it a little discomforting for Japanese players when the Japanese script does
not clearly correspond with the movement of the character’s mouth?
Tsurumi: Since I am pretty good at that, I try to get it right no matter how hard it might
prove to be. But in the case of Japanese production companies that do not have those
skills, if they want to do it without cutting corners, the fastest way is to remake the char-
acter’s facial animation.
Hasegawa: Of course,this is a time-consuming and labor-demanding process.
Tsurumi: In Ratchet & Clank 3 there is a robot named Courtney Gears, which is a parody
of Britney Spears,and there is a scene in the game where she sings a song.For that scene
I wrote Japanese lyrics with pretty much the same meaning as the original and matched
the movements of the model’s mouth.I am rather proud of that.
Q: The facial expressions in Ratchet & Clank are basically made to correspond with
the English script, but it’s translated so that it seems natural in the Japanese version.
Hasegawa: It’s like it’s infused with a spirit that transcends the level of simple translation
and localization.You should emphasize that point a little more.
Tsurumi: No,I would rather the fact that,even on a global scale,the level of the Japanese
voice actors was quite high. Their technique is the best in the world. When they make
animations in the U.S., they use the prerecording style by which they first have the voice
actors perform the script, and then they make the animation to match the voice track.
They usually do this for American game movies too. But in Japan the post-recording
method is preferred, by which they make the film first and lay down the audio track to
match the film second.So if you write a good script,they will bring the character properly
to life. Actually, we only use talented voice actors; we don’t choose them based on their
popularity.
Hasegawa: While we’re on the subject,I should mention that the localization of the Eng-
lish version of Spirited Away was very well done. Miyazaki was very careful about that. It
was done extremely well.I was impressed.
Tsurumi: I watch both the subtitled and dubbed versions of overseas films, but English
versions of Japanese films are something I never paid attention to before.
Hasegawa: They’re worth seeing.
Tsurumi: A contrary example is the Japanese version of Treasure Planet (2002).That was
well done too.But to be honest, it wasn’t put together very well.In the Japanese version,
however, the voice actors added some flavor to the standard characters, and the script
and mouth movements matched perfectly. In Shrek (2001), for example, Yamadera 
K
ichi’s voice of Shrek was superb.He is a pro among pros.
Hasegawa: That is why his earnings are so high.
Tsurumi:What was also better than I expected was Kuroki Hitomi’s voice of Mrs.Incredible.
o

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Q: She is a famous Japanese actress and has little experience as a voice actress, but
her performance was wonderful.
Hasegawa: Casting Kuroki Hitomi was well received because originally the main charac-
ter of The Incredibles was really Mrs.Incredible.
Q: In games made for Japan it is normal practice to dub boy characters with voice
actresses,right?
Hasegawa: Yep. And when we mention this to overseas developing teams, they
understand.
Tsurumi: It is the same as the eyebrows we mentioned before, or some other part of a
character we want to emphasize; we need to come to a consensus between the Japan-
ese and American teams about the basics of what kind of character we want to make,
meaning that in Japan the design of the character must be different in order for it to
have the same significance.
Q: On the other hand, even if you look at characters with a similar design, Japanese
and American players will experience something different.
Tsurumi: That’s right.
Q: Please tell me briefly about the workflow of character design. If a new game proj-
ect is initiated in the U.S. with the assumption that it will go on sale in Japan, what
kind of steps do you take to make the character?
Tsurumi: First, we list the ideas of what kinds of characters we want to make and
consider the plot of the game’s story and any characters that may be necessary.
These are the first two things that we do. Next, someone mentions any ideas they
have about a character. Based on that, an artist begins to sketch a rough design of
the character.
Q: Do you do this with both the Japanese and American developers present?
Hasegawa: There are a lot of production companies in the world, and what is fortu-
nate about our position is that we can participate together on a project from the very
beginning. Generally, the localization process begins when a Japanese company gives
the OK to a beta version of a game that an overseas production company has made or
to one of their games already on the market. However, in our case, we can participate
in game development when a project only exists on paper.That is why, as Tsurumi said,
we can also propose to U.S. developers those elements that we think are necessary for
a character’s personality and their role in a game. These days, Japanese, American,
European, and recently Korean producers, too, all gather at the same table to discuss
the development of a game.The fact that we are able to do that is testament, I think, to
how fortunate we probably are among game developers throughout the world.
81

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Tsurumi: I think that other companies are doing that, too, because Naughty Dog used
the same methods when they made Crash Bandicoot seven or eight years ago after we
mentioned it to them.
Hasegawa: But to what extent are other companies doing it?
Tsurumi: They are doing it to some degree.
Q: Nintendo may have done that when they made Metroid Prime (2002).
Tsurumi: Oh, that’s right.The rookie studio that made Metroid Prime, Retro Studios, was
a company composed of American developers who wanted to make a Metroid game.
Q: An example from some time ago is Donkey Kong Country (Nintendo 1994), which
was developed by the English company Rare. But I don’t know much about how they
made it.
Tsurumi: Didn’t Nintendo just supervise the character development for that project?
Q: That might be right.
Tsurumi: Going back to our previous topic, presentations on character design are given
by development companies to producers at SCEJ, SCEA, SCEE, and SCEK*, and then the
producers discuss the contents of the presentation. This is the relationship between
production companies and publishers. People get together from different regions to
evaluate ideas and discuss the necessary elements of a character’s design for each
region so that the game can be sold in Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Korea. The pro-
duction company then puts together the contents of this review session and comes
up with a second design proposal after adjusting the conflicting elements for each
region. We do this again and again until we come up with the final design of the char-
acter. I think this process is very typical. So I think that the method itself is possible for
any company.
But I don’t know if the reason that there are only a few character designs originally
produced in the U.S. that are accepted by the Japanese market is because they are not
very good at doing this, or if it is because they are not experienced at it. But this is how
we have been doing things for the past seven or eight years.
Q: So in the very beginning, an American designer draws a rough sketch based on
the specifications of a character you write up.
Tsurumi: Yes.They draw page after page.That is why the initial proposal is so necessary.
The character artist draws several pages based on our suggestions. His or her drawings
are then digitized and passed around on the Internet.

3.4
INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
But this is what the production company has to pay attention to. If they incorporate
the various suggestions from each region,and modify the rough sketches by a process of
elimination, the character will be a little ordinary; or if they try to include everything, the
character will be a disaster. Ultimately, the character artist listens to the requests of each
region, and must understand the basic significance of their demands.That is why I send
manga to them as reference materials,so they understand what we want.The Europeans
are good at letting us know the types they prefer,too.
Q: So does the staff member who ultimately puts together the character design,like the
character artist for Ratchet & Clank at Insomniac Games, have that kind of authority?
Tsurumi: No,SCEA has the authority to approve character designs.
Q: But the person who actually draws them by hand is the character artist at Insom-
niac Games, right? So it is necessary for that person to put together the requests
for signature traits into a character’s design for each region. For example, there are
various ways to adjust Ratchet’s eyebrows to make them thicker, so it is necessary to
have a good understanding of that sense.There must be a lot of demand placed on the
skill of a character artist.
Hasegawa: That is,without a doubt,true.
Tsurumi: If those sorts of signification elements have been included, we can still make
different illustrations for the Japanese version. That is why we said that if the character
had eyebrows, it would have been fine if they had been drawn to a minimum, or if they
included stripes on his body we could have modified the details of the texture in Japan.
Hasegawa: This [Ratchet & Clank 3 CG (Computer Graphics) manual] is essentially an
overseas illustration, but only the eyebrows have been altered for the Japanese version.
Conversely,the image on the packaging was independently created in Japan.
Q: Other than the heroine, the supporting characters are very American. Weren’t
there any other changes?
Tsurumi: Yeah.The supporting characters haven’t been changed very much.To be hon-
est,other than the protagonist,they were fine as they were.The supporting characters in
the American version were just fine for Japan. There are some characters among them
that seem a little weird for Japanese people.The Scrunch character in Ratchet & Clank 3 is
a case in point. But other than the protagonist, the other characters were fine. Of course
the heroine was important too,but the Captain Sarsha character in Ratchet & Clank 3 was
not very appealing for a heroine.
To be sure, it is necessary to consider the age bracket of a game’s main players. If
Ratchet & Clank had been a game meant for teenagers,we would have had to have made
the heroine more stimulating for them.In Japanese games for teenagers the heroines all
have something erotic or sexy about them these days. Of course, we make it very subtle.
But since Ratchet & Clank is not a game for teenagers in Japan, we didn’t consider
such alterations.
83

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Q: Is the target age group the same in the other regions?
Tsurumi: They are slightly different. Ratchet & Clank has a different rating depending on
the region.In Japan it’s for all ages,but in the U.S.it was rated “teen.”*
Q: Why was it rated “teen”?
Hasegawa: It must be because the hero carries a realistic gun. Also, the marketing
approach of SCEA and SCEE is that if there is an E symbol on the packaging, it will be
regarded as a game for children. And teenagers won’t even touch those games. That is
why in order for the game to have a cool image they wanted to give it a teen rating.The
dialogue of the characters in the English version is also somewhat adult in nature. In the
U.S.,stores like Toys “R”Us and Wal-Mart would not accept advertisement material featur-
ing Ratchet equipped with a gun.This was fundamentally out of the question for general
circulation. Also, the game had to be displayed on the upper shelves because children
might pick it up and look at it.But that is also why SCEA and SCEE went ahead and rated
it “teen”for marketing reasons.
But because Ratchet & Clank is such a great game, anyone could enjoy it if they give it
a try.Even little boys could enjoy it if it was their older brother who purchased the game.
So we made the content and images so that even high-school students would be satis-
fied if they played the game.
On the other hand, since the people who play this type of game in Japan are at best
younger players,we made the game for all ages.Fortunately,we are tolerant of images of
guns in Japan. Also we translated the dialogue scenes so that even a child could under-
stand them and feel safe playing the game. There was no bloodshed in the game from
the beginning anyway.
When Jak and Daxter came out, the original design of the overseas version was very
cool,but Ratchet & Clank worked better for us.Although in Japan Jak and Daxter was sold
to primary-school students, when the second of that series came out, the content was
too mature,and there were a number of differences from our marketing strategy for chil-
dren. That is why we didn’t sell many in Japan. We couldn’t attract players from all age
groups by just localizing the game.
Tsurumi: To go back to our original discussion, this is an example of why children are
more receptive to character design.The number of children who could identify with the
characters in the first Jak and Daxter was high, but they didn’t really strike a chord with
84
*The rating system for the U.S. includes EC (early childhood, ages three and over), E (everyone,
six and over), T (teen, 13 and over), M (mature, 17 and over), and AO (adults only, 19 and over).
When a game is introduced before its release without a rating, it is labeled RP (rating pending).
Ratings are assigned by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).
In Japan, the rating systems for console and computer games are different. Console game ratings
include “everyone,” “12 and over,” “15 and over,” and “18 and over.” Their ratings are assigned
by the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO). For computer games there are two
ratings, “18 and over” and “15 and over.” The ratings are assigned by the Ethics Organization of
Computer Software (EOCS).

players in their early teens and older. On the other hand, when the second game came
out, even though we were not disregarding children, because the game content was a
little more mature,we marketed it to players in their early teens and older,but our efforts
did not bear much fruit.
Hasegawa: The content of Jak and Daxter 2 received very favorable ratings. Some game
enthusiasts bought it on a hunch and really enjoyed it. But even they said it would not
sell well to most gamers. We got a lot of candid advice written on some Internet BBS
(Bulletin board system) sites.It was a fine product,but SCEJ didn’t market it properly.
Tsurumi: I have some ideas for Jak and Daxter 2, but ultimately there is nothing I can do.
But if I had done some passable design work for the characters in Jak and Daxter. . . .
Sorry, this is my own opinion, but for me all of the characters in Japanese RPGs (role-
playing games) look so much alike now that I can’t tell them apart. Maybe my thinking
is just old fashioned, but I really don’t get it. Even when I look at the images in Radiata
Stories (Square-Enix 2005),it looks just like the other games.Because I read a lot of manga,
I can differentiate the Tales series (Namco 1996) from the others, but . . . . [The character
designer for the PS2 version of the Tales series is the illustrator Inomata Mutsumi.]
Radiata Stories

Conversely, even if we had hired a popular Japanese character designer and assigned
him to Jak and Daxter, I probably wouldn’t have been able to feel any affection for them.
But it may have sold better. Also, if we had used photo-realistic characters like those in
Onimusha 3 for that system,it might have sold itself.
Hasegawa: On the other hand, when we enter the era of the PlayStation 3, our job is
probably going to get a lot more difficult than it is now. If it were a character like Crash
Bandicoot for the first PlayStation, even if we didn’t alter the character in the game at all,
and only changed the package illustration and text, there are some things we could
leave to the player to imagine by themselves because the visual animation for the first
PlayStation was limited. When it becomes possible to make even more photo-realistic
animation, then we will have to express this with only an image. That is why when
PlayStation 3 comes out, superficial changes like those we did for Ratchet & Clank 3, like
just altering his eyebrows to make them a little thicker, will become impossible.We may
have to make a different polygon model of just a character’s head for the Japanese,
American,European,and Korean markets.
Q: Do you mean to say that while the protagonist is important, the most important
thing about him or her is their head?
Tsurumi: No,it’s not just their head,but artistic style as a whole that is important.
Hasegawa: But when character visuals are run in game magazines, readers will wonder
“What is this supposed to be,”and they will hesitate to buy it.
85

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Tsurumi: It is better for them to think that it is a passable design than wonder what the
character is supposed to be. I’m only talking about artistic style. Even if the character has
a passable design, there is a technique by which we have the character carry a weapon
with an unconventional design, which makes the character distinguishable from others.
I should mention Square-Enix as an example here. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw
Final Fantasy X. The character is realistic and beautiful, wears a very revealing costume,
and carries a cane with an unusual design. It is an amazing character design. It was mar-
keted wonderfully and is technically superb.I have no complaints about it.But I am still a
little puzzled. Fortunately, however, it includes everything necessary for the Japanese
market and those overseas.Everything harmonizes very well.
Q: I have always thought that for the character designs of the Final Fantasy series,
the protagonists have all had a Japanese pop idol motif,and the heroines have been
based on female celebrities popular at the time. In short, I have thought that the
design of the Final Fantasy characters was purely for the Japanese market, but actu-
ally a lot of elements were used that made them popular overseas,too.
Tsurumi: That’s right.They have a lot of different things to them.
Hasegawa: That’s not a very typical anime style,so if an American player sees the charac-
ters,they are able to appreciate them fully.
Tsurumi: Japanese female faces are well received in the U.S. It’s a realistic CG character,
but she wears somewhat oriental, skimpy clothing. The sexy elements of the character
are quite understated,but they are there.That was done in great taste.
Q: Going back to our discussion on gamer demographics, whether the character
design of a game is culturally acceptable is closely related to the game’s marketabil-
ity. So in the U.S., they rate games higher than they do in Japan, and in Japan you
make games for primary school students that easily become popular among older
and younger generations,like for middle- and high-school students?
Hasegawa: I don’t know about the older generations, but they do pick up a following
easily among the younger players. Like I said before, we can think about this being like a
little boy trying to raise himself up to the adult world. American gamers in their 20s and
30s probably gather information themselves more than they do in Japan and have a ten-
dency to judge a game’s marketability by this information. They might think,“I want to
play a fighting game, so what is the best fighter on the market now?”I have the impres-
sion that they buy games after investigating them thoroughly in game magazines and
on the Internet. Compared to that, in the Japanese market at present, the public image
has a very strong influence on game sales.There are many gamers who comment on the
contents of a game without ever having played them.
Tsurumi: There are people like that in America too.
Hasegawa: Of course there are,but no matter how I look at it,I feel that their gut feeling
for choosing a game comes from having evaluated games after playing them themselves
86

3.4
INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
or from their own personal tastes.Japanese gamers these days are not very judgmental,I
think.A lot of them buy games based on their impressions from a game’s television com-
mercial.Of course they also pay attention to reviews on the Internet, but in spite of what
they say, I think there are a lot of examples of people who make comments without ever
having played a game. There are a lot of users who play games with just a superficial
knowledge of its content.
So I think the range of gamers who actually play a game are probably primary and
middle-school students.
Q: A minute ago we talked about how gamers in different countries get a different
impression even if they see the same thing, so in order to give the same impression to
the users it is necessary to use different forms of expression. You may be able to say
the same thing about color. That is what I feel about the color of Nintendo’s logo. In
Japan, the Nintendo logo is written with red letters on a white background, but in the
U.S. it is written with red letters on a black background. I felt that the difference
between the combination of red and white compared to the black and red indicated
something about the differences between the target groups in both countries.
Hasegawa: I see.
Tsurumi: Compared to Ratchet & Clank, the color usage for Monkey Mania (SCE 2000) has
a lot of primary colors. But in order to make the explosion effects realistic in Ratchet &
Clank, the background is made to look more realistic and has darker,toned-down images.
Unlike Japanese designers, their level designers seem to want to make levels with toned-
down color schemes,but in Japan we get requests from various offices asking us to please
make the background more colorful.That is pretty much what happens.But if we do that,
we will be concerned that players might not be able to appreciate the explosion effects.
The result is that we can’t alter it at all because we have this apprehension that the overall
enjoyment they will get from playing the game will be weaker,even when we localize the
game.The significance of color usage in the U.S.and Japan is that different.
Q: The use of colors for characters in American games is distinctive.They have a ten-
dency to tone down the colors more than what you see in Japanese games.
Hasegawa: In Japan we have a tendency to use a lot of primary and pastel colors, but
they don’t use a lot of them for their characters.
Tsurumi: Also,American production companies use a different approach when they create
images,like making Ratchet’s body hair realistic.So for the Japanese version of the charac-
ter, we toned down his realistic hair a little when we localized the game.But we can’t alter
the color at all for Japan because it is possible that it will change the game’s marketability.
Another example of how an alteration may change a game’s marketability is adjusting
its difficulty level. (When a game is localized for Japan, it is normal to lower the difficulty
level by making the game easier.) Like with the first Tomb Raider game (Eidos 1996),
the difficulty adjustments were not very good. In a certain stage, the map mechanism
was changed too much, and the original feeling of a challenge was weakened. And
87

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
mechanisms that were too difficult on other levels weren’t changed. When we make
changes like this, we use test players to see how the game will do with our intended
users because it is necessary to find out whether or not our alterations of the difficulty
levels are reasonable. Even for levels that seem difficult at a glance, we consider whether
or not we can handle changing the way hints are provided in the game or if we need to
alter the system.For example,with Ratchet & Clank we can think about how,when a char-
acter collects bolts, it gains experience points and his ability level increases. So we deter-
mine what modifications will work based on the results of our focus tests. Only after we
make sure that our alterations won’t harm the best possible marketability of a game that
was made by an American production company can we move on to the next step,which
is changing the difficulty level for Japan.
But we don’t have any way of determining whether or not a game’s marketability will
definitely change if we alter the visuals.
Hasegawa: We just wait for reactions from gamers after a game goes on sale.
Q: So while you are able to conduct a focus test to try out a character, it is difficult to
test the overall visual design and coloration.
Tsurumi: That’s right. Even if we considered changing the overall color scheme and con-
trasts to make the images more attractive, it’s pointless if the visual appeal of the explo-
sion effects is reduced as a result.
Q: So it’s difficult to analyze in detail the reaction of gamers.
Tsurumi: Yes. So we give American production companies some suggestions, but ulti-
mately we leave the decision to them.To be sure, we are still told by the SCEJ marketing
department how they think the game could be better.
Actually it is difficult to make the explosion effects realistic if we use a lot of primary
colors for a game’s background. It is also a matter of whether or not we want the explo-
sion effects to be like a cartoon or more realistic. I think that even when looking at other
games.
Q: We talked about how when the performance and resolution of game systems gets
better, game localization will become more difficult. Does that mean that it was eas-
ier before?
Tsurumi: It was because explosion effects were drawn as just 2D pixel images. But that
doesn’t mean that every game will be realistic when PlayStation 3 comes out. Explosion
effects are just one type of artistic style. When we choose to make the way we depict
things like explosions and structural damage realistic, the overall color scheme of the
game environment will be decided.Actually,the Ratchet & Clank for the PlayStation 2 was
a case like this.
Of course, I suppose when PlayStation 3 comes out, the overall color scheme for
games that we choose to use realistic explosions will be difficult. But if we choose to use
a cartoon style to depict explosions,it probably won’t matter much.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Hasegawa: When PlayStation 3 goes on sale,the physics engine that is used in Half-Life 2
(Valve 2004) will probably be programmed into a lot of other games. For example, sup-
pose there is a scene in the game with a wall made of bricks, and each brick has been
programmed for a collision. Every time the wall is broken, the way they come apart will
be different. This technique is representative of that. Overseas programmers will proba-
bly love using a physics engine to calculate the physics for such things. But it doesn’t
really matter to me.If they you are going to take that much time on how bricks react to a
collision, I would rather they look after some of the other places. That sort of thing is
going to start coming up more and more.
Q: It’s a question of priorities.
Tsurumi: The choice of what you will focus on for a game design becomes more impor-
tant as the potential of game systems increases. While the production company itself
gets advice from various offices about projects, they need to have a certain taste and
sense of balance so that they can claim what is important, like what they need to
express;otherwise the game won’t have an identity.
Hasegawa: Seven or eight years ago, the technical term “Ik” got a lot of attention.
This technology programmed a character’s ankles to adjust automatically to the slope
of the ground and positioned their feet accordingly. At the time I didn’t understand
what was so great about that technology at all. To be sure, I thought that technologi-
cally it was great, but if they were going to be so particular about that, I would have
preferred that they pay attention to some other things. Originally there were a lot of
anime with characters walking like they were sliding across the floor.That was the case,
for example, for what is said to be an anime popular all over Japan, Sazae-san (1969).
Once we were told that when a character looks like it is sliding over the floor, or may
be floating in the air, it means that the character is walking in that animation, we
would recognize it as such. Without being aware of it, we try not to notice it by not
acknowledging it.
Sazae-san
http://www.fujitv.co.jp/b_hp/sazaesan/
I couldn’t believe it when it became popular in the Japanese game industry to insist
that it was important for the soles of the feet to adjust to changes of the ground’s slope
in a game. However, they were saying that there was no other technique for the
programmers to really show their skill.
To mention a similar example, in a scene where several stones come rolling down a
hill, when the stones hit each other, they will have been programmed using physics to
collide differently every time. I understand why programmers love to use that sort of
technique.But when I saw it,I wasn’t that impressed.
Tsurumi: There are some differing opinions about that.When I was making 2D side-scroll
action games about twenty years ago, I had thought that if we didn’t do something
about a character’s feet looking like they were sliding over the floor, the expressive tech-
niques of the whole game industry wouldn’t improve. Maybe at that time production
89

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
companies all over the world were making detailed alterations to the scrolling map one
pixel at a time,which also contributed to the advance of the industry.
Hasegawa: It’s not like I was saying that sort of challenge wasn’t necessary.
Tsurumi:Yeah.It’s a matter of focus.
Hasegawa: Since the level of a game console’s expression was so limited a while back,
we just focused on a few parts of the game.But when PlayStation 3 comes out, since the
range of what we will be able to do will go up even more,we will have to pour a lot more
energy into everything than we do now.That is why we will need to focus all the more.To
give an extreme example, even if the puppeteers and stagehands who wear all-black
garb for the Japanese stage and puppet theaters are seen by the audience, the viewers
know that they are supposed to ignore them. In the same way, even if the feet look like
they are sliding,it’s best to just think of it as walking.
Tsurumi: A long time ago,Sega made a game called Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker (Sega
1990). In order to emphasize Michael’s moonwalk, we were told by the designer that his
feet couldn’t slide when he is walking normally. That’s for sure. The designer said the
same thing to the programmer.And the programmer consented.
Hasegawa: That’s right.
Tsurumi: It’s a question of what you focus on when your resources are so limited.When I
am playing a game like Dragon Warrior 8, I don’t pay attention to whether or not the
character’s feet are sliding anymore.But I used to.
Q: So, in the days of 8-bit games, the fact that the characters in Super Mario Bros.
and the blocks in Tetris, though I don’t know if I can call a block a character, were
accepted by the world market was because it was an abstract form of expression.
Tsurumi: That’s right.
Q: And with PlayStation and PlayStation 2, the expressive potential of game con-
soles improved, and when the third console comes out, it will be difficult to design a
game character that will be accepted all over the world, because characters will be
more realistic?
Hasegawa and Tsurumi: Exactly.
Tsurumi: I would be happy if there were some sort of definitive methodology, but
compared to the days of 8-bit games, the business of being able to establish a character
franchise is going to be more and more profitable.
Hasegawa: I think that we will breathe new life into the appeal of today’s game characters
for the next-generation systems when they first come out, but there may be characters
that absolutely cannot be created with today’s 2D anime-like techniques.
Tsurumi: Characters that can’t be made with 2D anime techniques?
90

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Hasegawa: Characters whose appeal will be represented by high-resolution 3D tech-
niques for the first time.
Tsurumi: Like Mrs.Incredible?
Hasegawa: Well,something like that.
Personally,like I said before,I think the more photo-realistic game characters become,
the more difficult the task of localizing a game will be.
Q: Incidentally, there are a lot of game characters that are created in Japan but are
popular all over the world. Are there any characters that were created overseas and
are popular in Japan as well?
Hasegawa: Just Crash Bandicoot. That character is the only one made by an overseas
production company to sell more than a million titles in Japan.
Tsurumi: There wasn’t another one?
Hasegawa: No. Crash Bandicoot is the only one that was popular in Japan. Ratchet &
Clank is doing pretty well,but its peak sales have only reached about five hundred thou-
sand titles.
Q: The Crash Bandicoot series is still being made by a different publisher,but what is
the demand for that series?
Tsurumi: I only know about the title when the publisher was SCE. Roughly speaking, the
sales figures for that game in Japan are Crash Bandicoot, 1 million; Crash Bandicoot 2, 1.5
million, Crash Bandicoot 3:Warped, 1.5 million; Crash Team Racing five hundred thousand;
and Crash Bash, three hundred thousand.
Q: When the first Crash Bandicoot went on sale, a lot of Japanese gamers, including
myself,mistook it for a Japanese game.
Tsurumi: That’s because we made it so that you would think that [laughs].
Hasegawa: Naughty Dog, which made Crash Bandicoot, really respected Japanese
game development and was eagerly researching our game designs. Their efforts
paid off.
Tsurumi: And Mark Cerny was first rate.
Q: It has often been said lately that if you sell the same game, images in the
game, including the characters, designed with the target market in mind sell better.
That is one reason why Japanese games are no longer selling very well in the U.S.
The game itself is interesting, but for them the images aren’t “cool” enough. So
when you discuss this problem, I imagine that you talk about what is “cool” for an
American audience.
Tsurumi: Like Viewtiful Joe (Capcom 2003)?
91

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Q: Indeed [laughs].
Tsurumi: Viewtiful Joe 1 was well received in the U.S.,but I haven’t heard much about the
second,in the U.S.or Japan [laughs].
Q: What did Naughty Dog respect about Japanese games? Was it character design,
game design,or both?
Hasegawa: I think that was different for each game.
Q: What about the first Crash Bandicoot? When they were making the first game,
what kind of things were they trying to learn from Japanese games?
Tsurumi: They put great importance on the opinions of the Japanese team when they
were at the development stage, and when they developed the game, Naughty Dog and
Mark Cerny were researching the enjoyment of a game for its particular console and how
to make such games on their own.They learned a lot while they were doing this.So what
they respected about Japanese games was their game design.
Hasegawa: For example, the settings for a game’s learning curve or how you teach a
player how to control a character and what it can do in a game.
Tsurumi: Actually, since the first Crash Bandicoot still had some shortcomings, we made
the second one perfect.
Q: Were there any reflections of suggestions you received from producers in differ-
ent countries regarding character design?
Tsurumi:With the first game we didn’t have that kind of system yet.The system for making
such character designs was refined as we worked on the series.When we were working on
the first game,the graphics of the first PlayStation were a little cheap,so we endeavored to
have players supplement the image of the character other than what appeared on the
screen.For example,for promotional uses we made a Crash Bandicoot costume,and when
we illustrated the packaging,we added some “Japanese”elements to the character design.
So it’s possible that there may have been some difference between the Crash Bandicoot
character in the game and the one we presented to the Japanese public.
But when the second game was in development, Naughty Dog adopted elements of
character design popular in the Japanese market and tried to incorporate them into the
game from the very beginning.For example,having Crash Bandicoot dance,having Coco
Bandicoot, Crash’s little sister, appear in the game for the first time, stuff like that. Of
course, elements acceptable to markets other than Japan were adopted for the second
game as well.So the development process matured as we worked on the series.
Hasegawa: I think that is probably because our localization process itself has come a
long way since the Crash Bandicoot series.
Tsurumi: A while ago I mentioned that from the early stages of developing the charac-
ters for Ratchet & Clank, producers from different regions assembled to discuss character
92

3.4
INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
design issues. This, too, was done as we worked on the Crash Bandicoot series. Because
the producers who assemble together from SCEJ,SCEA,and SCEE haven’t changed much
since then, they have been cooperating and sharing knowledge as a matter of course.
And it was through such a process that we developed Ratchet & Clank.
When I think about it now, Crash Bandicoot involved a lot of trial and error. I often
made international calls to the U.S.in the middle of the night.
Q: So when the first game in that series came out,the hardware was not as good as it
is now, but you had the option to expand things other than the visuals in the game.
Tsurumi: There was that, and also from the very beginning the Crash Bandicoot charac-
ter was one that had stimulated interest, and it was already a suitable subject for the
Japanese market.So I guess both worked well for us.
Q: In your presentation data for your lecture at GDC 2003, you had some materials
about the changes made to the character designs in Sly 2: Band of Thieves.
Hasegawa: That’s right.
Q: First you get a proposal of rough designs from the American team, then a design
is proposed by the Japanese team,and finally a decision is made.
Hasegawa: That’s right.
Q: What is the process after a character design has been decided?
Hasegawa: Once a character design is finalized, we move on to making the actual poly-
gon model.Actually,both are done at the same time.If alterations are added to the char-
acter design,we make them to the polygon model as well.
Q: Do you alter the polygon model itself to suit each market?
Hasegawa: Not for Sly 2. For the Japanese version of Ratchet & Clank we made detailed
alterations like changing the character’s eye color and texture. But, we didn’t modify the
original polygon model of the character.
Tsurumi: When you change the polygon model of a character,it affects the way the char-
acter appears in the movie sections of the game in various ways. Due to production
deadlines,we don’t take it that far.
Q: But since you were changing the textures of the character in Ratchet & Clank, the
Ratchet who appears in the movie parts is different in the U.S. and Japan. That
means different movie files had to be made for Japan and the U.S.
Tsurumi: That’s right.In other words,if we make a different movie file,change the texture
of the CG image for advertisements, and have other visual materials, we can assume that
Japanese users will put all of these elements together and envision their own Ratchet
93

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
character. So changing only the texture will suffice, even if we don’t alter the polygon
model.
So for now, if we can’t adjust a character’s image for Japan by just changing the
texture,it’s more efficient to just rethink the character design itself.
Q: So, we mentioned this before, but do you think it will be possible to make region-
specific character polygon models for the next generation game consoles from the
get-go?
Tsurumi: That’s possible. But it will actually depend on production costs and time. And it
will also be necessary to think about the additional processes that make it possible to
modify the character model for each region whenever we are working on the movie data.
Q: So, to go back to the beginning, when you are thinking about making a character
that will be accepted all over the world, you all have to work hard at it from the very
start.
Hasegawa and Tsurumi: That’s right.
Hasegawa: I think that principle will never change.
Tsurumi: Other than that,what is important is if a production company can make a char-
acter with an appealing identity, while taking the initiative to design that character by
incorporating the requests of each region.And the publishers from different regions can
verify if the resulting character will be appealing in their respective countries.
Ultimately it’s the production company that designs a character.And it’s also a matter
of how the publishers verify the potential of a character design for their own countries.If
they find a problem, it should be solved. To be more specific, I think it will become a
pretty ordinary task to debate with people who propose character design problems. But
when it comes to problems regarding character design as a field of art, since there are a
lot of elements that depend on personal taste, it is truly difficult to design a character
objectively.So for now it is still difficult to work out these problems.I hope this interview
can help this matter in some way.
Q: Understanding and creating are two different things. The most important thing
for a production company is a good sense of a character designer’s creativity.
Tsurumi: That’s right. And to go back to our original discussion, that is why we always
send a large quantity of manga and anime for reference purposes. So we tell them, for
example,“This is a great manga, so take a look at it.” And we might also attach a memo
that says something like,“The artwork in this manga is good for such-and-such a reason.”
We even regularly send stuff that has no direct relationship with the project we are
currently working on.
Hasegawa: When we were working on Sly 2, we showed a DVD of The Castle of Cagliostro
(1979) to the whole staff of the American production company so that they would
understand the details of a certain taste we were hoping to capture.
94

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
The Castle of Cagliostro
http://anime.goo.ne.jp/dvd/detail/D110488116.html
Tsurumi: The head of the art design team for Sly 2 loved that sort of manga and anime.
Hasegawa: That guy was originally not from the gaming industry but worked on Spider-
Man for Marvel Comics. It was easy to talk with him about matters of creativity since he
himself was a comic-book artist.He was an amazing artist.
Q: The directors of The Matrix (1999), the Wachowski brothers, are big fans of
anime. And in Japan, among people who are sensitive to trends, fans of the artwork
in American comics,like Marvel and DC,are increasing.Compared to five or six years
ago is, has there been any progress regarding a mutual understanding of creativity
between Japanese and American creators?
Tsurumi: It is difficult to come up with a consensus about that because it’s different for
each creator.
Hasegawa: Other than the creator, the range of market acceptance among consumers
in the U.S. and Japan will, for example, suddenly increase simultaneously with the
release of some outstanding product. The way it increases is not in a straight line
but escalating.
For example, the 2 Channel* BBS (bulletin board system) and its jargon was liked by
only a portion of its users for a long time in Japan, but now that sort of slang is some-
times being used for the titles of articles in fashion magazines for young girls and the
like. This happened when Train Man, which began as an entry on 2 Channel, got atten-
tion from the general public and became a bestseller. When that happened, the degree
of acceptance for 2 Channel among the general public increased.
Didn’t the range of acceptance in the Japanese market for overseas character
designs increase around the time of Crash Bandicoot? If a strong title or something
comes out some time later, the range of a Japanese player’s degree of acceptance will
probably go up.
Tsurumi: If only the X-Box had sold more in Japan, the design of the protagonist in Halo
(Microsoft 2000),Master Chief,would have been more popular!
Q: What about Grand Theft Auto 3 (Rockstar 2003)?
Tsurumi: The Japanese version sold about three to four hundred thousand copies.About
the same as Grand Theft Auto:Vice City.There are still some limitations.
Hasegawa: Other than the game, they also sell a soundtrack of Vice City. The soundtrack
is perfect for people like us, who grew up in the generation that watched Best Hit USA.
(Best Hit USA was a popular television program in Japan in the late 80s,which introduced
the trendiest pop music in the U.S.)

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
Tsurumi: Since I am a generation above them,I still don’t think I want to play the newest
Grand Theft Auto game, GTA 3: San Andreas, even when I hear good reviews of the game.
Hasegawa: But GTA 3 has some violent scenes,so in Japan it never became a mainstream
game.It’s a game for hard-core gamers,and normally fathers with children won’t buy it.
Q: There is a character named Snoopy, for example. Snoopy is a character in the
Peanuts cartoon, but, interestingly, not much is known about Peanuts in Japan.
Snoopy is loved by a lot of people in Japan because the design of the character is
cute. Are there no such cases of this phenomenon with games? Not overseas games,
but just their characters?
Tsurumi: That makes me think of Toro* [laughs]!
Hasegawa: Let me give you a different example.In Space Channel 5 (Sega 1999) there is a
character named Ulala. The character designer who came up with Ulala also designed
characters for feminine products in Japan. This is an example of a design being more
popular than the character itself.
Tsurumi: So Toro is an example of how a character is recognized more than how well a
game sells.Don’t avert your eyes [laughs].
But that was actually a marketing problem.The Toro game only sold when it first came
out, and it didn’t sell well after that, but selling products featuring the Toro character
made it profitable for the company. So the series is still being made even today.Without
such exposure and marketing of a fixed character, it won’t last in the market.It is difficult
to make known only the character if the company doesn’t engage in some foundational
economic activity. So in order for a game character to be widely recognized, it is neces-
sary to sell character products and establish a link between that character and the con-
tinuing production of its game.
Q: However, it was a major turning point when Toro first appeared in the
Dokodemo Issho game itself. It picked up a big following with people other than
gamers. If the game as a nucleus is boring, then there is no way for the character
itself to be recognized.
Hasegawa: What about Lara Croft from Tomb Raider (Eidos 1997–2005)?
Tsurumi: That’s because that character was recognized in Japan more as a character in a
movie than in a game.
Hasegawa: Even before that, there are instances such as the Sonic character in Sonic
the Hedgehog (Sega 1991) becoming known as an apparel character more than a
game character.

INTERVIEW: RYOICHI HASEGAWA AND ROPPYAKU TSURUMI OF SCEJ
Tsurumi: Sonic was first popular in the United Kingdom, and is an example of a reverse
import to Japan,so it’s a little different.I even had five or six Sonic T-shirts.
Q: Sonic was a popular game in Japan as well.
Hasegawa: Even though that game was made in Japan, it was a big hit first in the U.S.
and then Europe,and ultimately its popularity spread back to Japan.
Tsurumi: The Sonic game series is still being made, but it’s an example of a character
whose market potential has stalled,perhaps due to poor marketing.
In short, for a game character to be widely recognized, it is necessary to market it
well and add some appeal to the game itself.The publisher of Crash Bandicoot switched
from SCE to Vivendi Universal Games in the U.S. and Konami in Japan, but because
their marketing was not as good as SCE, in both the U.S. and Japan the degree of
recognition decreased.
Hasegawa: The Crash Bandicoot character is no longer popular in Japan.
Tsurumi: What I often said about Ratchet & Clank was that even if we continued to
produce the game for a few years for the children’s market, when the older children
stopped playing it, the younger generation would fill in the gap. Since the population of
children is quickly diminishing, the Japanese market for children is affected by lower
birthrates, but I think it’s possible to maintain a character’s brand value by marketing
them well.
Hasegawa: What was fortunate about Ratchet & Clank in Japan was that hardcore
gamers recognized it as a high quality game, so we were able to reduce the number of
people who might normally stop playing it earlier.
Tsurumi: And we market games for parents, too. So I guess we can maintain a character
brand if we market it for the whole family. Of course, we could have done that for Crash
Bandicoot in Japan by marketing it for the family and establishing it as a good quality
action game that could be played during the holiday season. If we could have done this
for five or ten years, it would have been a big hit.That is true for the Nintendo character
franchise.It would be a powerful weapon if you had a character franchise and could con-
tinue to market and serialize it.
Q: In the very beginning, we talked about portraits of Ratchet. In Japan, importance
has been placed on the design of a character’s silhouette so that children could
readily draw their portrait from the days of Ultraman (1969). Do they do this in the
U.S., too?
Ultraman
http://www.m-78.com/
Tsurumi: When American comic heroes like Superman, Batman, and the X-Men spread
all over the world in the 1960s and 1970s, I heard that editors asked color illustrators to
paint characters simply and use a color scheme that made it easy to understand the
97

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE
characteristics of a character, and that the editors also asked their artists to make the
silhouettes of the characters easily identifiable. But 10 years later, that sort of technique
was ridiculed as being somewhat childish.
Q: Long ago, I heard that when Yokoi Gunpei (1941–1997), who is famous for devel-
oping gaming machines,was producing Game & Watch (1980),Donkey Kong (1981),
and Super Mario Brothers (1982), he incorporated the American cartoon style into
character and game designs because he loved Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Popeye
and Tom and Jerry. The cornerstone of Japanese game character design is function-
ality, but we can say that what influenced that functionality is American cartoons.
Of course,after that,anime and manga style was quickly incorporated as well.
Hasegawa: That’s right.
Q: On the other hand, as game systems evolve, the design of American game charac-
ters hasn’t incorporated the American comic and cartoon style.
Tsurumi: The character design of Crash Bandicoot seems to have been influenced by
American cartoons.
Q: That’s true, but from the era of the Atari to Crash Bandicoot, I feel that there is a
greater distance between American games and cartoons than that in Japan.
Tsurumi: One of the reasons for that is that there was an idea to use Hollywood
animators to develop games, but that might not have been very typical until the latter
half of the 1990s. But this became customary at about the time when Crash Bandicoot
came out.
Hasegawa: Long ago, there was a game for the Sega Genesis called Aladdin (1993).
From what I know, that was the first time that an American production company used a
Disney animator to develop a game. Before then, when we animated a 2D character
swinging a sword,we were drawing several pages of the animated motion of the arm at
equal intervals throughout the whole movement. But with Aladdin, they used the same
devices as Disney animation to make the arm movements look good,so they shortened
the animated sections when an arm starts to move, and lengthened them for when an
arm is extended. This is the same technique as those used to make real animated car-
toons in the studio.This was shocking for a lot of the Sega creators. At the time, I was in
charge of localizing Aladdin, and a lot of designers from the arcade-game machine
development team were coming to study these animation patterns. That was a time
when 3D CG was being used for arcade games, and 3D fighting-games projects like Vir-
tual Fighter (1993) were being developed.
Tsurumi: The early 1990s was a time when ordering character animation from external
production companies was starting to increase, even for game development studios. It
was at about that time when what kind of action a character does, and a character’s
personality reflected in that action,came to be regarded as important.
98

99
Q: There was also a Super NES version of that Aladdin game, which Capcom sold in
Japan.
Tsurumi: That’s a different game, and it wasn’t made very well.The Sega Genesis version
of Aladdin was sold as a Disney product in the U.S., and Virgin Interactive was the pub-
lisher.So it was made very well.
Q: Speaking of Disney games for the Sega Genesis, there was one called Mickey
Mouse: Castle of Illusion (Sega 1990) at that time. For me the way Mickey moved
was a real turning point.But I didn’t pay attention to Aladdin.
Hasegawa: Mickey Mouse was a great game, too, but Aladdin was better. That is why
Aladdin is still held in high regard as a great game.
Q: Just to backtrack a little, creators in Japan who wanted to work on image develop-
ment in the industrial establishment could only work on anime before the 1980s
and, for the gaming industry, beginning from the late 1980s. I guess in the U.S., since
such artists just went straight to Hollywood, they started to have a relationship with
the gaming industry from the early 1990s.
Tsurumi: Since Aladdin came out in 1993, I suppose that was the beginning of it all.
And it probably became the norm around 1993 to 1994. From that time the memory
capacity of the ROM cartridge got larger. Soon after that, the CD-ROM started to
be used as game media, and the data capacity went way up. Until then, due to
the limits of the ROM cartridge’s memory capacity, we couldn’t include a lot of
animation patterns.
Q: Right after the 3DO came out, we entered the era of PlayStation and Sega Saturn.
It was also at about that time when companies like Lucas Arts started to excel at
making games based on films.
Tsurumi: The evolution of game technology is part and parcel of the exchange of
human resources between the movie and game industries. And that continues to be
true even today.
Hasegawa: That was a time when the whole industry was making games while strug-
gling to come up with new methods of game expression. We can talk like experts
about this now, but we were unaware of it when we were absorbed in our work on
Crash Bandicoot.
Tsurumi: We bickered with Mark Cerny a lot when we were working on that project.
Q: Games and animation are both enjoyed on a television screen. We can say that
the difference between the two is a matter of whether or not you can manipulate
the images. So as we looked back at the history of game character design, we
arrived at the world of the American animated film, so I think I understand that

CHAPTER THREE • CULTURE

Interview:W.Lewis Johnson
W. Lewis Johnson has been a pioneer in the research and development of computer
characters for learning applications (referred to in the research community as pedagogi-
cal agents). Johnson and his team of researchers created one of the first virtual tutors to
make use of gestures as well as language within an immersive environment.Currently,he
is leading a project at the University of Southern California (USC) that aims to teach Ara-
bic to students through coaching by and immersive interaction with characters. The
team used the 2003 Unreal Tournament Engine as one technical component of the
learning environment. Learners were coached not just in words themselves but also in
fine-tuning pronunciation and in using culturally appropriate gestures when communi-
cating.The tutoring modules are game-like,with objectives that build upon one another,
motivating the learner to move through the lessons themselves.See Clip 3.1 on the DVD
for a sample of the Tactical Language system in action.
Q: In the Tactical Language Project, the approach to language learning includes not
just vocabulary and grammar but also tutoring in nonverbal communication and
social skills.What made you decide to take this approach?
We focus on rapid acquisition of conversational skills. We want to teach people enough
language and culture so that they can engage effectively in face-to-face communication.

INTERVIEW: W. LEWIS JOHNSON
101
For many people using our training software,that is main thing that they want to learn—
they are planning to travel to a foreign country, and they want to be able to communi-
cate effectively with the people there. And if you can converse well in a language, it is
going to be easier to understand, read, and write the language. So many language
courses do just the opposite—they focus on reading and writing first, and conversation
skills don’t really come until later.We think our approach is closer to the way people learn
language naturally when they live in a language community.
So, given the focus on conversation, we asked ourselves: how can we help people
acquire conversational skills as quickly as possible? We decided to focus on particular
conversational tasks in common social situations. Tasks include introducing yourself,
describing your job or mission, asking for directions, arranging meetings with officials,
and so on. By narrowing the focus we can give learners experience in engaging in con-
versations early on,while their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar is still limited.This
helps build confidence,and encourages learners to continue to develop their skills.
Then, because we put the emphasis on communication skills in social situations, we
must consider broadly what learners will need to know to communicate most effec-
tively in social situations.This includes an understanding of the cultural rules and norms
relating to those social situations. Learners need to become sensitive to the differences
in norms of behavior among societies. This will help to avoid misunderstandings. And
they need to understand cultural differences in nonverbal communication. Nonverbal
communication skills can compensate for deficiencies in verbal communication skills.
Plus,they signal cultural sensitivity and help to build rapport.
Q: How did you go about crafting the gestures and situations in the project? Did you
motion-capture native speakers? Work from film footage? How did you know which
gestures were important and why?
We start by drawing from books on the target culture. These are helpful but are often
very general and do not show the gestures in use in specific situations. We then

language and culturally appropriate nonverbal skills (see Clip 3.1).

construct scripts for dialogs in particular situations. Writing these scripts involves
collaboration between English-speaking script writers and specialists who are either
from the target culture or have extensive experience in the target culture. Placing the
dialogue in specific situations helps to uncover cultural details that are not apparent
when one discusses communicative skills in the abstract. We then videotape people
from the target culture role-playing the scripts in order to uncover further details.
It is important to have multiple people look at the materials as we develop them.Cul-
tures are not homogeneous things,and different people have different views about what
is appropriate in a given situation.This is particularly important for our work because we
emphasize colloquial dialects. There is often little agreement as to what is proper or
appropriate in a given dialect.
Q: What were the most striking differences in American and Arabic gestures and
social behaviors that you and your team uncovered in the process?
Arabs are very relationship-oriented.Whereas Americans tend to be rather matter-of-fact
and get down to business quickly, Arabs typically want to first understand the social
position and trustworthiness of the person they are dealing with. So we put emphasis in
our training in techniques for showing and garnering respect. Gestures play an impor-
tant role here; for example, bowing slightly with your right hand over your heart indi-
cates respect and sincerity.
Q: You’ve conducted early evaluations of the system. What sort of feedback did you
get from learners about the nonverbal component of the lessons?
The nonverbal component helps convey a degree of responsiveness and interactivity
that language alone does not.We have found it most effective to encourage learners to
enter our game world as early as possible and just try walking up to one of the
nonplayer-characters and say hello. Our user interface allows the user to select a gesture
for their character,while they speak on behalf of their character into a microphone.When
the characters in the game respond with speech and gesture, many learners find the
simulation of interactive dialogue very compelling.
Our software includes a combination of game-like experiences and practice exercises
in which learners develop the skills they need to play the game effectively. Our evalua-
tions show that these learning materials support each other.The game experiences help
learners to understand clearly how what they are learning will apply to realistic conversa-
tional situations. Learners are motivated to work on the practice exercises so that they
can play the game more effectively.
Q:You used the Unreal Engine as a part of the technical structure of the project and for
a game-like approach to learning. Could you speak to the reasons for these choices
and any evaluation results to support the choice to create a more game-like situation?
The Unreal Engine provides extensive capabilities for animating characters. This was
essential for emulating face-to-face dialogue in the Tactical Language Project. Some

3.6
SUMMARY AND WHAT IS NEXT
103
researchers have experimented with 3D virtual worlds as vehicles for language learning,
but they do not support animated characters, so learners don’t get any experience with
face-to-face conversation.Some play video clips to simulate dialogue turns,but video clips
do not convey the same degree of responsiveness,not without a huge library of clips.
In addition, building on top of game technology helps us to understand how games
can contribute to learning.There is a lot of interest these days in using game technology
to make learning fun and engaging.There is certainly a lot to learn from game developers
in how to structure user experiences to be make them fun and engaging. These include
giving learners a clear goal and objective and managing the level of difficulty of the expe-
rience in order to achieve the objective.But we also find that making the experience more
game-like is only part of the story.Games achieve engagement through action and inter-
activity, but reflection is important too. Learners want to understand what mistakes they
made in playing the game and improve their skills so that they can play the game better
next time.For many games this reflective aspect is not explicitly supported,so games cre-
ate blogs and discussion groups where they can share their insights. We, on the other
hand,consider reflection and practice to be essential parts of the learning experience and
provide a mixture of action-oriented and reflection-oriented experiences.
Q: Anything else you’d like to add about the project? About the challenges of craft-
ing an authentic cross-cultural experience for learners?
Cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural collaboration are essential for a project such as this.
It has become a central theme of our work. Most multimedia authoring tools, including
language-learning authoring tools, are designed to support individual content authors.
We have had to develop a whole new suite of tools enabling people with different tech-
nical and even cultural backgrounds to work together collaboratively.It also requires that
team members learn to respect the contributions of the other team members.
It is also interesting to note the extent to which we have had to develop connections
with different cultural communities in order to carry out this project.People familiar with
the culture participate in the design of the materials; native speakers of the language
record samples of the language and lines of dialogue for the game characters. We have
to work with people we can find to work with, even in a big city like Los Angeles, which
contains many ethnic groups. In fact, we found ourselves applying our own cultural
lessons, as we developed relationships with the local Arab-American community in
Los Angeles. These skills and cultural sensitivities will come in handy as we proceed to
develop training materials for other languages and cultures.

Beyond Cultural Stereotypes
Choose two or three national cultures, including your own (e.g.,
United States, Japan, and Germany). Break into two teams for each
country—one group should collect stereotypical images of people from
that culture (these can be found in movies, comic books, and other
media), and the other should collect present-day, news-related imagery
of people from this culture that were produced within that culture. Cre-
ate slideshows and compare the two sets of images for each country,
noticing areas where the two sets of imagery radically differ. It may
also be interesting to compare historical stereotypical images with
more recent ones, to see how they shift over time.

What cultural and subcultural groups do you belong to? Have each
person make a list of their memberships. These can include pop sub-
cultural groups such as musical tastes (punk, metal, etc.), hobbies, and
the like, as well as broader cultural groups such as nationality and eth-
nicity. When your group gets to a stage where you are generating game
and character ideas, pull these lists back out and consider whether you
have the “street cred” to give the right cultural depth and authenticity
to what you have dreamed up. You can also use these lists to help gen-
erate ideas that will be well grounded in what your team knows well.
of media contexts on how characters are “read.” Although there are no easy
answers for designing characters that successfully span cultures in their appeal,
some suggestions were made for improving a designer’s chances of achieving this
goal. Chapter 4 continues discussion of player characteristics with an examination
of gender and its impact on character preferences.

CHAPTER
Four
Gender
4.1
What Is Covered and Why
This chapter provides an introduction to how a player’s gender can have an impact
on reactions to game characters, and it describes ways to shift design practices to
create specific gender or cross-gender appeal in characters. Gender is a controversial
topic in the social sciences (and in general), so this chapter also takes some time to
define gender, insofar as it relates to creating game characters, using a social psy-
chological approach.
There are many important major demographic variables, such as race, age, and
socioeconomic status. Why focus on gender? Short of culture, gender is probably
one of the most discussed demographic factors in game design today. Much has
been written in the popular press about the predominance of males as game con-
sumers. Concerns about this imbalance span the commercial and the critical spec-
trum: game publishers would like to sell games to a broader audience, and social
critics want to see girls participating equally in computer literacy through games.
(See [Brunner et al. 1998] for an excellent overview of the concerns and hopes for
female-oriented games during the mid-1990s.)
There is some evidence that the gamer gender gap is slowly narrowing: a 2004
survey by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) reported that 39% of com-
puter and video game players were female, up from 38% in a 2001 survey (ESA
2001, 2004). These numbers, though, do not highlight the fact that far more hard-
core, frequent gamers are male.
There are many factors that influence whether a game is female friendly. This
chapter focuses on the influence of character design in attracting female players. We
will look at research about gender and preferences in games, toward an understand-
ing of how the design of characters in a game affects whether females want to play
it. We’ll look at some games whose characters have many of the features girls seem
to prefer, which have done well with female gamers, and then will cover guidelines
to help in making design decisions about characters that will be more likely to sup-
port female players.
107

CHAPTER FOUR • GENDER
4.2
The Psychological Principles
4.2.1
Gender: Getting Clear on the Concept
Researchers generally make a conceptual distinction between gender and sex. Sex is
the biological aspect of being male or female, and gender is the part that gets
learned and adopted after birth, from other people and from the cultural environ-
ment. Though there is evidence that a few biologically based differences between
men and women could contribute to overall game preferences, this evidence does
not have a major impact on character design choices. I will touch on these topics,
but most of the research in this chapter focuses on observed gender differences, not
on biologically-linked sex differences—things that are learned not inherited.
Gender patterns that get learned as a person grows up in a given culture and time
do not follow a simple binary pattern—each person does not simply learn all the
“proper” male or female behaviors and reactions. Rather, we follow a unique trajec-
tory through this learning space. Any given individual may be typically “feminine”
in some regards and “masculine” in others; for example in dress—see Figures 4.1
108

F I G U R E
4.1

4.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
and 4.2. So it is with the ways that any given female will approach gaming. Some
will very much enjoy masculine play patterns and personas in games. This chapter
highlights findings that point out where gender roles tend to differ. These findings,
when applied, may also end up opening up a game’s characters to a broader
swath of the male audience, not all of whom enjoy highly masculine gaming and
characters.
Some aspects of gender are more culturally open for exploration than
others, and this varies among and even within cultures. For example, wearing
pants is acceptable for women in the U.S., but wearing skirts is not okay for
men in most U.S. regions (although there are male, nontransvestite wearers of
“utili-kilts”).
Gender roles and qualities can also shift dramatically over time: what may have
been considered masculine 100 years ago (or even 10) may now be considered femi-
nine. The name “Leslie,” for example, used to be considered a male name. Gen-
dered behavior can also shift within a person’s lifetime—for example, adolescents
are much more concerned with whether they are behaving in gender-appropriate
ways than adults.

CHAPTER FOUR • GENDER
What does all this mean for game character design?
• The terrain of gender and games is always shifting. As the ESA studies show, girls
are increasingly playing games. Over time, this alters the male “genderedness” of
playing games. It also means that it may become increasingly important for games
expected to be mainstream blockbusters to support female gamers by designing
characters with them in mind.
• All female gamers are not alike. The audience of female gamers is composed of
different clusters of gender behavior. Some female gamers are interested in
exploring and engaging in male-gendered activities and styles of games. Most
discussion in this chapter will focus on gender-related habits and interests girls
have that are not well-expressed in many current games.
• Feminine game-character qualities could also appeal to males. Some argue that
games with a range of character choices (such as massively multiplayer online
role-playing games (MMORPGs)) provide an opportunity to try on different
gender roles for both sexes. Broadening a game’s characters and modes of engag-
ing with players could have the side effect of drawing a wider male audience,
including men who have (or wish to explore) a more feminine side.
4.2.2
Biology: Research Findings and Characters
There are two biologically based differences between males and females that bear
mentioning in relation to character design. The first is a slight trend toward better
spatial abilities in the average male, including mental rotation of objects as well as
spatial navigation. Women rely more on landmarks for navigation, orienting them-
selves based on the terrain in relation to their own physical position. This difference
has been detected across cultures (Boon and Lu 2000, Schmitz 1999).
This means that a larger number of female gamers may find game play more
accessible if they can wayfind using landmarks to orient themselves physically
within the game world. At present, I am conducting research with a graduate stu-
dent at Stanford to determine whether female gamers have an easier time wayfind-
ing in a third-person view, when they can see their own character’s body, than in a
first-person view (see Figure 4.3). It may be the case that this contributes to the
bias in first-person shooter audience toward male gamers.
The second relevant biological difference is the presence (to varying degrees) of
the hormone testosterone. Testosterone level in men has been associated with
increased tendency toward aggressive behavior, and there seems to be a correlation
between the amount of free testosterone and other related hormones a woman has
in her system and her physically and verbally aggressive behavior (von der Pahlen
et al 2002, Cashdan 2003). This research supports the observed differences in game-
play preferences between the average male and female—males tend to enjoy violent
play more and have less of a problem with engaging in violence that is not heavily

motivated by a game’s backstory (see Figure 4.4). This means that games that have
characters that do not engage in heavy, unmotivated aggression are more likely to
appeal to most female gamers.
4.2.3
Gender: Research Findings and Characters
The full range of differences in gender behavior and acculturation could and does
fill many volumes. My aim is to share a few concepts directly related to how
females, in particular girls upon whom most research to date focuses, typically react
to characters in games. These can be broken down into three broad areas:
1. play styles
2. roles that girls are comfortable taking on and fantasizing about
3. ways that others will likely behave toward a girl versus a boy
Play Styles
What Girls Like to Do in Games
Studies investigating girls’ play tendencies reveal some interesting divergences from
the majority of games on the market and help to explain the popularity of games

CHAPTER FOUR • GENDER
such as The Sims™ and Animal Crossing. Please note that these are tendencies, not
absolutes, and depend upon the individual’s own personality, preferences, and
acculturation. The results cited in this chapter are drawn from four research efforts,
with different approaches and agendas, ranging from a broad survey of play pat-
terns conducted at a research think tank to a design exercise in which boys and
girls were asked to create their own games. For more details on any one of these
studies, please see Further Reading at the end of this chapter. I have indicated
which studies support which play patterns here:
• Girls tend to enjoy games that allow for open-ended play and exploration that
does not necessarily require completion of one goal or level to get to the next
(Gorriz and Medina 2000, Kafai 1996).
• Girls prefer games with puzzles or mysteries over games that involve physical
accuracy and acuity (Children Now 2001, Gorriz and Medina 2000).
• Girls would rather spend their time creating things instead of destroying things
(Gorriz and Medina 2000, Bruner, Bennet, and Honey 1998).
• Girls enjoy everyday life activities and metaphors just as much if not more than
fantasy adventures (Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 1998).

4.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
• Girls may be less comfortable than boys about just jumping in and exploring a
game to learn how to do things; they may do better with more explicit mentoring
and instruction at the beginning of a game (Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 1998).
The Sims™, a game that has been popular with female gamers, fits many of these
play patterns (see Figure 4.5). It is not a highly goal-directed game—players can
determine their own subgoals and can move from one to another freely. A player
can devote time to building her Sims characters’ careers, their social lives, or their
houses, in any order, at any time. Destruction and violence are not primary game
activities. The Sims™ metaphor—families with careers and children—is quite close
to everyday suburban life (with some entertaining twists, of course).
Animal Crossing is another game that supports open-ended play. The village
metaphor is not far from everyday life, and the player spends time collecting items,
furnishing the house, and going on quests on behalf of other characters, rather than
going on major campaigns of destruction. The game begins with a friendly intro-
duction for how to get around town and what to do, by the village shop owner,
Tom Nook (see Figure 4.6). All of these qualities of game play probably contribute
to this game’s success with a female audience.
How do these qualities relate to character design? They help to determine the
visceral and cognitive aspects of a game’s player-character (which I will discuss
further in Part IV). Briefly, the player-character is an extension of the person playing
the game, on several psychological levels: the basic visceral level (physical and emo-
tional); the cognitive strategy level (problem solving); the social level (how I relate to
others); and the fantasy level (getting into the history and motivations of the charac-
ter). Play style drives the design of the first two levels: how the game feels as the

player physically navigates in the world and what sorts of problem-solving strategies
she will use in playing the game. Supporting female play styles means that a larger
number of women will be able to easily jump into the player-character’s “skin” and
feel comfortable and engaged. It also means that the female player’s strategies for
decision making will work for her instead of fighting the core game-play style.
How Girls Play with Others in Games
Another factor about female play styles that affects character design is how the
player relates to others during game play. This influences design of the social
aspects of the player-character. Here are some trends reported from the studies I
mentioned in the previous section:
• Girls prefer collaboration to violence against others in games (Gorriz and Medina
2000, Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 1998).
• Girls tend to prefer working in smaller teams than boys do (Subrahmanyam and
Greenfield 1998).
• Girls enjoy forging relationships—visiting other characters, writing letters, learn-
ing about how other characters feel about what is going on (Subrahmanyam and
Greenfield, Bruner, Bennet, and Honey 1998).
• Girls are interested in the story behind the story—motivations and interrelation-
ships among characters (Gorriz and Medina 2000).
• Girls enjoy communication with other girls, and games that encourage or incor-
porate chat and social activity in conjunction with the game can support this
(Gorriz and Medina 2000).

4.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Animal Crossing includes many of these features. The player’s character moves
to a new town and sets up house. She visits with other residents and can have short
exchanges with them and send and receive letters (see Figure 4.7). Over time, she
learns more about the history and interrelationship and moods of the various
townspeople. If she likes, the player can also asynchronously send letters or items
to friends who also play Animal Crossing, and can visit another person’s town using
their memory card.
The Sims™also supports collaboration and conversation—social situations
are not typically resolved with violence (see Figure 4.8). Much of the game’s
appeal is that you can manage and rearrange the social relationships among
your characters and watch and interpret their actions toward one another,
building elaborate back stories. Fans have used The Sims™to create short sto-
ries, supported by screenshots, with complex plots and interrelationships. (See
Maxis’ fan Web site for examples: (http://thesims.ea.com/us/index.html?menu-
community&content-/us/chat/)). Neither game involves large teams.
Roles for Girls: Fantasy Personas Girls Can Relate To
Another way to make a game’s player-character girl friendly is by providing a fantasy
persona that a girl would like to step into. Girls have a different spectrum of interests
in and needs for exploring social roles and possibilities than boys do. Young girls are
trying on possible personas and learning gender norms, women players may be
expressing aspects of themselves within the cultural framework for being “feminine”,

as they take part in a game. Female roles shift over time in any given culture, and
games and other media are part of the terrain where they are contested and evolve. A
girl may enjoy trying on a male persona as well, but including female-friendly fantasy
personas will enlarge a game’s chance of appealing broadly to female players.
A look at popular culture reveals a range of female archetypes that have been
created for girls and have met with some popular success: Nancy Drew, Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, Hermione of Harry Potter, Barbie. These transmedia personalities
do get incorporated directly into games—for example, Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
who stars in a game by the same name.

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Offering players a chance to choose their gender and to control some physical
aspects of the player-character can help to address desires to create a feminine or
masculine fantasy persona in a game. The Sims™ offers extensive choices to players
so that a girl can set up the look she likes (see Figure 4.9).
Other games provide a mix of characters that includes engaging female fantasy
personas. The core party in Final Fantasy X, for example, includes female charac-
ters in the fighting group with different personal qualities (see Figure 4.10). Lulu

is a sensual, materialistic, hyperfeminine character, whereas Yuna is androgenous,
understated, and more focused on the spiritual. Both blend strong fighting skills
with more traditionally feminine qualities.
Industry watchdog research suggests that female player-characters that are
appealing to female players are still underrepresented in current games, helping to
contribute to why girls play less. Even when player characters are biologically
female, they are still “aggressive and have the physical attributes of a male-defined
sex symbol” (Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 1998, 59). Also, see (Children Now
2001) for an analysis of player-characters in top-selling games. A character that a
male enjoys watching may or may not be one that a female enjoys inhabiting. It
depends upon her own ability to project herself into the role of that character and
to feel excited and empowered by her abilities in game play.
Reactions to Girls
Another way to engage female gamers is to acknowledge gender in the ways that
nonplayer-characters (NPCs) relate to the player. Gender has a big social impact in
real life—males and females are treated differently in both subtle and not-so-subtle
ways, in every culture. If NPCs do not acknowlege a player’s gender when this
would happen in real life, or worse, react as if the player is of the wrong gender
when the player is not interested in gender play, this can throw the player right out
of her willing suspension of disbelief. Conversely, the appeal of an NPC to the
player may depend on his or her gender.
The Impact of Gender-Based Attraction
One motivation for social interaction is sexual interest, for both men and
women. It is important, when designing NPC reactions to the player-character,
to consider how well the player’s own desires map onto the design. For exam-
ple, (heterosexual) female players may not respond as strongly and positively
to characters like Cortana of Halo, or Princess Yorda in ICO, who draw part of
their appeal from being attractive women that the male player is drawn to visu-
ally. By contrast, an NPC such as Auron from Final Fantasy X has a strong
appeal to (heterosexual) female gamers as both a romantic figure and a mentor
(see Figure 4.11).
Games with cartoonish, nonhuman characters avoid this issue entirely by remov-
ing physical attraction from the palette of the designer, which may help to explain
their broader cross-gender appeal (see Figure 4.12).
Gender and Assumptions about the Player-Character
Acknowledging gender in a game and building gendered behavior into reactions to
the player-character may make the game more immersive and interesting both for
girls who want to play female characters and for boys who want to try out what it

is like to use female social strategies and deal with gendered assumptions. The trick
is to avoid simply replicating annoying gender-based behaviors (such as those
that sometimes occur in games like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic; see
Figure 4.13). Gender-based behavior in the game should ideally add value to the
player’s experience not just low-grade, real-world sexism.

Design Pointers
Knowing about these gender variations in game and character preferences,
how do you design a game with characters that will be a success with female
gamers? Based on the findings discussed in this chapter, there are a few things
I would recommend.
First, decide whether the aim is to design a game that appeals to both genders
or one that is targeted toward female gamers specifically. If the answer is a
game with broad cross-gender appeal, here are a few pointers:
• Don’t accidentally leave out female gamers.
• NPCs should be appealing to both genders and should react in gender-
realistic ways, especially if the game has a more photorealistic and mature
(as opposed to cartoon) style.
• Core game play should offer a broad enough range of actions and goals to
support both female and male play preferences and strengths. This means
it is ideal to avoid extremely goal-driven play, purely spatial navigation
without good landmarks, and unmotivated aggression. It also means you
may gain audience members by including some form of communication
and social play qualities and by including some nonviolent ways to partici-
pate (such as collecting, collaborating, or building).
• Offer flexible character choices so players can choose not only which gen-
der but how extremely gendered they want to be.

Interviews with Gamers—Personal Perspectives
Gathering data from real people who play is the best way to ensure that a game’s
character designs truly work. To help show the value and richness of individual per-
spectives (versus relying on generalizations about broad patterns), I have included
two interviews with female gamers and one with a male gamer about their gaming
histories and preferences. I hope these will serve as inspiration for incorporating—
early and often—both men and women who fall into target audience segments into
design teams and test groups as a game is designed.

Interview: Sarah Walter
Sarah Walter grew up with computer games in the house, thanks to her
father encouraging a computing hobby. She received a BS from UCLA in cognitive
121
If you want to specifically target female gamers:
• Design female player characters that are relevant archetypes or that offer
customization.
• Make sure NPCs react in ways that enhance the player’s experience of her
character. Consider whether NPCs are attractive and engaging to the female
eye.
• Consider developing deeper backstory and connections between characters.
• Think about moving beyond traditional genres, as The Sims™ and Animal
Crossing did, to embed female-friendly play styles (collaboration, communi-
cation, building, and everyday life metaphors) more deeply into the core
play mechanics of the game.
In either case, I would also recommend two tweaks to the design process
that will increase the odds of success: early and frequent play-testing by
females in the target audience group and the inclusion of women in the
game development team. The latter helps ensure that early brainstorming
sessions, design documents, and prototypes will be shaped in a way that
supports female game play. With the inevitable fast and furious design-and-
build time frame, this is the safest way to ensure that a game will truly
appeal to female gamers.

science, specializing in computing. For the next two years, she worked as an
interaction designer for mainstream Web sites and applications, straddling
the line between users and implementation. Currently living in San Francisco,
Sarah is pursuing a PhD in learning sciences and technology design at Stanford
University, focusing her research on informal learning with games and gender dif-
ferences in gaming. She recently interned in the video game industry in a
production role.
Q: First off, what games do you like to play? List a few favorites and why you love
them.Also,tell me a bit about the kinds of genres you like and why.
This is a tough question; I normally respond with my current addictions, though a few
games stand out in my history of gaming . . . . Adventure games, text-based and
otherwise, have been a favorite, for their problem-solving game play and story lines. Old
addictions include the King’s Quest series, Maniac Mansion and Day of the Tentacle, and
the Laura Bow and Monkey Island series. Below the Root for the Apple IIc was based on a
series by one of my favorite authors at the time, which pretty much blew me away. The
game was an early favorite. I loved that the designer of several 1980s to 1990s Sierra
adventure games was a woman,Roberta Williams;this fact most definitely contributed to
my early desire to design games.
Freely exploring another world totally draws me in,as in GTA 3 and up.There’s nothing
like plowing down innocent pedestrians in a stolen car while listening to old school
Michael Jackson.The Legend of Zelda:The Windwaker is phenomenal.I love Nintendo’s col-
orful style,and the vast world offers plenty of exploration.
In my next life I’d like to be an architect, but for this life, I’ll keep playing the
SimCity™and Sims™ series to satisfy this building urge. Earlier, I played Rocky’s Boots
and The Incredible Machine for the same reason. I also love any game that makes me
tap into logic skills, like these latter two games, as well as Advance Wars and any game
requiring stealth.

Q: How did you get into gaming?
My dad drew me in to his computing hobby when I was in grade school.We had games
for our Apple IIc, Atari, and later the x86 machines. He subscribed to a service which
mailed out 5.25-inch floppies full of small applications every month or so. I searched for
the games in each of these disks. I also played Carmen San Diego with grade-school
friends; we each had a certain task for the game, such as fact-checker, note-taker, and
driver. We played this single-person game as a team. Playing video games with girl
friends fell off as we grew up, unfortunately, although by age 14, I knew I wanted to
design games that encourage thinking and learning.
Q: What are your play patterns? (When do you play and for how long? For what
reasons? Alone or with others?)
I was a closet gamer during high school and college. Now I try to recruit friends to
play games with me, like Halo, in cooperative mode. I play competitively too, but as
neither my boyfriend nor I like to lose, it is probably best we play together against
the machine.
I play games by myself to escape, or decompress, at the day’s end. One of my
favorites now is the Advance Wars series on the GBA (Game Boy Advance); it is a great
way to get in 15 minutes of one complete game, enough to tide me over for a bit, or
while waiting in airports, etc. Although, it is easy for me to sink an entire day
engrossed in a game, even if I tell myself I’m just decompressing. Other times, I will
turn to a game for the same reasons I turn to a good novel, to immerse myself in this
other world.
I’d love to play more games with friends, but the selection of great multiplayer games
seems slim right now,at least for my preferences.I don’t enjoy realistic sports games,and
most of the rich story lines and environments seem to exist in single-player games at the
present.I would love to see the industry work to make more types of games to play with
people in the same room,as opposed to over a network.
Q: Did you or do you take any guff from folks for being a female who likes playing
games? How do you feel about it?
I’ve gotten slack for being a gamer in general, not for being a female gamer specifically.
I definitely have felt out of place at GDC (Game Developers Conference), E3 (Electronic
Entertainment Expo), or in the games aisle at the store, but this is more a product of my
mind than a result of others’actions towards me.
Q: How do the men in your life feel about your gaming habits? Do you play games
with other gals? With other guys?
I’ve turned my boyfriend, Brent, into a Halo addict. He says he is not a gamer, but I
have introduced him to a game or two, only to find him in the same position hours
later, trying to complete a level. Another of my close male friends now comes over

CHAPTER FOUR • GENDER
124
to challenge Brent at NCAA Football. It is hilarious how worked up they get. I’ll play
other games with them, like SSX™, shooting or racing games, but not the realistic
sports games.
Brent just reminded me to include how annoying my current addiction to Advance
Wars is. Apparently, I turn into a “zombie”for a couple hours while playing a few levels of
this game. I think that he does not want to play, fearing he will become addicted as well.
I seldom play games with my girl friends. While interning at EA over the summer, a
few interns and employees started a girls’ gaming night. These evenings are a lot of
fun since I have not had a videogame-playing group of girl friends since grade school.
We play whatever strikes us at the moment, from Mario Party to SSX™3 to Katamari
Damaci on a Japanese PS2.My guess would be that we feel comfortable exploring a new
game or genre in this setting, as our experiences with games range quite a bit. Learning
with an advanced group, male or female, can be intimidating, just as it would be for
any domain.
Q: Do you think your own gaming interests are “typical” of female gamers? Why or
why not?
Yup, when I mentioned Halo in “cooperative” mode, that was a big female flag; however,
I’m still killing aliens, which many people think is not a “girl”thing. A female gamer friend
and I recently had several of our female grad student friends get together to play some
console games. We were both pleasantly surprised when they wanted to stop playing
Mario Party so they could “kill stuff.”As with any generalization,typical female game-play
patterns sometimes don’t apply.
Q: What advice would you give to designers hoping to craft games to appeal to you
as a female gamer?
The problem of attracting females to video games is the same as attracting any
new user to the game. Involve a wide range of gamers, including females, in the
design. Test concepts and game play with females as well as males, early and often
throughout the design process. It is not that girls don’t want to play; find a hook
to draw the women into the game; think about women who might be in the room
while the men in their lives are playing.Talk to them. From what I have seen, game
designers have been designing mostly for the people in their own buildings. This has
been successful for part of the population so far, but as the generations infused with
technology grow up and game design advances,games will no doubt start to appeal to a
wider audience.
Q: Have you or do you have any interest in being a part of the game-design busi-
ness? In what ways?
I interned at EA/Maxis during the summer of 2004, on the final stages of The Sims™2.0
production. I was involved from alpha to release, helping to run short- and long-term

4.4

play tests,and working with the production team to get the product finished . . . .It was
a blast.I hope to return to the industry after I finish my doctorate.

Interview: Stephanie Bergman
Stephanie Bergman is an avid gamer who spoke out about her non-“girlie” prefer-
ences in games as part of a chapter highlighting Game Grrlz voices in From Barbie
to Mortal Kombat (Cassell and Jenkins 1998). I caught up with Bergman in 2004 to
get further insight into her experiences as a girl gamer.
Q: First off, what games do you like to play? List a few favorites and why you love
them.Also,tell me a bit about the kinds of genres you like and why.
My all-time favorite game would have to be the multi-user Dungem (MUD) I was fairly
addicted to in college. Role-playing games (RPGs) are definitely my absolute favorite
genre overall—I love creating a character and burying myself in a story line.I’m also very,
very prone to becoming solidly addicted to online games. I was an early beta tester for
three different online RPGs (what you could sort of consider graphical evolutions of my
old MUD). EverQuest and Asheron’s Call are still around of the two, and as soon as they
launched in the retail version, I stopped playing out of necessity. I just knew that if I kept
playing I would never stop. I remember far too many nights where I would be online at
4 a.m. with a bunch of people trying to solve one more quest or trying to get myself up
one more level.
I concentrate these days on playing single-player role-playing games instead. They
have a shorter life span, in that I finish them and they’re done—they don’t really have
very much replay value—so at least they only suck my life away for a few weeks instead
of multiple months. I love the Final Fantasy series of games and am nearly finished with
Kingdom Hearts, which is a very cute combination of two of my favorite things—Final
Fantasy and Disney.
On the flip side of my gaming interests, I also love first-person shooters, which are
rather violent, agressive games. Unlike RPGs, I can jump into a first-person shooter, play
for 20 minutes, and feel completely satisfied. It’s a wonderful way to get out a great deal
of stress, and a lot of fun. My favorite is still Quake 3, which is now considered fairly old,
I suppose, but it’s great to me. I should say, I have been known to be online until 4 a.m.
playing Quake 3 as well, but that was generally due to the people I was playing with—
I was part of a Quake clan and would hang out with my friends and have matches at all
hours of the night.Quake also has a team-based variant called Capture the Flag,which is a
favorite of mine; nothing could possibly compare to the feeling of a group of us working
together as a team to win a hard-fought match.
I’ve also had a blast with the whole Grand Theft Auto series; it’s a lot of really silly,
reckless fun.
I also play more silly games, which I don’t really consider games in my silly
gamer way of thinking—just the little ones I download onto my handheld—things

CHAPTER FOUR • GENDER
126
like Hearts, Solitaire, Bejeweled—games I play when I am waiting at the airport or
something.
Q: How did you get into gaming?
I begged my parents to buy an Atari, and they did. After that, I kept trying out different
systems—I played games on our Apple IIc, on various consoles, on handhelds (Game
Gear,etc.),until I ended up here.
Online gaming—my brother and I had heard that we could get two computers to
play Doom against each other if one called the other using a modem.We kept trying,and
trying, until suddenly it worked. The second I saw him run across my computer screen
I was totally hooked.It was the neatest thing I think I’d ever seen.
Q: What are your play patterns? (When do you play and for how long? For what
reasons? Alone or with others?)
It depends on the game I’m playing.RPGs,I think I definitely need a chunk of time to play.
They’re not fast and quick games,so I reserve them for the weekend.
Shooters I don’t play at all anymore, since my computer died (I need to buy a
new one). I used to play those at night during the week to let off steam; they were
perfect for that. In fact, at my old job, my entire office used to get online every night
to play Quake. I tell you, there is NOTHING like being able to shoot your boss in
the head when you’re mad at him. It is a wonderful feeling, and much more productive
for the workplace. You can even shout smack talk at him, and it’s all considered
totally appropriate.
When I was part of a Quake clan,I would always play with them—they were a wonder-
ful group of women who I proudly called my sisters.We played in tournaments,had prac-
tices,just like any other team—it was just a very different “sport.”
Q: Did you or do you take any guff from folks for being a female who likes playing
games? How do you feel about it?
Oh, of course. It’s gotten better now, but it was terrible when I first got online. In fact,
when I first started playing online, I was afraid to use my real name, so I picked the most
masculine, manly name I possibly could—I was John Clark (from the Tom Clancy novels).
About six months after I was playing online,there was an all-female Quake tournament
happening, and I really wanted to play, but in order to do that, I had to “come out,” so to
speak.So I changed my name.The first time I joined a server as a girl,I was first asked why
I had such a gay name for a guy (my nickname was/is Bobbi). I said I was a girl. The guy
wrote back that I wasn’t—I insisted I was. He said that I must be a lesbian—I told him I’d
tell my boyfriend that.He then said that my boyfriend was gay.
That’s actually a much tamer story than most.I’ve been called every name in the book,
but the lesbian one comes up most often, that women who play games are butch, aren’t
real women,what are we thinking,how can we be interested in this.

4.4
INTERVIEWS WITH GAMERS—PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES
127
We’d also be told how if we were women, well, then, we must be terrible, because
women couldn’t be any good at games.Then,if we beat them,we’d never hear the end of
it—that would be when the insults would come out. That would always be a lot of
fun,though.
We made a joke out of all of the insults with our clan name, which was Clan PMS
(there’s even a PMS model in Quake 3 that you can get!)—PMS stands for Psycho Men
Slayers.All very tongue in cheek,but also very appropriate;after all,99% of the people we
would be playing against would be men.
Q: How do the men in your life feel about your gaming habits? Do you play games
with other gals? With other guys?
My male friends actually love it and joke that they wish they had a girlfriend who would
understand their love for their computer,or their PS2.We have “gaming nights,”and have
brought games into work on occasion and hung out there playing Mario Kart; it’s a
lot of fun.
The majority of my gaming is done on my PS2 these days,though I just don’t have the
time to commit to multiplayer games anymore. Single-player games are much more
manageable,time-wise.
Q: Do you think your own gaming interests are “typical” of female gamers? Why or
why not?
Based on what the statistics show, anyway, they aren’t. From what I understand the
stats to show, most women these days are playing games like The Sims™, or Web-based
games like those on the Zone or Pogo.I find those to be boring, more of the fluffier-type
games that I was referring to earlier.I like more in-depth,immersive games where there’s
either a great story and some sort of progression,or some kind of winner and loser.
Q: What advice would you give to designers hoping to craft games to appeal to you
as a female gamer?
Don’t make games for women.
Back when I got my Atari, there was Pong, and I loved it. It was just Pong, though; it
wasn’t made for women or men.And it was perfect.
These days, there are companies making games specifically for girls, and nearly 100%
across the board, I find them to be horrible. They’re dumbing down the concept of
games, thinking that THAT is what women are looking for. If they actually look at where
women are—The Sims™, Pogo—those are asexual games. All game developers need to
do is make good games.Women will follow.
A few years ago I saw some boys teasing a girl on a subway in NYC because she
wanted to talk about the racing game they’d been talking about; they were teasing her
that she should have been more interested in Lara Croft because “that’s a girl’s game.”
The look on that little girl’s face as the boys teased her is not something I am about to

CHAPTER FOUR • GENDER
128
forget. THAT’s what making girl games is starting to do to the gaming industry; it’s for-
cing people to classify games as male and female,and it’s already affecting little kids.It’s a
very,very dangerous path to go down.
People have fought for years to have workplaces and schools not be classified by
gender—why are we doing it to games? It’s taking a huge step back.
Q: Have you or do you have any interest in being a part of the game-design
business? In what ways?
I used to write for a few different online publications about the gaming industry (the
main one is still up and archived at http://www.loonygames.com), and I also coproduced
and cohosted an internet television show specifically targeted towards women. (My day
job at the time was cohosting and producing another daily show about gaming—but
my baby was my show about women and games.)
I loved doing that—it was great being head-deep in an industry that I loved, and
I especially adored being able to be in a situation where we could do something specifi-
cally for women. We targeted our show towards women who were first getting online
and might not know as much about games, and we did a lot of segments teaching
more basic things than our other programming would have covered—how to set up
networking for games, how to install mouse drivers—things that may seem simple to a
lot of people,so simple that nobody ever explains it anywhere.
We were also able to do our own female Quake tournament—the same type that had
gotten me to “come out of the closet”years before,but on a much larger scale.We flew the
finalists in our tournament from all around the country (one came from Alaska!) to NY for
the finals, gave them a real New York City experience that only a woman could enjoy—a
spa day at Elizabeth Arden—and had the main event at a large Quake tournament held
right in downtown NYC.The women were even taken out to dinner by John Romero and
Stevie “Killcreek”Case.John Romero’s one of the original creators of Doom and Quake,and
Stevie’s probably one of the best-known women in the gaming industry.
Now I definitely would love to get back into the industry someday. I love the people,
and obviously I love the games and the technology. But I’m not a programmer, so my
ability to actually be involved is somewhat limited. I also am very happy in my current
position,so I’m staying where I am for now.

interest in game design and development.
Q: First off, what games do you like to play? List a few favorites and why you love
them.Also,tell me a bit about the kinds of genres you like and why.
I’m a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, and similar RPGs in general (The Legend of
Dragoon, Xenogears, etc). I also like adventure games in the style of The Legend of

4.4
INTERVIEWS WITH GAMERS—PERSONAL PERSPECTIVES
129
Zelda and Kingdom Hearts. Action games like Devil May Cry and Zone of the Enders are
nice, but I find them to be a bit short. It’s the story and the characters of a game that
drive me to play them. Game play is essential, of course, but I’d rather have a massive
plot with twists and turns, character growth, and emotional cinematics than any
amount of high-resolution graphics (though I won’t complain if a game has both).
Q: How did you get into gaming?
I only played a few games at first.Things like the original Castle Wolfenstein and Star Trek
25th Anniversary were my first exposure to games. I also got into Half-Life when it first
came out.However,it wasn’t until I began playing The Legend of Zelda:The Ocarina of Time
and Final Fantasy VII that I really started to consider myself a “serious”gamer. Afterwards, I
followed the Final Fantasy series and became increasingly interested in Japanese-style
RPGs and adventure games.
Q: What are your play patterns? (When do you play and for how long? For what
reasons? Alone or with others?)
How and when I play depends on the kind of game I’m playing. I typically play in
the evenings or on weekends,when I have a good chunk of free time and nothing sched-
uled. I’ll also play between other important tasks to clear my head. If I’m playing an RPG,
I’ll sit down for anywhere from half an hour to two hours or so,trying to get as far as I can
into the story before other things pull me away.If I’m playing an action game,it’s typically
a much shorter session,usually no more than an hour,or until I complete a level or three.
Adventure games are much more varied. Typically, I’ll play until I reach a point where
there aren’t any pressing quests or important questions to be answered. Sometimes, I’ll
play quick little games like Warning Forever or Squares when I don’t want to start my work

immediately, or I just need a break. These games only last for 10 minutes or so, so they
don’t take too long to go through,and provide a quick distraction.
Q: Do you think your own gaming interests and patterns are “typical”of male gamers?
Why or why not?
It really depends,I suppose.I know some guys who play just like I do and many more who
are completely different. However, I’d have to say that I’m not altogether the most com-
mon type of male gamer.While I enjoy action games and first-person shooters for a quick
distraction or an outlet after a frustrating day, I prefer much deeper and more complex
games.I don’t like being stuck in the role of a faceless,nameless grunt mowing down alien
horrors for no good reason, unless I’m allowed to explore to my heart’s content. I tend to
enjoy putting myself in the place of a much more driven and intricate character. That’s
probably why I enjoy RPGs so much, especially Japanese titles.They tend to have incredi-
bly intricate plots and characters with multiple driving forces behind their actions. For
example, you can compare Zidane, the lead character of Final Fantasy IX, to the faceless
“hero” of Diablo II. Zidane’s character is exposed throughout the game, showing him as a
wise-cracking, flirtatious rogue who actually cares about people and will do almost any-
thing to help others but still thinks about his actions first. On the other hand, the player-
character of Diablo II is defined solely by his or her class.They have no backstory, no per-
sonality, and no real identifying characteristics. In that game, all you are is the armor you
wear and the attacks you choose.You’re a schmuck who just happens to be the only one
who can save the world.I’m not a fan of those kinds of characters.
Q: Did you or do you take any guff from folks for being a guy who likes playing
games that usually appeal to females? How do you feel about it?
Not really.I do tend to get defensive when people make fun of games I like,especially the
Final Fantasy series. Some people complain that they’re boring, or constantly whine
about the turn-based combat and the angst-filled characters.But that’s more of a general
thing. It’s just a personal preference of mine, and I really don’t care what other people
expect. I just find it sad how slanted the advertising and business of games seem to be.
For example, in its first day of release, Halo 2 sold over two million copies.While I haven’t
played the game, it looks to me to be just another formulaic shooter with really flashy
graphics and weapons that make pretty explosions. On the other hand, almost no one
outside the fan-base even knows when a Final Fantasy game comes out.It’s fairly annoy-
ing to see so many gamers (primarily male) swooning over that kind of game, whereas a
deep and emotional game that takes 40 hours to complete and doesn’t involve guns and
rockets in every situation is overlooked by a vast majority of gamers.
Q: Do you play games with other guys? With female friends? Does this differ in terms
of type of game and style of play?
It always depends on the kind of game. If I’m playing a single-player game or RPG, I’ll
typically ask if anyone wants to watch, or watch someone else play. If it’s an adventure

or action game, I’ll sometimes switch off with another person (male or female, it really
doesn’t matter) so we both get to experience it and help each other out. I also enjoy
playing fighting games in multiplayer mode. There’s nothing quite as fun as trying to
one-up one another without resorting to actual physical conflict.
Q: What advice would you give to designers hoping to craft games to appeal to you
as a gamer?
Story, story, story, character, character, character. Every character in a game, no matter
how long they stay on screen, has some impact on the story and the player. Don’t just
send a player and his or her avatar* into a situation for no clear reason.There’s really no
difference between someone fighting for a good cause and someone who just kills any-
one and anything that gets in his way if the good cause is not there. There has to be a
REASON for as much of the game play and story as possible. Without justifications for
their actions, there’s really no reason for players or their avatars to be involved in the
game at all.
Q: Have you or do you have any interest in being a part of the game design
business? In what ways?
I’m hoping to become a game designer in the future.My primary interest lies in scripting,
story,and character design.I couldn’t program my way out of a paper bag,but I’m always
interested in the basic systems behind games. I want to be able to work with program-
mers, writers, and other artists to create games that are artistic and deep but still just
plain fun.That is really my only goal: to create things that I enjoy making and that others
will enjoy playing.

player actions.

Summary and What Is Next
This chapter presented research findings on biological and enculturated differences
between men and women that have an impact on game and character appeal. Two
games that succeeded with both genders—The Sims™ and Animal Crossing—were
discussed in light of these findings. The chapter ended with some recommendations
for taking gender-based preferences into account in the design process. Though there
are certainly other demographic variables to consider when designing characters,
this marks the end of the section on player qualities and character design. Part III
focuses on the social equipment that a character possesses—face, body, voice—and
how to make the most of these from a psychological point of view.

Exercises
4.6.1
Interviews
Do the people in your design group display typical gender patterns in
their play preferences? Conduct interviews of male and female gamers
in your group and compare play preferences: genres, favorite games and
styles of play, most- and least-liked characters, and specific turn-offs
about game play. Compare notes: How many people fell into highly
gendered play patterns? How many had counter-gender patterns? What
about blended preferences?
4.6.2
Androgynous Game Sketches
Based on the overlap between the male and female preferences you
gathered in your interviews, work in teams to design game concepts that
will appeal to both genders. As you brainstorm, consider games that
have demonstrated cross-gender appeal, such as The Sims™ and Animal
Crossing (discussed in this chapter), and party games such as Dance
Dance Revolution. What aspects of these games work well to support
cross-gender appeal? Incorporate some of these elements into your own
design sketches.

PART
Three
Using a Character’s
Social Equipment
What is Covered and Why
Part III turns back toward what is on the screen, diving into the details of social
impressions and how they emerge through cues from character faces, bodies, and
voices. Chapters 5–7 include examples from games that take maximum advantage of
these cues, and each offers specific pointers for incorporating insights into designs.
Design tips include areas of social-cue research that are not really being taken advan-
tage of with current character designs and that could give a design a unique edge.
The psychological principles in this section deal with ways that each component
of the person—face, body, and voice—contributes to an interaction partner’s social
and emotional experience. Although face, body, and voice are discussed separately;
of course, these modes of expression work together to create overall impressions.
When interpreting the behavior of others, people sift through these signals to resolve
(or revel in) ambiguities and to sniff out falsehoods. If one aspect of a person’s social
signals is hard to read or unavailable (for example, in a phone conversation), the
observer will lean more heavily on the cues that remain. This means that designers
who know that one area of social cues will be weak in a game’s characters due to
technical or other limitations (such as small screen size or limited memory) can at
least partially compensate with higher-quality cues in other modalities.
It is important to keep in mind that the basic behaviors and reactions discussed
in Part III are modulated through different cultural influences and training. For
example, human beings tend to raise their eyebrows briefly when greeting someone
they know already, but in Japan, this impulse is suppressed because it is considered
impolite. Use of social signals for audiences beyond the development team should
be undertaken with the caveats in Chapter 3—to include members from the target
audience on the design team and to make sure to test early and often.
I hope that reading these chapters will give designers valuable insights for direct-
ing character development efforts, not only at the animation or sound-design level,
but also in terms of integrating the subtle impressions that faces, bodies, and voices
make as a whole upon the player. Using these basic building blocks with an eye
135

136
toward sculpting the overall social interaction can lead to much more powerful
emotional responses and resonance with characters.
Who Will Find Part III Most Useful
This section will be of value to anyone who works on character design (not just
artists, animators, and audio specialists). Social cues are conveyed within the con-
text of game action, so adept application of the principles requires the understand-
ing and engagement of programmers and game designers as well as media artists.
Overview of Key Concepts
Faces
Chapter 5 introduces the psychological foundations for the ways that faces work to
communicate and encourage emotion, to teach others, to sync people up, and to
reflect and forge social relationships.
Reading Faces
The chapter begins with analysis from psychologists who have broken down the
components of facial expressions.
“Action units”for the brow and forehead,mapped out by Ekman and colleagues to better
understand emotional expressions.(Based on Knapp and Hall 2002).

137
Social Learning from Faces
Next, the concept of social learning is discussed—how human beings increase the
pace of learning by watching others.

Social Synching—Empathy
This chapter includes a discussion of how emotions that people read in others can
be “contagious” and how this applies to crafting player-character faces.

Bodies
Chapter 6 shows that bodies are vital in everyday social communication. How,
when, and where people move reveals relationships and ongoing shifts in feelings
toward others and expresses personalities, moods, and attitudes.
Interpersonal Distance and Touch
This chapter begins with a discussion of interpersonal distance and touch—two
simple yet powerful ways people communicate connections with others and per-
ceive them between those they observe.

Social Relationships and the Face
Chapter 5 concludes with a discussion of how people convey their social feelings
toward one another, and reinforce social roles, through facial expressions, with a
look at excellent character design from The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker.

139
Imitation
The chapter goes on to address the tendency people have to unconsciously imitate
others’ postures and what this may indicate about their relationships. This powerful
social effect is not currently used in games and is a great opportunity for adding
unique social power to a game’s characters.
Gesture imitation happens in many everyday social contexts; becoming aware of it can help
reveal underlying social structures.
Social Grouping
Chapter 6 also includes a discussion of how people adjust their posture to welcome
or stall conversation partners who want to participate in a group conversation. The
chapter includes an interview with Chuck Clanton, one of There’s designers, who
worked on the innovative social body language There avatars use.
There avatars automatically adjust their posture toward one another as conversations take place.

Voices
Emotion in Voice
Chapter 7 begins with a discussion of cues of emotion. The voice can convey a per-
son’s unfolding emotions in reaction to what others do and say. These cues can be
“read” even when a person does not speak the other’s language.
In The Sims™, characters speak an incomprehensible language that consists pri-
marily of emotional tones, which manage to give the player a clear picture of what
is going on emotionally with and between the Sim characters.
The movement of athletes in games such as (a) SSX™3 conveys very different personal style and
evokes different player emotions than the movement of the more vulnerable,awkward
characters in (b) ICO.(a) SSX™ 3 image ©2005 Electronic Arts Inc.SSX is a registered trademark of

Bodies and Identity
Chapter 6 concludes with a discussion of ways that psychologists and movement
experts have worked to analyze and identify signature movement qualities and
parameters that convey meaning about a person’s current emotional and physical
state and general personality. Making studied use of these parameters in character
planning and design could help achieve the kinds of powerful effects that can be
seen when contrasting the casual grace of characters in sports games with the
endearing awkwardness of the characters in ICO.

Social Context and Identity
Chapter 7 also discusses the ways that a person’s voice conveys information about
social status and relationship to the listener. In Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, peons
respond in a more submissive tone of voice than other higher-ranking characters
when given orders.

142
Social Interaction Logistics
Chapter 7 concludes with a discussion of the ways that vocal cues help manage
social interaction—as when sounds like “mmmhmmm” are used in everyday
conversation to indicate that the other person is listening and to help modulate
turn-taking. As games evolve to include voice interfaces among players, these sorts
of cues will become increasingly important for crafting believable and engaging
character interactions during game play.
Take-Aways from Part III
Part III will give the reader a better understanding of how character faces, bodies,
and voices contribute to the quality of social interactions with players. After reading
these chapters, a designer will be able to analyze characters she or he has already
made, isolating which aspects of a character’s social signals are effective and which
are not. These chapters will give design teams criteria for directing and improving
character design at this level of detail and may help to uncover where problems lie
with characters that are somehow not socially engaging and lifelike. These ideas
also serve as a foundation for making use of the more general pointers about
player-character and nonplayer-character design in Part IV.

CHAPTER
Five
The Face
5.1
What Is Covered and Why
Character faces are becoming increasingly important as game graphics capabilities
and processing power allow for more visibility of and subtlety in facial expression.
What was not possible 20 years ago (when conveying a smile or frown in a sprite
(a player character image on-screen during gameplay) was an achievement), is
now limited only by the designer’s imagination and abilities. Subtle mingling of fear
and excitement upon an enemy’s face, unmistakable delight of an ally at seeing the
player-character—these emotions and more are now possible. This is wonderful
insofar as the social power of games is concerned. The face is one of the most
important human communication channels.
This chapter introduces some of the social cues people are looking for in one
another’s faces and offers ways to incorporate them intelligently and appropriately
into the design of characters. Game examples are drawn from The Legend of Zelda:
The Windwaker and Super Monkey Ball 2.
5.2
The Psychological Principles
Reading faces is a fundamental aspect of social interaction. There is evidence that
there are specific areas of human (and primate) brains devoted to the processing of
faces (see Figure 5.1).
5.2.1
What We Look for in Faces and Why
Expressions
When interacting, people watch the play of expressions upon the other person’s
face—the raising or lowering of an eyebrow, crinkles forming around the eyes, or a
subtle droop at the corners of the mouth. Researchers who study the movement

Responses of a neuron in a monkey’s area IT to various stimuli.This neuron responds best to a
full face,as shown by its response to monkey and human faces in the top two records.Removing
the eyes or presenting a caricature of a face reduces the response.This neuron does not respond
to a random arrangement of lines.(From Bruce,Desimone,and Gross 1981.)
of these muscles have isolated 46 action units involved in forming expressions
(Ekman, Friesen, and Hagen 2002). Figure 5.2 shows the action units identified for
the brows and forehead. Specific combinations of these action units lead people to
say that a particular emotion is being expressed. For example, the combination of
action units 1 and 2 leads to a label of “surprise.” Ekman and his colleagues
painstakingly catalogued the individual facial muscles and their combinations and
studied how they are used to convey basic emotions such as fear, anger, happiness,
and sadness. They then investigated whether people from different cultures identify
the same emotions from their database—is a sad face recognized as sad across the
globe? The answer seems to be yes.
Why is this the case? Darwin’s ground-breaking work on facial expression
suggested that human emotional expressions evolved out of involuntary physical
reactions that can also be observed in other animals. Today psychologists know
that there are some cultural differences in emotion display patterns, but most

5.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
researchers agree on the universality of at least four basic emotions (see Figure 5.3
for illustrations of some forms of these expressions):
• anger (assertion),
• fear (aversion),
• happiness (satisfaction), and
• sadness (disappointment).
Beyond expressing emotions, the movement of the muscles of the face also con-
tributes meaning to conversation. For example, raised eyebrows can be used to
emphasize words or phrases in conversation, or to indicate that one is paying atten-
tion as another speaks (see Figure 5.4).
Gaze
When watching a person’s face, people are also paying close attention to gaze.
Where the other looks and whether and for how long they make eye contact, pro-
vide important social information. Timing and direction of gaze can indicate
• dominance or submissiveness (patterns of holding or avoiding direct eye contact),
• where a person’s attention is at the moment,
• flirtation,
• interest in beginning a conversation (or desire to avoid one),

CHAPTER FIVE • THE FACE
• an invitation for one’s conversation partner to take a turn in the dialogue,
• active listening, and
• pondering of a point.
As with expression, patterns of gaze can vary depending upon culture or subcul-
ture. For example, lack of sustained mutual gaze might be interpreted as indiffer-
ence or rudeness by an American person and as politeness by a Japanese person.
5.2.2
Social Uses of Reading Expression and Gaze
Social Learning
If you needed to repair something complex for the very first time, would you prefer
to do it alone, learning through a combination of manuals and trial and error? Or,
would you want to work with another person who was already a repair expert,
watching and learning from what they did?
Most likely you would want to do the latter. It is much easier to learn how to do
something new with another person who is an expert to watch (see Figure 5.5).

CHAPTER FIVE • THE FACE
Psychologists have demonstrated that this is a powerful part of being human—a
person could never learn all he or she needs to know about life through sheer trial
and error. Instead, people learn rapidly and efficiently by watching one another and
learning from each others’ mistakes and successes. (See [Bandura 1977] for an
overview of social learning theory.) The face is one place people look to learn.
What do you think the person in Figure 5.6 sees? What might you do if you were
in the same room with this person? You would probably brace yourself for some-
thing bad and would look up to see the potential threat.
When people watch another’s face to learn about what is happening, they are
drawing conclusions about
• where attention is, by following the other’s gaze, and
• what the other’s emotional reaction is, by reading facial expression.
People put these clues together to help guide quick decisions about what to do to
be ready for what may be coming next. Social learning is the ongoing process of
watching other peoples’ attention shifts, actions, and reactions. The face plays an
important role in this process.

What is this boy so horrified by? If you saw him looking above you with this expression,you
would probably look for yourself to see what was so scary.

5.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Players can engage in social learning from well-designed characters just as
they do with people. In The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, the player’s character
gives hints about what to do and where to go with his large and expressive eyes
(see Figure 5.7). For example, in Clip 5.1 on the DVD, Link’s gaze is tracking on the
lantern that the player must swing from to get across the room. Such subtle cues
help guide beginners, or players struggling with the next insight, into the right
actions intuitively, avoiding the need for overt hints from guide characters or from
the interface itself.
Empathy and Emotional Feedback with Faces
As people scan others’ faces for emotional expressions, their own faces involuntar-
ily respond. Mirroring the expression on another’s face with your own helps estab-
lish connection and demonstrates empathy. During a conversation with someone
retelling a sad event, for example, you may mirror the grief in the face of the teller.
Listening to a funny story, you may put on a happy expression at the moment when
the teller describes a happy surprise, showing that you are emotionally on board for
the tale (see Figure 5.8).
Curiously, this mirroring can have an impact on our own emotions (see
Figure 5.9). Making a face seems to trigger the emotion that is “faked.” The facial
feedback hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, has been tested in modern times
with a rather ingenious study. Researchers had participants hold a penlike object in
their mouth, either with their lips wrapped fully around it or just clenched in the
teeth with the mouth open, which triggered use of the muscles that form a smile
(see Figure 5.10). The participants were told they were testing ways for disabled
people to hold writing utensils. Both sets of people rated how funny the same

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
cartoons were—those who had a “smile” on their faces rated the cartoons as
funnier (Strack, Martin, and Stepper)!
Given the fact that people unconsciously mimic facial expressions when they
are sympathetic, and that this can cause an emotional feedback loop, the player-
character’s face becomes an important tool in a designer’s arsenal for crafting the
right flow of emotion for players.
Good character designers direct player emotions by using player-characters to
underscore desirable feelings (such as triumph or suspense) and to minimize unde-
sirable ones (such as fear or frustration). For example, in Super Monkey Ball 2,
the player-characters show intense joy when they succeed, and have ongoing cheer
and energy-level which make this party game even more fun (see Figure 5.11). In
Clip 5.2, the player-character dances while the player selects which obstacle course
to tackle next. In Clip 5.3, the player-character celebrates after a win (the cues are
especially noticeable in the instant replay at the end of the clip).
In The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, the designers also help guide and shape
the player’s emotions through Link’s reactions to what is happening. In Clip 5.4 Link
is shot out of a cannon by the pirate (see Figure 5.12). His expressions shift from fear
to determination as the countdown takes place. During game play, Link’s expression
is one of resolve and courage, regardless of the obstacles that he faces.
Social Relationships and the Face
The expressions on human faces are not simply automatic reflections of internal
feelings nor unconscious imitations of others—they are also consciously controlled
social signals that help people connect. Researchers have demonstrated that
151

5.10
Participants in a study who held a penlike object in their mouth in a way that forced them to use
their smile muscles rated cartoons as funnier than those who held the object with pursed lips.

CHAPTER FIVE • THE FACE
humans use emotional expressions much more when in the presence of other
people (see Figure 5.13). For example, a study of the expressions on the faces of
Olympic winners at the moment of victory showed that they generally wore a smile
only when they knew others were watching their expressions. The smiles that they
put on for others were genuine (not “fake” smiles) but were nonetheless replaced
with other expressions in less public moments. Intentionally displayed facial expres-
sions help convey intentions and relationships to others and fulfill social obligations
to have certain feelings at certain times (for example, the persistent smile of the
flight attendant—see Hochschild, 2003).

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Some facial expressions that are used to communicate social intent include
• friendly or suspicious expressions (an important first impression factor, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 1),
• dominant or submissive facial reactions (also mentioned in Chapter 1), and
• ongoing facial reactions to shared experiences and stories (see Figure 5.14). The
degree and manner of empathetic emotions in a person’s face helps tell another
that he or she is connected and on the storyteller’s team. (The ways that social
roles shape the use of emotional expressions will be discussed in greater detail in
Part IV.)

CHAPTER FIVE • THE FACE
Great character designers make use of NPC (nonplayer-character) reactions to the
player’s character to help build connection to game goals and to show the player
her social role in the gameworld. In The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, Link’s
initial social relationships to three women—his sister (Figure 5.15), his grandmother
(Figure 5.16), and a pirate girl (Figure 5.17)—help to quickly and intuitively set up
the player’s game goals and play style.
Link’s little sister is dear to his heart and relies on him entirely. Her face is ador-
ing and trusting (see Figure 5.15). In Clip 5.5, she is stolen from him by an evil
bird. The player’s motivation to save her is enhanced by the emotional bonds
created through the use of facial expressions.
Link’s grandmother is very proud of him, and she acts as a slightly
smothering mother figure (see Figure 5.16). In Clip 5.6 she gives him the
clothes that mark his coming of age, and his reluctance and irritation is classic
adolescent behavior.
Petra the Pirate is a bit patronizing to Link, but helps him along (see Figure 5.17).
In Clip 5.7, she treats him as a bossy older sister might.
The use of facial expressions as a rich source of information about the NPC’s
relationship to the player-character is apparent in each clip. These social expres-
sions are a subtle and intuitive way to help guide the player’s motivations
and intentions.

Design Pointers
Here are some recommendations for taking game characters further with face-
work:
5.3.1
Give the Character’s Face the Right Mobility
Visual design and animation style should take into account the social messages
a designer wants to communicate. If you want to use gaze to teach the player,
consider making a character’s eyes larger, with high contrast between pupils
and whites of eyes, so that gaze direction is easy to determine (like Petra in
Figure 5.18). If you want the player to connect emotionally to a character’s

CHAPTER FIVE • THE FACE
156
face, make sure that the key expressions—surprise, anger, happiness, and
sadness—are quite legible for the player. Your facial modelers and animators may
want to take a look at Ekman and Friesen’s Facial Action Coding System (2002)
to make sure you have the right range of motion for the emotions you want to
convey. You will also probably want to test how readable expressions are in
game-play conditions when the player is focusing on many things at once.
5.3.2
Use the Face to Telegraph Intention
To help guide the player, consider using the technique from The Legend of
Zelda: The Windwaker presented earlier on page 149 (also used by Max Payne
and a handful of other games): give the player clues about what is active in
the environment through gaze (see Figure 5.19).
5.3.3
Use the Player-Character’s Face to Inspire and Control Player
Emotions
You can influence the player’s emotions by giving the player-character strong
positive reactions to happy events and calm and determined reactions to
adversity. Think about the emotions you want to enhance or minimize for
players when crafting the player-character’s emotional reponses (for example,
the look of grim determination on the monkey’s face in Figure 5.20).
5.3.4
Use NPC Faces to Enhance Social Relationships with the Player
Armed with a plan for the relationships the player-character has with each
NPC in your game (for example, by creating a relationship diagram as
The faces of characters in The Legend of Zelda:The Windwaker have simple,exaggerated

discussed in Chapter 2), you can map out what sorts of feelings each NPC
would have toward the player, at any given moment in the game. Then you
can craft the NPCs’ facial expressions to show how they feel, evoking reac-
tions from the player to help drive and motivate game play (see Figure 5.21).
These emotions might be positive (e.g., nurturing a sister) or negative (e.g.,
being goaded by a bossy pirate)—both types of emotion can support a player’s
motivation through relationship-based reactions.
Consider using the player-character’s gaze to show the player where to focus.Image

CHAPTER FIVE • THE FACE
5.4
Summary and What Is Next
This chapter highlighted the importance of the face in social interaction, introduc-
ing psychological research about how the face is used in social learning, in fostering
empathy, and as a communication tool in relationship building. Examples from The
Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker and Super Monkey Ball 2 illustrated ways design-
ers can make use of these effects in character designs. Chapter 6 continues this
overview of characters’ social equipment, turning to bodies and the role they play
in social interaction.

Exercise: Contagious Emotions
Can a character’s face really affect your emotions as you play? Test the
power of this effect in one of these ways:
1. Using Web cameras, try playing an online turn-taking game (like tic-
tac-toe, checkers, chess, or go), either with or without being able to
see your opponent’s face on video as you play. How did seeing his or
her face affect the game play experience?

The Body
6.1
What Is Covered and Why
Bodies reveal a wealth of information about people and their relationships. Designers
have far more options for range and subtlety in character movement today with
better animation tools and more powerful platforms. Although character animators
do focus a great deal of attention on the body language of individual characters,
there is still little consideration of how characters move in relation to one another.
This chapter examines some of the social messages bodies convey, with examples
from games that make use of these cues in characters—ICO, SSX™3, and There. The
chapter concludes with tips for taking advantage of body language in character
design. The chapter also includes an interview with one of the designers of There
about the forward-thinking choices made in designing the player avatars for this
highly social environment.
6.2
The Psychological Principles
Studying human movement and its place in social relations is not an easy task.
Until recently, there were no adequate technologies for recording and systematically
analyzing motion. Even with these tools in hand, it is difficult to translate insights
about holistic impressions of personality or social connection into quantifiable and
testable predictions. This predicament is not improved by the fact that most people
are dimly, if at all, aware of the incredible impact of bodies in social interaction.
Ask the average person if they think body language plays a big part in their assess-
ment of others, and they are likely to say no, even when research results show that
they are sensing and making decisions based upon body cues (Nass, Isbister, and
Lee 2000).
Body cues have a pervasive influence on social relationships and are therefore an
important part of crafting truly engaging game characters that feel lifelike and that
evoke social reactions from players. This chapter will present some of what has
been unearthed in this still-evolving area of social psychology.
161

CHAPTER SIX • THE BODY
6.2.1
Bodies Show Relationship
Interpersonal Distance and Touch
One way to begin considering how bodies work in social interaction is to consider
what proximity (how close people are together when they interact) says about rela-
tionship. Consider Figures 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 for a moment. Most people guess that
the first pair are colleagues or new acquaintances. The second pair tends to look
like more familiar friends, and the third pair like a couple. Something as simple
as how close people stand together has a profound affect on what they are com-
municating about their relationship. Edward Hall, a well-known anthropologist,
made observations of four zones of interpersonal space in U.S. social contexts:
• Public distance. Standing more than 12 feet apart. At this distance, it is easy to
see everyone’s full body. Typically, people will slightly exaggerate their expres-
sions and movements so that they are easy to interpret.
• Social distance. Standing 4 to 12 feet apart. This is the zone that most people
hover within at parties—the closer they stand within this range, the better they
probably know one another.

CHAPTER SIX • THE BODY
• Personal distance. Standing 18 inches to 4 feet apart. At this distance, it is easy
to read subtle facial expressions. This is the distance that people use for more
private conversations.
• Intimate distance. Less than 18 inches apart. This allows the people to easily
touch and even to smell one another.
As was mentioned in Chapter 3, social distances vary depending upon culture and
subculture, but the principle holds true: people can tell very quickly by the dis-
tance between people how likely it is that they are already in a close relationship.
Types of touch also contributes to how people perceive relationships (see Figure 6.4).
Some key purposes of touch include:
• Function. Touch as part of a task, such as a doctor’s examination or a coach clar-
ifying a movement.
• Social ritual. Rituals such as handshakes or cheek kisses.
• Friendship building. Touches that show care and liking for another, such as a pat
on the shoulder or a hug.
• Intimacy. Touch that expresses sexual interest and/or emotional connection.
164
Touch communicates social connection.

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
165
In ICO, the player-character (the young boy carrying the stick) finds a trapped
princess very early on in game play. From this moment forward, the player takes
care of her. The princess (Yorda), is not really able to defend herself and is not as
agile as the player-character. She must be led by the hand to ensure that she tags
along, and she needs help over obstacles. When the player battles the shadows
that threaten her, she will stay close by (within social distance). (See Figure 6.5
and Clip 6.1 to observe some of their interaction in game play.)
Many players of this game have remarked upon the emotions created by Yorda’s
dependence upon them. This dependence is expressed almost entirely through
body language. By keeping the two characters close, and by using touch as part of
game play, the designers build a powerful connection between the player and
Yorda.
Imitation
Another way people display relationship through bodies is imitation. Without real-
izing it, people often unconsciously mimic the postures and movements of those
around them (Figure 6.6). Certain circumstances evoke this behavior:
• When the other person is more dominant. People tend to imitate those who have
more social influence than they do.
• If seeking assistance. If a person needs something from another, she or he will
begin to adapt the other’s poses when making a request.

interaction). ICO is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. ©2001 Sony

Gesture imitation happens in many everyday social contexts; becoming aware of it can help
reveal underlying social structures.
F I G U R E
6.6
• When absorbed in conversation with someone. Researchers have noticed that
gesture synchrony happens more when people are highly engaged with an inter-
action.
People tend to avoid imitating someone’s postures and gestures if in competition
with them (see Figure 6.7).
One way to explore the power of imitation is to do some observation in everyday
life. For example, in a meeting at work, it is possible to observe body dynamics:
who around the table is already holding similar postures? Are they people who
share the same views? If you introduce a new pose (such as clasping your hands on
your head), do people take the same pose? To directly observe the unconscious
nature of these effects, you might ask them if they were aware that they copied your
pose. Most likely, they will say no. Your colleagues can probably tell you who got
along with whom in the meeting but may not be able to articulate exactly how
body language affected their perceptions.
Social Grouping
People also communicate relationship in the ways they orient themselves toward
others during the ebb and flow of group interaction. From a young age, humans learn
which groups are open to our approach and which are not by observing whether
group members seem to “open up” space as we approach. Turning to acknowledge

new arrivals, and including them in the sweep of one’s gaze shows acceptance.
“Turning a cold shoulder” is likely to cause the new person to hesitate, and if the
situation does not change, to move on to some other group (see Figure 6.8).
There are many online 3D social environments and games but few with as
natural and inviting a use of body language as There. Figure 6.9 and Clip 6.2
show how There avatars glance toward the speaker who is taking the current turn
and realign themselves as a group to allow newcomers to enter and exit. These
subtle automated touches help to tip the balance toward friendly interaction
among players. For an in-depth discussion of the design choices made in creating
There, see Section 6.4 for the interview with Chuck Clanton.
6.2.2
Bodies Communicate Identity
Posture and movement also communicate who people are as social individuals—
what they will be like to interact with and what to expect from them.
Each of the people in Figure 6.10 is sending social signals through posture and
movement—clues about how they are feeling and about their general persona.

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
171
Putting a name on the kinds of qualities one can observe in these examples, and
understanding their underlying dimensions, has been an ongoing challenge for psy-
chologists. Some nonverbal qualities easily map to broader traits, such as friend-
liness or dominance (which were discussed in Chapter 2). Others seem specific to
movement itself. One researcher analyzed nonverbal style by systematically collect-
ing words for movement qualities and asking people to rate friends’ movement
styles using these words (Gallaher 1992). Based on the results, she came up with a
few key factors:
• Expressiveness. Using a lot of variety and energy in expressions and gestures
when talking with others.
• Animation. Showing a lot of energy in general movement—a bouncy walk, quick
reactions, and so on.
• Expansiveness. Taking up more space with one’s body in movement.
• Coordination. Moving smoothly and with grace.
She found statistical connections between these movement qualities and personal
qualities. For example, someone who was habitually fearful would typically show
less expansive movement and less animation.
She also found a gender-related pattern: women tended to score higher on the
expressiveness scale, while men scored higher on the expansiveness scale. And she
found trends of connection between a person’s body type and their movement
style: heavier people were rated as less animated and more expansive; taller people
were rated as more expansive, and people with more muscle were rated as more
animated and coordinated.
Gallaher’s findings mesh well with the movement analysis dimensions
developed by a famous early-twentieth-century dance researcher, Rudolf Laban
(Laban 1974). He created a system of movement analysis in which he coded
the following dimensions:
• Space. Whether movement is indirect and wandering or to the point (shooing
flies versus threading a needle).
• Weight. A light movement seems weightless and easy; a strong movement shows
much force behind it (brushing your fingers across a flower’s petals versus
wringing a towel).
• Time. Sustained actions seem to take their time; sudden actions are rapid and
over quickly (petting a cat versus grabbing the cat as it is about to escape from
the house).
• Flow. Free movement looks loose and uncontrolled; bound movement looks
quite controlled and perhaps even rigid (a dog shaking water off itself versus
balancing a biscuit on its nose).

Laban crafted a system of movement notation to diagram the qualities of
any given action. In Figure 6.11a Laban’s parameters for movement are arranged
in a notational space, and in Figure 6.11b, the effort diagram of someone screwing
a lighbulb into place shows how the notation gets used for a particular motion.
There has been recent work examining the Laban signatures of emotionally-
driven movement, clustering emotional movements into different effort signatures
(Fagerberg, Ståhl, and Höök 2004). These researchers found some interesting
clusters of emotions (see Figure 6.12):
• Excitement, anger, and surprised–afraid (all flexible, fluent, and quick motions)
• Sulkiness, surprised–interested, pride, satisfaction (all direct, light, bound, and
sustained motions)
• Sadness, being in love (sustained, fluent, light, and direct motions)

6.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
173
There is no definitive empirical strategy for analyzing motion as it expresses
emotion, mood, or more enduring personality traits. However, working from
Gallaher’s and Laban’s dimensions, it is possible to create a profile of a charac-
ter’s style of movement that can be useful for a design team in guiding choices
about animation details. Thinking about a character’s likely emotions in a social
encounter, and about the character’s overall personality and build and how these
will impact motion, will help take full advantage of the character’s body as a
social instrument.
Designers of professional sports games invest considerable design time in
recreating the signature moves and general style of athletes from real-world
teams. Even games such as SSX™3 that do not explicitly recreate famous athletes,
exaggerate the qualities that everyday people envy in athletes: their high level of
coordination and the magical way they have of making difficult movements seem
light, weightless, flowing, and with a sense that they have all the time in the
world at their disposal (see Figure 6.13). Watching Clip 6.3 while keeping Laban’s
dimensions of effort—space, weight, time, and flow—in mind, it becomes appar-
ent that these characters lift the player out of the everyday by heightening these
qualities.
In contrast, consider again the movements of the player-character and Yorda
in ICO (see Figure 6.14 and Clip 6.1). Neither has nearly the coordination and

smooth grace of the athletes. The player-character uses rapid, sometimes clumsy
movements. Yorda is more flowing but also clumsy. Both characters create a
sense of vulnerability and dependence through their movements, heightening the
tension for the player and perhaps increasing the urge toward teamwork for
survival. By manipulating body movements, the designers have subtly pressured
the player’s game-play strategy and emotions.

DESIGN POINTERS
175
6.3
Design Pointers
6.3.1
Think between Characters
When coming up with initial character concepts and sketches, think not just
about how each character behaves in isolation but also about the relationships
between characters. How does this character feel about that one? How does
he express this in how he moves? Does he keep a greater distance from the
other? Are his movements more closed and tense around the other? It is possi-
ble to provide a much richer and more socially realistic experience for the
player if designs are grounded within the larger social framework of the inter-
actions between bodies.
6.3.2
Use Touch and Interpersonal Distance
Consider using touch and interpersonal distance to help players understand
character relationships and to enhance emotional reactions to what is going
on. If a player is being mentored by a character, why not have that character
give the player’s character a friendly pat on the shoulder? If a player is
closer to one character and not friendly with another, show this in how
close they stand when they talk and how their bodies orient toward one
another. You can even incorporate social touch into core game-play dynam-
ics, as in ICO, expanding the notion of physical contact in games beyond
trading blows.
6.3.3
Imitation: A Missed Opportunity
The principle of imitation was included in this chapter, although I could not
find a good current game example, leading me to believe that this is a pow-
erful, missed design opportunity. Consider how the subtle imitation of a
powerful character’s movements by more submissive characters could
enhance their apparent authority and charisma. Imagine showing shifting
alliances in a complex RPG through imitation by characters. Envision show-
ing friendship networks and hierarchies in a social online game through
automated imitation by player-characters. Think creatively about making use
of imitation.
6.3.4
Group Dynamics
The designers at There have demonstrated the value of incorporating group
dynamics into 3D chat. When creating a multiplayer environment, consider
building and extending from their work to help make the game more socially
realistic and engaging.

CHAPTER SIX • THE BODY
176
6.3.5
Extend a Game’s Character-Style Palette
When planning how characters will move, consider the signature dimensions
of body movement that were discussed earlier and choose a palette of physical
qualities that evokes the experience you want the player to have. Not all char-
acters should possess the exaggerated grace and flow of professional athletes.
ICO is a splendid example of using some awkward movement traits to create a
different sort of engaging player experience.
Consider taking time during the design phase to give each character a rating
along Gallaher’s dimensions: expressiveness, animation, expansiveness, and
coordination. When crafting specific animations, Laban’s effort dimenions—
space, weight, time, and flow—may be useful for helping to capture the per-
sonality and mood of a character performing that motion.

There is an online social “get-away”environment. ©2005 There.com.All rights reserved.
Q: First of all, a little about There itself: some folks might not consider this a game.
What about you? Do you think that There falls within the “game” context? Why or
why not? What is or are the primary driver(s) for participation in There for players?
Based on strict definitions, There is certainly not a game. It has a physics, which could be
considered rules,but there is no way to win or lose.In the entertainment sense,it is a toy,
something you use for play. Psychologically, it is an immersive environment, a world, and
a place where you can live part of your life.
We thought and talked about There as being a virtual world, a place where games
could be invented and played.Like the real world,much of the fun surrounds rather than
inhabits games. You anticipate a game, you prepare to play or to watch your team, you
talk about what happened afterward and are elated or depressed at the results, sharing
those feelings with others. Like the real world, games result in social fun outside the
game itself.
So, activities in There are certainly games. I ran one of the first Buffy Trivia Contests in
There. It was great fun and definitely a game. One woman knew the answer to every
question and was fast on the buzzer. The contest was so one-sided that we all got quite
silly and giggly,spending more time talking and razzing each other than actually playing.
I talked with contestants and even others who had heard about it for days afterward.
(The winner ended up running most of the Buffy Trivia Contests later because no one
wanted to play against her!)
Most people are attracted to There because of the opportunity to do fun activities
with other people, and they stay in There because they form friendships. Fun activities
include those available in real life, like shopping for the right outfit, and those that are
purely fantasies, like “surfing” the boneyard in Tyr under the full moon on a hoverboard.
For some,their avatar is an extension of themselves so they are living in this virtual world.

CHAPTER SIX • THE BODY
For others, their avatar is a fantasy of some part of themselves they would like to experi-
ence and cannot in any other way. An example of this is selecting an avatar of the oppo-
site gender.It is quite thought provoking as a guy to have a female avatar and see all the
ways other guys relate to me. (And I enjoy all of the possibilities for clothing that are not
available to male avatars.In Elizabethan times,men got to wear all sorts of fancy clothing,
but today most finery is reserved for women. In the animal kingdom, adornment of the
male is commonplace, often more than of the female.Too bad for modern men, but in a
virtual world, you can choose to have a female avatar and take advantage of all of the
wonderful clothing that exists in There.)
Q: There seems to be primarily a social activity space. Did this focus of play affect
how you developed player-character styling,animation,and actions? How so?
Yes, very much so.Very early in the development of There, we initiated a project called
“avatar-centric communication.” The team working on this was Jeffrey Ventrella, who
codesigned most of this with me; Fernando Paiz, who was our lead engineer and a very
creative contributor; and Ko Patel, another very creative engineer who contributed
many ideas as well. Tom Melcher, the president at that time, was really our executive
producer and a creative contributor as well. We believed very strongly that There
would be primarily a social place. So talking with others would be extraordinarily
important. In real life, talking in person has great value compared to a disembodied
voice, like the telephone, or even this email conversation. We knew we needed to
express that value in There to realize the benefit of having an avatar. Otherwise, you
might as well use email and IM.There are several reasons why having a conversation in
a body in a place is important. The place itself adds context. Talking while looking out
at an incredible vista from the top of a volcano is very different from meeting someone
in a small dark tomb whose hidden entrance you just discovered. A crowded bar adds
a different flavor than the seashore. The greatest value comes from the body of your
avatars,body language.
Body language appears in two ways . . . autonomic and intentional.The autonomic
nervous system is what keeps you alive, it runs your heartbeat and breathing. Avatars
breath and move around slightly all of the time, just like humans. This makes them
seem alive. Intentional expressions are driven by the intentions of the user.You can use
the smiley language to smile or laugh or cry. In addition, if you use certain words
like “yes” and “no” in your chat balloons, your avatar nods or shakes its head. In fact,
we keep track of the emotional state of the body language you use and the level of
attention based on how much you are chatting, and change the poses of the avatar
continuously to make the ongoing body language of your avatar consistent with the
conversation. And finally, there are many elements to body language that create social
context. For example, when someone joins a conversation group, everyone looks at
them briefly.This makes you feel acknowledged and welcome but is much too small a
behavior to require that the user control it. So our avatars do these nearly subcon-
scious social acts as part of their autonomic behavior, and it makes conversations feel
much more natural.
178

6.4
INTERVIEW: CHUCK CLANTON
The styling of the avatars went through several iterations. Our first avatars were very
simple and cartoonlike and incredibly expressive. Cartoon faces can do things that
real faces cannot. But they were so cartoonlike that it was hard to “inhabit”the avatar as
yourself. We then made avatars that were much more realistic. This caused expressivity
of the faces to suffer. So the final version you see today is somewhat less realistic and
more expressive.
And just as the avatars are somewhat less realistic in order to be more expressive, we
also added emotional expressions that are familiar but not realistic . . . what we call
moodicons.I can send a big red heart from my chest to yours with the smiley language or
cause yellow question marks to rise out of my head. We are all familiar with this language
from cartoons,and it has a lot of emotional power that mere expressions do not.
Q: I notice that the There avatars move on their own during chat.Why is this? What did
you have in mind when designing these animations? Have you done any play testing
of player reactions to this low-level autonomy of their avatars? If so,how did they feel?
I did dozens of play tests as we progressed through the avatar-centric communication
project. Of course, we tried many variants and found many dead ends as well as
fortuitous discoveries. Social autonomic behaviors have a very significant impact
on improving the sense of presence and welcome and involvement in the group. For
example, if others look at you when you speak, you feel their presence and you are more
likely to talk and feel involved.
Another element that bears mentioning is the camera. In most virtual worlds, there is
a single, fixed third-person camera that trails your avatar and creates the experience of
having a body in the world.However,in films,the camera is used much more expressively.
Studies on the psychology of TV and film show that the bigger an image is on your retina,
the greater its emotional impact. That’s why the close-up shot in film is used to create
emotionally powerful scenes. In There, we wanted social interactions to have similar
power.So we created a cinematic camera for conversational groups. When someone uses a
strong emotional expression like laughing, the camera cuts to their face briefly to give
power to that expression. Play testing did prove that this was very powerful, but it could
also be annoying. In large conversational groups, the camera cuts felt distracting, and we
also noticed that most members used fewer emotions and focused more on chat in that
setting.So,over time,we carefully tuned the context where camera cuts would be used.
We also gave users control over the camera so they could accept the default view on
joining a conversational group, which shows everyone but is quite distant, or they could
rotate and zoom the camera in to better see what they are interested in.So, for example,
when seated in the audience at a stage, you can choose to have a close-up camera view
of the people on the stage or of the audience or of yourself and your nearest neighbors.
In some games, audience members may need to talk among themselves, which is best
done with one camera, and then call out answers to someone on a stage, which is best
viewed with a different camera.
The camera is one of the most powerful tools in There for creating social spaces and
increasing the expressive power of body language.

readers about choices you made in developing the player-characters for There
(body language or any other factors)?
The avatar-centric communication project went through three major phases that
reveal the power of iterative design. We created an initial prototype for two avatars
where conversations could occur any time the two approached one another face to
face. Most of the social and body language features were invented in this phase. Our
intelligent cinematic camera worked very well, and we were all sold by this prototype
on the success of our approach. Then we added more avatars, and the camera could
not be made to work. It is a very hard problem finding good camera angles to view
everyone in a conversation when they are allowed to stand in arbitrary positions rela-
tive to one another in the world, and without a good camera, most of the emotional
power disappears.We needed avatars to be in specific positions to engage in conver-
sation.We invented the chatprop, and our first chatprop was the loveseat.The loveseat
was a two-person bench where we imagined a couple sitting, talking, flirting,
arguing . . . and we made the camera change its position as the avatars changed their
poses. If you sat facing your partner, the camera shot would emphasize togetherness.
If you turned away, it would emphasize separation.This chatprop was great, but unfor-
tunately it was a dead end. In almost every other chatprop, emotional expression of
pose and camera view needed to be separately controlled. Another iteration in our
design lead to many chatprops, like a living room with a sofa and two chairs, a stage
with audience seats, where camera view is directly controlled. All during this phase,
conversational groups could only form when seated, never when standing around in
the world because we did not know how to solve the camera problem with free-form
groups. We knew what we wanted, but it was very difficult to program. We wanted
avatars to be nudged into fixed positions relative to one another when they started
talking. And we finally figured out how to do it. So, today if you walk up and talk to
another avatar, you are both nudged into a specific position relative to one another,
and the camera works correctly to show the conversation and cut to your facial
expressions. Others can come up and join the conversation, and everyone moves
sideways slightly to let them in.
We began with a simple prototype that allowed conversations in the world to work
well, it didn’t scale, we had to solve many problems along the way, and finally we came
full circle to solving our original problem. Of course, there were many design areas like
this. For example, chat balloons rise from each avatar and their order tells you about the
conversational order.If they rise too fast,it is impossible to follow the conversation.So we
designed a fairly complex scheme to make conversations as legible as possible by keep-
ing the chat balloon ascent as slow as possible during heavy chat.
Q: Do you think your players are conscious of all the body language you’ve put into
the avatars?
I know they are not conscious of it from play-testing results, but it has its intended effect
without calling attention to itself.

Summary and What Is Next
This chapter discussed some of the social cues bodies convey about a person’s rela-
tionships and identity, using examples from games that make use of these principles.
Design suggestions were made for incorporating body cues into character designs,
including the missed opportunity of imitation. Chapter 7 will complete this section
on using characters’ social equipment with a discussion of the power of the voice.

Exercise: Social Bodies
Watch a movie together, with the sound turned off. Look for the social
uses of the body that were discussed in this chapter: interpersonal dis-
tance, touch, identity, social grouping, and attitude. As you watch,
pause and rewind the movie whenever necessary to get a better look at
particular examples. Have one person jot down notes about where and
how body dynamics are being used in the film that you can use later
as reference. Working in teams, design and begin to animate a party of
characters for an RPG that use some of the behaviors you saw, focus-
ing on how the space and actions between characters work.

CHAPTER
Seven
The Voice
7.1
What Is Covered and Why
Chapters 5 and 6 were about social cues that engage the eyes. This chapter is
devoted to the ear. Chapter 7 completes the discussion of characters’ basic social
equipment with discussion of the voice—the rich messages that people convey
through how they say things.1 The chapter includes an overview of the kinds of
social cues that the voice conveys, with many listenable examples from games
(including Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Final Fantasy X, The Sims™, Grim Fandango,
and Curse of Monkey Island), and offers design tips for considering the aural side of
social signals when crafting character voices. Chapter 7 also includes discussion of
some future-facing voice technology and an interview with two pioneers in using
emotion detection from voice cues to adjust interfaces.
7.2
The Psychological Principles
Before reading this section, take a moment to listen to the first two voice samples
on the DVD (Clips 7.1 and 7.2). While listening to each person, try to form a
mental picture: How old are they? What gender? Is this person of high or low
status? Are they in a good or bad mood? Then see Section 7.9 for photos of the
speakers. Most likely you correctly identified the majority of these visible traits
from voice alone.
Listening to a person’s voice on the telephone, you can often make a good guess
about age, gender, social status, mood, and other characteristics without any visual
cues to help. Even if the person is speaking another language and you cannot
understand the meaning of the speech, you can still get pretty far in assessing these
qualities. How is this possible?
Researchers point to the evolutionary roots of speech in the grunts and calls of
our primate ancestors. There are striking similarities in the vocal characteristics of
fright, anger, and dominance, among other social cues, when one compares primate

1Analyzing the social meaning of what characters say moves into the territory of linguistics,
which would require a book in and of itself. For further reading on this topic, see (Clark 1996).

CHAPTER SEVEN • THE VOICE
184
and human voices. Researchers who asked participants in a study to listen to male
macaque monkeys found that more than 80% of the listeners could accurately
identify what the dominance calls meant (Tusing and Dillard 2000, 149).
Social scientists refer to the information that is not conveyed by the words
in speech as paralinguistic cues. A large proportion of the meaning in everyday
conversation emerges through paralinguistic cues—shifts in voice quality while
speaking, pauses, grunts, and other nonlinguistic utterances. Paralinguistic cues
play an even bigger role in communication between people who already know
each other well—a well-placed sigh or lack of a heartfelt tone conveys volumes.
To make characters seem richly human in their communication, then, a designer
should have a solid understanding of what they are conveying with how they
say things.
7.2.1
The Mechanics of Speech
To speak, a person pushes air from the lungs through the larynx, mouth, and nose.
The pitch and the qualities of sounds are affected in two different ways: phonation
and articulation. Phonation is the way a person moves the larynx itself to make the
initial sound. When the shape of the muscle folds in the larynx (which used to
be called the vocal cords) is altered, it produces different sound pitches (called
fundamental frequencies) and also different sound qualities, such as breathiness or
harshness. These qualities can shift due to a person’s emotional state—tenseness,
tiredness, depression, and excitement all can have effects on phonation. Articula-
tion is when a person uses the natural resonance of the mouth, nose, and even of
the chest cavity, as well as moving the tongue and lips and palate, to alter the
sound as it comes out. People are very sensitive to shifts in articulation—for
example, a person can “hear” a smile in another’s voice, in part because the shift
in lip shape when speaking affects the articulation of the sound (see Figure 7.1).
Listen to audio Clips 7.3 and 7.4 on the DVD. Can you tell which recording was
made while smiling? See Section 7.9 for the answer.
As with facial expression and gesture, some of what people hear in others’
voices comes from their physical qualities and their body’s involuntary reactions to
circumstances. Some comes from learned strategies and responses to social circum-
stances. For example, gender and age come across in voice because of physical
qualities of the person’s vocal equipment itself (which can be a problem for people
whose voices fall outside the usual range for their gender or age group). Mood and
emotion are signalled involuntarily (at least in part) because of changes in vocal
production as the person’s nervous system reacts—for example, the dry mouth and
speedier heart rate of anxiety also have effects on the muscles in the larynx and on
breathing itself. However, a person can also mold the tone of his or her voice in
some ways, adopting a pacifying, pleading, arrogant, or neutral tone of voice using
intonation and rhythm (referred to as prosody by researchers). Failing to adopt the
proper social tone of voice is a communication in and of itself.

7.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
7.2.2
The Social Signals in Voice
Emotion in Voice
Emotions underpin decision-making, including social action and reaction (see
[Damasio 1994] for a fascinating account of the role of emotions in thinking). Know-
ing that another person is angry is crucial to understanding how they are interpreting
social actions and the world at large, thus helping to predict what they might do
next. Failure to recognize emotional expression is a serious liability in human inter-
action—it is in fact a symptom of some disorders in the autism spectrum.
Chapter 5 touched upon Ekman and colleagues’ work on recognizing facial
expressions of emotion. There has also been extensive work on the expression
of emotion in the voice. Voice researchers have found, when they look for con-
sistent signatures of emotions, that there are clear patterns (see [Kappas, Hess, and

Both phonation— the action of the larynx (vocal cords) and articulation— the shaping of the

information (based on Kappas,Hess,and Scherer 1991).
F I G U R E
7.1

CHAPTER SEVEN • THE VOICE
Scherer 1991; Cahn 1990; and Burkhardt and Sendlmeier 2000] for more detail on
the taxonomy that follows):
• Anger (hot). Tense voice, faster speech rate, higher pitch, broader pitch range
• Anger (cold). Tense voice, faster speech rate, higher fundamental frequency and
intensity, tendency toward downward-directed intonation contours
• Joy. Faster speech rate, raised pitch, broader pitch range, rising pitch pattern
• Fear. Raised pitch, faster speech rate, broadened range, high-frequency energy
• Boredom. Slower speech rate, additional lengthening of stressed syllables, lowered
pitch, reduced pitch range and variability
• Sadness (crying despair). Slower speech rate, raised pitch, narrowed pitch range,
narrowed variability
• Sadness (quiet sorrow). Slower speech rate, lowered pitch, narrower pitch range,
narrower variability, downward-directed contours, lower mean intensity, less
precision of articulation
• Depression. Lower intensity and dynamic range, downward contours
Notice the similarities among emotions—fear, anger, and joy all seem to be
signalled by faster speech, higher pitch, and more range. In contrast, quiet sadness,
depression, and boredom share slowing of pace, lower pitch, and less variability.
These effects can be traced back to what is going on in the person’s nervous
system. The arousal of a person’s sympathetic nervous system, which causes things
like increased heart rate and sweating, also causes these changes in the voice.
When a person’s parasympathetic system, which decreases blood pressure and
slows heartrate, moves into action, it also shifts what happens in the voice itself.
A glance back at the Laban movement graphs in Chapter 6 (Figures 6.12 and 6.13)
shows that body movement style also seems to be modulated in this way.
So how do people learn to tell apart the high-energy or low-energy emotions in the
voice? Certainly they use context contributed by the words themselves, but people are
also able to tell what position the mouth is in, based upon sound. As mentioned
above, a person can “hear” a smile. Voice researchers have detected different patterns
of intonation as well—such as the characteristic rising pitch pattern of joy. It is also
the case that people acclimate to one another’s vocal patterns—knowing someone
well includes knowing how they, in particular, signal sadness or joy with their voice.
One game that takes full advantage of the power of paralinguistic cues in con-
veying emotion is The Sims™. Sim characters speak to one another, but their words
are entirely incomprehensible. Simlish may be gibberish, but it is laden with emo-
tional signals, and it allows the player to draw conclusions about how his or her
Sim is feeling in general, and in relation to other Sim characters (see Figure 7.2).
For example, listen to Clip 7.5. As the Sim characters move from joy to jealousy, it is
easy to follow along despite the lack of words.
186

7.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
Interestingly, researchers have found connections between the expression of
emotion in the human voice and strategies for evoking emotion through music. Two
researchers performed a meta-analysis of research that had been done on evoking
specific emotions with music, with work on emotions in speech. Data “strongly sug-
gest . . . that there are emotion-specific patterns of acoustic cues that can be used to
communicate discrete emotions in both vocal and musical expressions of emotion”
(Juslin and Laukka 2003, 799). This makes sense if one considers that the playing of
musical instruments tends to reflect the muscular tension and general arousal state
of the performer—creating a bridge to the listener into a particular emotional state.
Some games, for example, Grim Fandango, make use of this connection between
music and emotion to heighten the player’s experience of a character’s emotional
reactions. See Figure 7.3 and Clip 7.6, in which Manny’s boss berates him for a

mistake. Notice the music in the background, which displays some of the same
aural qualities as the boss’s tirade.
Social Context and Identity
As researchers begin to assemble a more detailed picture of how the voice con-
tributes to social interaction, one thing they are realizing is that emotion is not
necessarily the predominant message communicated. Researchers in Japan who
gathered a large body of recorded speech by asking people to wear headsets around
in everyday life, found few examples of strong emotion in voices. Day to day, peo-
ple tended to keep their emotional reactions mostly to themselves. What did show
up were big differences in patterns of voice depending upon who the person was
speaking to—adjustment based on social roles and relationships (Campbell 2004)
and, of course, individual differences in vocal style that emerged from each person’s
own personality and physical qualities.
Some traces of social roles and relationships in voices can be broken down along
the dimensions first discussed in Chapter 2: cues of dominance and of friendliness.
People demonstrating dominance tend to lower their voice somewhat and to
construct shorter utterances in general. They may sometimes speak more loudly,
depending upon the situation. Showing submission with voice involves using a
softer, more highly pitched voice, and subordinates tend to say more. As was men-
tioned earlier in this chapter, these general vocal contours of dominance are true of
other primates as well as people. Clips 7.7 and 7.8 demonstrate the difference
between dominant and submissive voices. Although the butler (Raoul) is initially
very dominant, he moves to submissive obsequiousness in the second clip once
Manny has a pass to the VIP lounge (see Figure 7.4). In general, Grim Fandango

makes brilliant use of vocal dominance cues to heighten comic effect. Other exam-
ples of games that use dominance cues in similar ways are The Curse of Monkey
Island (Figure 7.5, Clip 7.9) and Warcraft III (Figure 7.6, Clip 7.10).
Friendliness is shown in various ways. Meeting with a friend usually leads to
warmth and energy in the voice, the signals of joy. Conversation among close
friends includes more range of emotion than between more distant acquaintances—
more revelation of personal emotional state and empathizing with the other’s state

through modulation of your own voice. Intimacy with someone is often reflected
with a more breathy quality in the voice. For an example of the breathiness of inti-
macy, contrast the clips from Grim Fandango above, with Clip 7.11—a conversation
between Manny and his love interest, Meche. Both Manny and Meche have a great
deal of breathiness in their voices.
Individual personality can come through in the voice as characteristic
patterns of emotion and energy. For example, in Grim Fandango, the hat-check
girl is a high-energy character who makes rapid turns from enthusiasm to anger
(see Figure 7.7, Clip 7.12).
Social Interaction Logistics
Vocal modulations during an interaction show that a person is listening and
comprehending and also help to orchestrate turn-taking in conversation. “Back-
channel” responses such as “uh hunh” make the speaker feel the listener is
engaged with what is happening. People also use such noises to indicate that they
are still thinking or to express a range of emotions in response to a statement before
they can put them into words.
Games with elaborate and extensive cut scenes, such as Final Fantasy X,
make artful use of these sorts of cues to reveal the nuances of relationships
among characters (see Figure 7.8).
Back-channel responses may be one reason that people enjoy using voice-
enabled multiplayer online games as well—players can hear the triumph or
despair in one another’s voices as they play, heightening the experience itself, and
can use vocal cues (e.g., “whoa!” or “uhhhh . . .”) to help guide one another’s
actions.

DESIGN POINTERS
Missed Opportunity: Real-Time Vocal Adaptation
Currently, NPCs rarely offer real-time back-channel sounds and comments during
game play. Revealing more complex awareness of a player as well as reactions to
the player through emotion- and information-laden audio cues as play situations
unfold could greatly increase the sense of social presence and connection a player
feels toward an NPC. Imagine a sidekick or a just-rescued character gasping as the
player executes a tricky move or making a subtle noise of doubt and hesitation as
the player starts to move in a fruitless direction.
This will become increasingly practical as voice synthesis becomes more and
more realistic, eliminating the need for a huge body of prerecorded audio files (see
Section 7.8, for more information about speech synthesis).

Design Pointers
Here are some suggestions for heightening character impressions for players
using vocal cues.
7.3.1
Focus on Relationships
As with body language (Chapter 6), it is helpful in audio design to think about
how voice cues will reveal relationships among characters—between NPCs as
well as between the player-character and NPCs (see Figure 7.9). When craft-
ing audio, think about the ongoing relationships between characters and their
social roles in relation to one another, as well as the moment-to-moment
game-play state of the player and how the character can respond to what the
player is experiencing.

CHAPTER SEVEN • THE VOICE
192
7.3.2
Give NPCs Audio Personality
If a character has strong personality traits, make sure they come through in
the voice as well. It is possible to create humorous contrasts between voice
and appearance (as in the case of Daxter from Jak and Daxter, discussed in
Chapter 2; see Figure 7.10).
7.3.3
Use Voice (and Music) as an Emotional Regulator
Character voices can make a player calmer, more enthusiastic, triumphant, so
use voice to shape a player’s emotional experience of game play: light-hearted
words after an intense battle sequence from a sidekick, for example, or a gruff

Future Directions—Emotion Detection
To respond in real time with appropriate emotion, a character needs to know how a
player is feeling. Designers can fake this social awareness to some degree because
much is known about the state of the player from the game engine itself—did the
player just triumph, get badly beaten, and so forth. However, there is work being
done on alternative methods for assessing player emotion. Speech researchers
have been working for years to be able to detect the traces of emotions in voices.
Increases in processing power and in understanding of emotion cues in voices is
beginning to lead to results.

pep talk from a guide or mentor’ if things went badly. Consider using music
to bolster the effects of an NPC’s words, as well as to help manage player
emotions as game play unfolds.
7.3.4
Voice Checklist
When specifying the audio for each character in a game, take a moment to
consider each type of social cue. As audio assets are created, revisit the criteria
to see if the desired qualities are coming through:
• Emotional state. How is this character feeling right now? In general?
Toward the player? Toward other NPCs?
• Social status and context. What is this character’s relationship to the others
in the action? In general? What about right now?
• Interaction logistics with the player and other characters. How does the
character acknowledge the actions and reactions of other characters?
7.5
Interview:MIT Media Lab’s Zeynep Inanoglu
and Ron Caneel
Zeynep Inanoglu and Ron Caneel, graduate students at the MIT Media Laboratory,
have created a program and interface for detecting the emotional content of voice
messages. The system, called Emotive Alert, looks for vocal patterns indicating
valence (positive or negative feelings), activation (level of energy), formality, and
urgency. The system is meant to allow the user to sort and prioritize messages and
to alert the user to those that are most urgent.

CHAPTER SEVEN • THE VOICE
Q: What was your inspiration for creating Emotive Alert?
Emotive Alert was mainly inspired by a seminar that we both attended last spring (2004).
Both of us had various experiences working with speech signals, so when we came up
with the idea, Professor Rosalind Picard, who was giving the seminar, encouraged us to
take on this project. It also helped that Zeynep had access to her group’s voicemail
system and was already using the voicemail data in other projects.
Q: How did you choose the emotions to analyze from the messages?
In addition to the classical valence-arousal dimensions (Russell 1980) (happy/sad and
excited/calm) we chose urgency and formality since these are more interesting to look at
in the voicemail domain. Since our approach only analyzes prosodic speech features
(intonation, perceived loudness, rhythm) we hoped that these features would vary suffi-
ciently in the dimensions that we chose.
Q: Could the method you’ve evolved for analyzing the messages be helpful for
analyzing “trash talk”among players in an online game-play environment?
Our method can be retrained to detect variances from a given speaker’s normal speaking
style. Acoustically, one would hope that these variances imply unusual behavior
(i.e., trash talk in games). However, to make such systems reliable, a key-word spotting
capability should also be incorporated along with acoustic tracking.
Q: Where do you think voice analysis and synthesis are heading next? Will there
be effective real-time analysis of emotion in conversation? What about lifelike
synthesis of emotion in voices?
There is a lot of room to grow in both emotional synthesis and analysis. Effective real-
time analysis of emotion in conversation is a possibility, depending on what emotional
categories we are tracking.The problem is not only an issue of implementation but also
of emotions theories and available emotion data to train these systems on.

Summary and What Is Next
This chapter described social qualities of voices, including emotion, social context,
and identity, and the handling of social logistics in interactions. Design discussion
included the power of ongoing vocal feedback, a missed opportunity in making
NPCs even more lifelike and engaging, as well as ways to incorporate other social
cues into character vocal design. Part IV shifts focus to particular social functions
that characters have in games and how these should affect design thinking.

Exercise: Developing a Social “Ear”
Each person should capture a brief segment from a movie or television
show in which two characters are speaking. Take turns listening to (not
watching) these brief snippets of dialogue in a group and have everyone
try to identify the relative social status and relationship of the char-
acters as well as their personality traits, emotional state, and as much of
the social context as possible. If there are members of the group fluent
in two languages, they should bring snippets from their second lan-
guage. See if the group can identify status, personality, and emotions
regardless of understanding the words. Discuss what it is that you are
hearing and which cues are the most legible and accurate (e.g., that the
group can most easily identify and agree upon).

PARTFour
Characters in Action
199
What Is Covered and Why
Part IV asks you to step back from the details of people’s social equipment (faces,
bodies, voices) to form an integrated understanding of how characters function as
a game unfolds. Chapters 8 and 9 introduce psychological concepts relevant to the
two major functions that characters play in games: acting as the player’s vessel
in the game world (player-characters), and providing social companionship and
assistance or resistance (nonplayer-characters, or NPCs). Both chapters argue for
an integrated approach to character design, working from game-play mechanics
upward to develop social and emotional roles for characters that are truly supported
in moment-to-moment game play.
As you proceed through these two chapters, you will find that all that has
been covered so far factors into the decisions that will be made about character
psychology in action. Part IV is, in that sense, the culmination of the theoretical
portion of the book. Part V will offer targeted advice about how to apply all of this
to the development process, as well as tools for evaluation of character psychology.
Who Will Find Part IV Most Useful
Part IV will be of value to anyone who works on character design (including those
who program a character’s motion, level designers, and even those creating the
physics of the game)! As with the principles in Part III, successful application
requires the understanding and engagement of more than the media artists on the
project.
Overview of Key Concepts
The Four Layers of Player Characters
Chapter 8 presents four psychological layers in which players experience a
player-character.

A player experiences the player-character at many levels while playing. Here are four layers that
are useful to consider when making design choices.

Social Roles and Defining Emotional Moments
Chapter 9 presents a concept from social psychology and sociology that can be
of great benefit in designing NPCs: social roles. Social roles can provide a frame-
work for predicting where emotional moments with NPCs will be expected by the
player and can help designers focus their efforts to achieve maximum effects.
Chapter 9 includes a detailed break-down of the most commonly found social
roles in games today, from pets to enemies to audiences, with design pointers
focused on creating meaningful social and emotional interactions with the player.
Take-Aways from Part IV
Part IV will give the reader tools drawn from psychological theory for figuring out
when and why player-characters and NPCs engage players. Both chapters empha-
size the importance of keeping the in-game psychological experience of the player

in mind and not leaving character development entirely to cut-scenes. The reader
will leave with guidelines for focusing development efforts, which should be useful
all along the way—from early brainstorming sessions to making tough trade-offs
during production—while still preserving the social and emotional impact of char-
acters. As a follow-up, Part V offers concrete advice on how to incorporate these
guidelines into the development process.

CHAPTER
Eight
Player-Characters
8.1
What Is Covered and Why
Chapter 8 focuses on the central character (in terms of exposure and impact) for
the player in most games: the player character. As was mentioned in the preface,
one powerful reason for taking a psychological approach to character design is the
interactive nature of the gaming experience. Interactivity is at the heart of strong
player-character design.
This chapter presents aspects of player psychology—four levels (or layers) at
which a player-character will be experienced—that should be considered in an
integrated way when designing player-characters. Games that balance these levels
well, such as Half-Life, Max Payne, Grim Fandango, and The Sims™, as well as
games which emphasize particular layers with positive effects, are discussed. The
chapter includes design tips for tuning player-characters based upon this four-layer
model and finishes with an interview with Marc Laidlaw, the writer for Half-Life
and Half-Life 2, about Valve’s approach to player-character design.
8.2
The Psychological Principles
Player-characters are at the heart of the interactive experience of gaming. They
are the interface through which players experience both the physical and social
landscape of the game world. To make good design decisions about a player
character, it is helpful to analyze the ways in which the player is reacting to the
player character from a psychological point of view.
In everyday life as well as in game play, a person is constantly taking in infor-
mation from her or his senses and making decisions about what to do next. These
decisions are affected by the person’s memories and patterns of perception and
action that have been developed over a lifetime. While a full discussion of this
process is well beyond the limits of this book, this chapter introduces four layers
of this psychological process that can provide helpful framing and criteria for
player-character design. (To learn more about any of these layers, see Section 8.7
for relevant pointers.)

CHAPTER EIGHT • PLAYER-CHARACTERS

8.2.1
The Four Layers
The four layers of a player’s psychological experience of player-characters that this
chapter highlights are visceral, cognitive, social, and fantasy (Figure 8.1).
Visceral Feedback
A person experiences the world through the senses. The mind takes in and filters an
incredible amount of information—sights, smells, sounds, haptic feedback—and the
body is constantly reacting and adapting to what is encountered. The visceral level
of a player-character is the sensory experience that a player has of that character,
particularly in the sense of feedback from the character to the player as he or she
takes action.
When a person “plays” a player-character, she or he takes on the player-character’s
body in the game world and adapts his or her reactions to the affordances of the
game world and to the capabilities of the player-character. Conscious consideration
A player experiences the player-character at many levels while playing.Here are four layers that
are useful to consider when making design choices.
F I G U R E
8.1

8.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
of the visceral qualities of a player-character can produce much higher player satis-
faction and engagement with that character.
Facets of visceral feedback include what sorts of physical powers the character
has, how it feels to control them and to move through the world, and the general
effects that actions have on the senses (usually limited to sight and sound, some-
times touch). For example, sports games usually give player-characters a much
greater level of athletic ability—strength, speed, and reaction time—than the player
likely has in everyday life. Platform-based games often give player-characters much
greater leaping capabilities than they would have in real life. Text-based adventure
games provide the player with options for witty repartee that she or he would prob-
ably not be able to rapidly generate left to his or her own devices. In each case, the
player-character provides a pleasurable visceral feedback experience to the player.
Every game has a unique visceral style to it, and when there is a player-character,
she or he becomes the surrogate body for the player through which the visceral
qualities of the game world are experienced.
Cognitive Immersion
A person does not simply react to sensory input in an automatic manner—he or she
also considers information that comes in from the world in a more deliberate way
and makes decisions about what to do next. Problem solving and taking actions in
the world require the player to inhabit the action possibilities of the player charac-
ter. What types of actions can this character effect on the game world and on other
characters, and how do I build these into a plan of action? The player must map
herself or himself cognitively onto the player character. Player-characters that we
inhabit intuitively feel this way in part because the player is able to synchronize his
or her problem-solving strategies with the capabilities of the character. If the player
tries to do things that will not work in the game world, then this mapping is not
working well. An example might be a player who tries to talk to an NPC to get help
with a puzzle and finds that this is impossible, or a player who tries to use a non-
existent jump button to maneuver in a game world.
One aspect of crafting a strong player-character is creating smooth and intuitive
cognitive immersion for the player.
Social Affordances
To the extent that a player-character is part of a social world that gives context to
the game, either between players or among player-characters and in-game NPCs,
designers must also consider the social level at which human beings interpret their
world. There are regions of the brain devoted to recognizing social cues—faces and
voices and the like (signals that were discussed in Part III). Reading social nuances
is an important evolutionary adaptation in human beings, who evolved to live in
groups rather than alone (see Section 2.8 for related references). As was discussed
in Part II, there is variance in social standards, depending upon gender, culture, and
205

CHAPTER EIGHT • PLAYER-CHARACTERS
other variables, which are learned over time. Players will be trying to make sense of
the game world in part through the lens of the player-character’s social capabilities
and context.
Player-characters act as an interesting bridge for the player into a game’s social
world. First of all, the player-character (when viewed from the third-person perspec-
tive) can give a sense of social presence to the player (as with the reactions of the
Super Monkey Ball 2 monkeys when they succeed at a level—see the end of Clip 5.3
and related discussion in Chapter 5). Player-characters also model the social role
and emotions the player should be inhabiting in a game through their actions and
reactions toward NPCs in cut-scenes. And finally, player-characters offer the player
a chance to don a social mask when interacting with other people in a multiplayer
game or when manipulating several characters in a party-based game.
An engaging player-character needs the right social affordances for the game-
play situation at hand, from clear social role and personality, as revealed to the
player in cut-scenes, to customizability of appearance and social cues in multi-
player situations. The player will feel more immersed in the role of the player-
character to the extent that NPCs reflect the player’s social role and qualities back
to him or her during game play (see Chapter 9, which focuses on NPC social roles).
Fantasy Affordances
The last layer of the psychology of player-characters that should be considered in
design takes a step back from modern-day biologically grounded psychology into the
territory of Freud and his colleagues. They believed that people’s fantasies provided
an important window into their past, mental landscape, and action possibilities.
Psychologists in the psychoanalytic tradition (such as [Bruno Bettelheim 1989]) have
touted the importance of stories and other fantasy vehicles in helping both children
and adults come to terms with concerns, explore emotionally laden or thorny
problems, or to create a foundation for making an important identity shift. Games
advocates such as Gerard Jones describe the ways in which games can provide this
sort of outlet for exploration and processing (Jones 2003).
Player-characters are an important component of the fantasy experience of a
game. Powerful player-characters are often those that speak to many players’
real-life hopes, fears, and issues. They offer players a chance to enact them and
explore possibilities.
8.2.2
Putting It All Together
Just as the art of game development as a whole lies in the integration of the
many components of a game into a fluid and engaging player experience, the craft-
ing of a great player-character lies in the integration of all the layers of the player’s
experience of the character in action. The player should feel that the character’s
action possibilities and strategies are engaging and intuitive, that the social
206

8.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
qualities of the character are clear, that she or he can act through this character
socially in an intuitive manner, and that his or her fantasy reasons for playing the
game are well-supported by this character.
It may help to think of the fantasy layer as a sort of veil or webbing that
connects and transforms the other, more bottom-up psychological qualities of the
player character. For this reason, it is crucial to make sure, when brainstorming a
character’s back-story and fantasy persona, that these qualities can emerge for
the player out of the game-play experience of that character, given the genre and
controller constraints of the core game-play dynamics that the team has in mind.
Following are some stellar examples of well-integrated player characters in games
from various genres—action, adventure, and simulation.
Two Well-Motivated Killers: Max Payne and Gordon Freeman
Max Payne and Half-Life are both games that primarily involve shooting. The
player’s physical control in the game is limited (for the most part) to choosing and
firing weapons and navigating terrain. Yet, unlike many other games in their genre,
both Half-Life and Max Payne manage to weave a compelling social and fantasy
kill-or-be-killed world around the player’s visceral and cognitive experience. The
player’s action possibilities feel natural given the constraints of the fantasy world
in which she or he is immersed, and interactions with NPCs resonate with and
underscore the player’s psychological perspective on what is happening.
In Max Payne, the title character almost immediately loses his wife and child to
burglers who seem to have sinister connections. The opening of the game mingles
cut-scenes and game play so that the player almost reaches Max’s family before it
is too late to save them. Their cries and the aftermath make a strong impression on
the player and help to ground Max’s vigilante behavior thereafter. The game uses
graphic-novel style panels to tell the story of the conspiracy against Max as things
progress and to help remind the player of Max’s personality and fighting style.
In Half-Life, the player-character is Gordon Freeman, low-level scientist in a
mysterious facility deep below the desert (see Figure 8.2). After being sent to carry
out a dangerous procedure, he and the other scientists find that the ensuing damage
to the facility means that its charges (dangerous aliens) have escaped and must be
dealt with. Gordon now begins his evolution from lowly lab assistant to competent
alien-killer. Along the way, he encounters scientists and lab workers who help him in
his mission to escape the facility and warn the authorities. His interactions with these
NPCs are brief and practical—there is no time (or need) in the game world for form-
ing relationships. Halfway through the game, he learns that the Marines moving into
the facility are actually not on his side, but want to silence him to keep the mess that
has occurred in this facility a secret, and so he must begin to fight them as well.
In both games, the “shoot first, ask questions later” tactics of shooter games have
been extremely well-motivated by the player-character’s persona and positioning
within the game world. The fantasy layer of the player-character meshes smoothly
with the cognitive and social strategies inherent in the game genre.

bad guys. (See Figure 8.3 and Clip 8.4 for an example of a friendly NPC helping

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
NPC offers to help Max. Usually that character is murdered shortly after providing
assistance, underscoring Max’s need for vigilance and his reasons for not trusting
or getting close to any character in the game.
In Half-Life, NPCs that offer their help act frightened and distant and tend to
stick to business—plausible reactions to the chaotic situation in the Mesa facility.
As in Max Payne, NPCs in Half-Life have a tendency to be killed rather quickly.
The overwhelming majority of interactions with other characters in both games is
with enemies that the player must mow down. Both Max Payne and Gordon Free-
man are men of action because of circumstances beyond their control, and their
minimal social skills and interactions feel perfectly natural in the context of the
game world.
The kinesthetic properties of these two characters have been well-chosen to
match their social and fantasy personas. Gordon’s first weapon is a crow bar—a
plausible beginning for a scientist working with what’s ready-at-hand as he strug-
gles to figure out what’s going on (see Figure 8.4). Killing the crab-like aliens with
a crow bar is an extremely satisfying visceral experience for players (see Clip 8.1).
By the time Gordon encounters the Marines, he has managed to acquire weapons
and expertise that are a match for theirs (see Clip 8.2). The frantic pace of game
challenges underscore Gordon’s sense of urgency (see Clip 8.3).
Max Payne’s nightmarish film-noir world is expressed in game-play kinesthet-
ics as well as cut-scenes. “Bullet time” allows the player to slow time down in the
dreamlike style of John Woo movies. Seeing one’s breath while trudging along in
the snow and other small touches to the physics and visuals of the world help to
underscore the isolated, dreamlike feeling of Max’s urban-underbelly environment.

Some of the game-play scenes are in fact disturbing dream sequences. Max’s use of
pain killers is a clever way to provide the player with health boosters and to insinu-
ate that Max’s sense of reality and time may be distorted.
Overall, both games manage to take the well-worn conventions of the shooter
genre and provide the player with a smoothly integrated and immersive psychologi-
cal experience of the player-character, blending social and fantasy persona, visceral
feel and cognitive strategy.
A Man of Wit and Ingenuity: Manny Calivera
Grim Fandango—another game with a player-character that manages to transcend
many of the limits of its genre—is an adventure game that consists of puzzle solving
in which clues are uncovered through dialogue, exploration, and experimentation
(see Figure 8.5).
Manny Calivera, the player-character, is a humorous and sympathetic underdog.
He is trapped selling travel packages to the newly dead in order to work off his debt
and make the final journey himself. Manny is a small guy who must rely on his wit
and ingenuity to get by in a world filled with thugs and goons. His witty patter and
cleverness fit the mechanics of an adventure game well—the player enjoys
choosing among Manny’s dialogue options and seeing what unfolds with NPCs (see
Figure 8.8 as well as Clips 7.5, 7.6, and 7.9, discussed in Chapter 7). Manny makes
a steady climb in competence and social power as the game progresses, mirroring
the player’s own growing competence with game play.
Grim Fandango (unlike Max Payne or Half-Life) keeps things light, despite the
dark world of the story, with astute touches such as what happens when a character
“dies.” In Grim Fandango, where everyone is already dead, passing on means being
turned into a bed of flowers (Figure 8.6). This helps make the game fit the adventure

genre, where game play is expected to be less viscerally stimulating and more cere-
bral and where comedy often plays a key role.
Living Dolls:The Sims™
The Sims™, a game discussed already in Chapter 4 in some detail, does a great
job of offering players a well-integrated player-character experience of a wholly
different sort.
Likened to a “living dollhouse,” The Sims™ allows a player to tailor individual
characters, as well as their living quarters, to his or her own vision. Players make
choices about the Sims’ jobs and activities and direct their everyday lives—from
making sure they are fed and well-rested to engineering the details of their
social connections.
The props and underlying simulation space of the game lend themselves to the
creation of everyday life environments from affluent suburbs (e.g. Figure 8.7a) to
run-down hovels. The Sim characters’ interactions with one another are an integral
part of game play—the player must keep his or her Sims socially engaged and con-
tent (Figure 8.7b). Sim characters do not actually talk—instead they speak an unin-
telligible language that has very clear emotional range (watch Clip 7.3 from Chapter
7, to see Sim characters conversing). Part of the dynamic of playing the game is
making sure that Sims are getting along (or creating conflict between them).
The Sims’ flexibility extends from social styles into the fantasy aspect of the game.
Sim characters also act as tarot cards for teasing out the fantasies of players, who
create stories that arise from the visceral and cognitive activities in the game. Players
can record Sim activities and share “family albums” with images of their Sims in

action. This feature has been used by players in the aid of creating elaborate graphic
novels available online (see Figure 8.8).
Interestingly, players seem to hop between experiencing their Sim characters as
extensions of themselves and as separate agents. Will Wright, in an interview with
Celia Peirce (Fullerton, Swain, and Hoffman 2004, 133), talks about how players
switch from “I” when they are controlling a Sim, to “he” or “she” when the Sim does
something unexpected or undesirable. Sims walk the line between self and other, and
allow the player to explore identities and fantasies in a flexible and low-risk way.
8.2.3
Focusing Player-Character Psychology:Tools,Puppets,
and Masks
Not every game needs full treatment of player-characters at all four levels—the core
game play of some games can lead to irrelevance or minimal value of a particular
layer. This section examines three styles of in-game player representation that
emphasize subsets of layers of player psychology.
Tools
Warcraft III and DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution (see Figure 8.9) are two
examples of games that do not require much of a social persona for players—but
for different reasons. Warcraft III is a real-time strategy game in which the player
commands a large number of NPCs in war campaigns. The player does not have
a direct character interface to the game—rather she or he uses a heads-up
display to observe what is going on and to give troops directions. Given this

8.2
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
bird’s-eye view of the battles, there is not much need for the player to have a
strong social persona.
DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution is a dancing game in which players step on
foot pads trying to match patterns of arrows on screen. There is not any kind of social
interaction between the player and anyone in the game world. Usually, two players
dance side by side and can interact socially in “real life” if they like, as they dance.
In both cases, including a strong social persona for the player would probably
not enhance the game; rather it would detract, as players would not be able to
meaningfully integrate the social persona into their understanding of game play. In
the case of Warcraft III, there is a fantasy layer that explains the history and goals of
warring factions within the game world, despite the lack of a social persona for the

player. In DDRMAX, there is neither. Warcraft III uses cut-scenes to show the player
the progression of fantasy campaigns and provides a series of major NPCs as focal
points for the plot progression in the absence of a single player-character.
In both cases, the game provides a tool or interface for the player during play,
rather than a highly realized player-character. There is no need for the player to try
to map his or her visceral and cognitive strategies onto a social or fantasy persona
in DDRMAX; in Warcraft III, the player can play in any style she or he likes between
cut-scenes, although the fighting minions have distinctive styles and reactions that
help to underscore the fantasy layer of the game.
Puppets
Games with relatively short cycles of play that are mostly about physical prowess
may not require much in the way of fantasy and social qualities in player-charac-
ters. Instead, player-character personality can come across in the style of movement
and visual characteristics, and social persona is defined mostly through nonverbal
interaction in real time between the player-character and NPCs. One might refer to
this sort of player-character as a puppet. The strength of puppet player-characters
lies in the joy a player feels in physically manipulating them and in watching the
results of his or her actions on-screen. Puppets often have super-human qualities—
grace in movement, extreme strength and accuracy, and the like. Super Monkey Ball
2 and Donkey Kong both feature puppet-style player characters (Figure 8.10).
Although there is a framing fantasy world, in Super Monkey Ball 2 it plays a
minor role in game play and is entirely absent in the most common mode of game
play (multiplayer). The charm of the player characters in Super Monkey Ball 2 comes

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
primarily from their grace and energy in game play. These characters are a joy to
manipulate and provide gratifying reactions to player success (see Clips 5.2 and 5.3
in Chapter 5). Their social qualities take the form of personality as expressed in
movement rather than in actual engagement with other characters during game play.
This is also the case for arcade games such as Donkey Kong (Figure 8.10b), in
which there is little time to give a player an elaborate fantasy context for play and
no player-driven social interaction. The tiny hero is a joy to operate because of his
kinesthetic characteristics—he is bouncy and indefatigable.
Sports games such as SSX 3 also have player-characters that serve as puppets for
players. Players enjoy having the grace and flair of star athletes, planning and execut-
ing moves that they could not perform in real life. (See Clip 6.3 from Chapter 6 for
an example of this type of movement.)
Masks
Masks are player-characters found in games that have a major social component.
The two examples shown here—Star Wars Galaxies and There—are both persistent,
massively multiplayer worlds (see Figures 8.11 and 8.12). A major component of
game play in this sort of game is interacting with other players, as they are repre-
sented through their own masks. Improvisational performers (Johnstone 1979) and
psychologists (Turkle 1995) agree that donning an alternate social face gives people
the opportunity to explore alternate social personas—new versions of the self that
may be very different from the everyday. Considerable design effort is typically
expended upon tools for customizing the appearance of mask player-characters. It is
also highly desirable when crafting a mask character, to provide players with vis-
ceral feedback and interface mechanisms for social expressions. In There, for exam-
ple, players can type special characters to make their characters smile, nod, wave,
and perform other social gestures (see Chapter 6 for more detail).

Design Pointers
Consider all four psychological layers from the beginning, when brainstorming
initial game concepts, to ensure that a game has powerful player-characters. A
player-character’s personality and appeal comes as much from his or her
movement in response to the player’s real-time controller actions as it does
from watching elaborate cut-scenes. The bulk of time spent with the player-
character will be in the moment-to-moment unfolding of play. It is my opinion
that the strongest player-characters are deeply grounded in the visceral and
cognitive layers and that their social and fantasy selves emerge from these

8.3
DESIGN POINTERS
217
roots rather than being conveyed through a linear story overlayed on an exist-
ing genre of game play.
When brainstorming, take the time to set explicit criteria for each of the four
layers:
1. Visceral. What does it feel like to move as this character? What is fun
about it? What powers does the player have that she or he probably does
not have in real life? What is it like to watch this character move (if the
character is visible)?
2. Cognitive. Does the player’s own instinct for what to do next in the game
mesh well with the cognitive strategies that this character would have?
Does the character feel like a natural mental skin for the player, given the
game-play mechanics?
3. Social. Does the character’s social persona fit well with the basic game-
play style and motivations? Is the social persona interesting and appealing
to the player? Does it mesh well with the cast of NPCs and their social
roles? Can the player perform the social actions that he or she wants to,
given his or her character?
4. Fantasy. Is this a character that the player wants to experiment with being?
Does the character’s backstory and motivation sit well with game play
itself—is this a fantasy persona that is truly well-suited to the core game-
play mechanics?
When the four psychological layers of a player-character do not line up, the
player may start to feel dissociated and dissatisfied with what is happening.
Here are some signs that a player-character needs layer tuning:
• Visceral out of alignment with fantasy. “This character looked much cooler
on the box and in the opening movie. I can’t do the cool stuff I thought
I would be able to.” (Can be a problem with characters adapted from film.)
• Cognitive out of alignment with visceral. “This character is really frustrating
to use—I keep trying to do stuff that makes sense, but the game won’t
let me.”
• Social out of alignment with visceral. “Why can’t I talk to the other char-
acters? How come this character doesn’t remember me? I would normally
solve this by talking to someone, but I can’t do that.” Or alternatively,
“I don’t want to have to talk to him or her. Why can’t I just shoot them?”
• Cognitive out of alignment with fantasy. “The cut-scenes in this game are
really annoying and irrelevant. I wish I could skip them.” Or alternatively,

CHAPTER EIGHT • PLAYER-CHARACTERS

“I really like the cut-scenes in this game but it’s really boring to play the
game itself because the parts of the characters I like have nothing to do
with how I play.”
It is also helpful to consider which psychological layers will be most important
given a game’s core and environment, and whether some layers are unneces-
sary. If you know that your character is a tool, puppet, or mask, you can
apply these criteria:
• Tool. The controls feel ready-to-hand and do not interfere with the player’s
cognitive strategy. There is minimal sense of social or fantasy self to get in
the way of play.
• Puppet. The character is fun to watch, and the feedback loop between the
player’s actions and the character’s behavior is not just nice to feel and
cognitively tuned but also extends and enhances the senses and makes the
player feel graceful.
• Mask. The character fits a social persona the player wants to try out and
offers ways to customize appearance that are fun and interesting. The
player can do the things she or he wants to do to communicate with other
characters, and his or her character feels socially lifelike.

Interview:Marc Laidlaw
Q: Gordon Freeman works at all four psychological levels for the player so well. Was
there something about the design process of Half-Life that helped make Freeman
such a strong and well-crafted player-character?
First,we designed the experience with input from every part of the team so that Gordon
would be totally integrated with the type of game we were building. While artists were
sketching out various concepts of the character, the programmers and level designers
were working out the technical details,such as Gordon’s apparent eye height and field of
view, his jump distance, and movement speed. We wanted to make sure that the player
wouldn’t feel as if he’s moving too quickly or too slowly, that he wouldn’t seem to be liv-
ing in a fishbowl.
Most of these basic definitions were altered again for Half-Life 2. We adjusted the
character to suit the more evolved world of the second game. A crucial issue was that of
scale: are common objects, familiar to the player, modeled and presented in a manner
that feels convincing? In Quake, for instance, buttons and switches tended to be

enormous. Bringing these conventions directly over to Half-Life, we ended up with com-
mon light switches that were two feet on a side. So that was something that required a
lot of tuning over the course of the two games.
From a narrative point of view, we made sure that the feedback from the world
and from the other characters would work to shape their perception of Gordon Free-
man. Security guards treated him with familiarity, friendliness, and respect; fellow
scientists treated him first with mild condescension, then with desperate pleading, as
his role in the Black Mesa Incident became more important. In Half-Life 2, the key
friendly characters treat you as if they like you, and you end up feeling that you must
be a pretty good guy.
Starting with basic ideas for the character, we would always subject each version to
lots of play testing, to make sure the experience was coming through for players. The
simple first-person viewpoint had already proven itself a strong one.Notably,id software
had done the anonymous silent viewpoint character in Doom and Quake.Your character
made various sounds to show exertion and pain;there was no cutting away to show your
character grunting and groaning. 3D Realms took this convention and pushed it further,
to develop the distinct personality of Duke Nukem. Instead of making only wordless
sounds, Duke made sarcastic comments and became more of a presence in the world
and in the player’s mind.
In Half-Life, we tried to get the best of both approaches.We knew we wanted to keep
the first-person viewpoint without breaking away. We knew Gordon Freeman would be
an initially anonymous sort of character, in keeping with id’s transparent style. There
would be no RPG stats to develop, minimal key commands, and a low level of screen
clutter. On the other hand, we wanted to create an actual character—one who was in

some ways the antithesis of Duke Nukem or the Quake Marine—not a wisecracking man
of action,but a silent scientist who gradually assumes the role of action hero.We wanted
a character any player could inhabit but one who had a definite place in his world—and
a name to go with it.
Valve’s process is to mock up the early concept as soon as possible and turn it into
something playable, then keep iterating until it’s as good as it can be.If we had stopped
short of a full realization of the initial vision, we would have ended up with something
more motley and unsatisfying. We could have had hybrid third-person views from
omniscient cameras, showing a character who inexplicably never spoke. But we ended
with something very pure. The rules for Gordon Freeman are simple, but abiding by
them is very challenging. So our character design affects our world, game, and story
design on every level.
Q: How do you personally go about creating and refining a player-character?
What are the important considerations for you in deciding whether a character
will work?
In the case of Gordon Freeman, character design was a matter of interface design. We
wanted a minimal amount of interference between the player and the game: no
branching conversation trees, no complicated superhuman abilities, and a strong
connection between Gordon Freeman as the game world sees him and the Gordon
Freeman envisioned by the player.We wanted to make sure that Gordon was a product
of his environment and also had an interesting role there that tied into the game play
in some way. Often his position is exploited for comic or ironic possibilities. Gordon is
supposed to be a bright young physicist, and the characters assume he is well trained
for his tasks; yet the player really doesn’t have a clue what to do, and the things they
actually spend time doing often amount to menial tasks. When the player solves
puzzles, or finds nonlinear ways of progressing, we can play up the idea that they are
somehow inhabiting a brilliant scientist. But the most important thing was to give the
player a feeling of being constantly off balance, never quite sure of what was expected
of them, to give them the task of continually finding this out for themselves.The world,
and all the encounters, were crafted to support this experience. It was a delicate
balance,as became clear in the part of Half-Life 1 where it failed.When Gordon goes off
to the borderworld, Xen, he is cut off from human contact and the many little props
that helped give him a sense of context. While it was our intention to create an eerie
sense of isolation and reinforce the feeling that you had gone beyond the point where
anyone could help you, many players faltered at this point. It was no longer obvious
that you had to be Gordon Freeman; there was no continual feedback from the world.
I think this shift in perspective had much to do with the dissatisfaction that many
people felt with the latter part of that game.It also changed the sense of being Gordon
as the louder complaint—the fact that it turned into a series of difficult jumping puz-
zles for which the player had been inadequately trained.We should have left Gordon in
constant contact with his scientist allies.This lesson was applied to the Xen sequences
of Blue Shift and worked much better in my opinion.

Finally, games tend to distinguish themselves first with their visual style, then with
their game-play mechanics, and last with their narrative. Visual style may pull people
in, but if the game play is no fun, then the pretty faces won’t matter very much. If
the game play is exciting and fun, then players won’t object too much to a weak story.
Ideally, all the elements are equally strong, but this is rare. A good game character is
one who enables and supports great game play. This is far more important than a
strong marketing image. Character is also something that reveals itself only gradually
to a player. It is very hard to convey (on a box or a list of features) what that particular
character brings to the game that makes the game remarkable.
Q: In the interview with Gamasutra (http://www.gamasutra.com/features/
20030808/carless-pfu.htm), you talk about infusing a game with personality or a
sense of authorship. How do you think this comes across specifically in Gordon
Freeman and his interactions with his world? Are there some defining details you
would point to?
The game is the result of many authors, and each of them has a strong distinctive
stamp that gives the game a feel unlike that of any other studio’s work; but we are all
aware that there is a certain Valve “vibe” to strive for—something which, when you hit
it, is unmistakeable. Originally we didn’t have a target outside our imaginations; but we
shared an indefinable goal. We didn’t know quite what it was, but we certainly recog-
nized it when we reached it. (Rigging up the Test Chamber disaster sequence in HL1,
and seeing how well it worked, was the turning point for the team—where we realized
what we were going to be doing from then on out.)
There are choices that we as a design studio tend to make that another studio
might not make, and our original design for Gordon Freeman reflects that. For
instance, we like to play on the irony inherent in the fact that the nonplayer-characters
make comments about Gordon that the player can’t refute. I think our audience looks
forward to a certain amount of this sort of thing throughout the game. Another studio
making a Half-Life game would take a different approach to the problem. That’s why I
think a game like Opposing Force, although it had many of HL’s constraints, has a very
different flavor reflecting the personalities and interests of the third-party team that
created it. Personally, I like to add little nonobvious details to dialogue and scenes,
thing that are not required by game play but which reflect the same sort of thinking I’d
put into one of my stories.The same can be said for our art design, our animation, and
(although I’m a poor judge of this) our code. You can see the individual’s handiwork
everywhere.Valve allows this to flourish.
Q: How do you make sure your characters stay true to the creative vision that you
have as you move through development? Is there any advice you would offer to
others for delivering on the promise of initial concepts? For checking up on your
work,staying honest,getting feedback?
The creative vision evolves over time. One of the interesting things about game
development, as opposed to other fields, is that you cannot foresee what the

CHAPTER EIGHT • PLAYER-CHARACTERS
222
technology is going to allow you to create in the near future. Cinematographers
know the limits of their lenses and film; writers have a certain vocabulary with
which to tell a story, and if they go out and learn more words, those words will still
have strong connections to the ones they already know. This is not always the case
in computer games. The technology progresses incrementally, but every now and
then it will reveal a new type of game play that makes you reevaluate everything,
including your initial vision.
8.5
Summary and What Is Next
Chapter 8 introduced four layers of a player’s psychological experience of
player characters: visceral, cognitive, social, and fantasy. Several examples of well-
integrated player-character designs were discussed, and the notion of specialized
types of player-characters—tools, puppets, and masks—was also introduced, with
examples. The chapter concluded with suggestions for incorporating the four
layers into character designs, along with an interview of Marc Laidlaw of Valve.
Chapter 9 discusses the other major type of character found in games: non player-
characters (NPCs).
8.6
Exercises
8.6.1
Using the Four Layers to Pinpoint Problems
Have each person in the group bring in an example of a player-character
that they hated and explain what it was about the character that was so
annoying or frustrating. Consider the four layers when critiquing and
discussing—it is very likely that the character did not have proper inte-
gration of these layers. Brainstorm ways that the player-character could
have been improved.
8.6.2
What Kind of Me Is It?
Using the four layers, analyze your designs of player-characters for
game projects. Consider whether the player-character, in the context of
this game, is primarily a tool, a puppet, a mask, or some hybrid. How
will this affect your design decisions? How will you know whether your
design is working for players? (Chapter 11 includes some guidelines for
conducting evaluations.)

CHAPTER
Nine
Nonplayer-Characters
9.1
What Is Covered and Why
This chapter uses the concept of social roles to explore the connections players
make with nonplayer-characters. Designs that make use of role-relevant social cues
enhance the chances of stronger emotional experiences for players and create
a more game-play-integrated experience of NPCs. The chapter describes examples
of NPCs in a range of social roles in games, showing with each how emotional
moments arise for players from social relationships with characters. The chapter
ends with design pointers for leveraging social roles in design.
9.2
The Psychological Principles
The terrain of the study of human relationships is far too large to cover in a book
like this one. Game character interactions are usually short, targeted, functionally
based interactions (not dates or marriages or ongoing coworker situations). There-
fore, this chapter presents a key concept from the psychological and sociological
literature that helps to focus understanding of relatively brief, instrumental inter-
actions: social roles.
Social roles are mutually recognized sets of expected behaviors and reactions
that a person will engage in with respect to another person. These roles develop in
social situations in which there are predictable patterns of
• interdependence because of overlapping goals and complementary abilities,
• power dynamics within and between social groups (hierarchies and in-group/ 
out-group status), and
• obligations in the form of kinship or other group relations that bind individuals
together.

(a) Social roles help synchronize people’s expectations of interactions.(b) Confusion over roles
can create frustrating experiences.
F I G U R E
9.1
Social roles are valuable in that they help people to engage in interaction with others
without having to negotiate everything about how each person will act, and often,
without even having to get to know one another very well (see Figure 9.1a). Social
roles help to reduce the risk of embarrassment, of confusion, of unwanted conflict
(see Figure 9.1b). They help to stabilize social groups—if a person has been trained
in how to behave in a given social role, others can count upon this training and
then can create and engage in more complex social structures. Social roles can be
a

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
barriers to greater intimacy, but they are very helpful in everyday situations in which
a person has short and targeted engagement with another (as is the case in most
player interactions with NPCs).
The notion of social roles initially emerged from the work of social scientists
such as Erving Goffman, who became very interested in understanding the
dynamics between people in everyday social situations. These researchers looked
for the underlying rules and mechanisms shaping social engagement—things
that are hard to see because we are immersed in them. Goffman was one of the
first to systematically describe the elaborate “work” going on in social life. He
introduced the concept of face work—the idea that people try to help each other
maintain consistent social identities by ignoring slips out of role-appropriate
behavior (see Goffman, 1967). Social psychologists later took up the concept of
social roles to help them understand the dynamics of interpersonal interaction and
perception and the ways in which people apply generalized knowledge to specific
social encounters.
One way to understand social roles is to think of them as social “faces” or masks
that a person puts on, signaling that she or he will behave in a certain way toward
another. Each person has many of these masks and may even have several that he
or she puts on with a particular person, depending upon context. For example, a
man may have a friend who is also a coworker. These two may act quite differently
with one another in the workplace versus out of it.
Social roles transcend the negotiation of relationship between two individuals;
they are part of a larger social structure. As such, they have definite cultural bounds.
Even roles that emerge from universal kinship situations—such as brother or
mother—are manifested in different ways, depending upon culture (see Chapter 3,
p. 54 for more discussion of cultural differences in social norms and roles).
People tend to underestimate the power of social roles in shaping a person’s
behavior and in shaping their own perceptions of others’ abilities and compe-
tency. In studies where people are arbitrarily assigned roles (such as manager and
worker or quiz show host and contestant), observers will rate the competence
and intelligence of those acting out manager or host as higher than worker or
contestant because the bias in what they see that comes from the role itself (Ross
and Nisbett 1991).
Social roles are useful to keep in mind when designing NPCs because social roles
shape a person’s expectations about how she or he will relate to others (both
human and digital). Out of these expectations arise possibilities for powerful emo-
tions based upon the fulfillment (or betrayal) of mutual goals: gratitude, disappoint-
ment, shared excitement and satisfaction, rage, and the like. Imbuing an NPC with
seeming awareness of role expectations will enhance the NPC’s lifelike qualities for
the player tremendously. A person expects an ally to be excited about a mutual vic-
tory and expects an enemy to be enraged about that same victory. Social roles are,
in a sense, libraries already present in the mind of the player that a designer can tap
into to create satisfying interactions with NPCs.
227

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
9.3
Dimensions of Social Roles and NPCs
For the purposes of analyzing social roles of NPCs in games, it is helpful to revisit
the factors that lead to role formation:
• interdependence because of overlapping goals and complementary abilities,
• power dynamics within and between social groups (hierarchies and in-group/
out-group status), and
• obligations in the form of kinship or other group relations that bind individuals
together.
These factors work together to shape a player’s social expectations of an NPC and
provide the possibilities for creating defining emotional moments between the
player and the NPC during game play.
Interdependence: Objectives and Abilities
NPCs have a range of objectives in games, from unthinking service and loyalty to
the player (or his or her archenemy) to world domination at the player’s expense.
An NPC may have various abilities that are useful to the player. Beyond the ability
to provide physical or mental assistance in fighting, solving puzzles, or just in
learning the ropes of the game world, a friendly NPC may also be able to provide
moral support in achieving game goals: cheering, excitement, approval, and the
like. NPCs may also provide companionship for the player or may provide a social
motivation in the form of somone who needs rescuing. Even unfriendly NPCs have
abilities that improve the player’s experience, providing opposition and conflict—
both physical and emotional—that enhances the player’s experience. NPCs in
neutral roles can provide social validation for the player when they approve of her
or his actions and help spur better play when they boo a bad performance.
Power Dynamics: Agreeableness and Dominance Revisited
Chapter 2 introduced key person-perception variables—what someone notices first
when meeting a new person. Among these were assessing someone’s relative power
compared to one’s self and deciding if they are going to be on your side or working
against you in some way. These are important initial perceptions because they will
help determine how well a person will be able to work with you. These perceptions
also form one foundation for social roles:
• Agreeableness. If a person is friendly toward you, you will expect that they may
try to work with you to achieve mutual goals. If that person is not friendly, you
will expect to deal with them at some level as a threat to your goals, or at best as
228

9.4
COMMON SOCIAL ROLES IN GAMES
a neutral or unhelpful force. This will affect any encounter you have with them,
as well as how and when you seek out interaction. It will also shape mutually
defining moments. With enemies, your success is their loss. With allies, success
is something for both to celebrate.
• Dominance. Dominance or submissiveness determines who gets to set the
agenda in a collaboration. The more dominant person typically determines what
will be done, and the less dominant one chooses whether it suits his or her goals
to go along. The less dominant party will spend time making it clear to the more
dominant one that she or he is on board for the agenda and is excited about the
outcome when things go well. Dominance also affects how much attention (and
what kind) must be paid to an individual. People look to more dominant others
to see whether they are satisfied and to anticipate where they will be going next.
People look to less dominant people to see whether they are doing what has
been assigned and (ideally) to make sure they are reasonably happy as they do
their work. People who are equally dominant are examined for signs that goals
are still in alignment and for shifts in status.
Obligations and Investment
NPCs in games are often positioned (through backstory and ongoing cut-scene
exposition) as having a preexisting social connection to the player. An NPC may
have a kinship role toward the player’s character (e.g., the Prince’s father in
Katamari Damacy) or some form of personal and/or social investment due to past
circumstances—colleague, companion in arms, childhood friend, or the like. This
means that the player already has a sense of obligation toward and investment in
the NPC based on their imagined past, and the NPC has been designed to have
“obligation” as well. Obligations and investment also grow during the course of the
game itself—the most powerful NPC interactions and connections can arise from
the building of obligation and investment through mutual actions during game play
(e.g., Floyd the robot’s famous self-sacrifice for the player in Planetfall, an early text
adventure game (http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/planetfall)).
9.4
Common Social Roles in Games
Just as social-role templates arise and evolve in everyday interpersonal interaction
to fit common situations and relationships, role templates have come into common
use in games because of recurring player needs in combination with possibilities
for NPC actions. This section includes examples of these common roles but should
not be viewed as exhaustive. As new game-play modes, genres, and audiences
evolve, designers can look for ways that characters can enhance game play by
taking on other social roles, borrowing from analogous situations in real life to
guide explorations.
229

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
If working in a well-defined genre of game, a designer may find the following
taxonomy helpful in guiding design and decision-making. The roles are organized
along the agreeableness and dominance dimensions, working through friendly char-
acters from least to most dominant, then unfriendly characters from least to most
dominant, and concluding with neutral characters working from least to most domi-
nant. For each, objectives and abilities as well as obligations and investment are
considered, as are the defining interaction moments based on these factors.
9.4.1
Minion
Minions are the least socially dominant of the friendly roles examined in this chapter.
Minions always defer to the player character and never challenge his or her authority.
Objectives and abilities
A minion’s objective is to help the player accomplish her or his game goals. Minions
do not usually have any independent goals, other than meeting their own basic sur-
vival needs. They do not typically provide any resistance to the player but offer phys-
ical assistance to the player during game play by accomplishing menial tasks that the
player assigns them. Minions also provide moral support in the form of unstinting
enthusiasm and spunk in the face of adversity and through their delight at accom-
plishing the player’s goals.
Obligations and investment
In most cases, the player is not personally familiar with individual minions—rather,
minions are attached to the player in an aggregate sense, and they matter to the
player for their actions as a group.
Defining interaction moments
Players will expect minions to mirror their excitement over successes and to cheer
the player up with their energy and determination during defeats. If part of the game
mechanic is keeping the minions happy, the player will expect unrest if the minion is
underfed, has too little rest, or the like. The most frequent player interaction with a
minion is to give orders—how a minion reacts has a big impact on the player’s
impression. Players of Warcraft III, for example, so enjoyed the reactions of their
minions to being ordered around that they collected audio recordings of peon replies
to orders and posted them on fan Web sites. Another design consideration with min-
ions is that they usually travel in groups. The player will not form an impression of
each individual minion, given time and attention constraints, so care should be
taken to design minions whose aggregate behavior is appealing. (See Figure 9.2. Also
see Clip 9.1 for a brief illustration of the charming group behavior of the Pikmen.)
230

9.4
COMMON SOCIAL ROLES IN GAMES
9.4.2
Rescuee
The rescuee is a player-friendly character who is also less dominant than the
player—someone in need of the player’s aid (see Figure 9.3). This does not mean
that the rescuee does not have powers of his or her own. Yorda from ICO, for exam-
ple, reveals powers as the game progresses that are essential to the player, making a
transition from helpless rescuee to ally. The fuzzles in Oddworld: Munch’s Odyssee
begin their interaction with the player as victims in need of rescue. In both cases, the
player wins the loyalty and devotion of the rescuee by freeing them. Some games (for
example the Mario series and Prince of Persia) include a rescue as strong game-play
motivation. Regardless of their powers, rescuees are by definition friendly to the
player’s character.
Objectives and abilities
A player’s assumption about a rescuee is that the character needs saving and will be
grateful for aid. A pure rescuee may have no game-play role at all, appearing only to
motivate the player toward the end goal of the game (e.g., Princess Toadstool in
the Mario series). Other rescuees are hybrid characters, moving from the passive role
into a more active one when they are freed (e.g. the Fuzzles in Oddworld). These
characters then transition into other player-friendly roles such as minion or ally.
Obligations and investment
Sometimes the player is given backstory explaining the player-character’s relation-
ship and obligation to the rescuee (for example, Jak and Daxter, in which Jak has a
hand in Daxter’s plunge into a toxic pool that motivates the initial game quest).

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
232
Sometimes the game relies on protection and nurturing instincts in the player to
motivate investment in the rescue (e.g., Mario and the Princess).
Defining interaction moments
It is essential to make the player care about rescuing this character, so a rescuee
must be presented in the most empathetic and urgent light—the player should find
this character worthy of care. Using cuteness and attraction cues will help (see Part
I for an overview of some of these design strategies). Emotional moments with res-
cuees include seeing the rescuee in pain or fear and wanting to help, or being able
to free the character. Including cues of awareness in the rescuee’s behavior of the
player’s attempts to rescue (such as excitement when the player is almost there and
disappointment if the rescue fails) will heighten the player’s emotions.

COMMON SOCIAL ROLES IN GAMES
9.4.3
Pet
Like minions, pets are much less dominant in the game world than the player.
However, pets are expected to provide some resistance to the player’s desires, as a
real-life dog or cat would. Pets are, in general, friendly toward the player, although
the player’s actions could turn the pet against her or him. The creature from Black
& White: Creature Isle, the dogs and cats from Petz (Figure 9.4), and the pets on the
Neopets website (Figure 9.5) are examples of NPCs that have this role.
Objectives and abilities
Pets are not typically designed primarily to serve the player. Rather, the objective in
engaging with a pet is to enjoy the pet’s development and learning and its moments
of connection and resistance to the player. A pet provides emotional engagement to
the player and challenge in the form of training and meeting the pet’s needs.
Obligation and investment
The social contract between player and pet is that of a caretaker—the player will
attend to the pet’s needs and will expect loyalty and obedience, within reason. The
player will expect emergent behavior and surprises from a pet: it is okay for the pet
to have a personality of its own to some degree; that is part of the fun. In contrast
to minions, pets will evoke a high degree of time and emotional investment from
the player. He or she will care quite a lot about the pet as an individual.

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
Defining interaction moments
Interactions with pets center around caregiving and training and on observing the
outcome of these actions through the pet’s interactions with the larger game
world. The player will be watching her or his pet closely, getting to know its per-
sonality, and trying to figure out cause and effect in terms of training and care.
Attention toward the pet’s reactions to player actions, and hinting at the underly-
ing motivational model of the pet, will enhance the player’s experience as will
displays of loyalty and care from the pet toward the player. If the pet “misbe-
haves,” acknowledging this in some way through the pet’s expression (showing
that “it knows it did wrong”) will make the interaction more engaging and lifelike.
9.4.4
Sidekick
A sidekick character typically has more social power and autonomy than a pet
within the game world but still is less dominant than the player’s character.
Sidekicks, like minions, are unequivocably on the player’s side. Two strong exam-
ples of sidekick characters are Glottis from Grim Fandango and Daxter from Jak and
Daxter (see Figure 9.6).
Objectives and abilities
Sidekicks provide moral support and practical advice to the player as well as some
good-natured teasing (for example, Daxter’s wise crack in Clip 9.3). They usually

do not provide much in the way of physical game-play assistance. The sidekick
provides unstinting loyalty but can also provide a second opinion and some valu-
able perspective to the player—offering hints about what to try next and filling
the character in on backstory. Sometimes, sidekicks get themselves into trouble,
requiring a rescue by the player.
Obligations and investment
A sidekick is typically present throughout the course of the game, so the player
has a pretty high level of investment in this character. Sidekicks are either intro-
duced as characters with strong existing ties to the player’s character, or (as in
Grim Fandango), they are won over by the player-character during game play
and accompany him or her for the rest of the game.
Defining interaction moments
Sidekicks are usually more talk than action, so their personality comes through in the
things they say and the way they say them as game play unfolds. The more aware-
ness a sidekick can show about the player’s performance—commenting on what is
going on, providing help when needed, and providing comic relief—the more enjoy-
able that character will be. Both Glottis and Daxter make heavy use of humor, includ-
ing meta-comments about how well the player is performing at the game. Giving the
player a chance to rescue the sidekick will heighten emotional investment in the char-
acter and will motivate a deepening relationship over time in the game between
player and sidekick. Some games have used the self-sacrifice of a sidekick (e.g., Floyd
in Planetfall) to produce powerful emotions in players. If the sidekick does make it

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
all the way through the game, giving the player emotional payoff by way of the
sidekick’s joy at the victory is essential. Since a sidekick is around for so much of a
game, it is worth creating a sense of individuality and motivation for the sidekick, tak-
ing it beyond the mindless obedience and unquestioning order-taking of the minion.
A sidekick’s own quest gives the player a chance to help in a way that strengthens the
relationship, creating more powerful emotions in the game itself.
9.4.5
Ally
Allies are characters on the player’s side who possess the same or almost equivalent
physical powers in the game world. They are unquestioningly friendly to the player.
Objectives and abilities
The primary contribution of an ally is in game task support, usually in the form
of group combat or sports play. Examples include the guards that fight alongside
the player in Half-Life, the soldiers that join in the reconnaisance and fighting in
Halo, and teammates in sports games (see Figure 9.7, also Clip 9.4). Allies can
also provide moral support through their reactions to the ongoing action—enthu-
siasm, determination, egging the player on, and so forth.
Obligations and investment
As with minions, the player probably does not form much of an attachment to indi-
vidual allies nor does she or he expect to see them for long periods of time in the
game. Allies are experienced in the aggregate.

COMMON SOCIAL ROLES IN GAMES
Defining interaction moments
As with minions, allies tend to have brief, functional interactions with the player—
their contribution is in the moment. However, there are ways to heighten the player
experience with ally actions even in these short encounters. Giving allies the
appearance of awareness of the player’s goals and emotional reactions to how
things are going (in both their physical reactions and in their words) will make the
player really feel he or she has back-up and will help give the player the feeling of
being on a supportive team. Building up a backstory for the team as a whole, with
recurring characters (such as Carol “Foehammer” Rawley in Halo, the Echo 419
transport operator who carries the Master Chief around Halo) helps add to the real-
ism and engagement for the player.
9.4.6
Guide
Guides are unquestioningly on the player’s side and usually have at least as much
social power and awareness as the player-character in the game world, sometimes
more.
Objectives and abilities
Guides can be thought of as the game’s help system. A guide is a personified data-
base for the player, and perhaps this is why guides are often portrayed as androids
rather than humans (for example, Cortana in Halo). However, the guide role is one
that offers a chance for emotional connection and humor. Consider Otacon, in Metal
Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. This character offers the player a humerous proverb
each time the player saves, poking fun at the relationship and offering the player a
rest from the stressful, dialogue-free stealth play in the game itself. Otacon uses
jargon that fits his role as a fellow soldier (see Figure 9.8).
Obligations and investment
Typically, a guide is accessible to the player throughout game play for advice but
does not spend major interaction time with the player nor engage directly in core
game play. The player may feel invested to the extent that the guide’s advice clearly
helps the player meet goals and avoid dangers.
Defining interaction moments
Most interactions between guide and player are dominated by the guide, who is filling
in the player on important game information. Making these interventions as natural,
unmechanical, and unforced as possible is an important goal for designing this type
of character. Giving the character a deeper relationship with the player that supports
the guide role and a set of motivations for being a guide may help give more social
237

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
238
substance to the interaction. The role has an inherent weakness, in that, unlike the
sidekick, the guide is mysteriously exempt from the action in the game. Common
devices for addressing this weakness include remote communication or defining the
guide as a computer being of some sort. It may be better to split the guide role into
two, making use of sidekick and mentor to fulfill this role where possible.
9.4.7
Mentor
Mentors are also firmly on the player’s side and typically possess far more power in
the game world than the player-character.
Objectives and abilities
Mentors function as helpers, as guides do, but they also take a leadership role in
guiding the player. Rather than accompanying the player-character on a quest, the
mentor usually provides some training and initial advice, followed by mission setting
and occasional requests for report by the player. Examples include Chop Chop Mas-
ter Onion from Parappa the Rapper (see Figure 9.9 and Clip 9.6) and Tom Nook from
Animal Crossing (see Figure 9.10).
Obligations and investment
Typically, a mentor is only periodically accessible to the player and helps to drive
the player’s core objectives and motivations through filling in backstory, setting

objectives, and providing feedback on ongoing performance. The player is fairly
invested in the mentor, who is providing feedback and information crucial to the
central missions of game play.
Defining interaction moments
As with guides, most interactions between mentor and player are dominated by the
mentor. Usually the mentor is offering some information or advice or providing

9.11
feedback on the player’s actions, so defining interactions often take place in cut-
scenes. Ideally, feedback should be adjusted to the player’s real performance, to
make the player feel the mentor is truly aware and invested. Mentors should, like
guides, have a deeper social relationship with the player that justifies their interest
in the player’s success and should also have a social position powerful enough to
justify their commanding the player-character’s attention and energies. Mentors are
often gruff types whose praise is doubly satisfying for being reluctantly given. How-
ever, any sort of relevant feedback and mission setting—gruff, humorous, even
ridiculous and capricious (e.g., the king in Katamari Damacy)—is the job of and
central emotional moment with the mentor.
9.4.8
Obstacle
The obstacle is the first social role listed in this chapter that is not agreeable toward
the player. Obstacles are characters that do not have the player’s best interests at
heart and who must be navigated past to meet play goals. Typically, obstacles do not
have that much social or physical power within the game—they are nuisances, not
major threats. One wonderful example from an older, text-based game is the screen-
ing door from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (see Figure 9.11 and Clip 9.7).
Objectives and abilities
Obstacles usually have some small game-play ability or token that the player needs
in order to proceed. In addition to providing physical resistance and challenge, they
sometimes provide a battle of wits and a bit of comic relief.

9.4
COMMON SOCIAL ROLES IN GAMES
Obligations and investment
An obstacle usually does not care if the player progresses or not but has an
agenda that the player must deal with in order to suceed. Obstacles usually have
short encounters with the player, and therefore not much investment on either
side is required.
Defining interaction moments
An obstacle should be fun to hate and patronize. Making the obstacle’s single-
minded obsession with its own agenda humorous and persistent will add fun for
the player. Obstacles should be funny, not scary or annoying, not depressing. Some-
times an obstacle can be won over by the player’s actions, which provides an extra
emotional punch (for example, the scene in Clip 2.9 in which Manny reencounters
the sea walker, who thanks him for his help in getting unstuck).
9.4.9
Enemy
Enemies are one of the most popular and enduring NPC types in games. They were
the earliest form of game NPC (for example, the aliens from Space Invaders, see
Figure 9.12), and marketers still feature them prominently in game advertising.
The makers of Doom 3, for example, used images of its NPC enemies heavily in
marketing the game at launch. Enemy graphics and behavior have continually
improved—compare the enemy creatures from the first Jak and Daxter game
released in 2001 (see Figure 9.13) to the aliens from Space Invaders which was
released in 1978 (see Figure 9.12)—but their role remains essentially unchanged.
Antagonistic toward the player, they are usually not as powerful as the player-
character in the game world individually but can often be overwhelming en masse.
241

9.12

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
Objectives and abilities
Enemies seek to destroy the player and vice versa. Enemies usually do not have the
strategic power of the player, although they may have equal or better fire power.
Obligations and investment
Enemies are the antiplayer equivalent of minions—they do not require much time
and emotional investment from the player, and their contribution to game play is
usually to be cannon fodder.
Defining interaction moments
Enemies are usually dehumanized (portrayed as aliens, faceless nameless soldiers,
or crafted in a cartoonlike way), allowing the player to treat them as an “other” and
not to become upset by their deaths. Because there is no personal investment on
the part of the player in individual enemies and relationships with them, emotional
moments arise from brief encounters around combat situations—the first sighting of
a new class of enemy, a surprise ambush, the moment of success in killing an
enemy, or the sting of being defeated. Much effort is already devoted to making
enemy deaths convincing from a physical point of view—accurate flopping, blood
gushing, and the like. However, emotional satisfaction for the player could be
increased if enemies appeared to be more aware of the game-play situation moment
to moment—with grimaces and scowls of defeat, frustrated gestures, a look of sur-
prise when the player appears, a surge of energy when the enemies appear to be

gaining, defeated body language when they appear to be losing, and the like. A goal
to strive for might be to leave the player with an impression of the fighting style and
spirit of a particular type of enemy—how they handle defeat, how they react in a
crisis, how ruthless they are, and so forth—rather than with just the mechanics of
weapons and tactics.
9.4.10
Competitor
Competitors are opponents in sports and sports-like games (such as Mortal Kombat,
Figure 9.14). These NPCs usually have skills that are roughly on par with the
player-character’s. Competitor NPCs often can also be used as player-characters in
multiplayer modes.
Objectives and abilities
Competitors have the same objective as the player-character: to win the contest
at hand. Their abilities are usually tuned at various levels of difficulty to give
different players a reasonable challenge.
Obligations and investment
Competitors in team sports are somewhat like enemies in that players devote little
personal energy to getting to know them as individuals. Competitors in one-on-one
sports may elicit a bit more investment over time from a player, as she or he gets to
know the competitor’s personal style and qualities. In neither case is there an expec-
tation of an ongoing relationship outside the context of each round of game play.

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
Defining interaction moments
As with enemies, the majority of interaction with and attention to a competitor
comes during moment-to-moment game play and are not particularly emotion-
ally and socially engaging, beyond the thrill of physically besting the opponent.
Some sports games show competitor reactions to wins and losses, which
increases the social engagement of the player. The satisfaction of victory and the
frustration of defeat could be enhanced even more by the extent to which the
competitor displays awareness of the shifts in fortune (frustrated shakes of the
head, flagging energy, or a surge of “I’ve almost got him” speed) while play
unfolds, as well as between goals, rounds, and the like. It would also increase
social and emotional impact if competitor NPCs develop a history with a given
player—remembering intense rounds of competition and developing expectations
and attitude toward the player based upon their shared experience (e.g., “here
comes trouble”).
9.4.11
Boss Monster
Boss monsters are a form of powerful enemy that has quite a bit more strength
than the player-character and which must be defeated through persistence and
cleverness.
Objectives and abilities
Boss monsters are usually very territorial since they typically bar the way for a player
into the next area of a game (for example, a temple guardian from The Legend of
Zelda: The Windwaker, Figures 9.15 and Clip 9.9). They seek to prevent the player-
character’s entry and are happy to cause his or her demise. Bosses are usually very
physically powerful but not especially bright.
Obligations and investment
The player is not encouraged to develop any sort of investment in a boss monster. It is
something to be beaten and moved past. The player does expect the boss monster to
present a much steeper challenge in terms of game play than run-of-the-mill enemies.
Defining interaction moments
The first moment of sighting a boss monster is an important moment, as is the
moment of defeat. As with enemies and competitors, having the boss show aware-
ness of winning or losing during the battle could heighten the emotional impact on
the player.

Archenemy
Archenemies are also antagonistic to the player-character but possess much more
social and physical power in the game world than player-characters—making their
defeat a significant accomplishment for the player. Dr. Badboon from Super Monkey
Ball 2 is a classic archenemy (Figure 9.16).
Objectives and abilities
Archenemies usually have some world-changing evil objective that the player-
character steps in to block, turning their wrath toward the player-character. Archene-
mies do not usually engage in actual combat in game play; rather, they have hoards

of minions that they dispatch to fight the player. An archenemy NPC usually shows
up primarily in cut-scenes, revealing reactions to the player-character’s progress
and provoking reactions with further evil actions and challenges. (See, for example,
Clip 9.10, in which Dr. Badboon tries to harangue Mimi into marrying him.)
Obligations and investment
An archenemy is a powerful focal point for the player-character—providing a target
for wrath and an embodiment of what must be destroyed in the game. As such, the
player has a strong motivation to pay attention to details about the archenemy and
her or his objectives. However, the archenemy does not usually spend too much
time onscreen, in proportion to length of the overall game. This makes motivation
of the player a bit more difficult, in terms of building up antagonism. It is better if
the player directly experiences problems due to the archenemy, to increase the emo-
tional punch of the character.
Defining interaction moments
Archenemies mostly appear in cut-scenes. Making those-cut scenes directly rele-
vant to prior or ensuing game play and showing the archenemy’s glowering or
gloating will help motivate the player. Showing the archenemy as perturbed by
the player-character and hesitant could be a powerful motivator for the player as
well, as is showing the eventual toppling of the archenemy. It is important to
resist making the archenemy more interesting and dynamic than the player-
character because the player may feel dissatisfied with his or her role and irri-
tated with the contrast between cut-scenes and game play. Embedding more
traces of the archenemy in actual game play (insults delivered by minions, game
play road blocks clearly traceable to the archenemy, and so forth) can heighten
the player’s emotions and make the ultimate defeat more satisfying. As a mun-
dane example, think of a battle between roommates in which one moves the
other’s belongings—the traces of interference can be the most maddening of
provocations.
9.4.13
Audience
Audiences are neither for nor against the player and have no power or impact in
game play. Their presence provides emotional ambience for what the player is
doing.
Objectives and abilities
Audiences are re-creations of sports audiences—they react to good and bad plays on
the part of the player and his or her opponents and, in general, appear to appreciate
246

9.4
COMMON SOCIAL ROLES IN GAMES
seeing a good game. They do not have game-play abilities but can influence the
emotional tone of the game and player morale with their actions.
Obligations and investment
The player assumes that the audience cares about the outcome and that the audi-
ence will applaud stellar moves and will boo mistakes. The player is typically not at
all invested in individual audience members.

9.17
Defining interaction moments
The player is peripherally aware of the audience’s reactions to ongoing game
play, and a positive reaction to a brilliant play will heighten the player’s feeling
of satisfaction. Audiences in games such as NBA Live 2004 react more appropri-
ately and with more social and emotional variation than in earlier games such
as Mortal Kombat (Figure 9.17). Studying crowd dynamics and bringing more
social and emotional nuances to in-game audience reactions—home team versus
away team, cheering a star player, coming from behind versus extending the
lead, and so forth—could further increase the realism and satisfaction of sports
games.
9.4.14
Informant/Trader
Informants and traders have services that they will provide to anyone for a price.
They are typically not particularly powerful in the social world of a game, but they

CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS
have something that the player needs. For example, in The Legend of Zelda series,
players can purchase useful supplies from traders (Figure 9.18).
Objectives and abilities
Informants and traders have their own agenda independent from the players.
Traders want to keep their businesses going; informants have projects that require
some form of assistance from the player. These NPCs are usually only involved in
side aspects of game play.
Obligations and investment
The player has little investment in an informant or trader and only basic
bartering or trading obligations. It is possible to enrich these roles by making
the trader or informant part of the player-character’s social network in such a
way that the player-character can use the trader/informant to find out more
about what is going on and to pass along messages to those she or he has a
greater investment in.
Defining interaction moments
Informants and traders reveal their personalities and attitudes toward the
player-character during brief engagements over the trade of goods or informa-
tion. It is possible to heighten the player’s engagement with these mundane
transactions by making the trader or informant very entertaining and engaging
in some way, but care should be taken to keep the character plausible within

the game world and to avoid intruding on core game play too much. One way
to avoid irritation is to allow the player to choose whether and when to get
chatty with an informant or trader and when to just do the business at hand.
9.4.15
Host
A host provides ongoing commentary about the game to audience members (either
real or imagined). As the moderator of the event at hand, the host has more social
power in the game world than the player-character. The host from You Don’t Know
Jack is an example of this role (Figure 9.19, also Clip 9.11).
Objectives and abilities
Hosts aim to inform and sometimes to entertain the audience witnessing the game
play. They may direct play but do not get involved in the game itself.
Obligations and investment
The player is invested insofar as she or he hopes to hear the host say positive things
about his or her game play. In games where the host directs play itself, the player
will be even more emotionally involved with the host’s reactions.
249
You Don’t Know Jack is a game that relies on the charisma and energy of the host (see Clip 9.11).

Defining interaction moments
The player will particularly enjoy hearing the player-character’s exploits praised by
the host and hearing her or his persona talked up before and after a game. The host
can build a sense of suspense and realism into the game play, making the player feel
that he or she is performing in front of a “real” audience. The interplay between the
audience and the host creates a synergistic effect for the player (for example, the
sound effects in Clip 9.12 when the player chooses the correct answer).
CHAPTER NINE • NONPLAYER-CHARACTERS

9.5
Design Guidelines
Though each social role presents unique challenges, it is possible to follow
some general guidelines for optimizing social-role use in NPCs:
• Plan social roles. When creating design documentation, take the time to
specify all NPC social roles, including relative social dominance and agree-
ableness, objectives and abilities, obligations and investment, and defining
interaction moments.
• Test legibility. Make social roles legible and consistent! Check up on this as
game development progresses (see Chapter 11 for evaluation suggestions).
• Focus on defining moments. Plan the defining emotional-interaction
moments for a character given her or his social role, and focus design and
development efforts here. When cuts are made, make sure that the game
has not lost all of these defining moments and thus diminished emotional
punch for the player.
• Focus cut-scenes and roles. Focus use of cut-scenes so that the player is get-
ting useful social role information about NPCs’ obligations and investment,
in particular, as well as hints about NPC abilities and goals.
• Embed roles within game play. When possible, embed at least some
obligation and investment into game play itself (not just in backstory).
For example, Yorda helps the player-character during game play in ICO
after being helped so much herself, or Floyd sacrifices himself toward
the end of the game in Planetfall. Enabling an NPC to react to player
actions in role-appropriate ways during game play also increases the
emotional impact of the NPC tremendously.
• Deeper role evolution and crossover. For characters with extended game-
play presence, consider deepening roles and/or giving these characters
multiple roles to create additional engagement and immersion for the
player. A sidekick can become a rescuee, a mentor can become an ally, or
an ally can become an archenemy. Playing multiple roles makes a character
richer and more socially interesting.

9.7
EXERCISES
251
• Balance roles. Take a step back and orchestrate overall balance of social
roles within your game. Make sure all player needs (for information, for
moral support, or for guidance) are being met; fill in gaps as necessary.
Sometimes, NPCs can seem arbitrary or clunky if there is not enough of a
social world in the game to support them; considering the cast as a whole
can help to prevent this problem.
• Break social stereotypes. Often there are patterns that have evolved over
time in the qualities of NPCs in given roles (such as rescuees often being
female or mentors often being older males). To create fresh and engaging
characters, consider turning these stereotypes upside down and making
an NPC that does not have the usual personal traits for that role. A young
female mentor or an old man who needs to be rescued could be more
interesting to the player because they are unique.
9.6
Summary and What Is Next
This chapter introduced the concept of social roles (from sociology and social psy-
chology), extending it into the realm of nonplayer-character design. Common social
roles in games were discussed, with examples and suggestions for focusing develop-
ment efforts to maximize emotional impact upon players. The chapter concluded
with some broad design suggestions to help the reader take advantage of social roles
regardless of the particular function of an NPC in a game. Part V provides guidance
for where in the game development process all these principles can be put to use
and includes suggestions for ways to evaluate the social effectiveness of characters.
9.7
Exercises
9.7.1
Role Clarity
Have each person select his or her favorite NPC in a game, and then ana-
lyze the character according to social role. What is the character’s relative
dominance and agreeableness in relation to the player? What abilities and
goals does the character have, and what are the obligations and invest-
ment of the player in regard to the character? Have each person show
(or describe) at least one defining emotional-interaction moment between
player and character. You may want to have each person also select a
least-favorite NPC and perform the same exercise—you may uncover
gaps and discrepancies with these disliked NPCs between the expecta-
tions they evoke with their social roles and the emotional and physical
behavior they deliver.

Defining Moments
When you are crafting plans for NPCs in their games, have group mem-
bers take a moment to specify defining moments between the player and
the NPCs, within the context of game play. Be as specific as possible:
include NPC actions and reactions and how these will be conveyed
through NPC bodies, faces, and voices (see Part III for some suggestions
along these lines). During play testing, test the NPCs for role legibility
and get player feedback on whether these key moments hold the impact
that the designer hoped for (and consider why or why not).

PARTFive
Putting It All Together
253
What Is Covered and Why
Chapters 10 and 11 offer a bird’s-eye view of applying the research presented in the
rest of the book while making a game. Chapter 10 builds from a brief overview of
the entire development process, linking theory and design suggestions to each step
along the way. Chapter 11 introduces evaluation techniques to help ensure that the
work the design team does in crafting socially and emotionally engaging character
concepts gets reflected in the end results of the development process.
Who Will Find Part V Most Useful
These chapters are a good place for the busy developer to begin considering the
application of psychology to his or her own character-crafting work of the moment.
These chapters will also be useful to someone who is trying to “evangelize” for
using a psychological approach in character design—Chapter 10 includes arguments
for the value of this approach that may win over skeptical publishers and managers.
Anyone interested in player feedback and issues of usability in games will find
Chapter 11 of particular interest.
Overview of Key Concepts
Process
Chapter 10 begins with six arguments for bringing a social-psychological approach
to game development. Issues that often come up, such as lack of time and
resources, are addressed here. The chapter includes an outline of the game develop-
ment process, for those new to the industry, and provides a phase-by-phase outline
of where specific psychological principles can be used during development. The
chapter includes an interview with master character designer Tim Schafer about his
own character-development process.

254
Evaluation
Chapter 11 makes a case for including user evaluation in the game-design process
in general and provides specific techniques for testing characters and making sure
that the principles suggested in this book are working in the ways that designers
intend. The chapter includes interviews with two games usability advocates—Randy
Pagulayan, a member of the Microsoft Games Usability team, and Nicole Lazzaro,
an independent consultant specializing in next-generation games usability.
Take-Aways from Part V
After finishing Part V, the reader will have a clear understanding of where and
when in the development process to apply the psychological principles described in
this book and an idea of when and how character evaluation fits into the develop-
ment cycle. Design teams will have checklists of criteria and methods for social
character design, and managers and design advocates will have tools for promoting
evaluation and the use of psychological principles while respecting limited time-
frames and resources for projects.

CHAPTER

Process
10.1
What Is Covered and Why
This brief chapter maps the pointers from the rest of this book onto the game-
development process, providing specific guidelines for how and when to apply the
psychological principles in this book to character-design work, from early brain-
storming all the way to postrelease planning for a sequel. The chapter also includes
rationales for taking a social-psychological approach to character design that can be
useful in convincing a team to use the tools and theory from this book.
10.2
Arguments for Bringing a Social-Psychological
Approach to Game Development
There is never enough time in the game development cycle—why add complexity
with additional design and evaluation tasks? Here are a few reasons to consider:
• It is not a time sink. Most tools provided in this book do not add time to the
development process, just new metrics and checklists to focus work that would
already be done.
• Better quality. Using social-psychological evaluation criteria on characters as the
game evolves will make the quality of characters better and more consistent.
• Stronger integration. Using the concepts and tools in this book will help root
characters more deeply in game play, and will minimize the “wish I could skip
the annoying cut-scene” phenomenon. This means that the effort put into those
scenes is not wasted in terms of overall impact of the game.
• Broader appeal. Stronger characters will help make a game’s appeal extend
beyond graphics and physics junkies to include players who want a more emo-
tionally and socially engaging experience.
• Shows off technical advances. Graphics capabilities are highlighted when charac-
ters’ social expressions are done “right.” Conversely, a great graphics engine can
make badly crafted character behaviors even more painful to watch.
255

CHAPTER TEN • PROCESS
256
• Power in a crowded marketplace. More appealing and engaging characters in a
game make marketing easier and raise the game’s chances of attracting a longer-
term audience for future sequels.
10.3
The Development Time Line
For those reading this book who are unfamiliar with the process, here is a time line
including the steps most developers take in bringing a game to market. Those
already familiar with the process can skip to Section 10.4. To learn more about the
game development process itself, see Further Reading (Section 10.7).
The typical game development cycle can be broken into three major phases:
preproduction, production, and postproduction.
10.3.1
Preproduction
This phase spans the time from the initial concept brainstorms to the creation of a
sufficiently fleshed-out prototype of the game to assure the developer that it is safe
to begin staffing up for full production. Tasks in preproduction include
• Creating a game treatment. This is done if the game is going to be pitched to a
publisher or to internal stakeholders before crafting a prototype.
• Market analysis. To make sure a game can be a success with a given audience,
there will usually be some market research and competitive analysis at this stage.
Early character designs and prototypes may be put in front of the target audience
to gauge reactions.
• Game design. This task takes early brainstorming all the way to some form of
design document along with an art bible.
• Technical feasibility testing. In preproduction, any radically new ideas about the
game-play programming will also get tested to ensure that they are feasible
before committing big resources.
• Project planning. By the end of preproduction, there should be a project plan and
a production path in place.
10.3.2
Production
This phase is the longest and the one in which the game is built out from the design
plans laid in the prior phase. Tasks in production include

10.4
BUILDING IN THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH
• Asset creation. The animations, sounds, and textures must all be created and
placed.
• Programming. The game code must be written, and all levels or areas of the
game must be assembled and tested.
• Play-testing. As the game is being crafted, testers work closely with developers to
make sure the play works and is pitched at the right difficulty level and pacing.
They also ferret out bugs.
• Marketing. In parallel to the development efforts, marketers are crafting a strat-
egy for promoting the game and are releasing material from the game to build
excitement and generate sales.
• Release. At the end of production, the game is put through some testing by players
both internal (alpha) and external (beta) to the company, then code is officially
“frozen” and a golden master is created for duplication and distribution.
10.3.3
Postproduction
After the game is released, there is still work to be done, including
• Patches and upgrades. Sometimes a game requires fixes that are released for
download. Online games may have continuing releases and upgrades throughout
the life of the persistent game world.
• Continued marketing efforts. Based on audience reactions, reviews, and so on,
the marketing tactics for a game may shift after release, to extend the lifecycle of
the game and take advantage of any unexpected positive factors (or to adapt to
negative ones).
• Postmortems and sequel planning. Development houses take what time they can
to learn from their own successes and mistakes in the design, production, and
marketing of the game. If the game is a success, there may be plans to create a
sequel or to port it to another platform, beginning the cycle anew.
10.4
Building in the Social-Psychological Approach
Figure 10.1 illustrates how the player experiences a character socially. The player’s
impression comes from surface qualities of the character as well as from her or
his interactions with the character during the course of the game. The player’s
own qualities (gender, culture, etc.) act as a lens through which he or she expe-
riences the characters. The diagram also shows the developer and the role he
or she plays in creating these impressions through design and iteration during
257

CHAPTER TEN • PROCESS
development based on observations of players engaging with the game. (To
learn more about any one of these factors, turn to Parts I through V referenced in
the diagram.)
During development, each member of the team helps shape the player’s end
experience. As Figure 10.1 illustrates, the social impression of a character arises
from all aspects of design—visuals, sounds, dialogue, as well as interactions with
the player that are coded into game play. Great character design requires a shared
team vision, crafted with careful attention to the game’s target audience. This vision
emerges during the preproduction phase.
258
A player forms social impressions of characters based on both surface and emergent effects,
which are enhanced through thoughtful crafting of each character’s social equipment.The
player’s own qualities,such as gender and cultural background,affect these impressions as well.
Designers can improve social impressions of characters by paying attention to all of these
factors during the development cycle.
F I G U R E
10.1

10.4
BUILDING IN THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH
10.4.1
Preproduction
Taking a social-psychological approach to character design ideally begins when the
game development process begins. Here are steps to take in the preproduction
phase, when brainstorming and refining a game’s design:
1. Consider qualities of target players (gender, culture, and other demographics)
and how these qualities can affect the way those players will connect to charac-
ters (see Part II for culture and gender design tips). Ideally, build a core design
team that includes members of the target player group.
2. When brainstorming, consider expanded notions of social expression for charac-
ters. (See Part III: Chapter 5 (The Face)—facial mobility, telegraphing intention,
controlling player emotions, and enhancing social relationships with NPCs;
Chapter 6 (The Body)—thinking between characters, touch and interpersonal
distance, imitation, group dynamics, and character style palettes; Chapter 7
(The Voice)—emotion in voice, social context, identity cues, and interaction
logistics.)
3. Take advantage of first-impression effects when drafting visuals and initial inter-
action concepts. (See Part I: attractiveness, baby faces, stereotypes, personality
and dominance/friendliness.)
4. Think about all four layers of player character(s)—visceral, cognitive, social, and
fantasy—when brainstorming and while refining the vision through early proto-
typing. (See Part IV: Chapter 8 (Player Characters) for tuning the four layers.)
5. Set clear character relationships for your game in your design documents. (See
Part I: Chapter 2 for the relationship diagram, including social roles for NPCs,
and see Part IV: Chapter 9 on social roles.) Make sure the affordances of your
emerging NPC concepts support these relationships in game play as well as in
cut-scenes. (See Part IV: Chapter 9 on defining emotional moments.)
By the end of the preproduction phase, the team should have
• a description of who the audience is and how and why each character appeals to
this group (guided by Part II),
• a description of each player-character’s appeal on all four psychological levels
(guided by Part IV),
• a sketch of the social relationships among all the characters in the game, with
some ideas about how these will come across in both game play and cut-scenes
(guided by Parts I and IV), and
• social expression strategies for each character (face, body, and voice) and
between characters (guided by Part III), and
259

CHAPTER TEN • PROCESS
• draft visuals of all characters that have the right social affordances for the social
plans the team has for each, including first impressions and ongoing relationship
formation (guided by Parts I and III).
These should become part of the game-design document and will be used as social-
psychological character benchmarks during the production process.
10.4.2
Production
During production, the challenge is to spread the social vision for the game’s char-
acters among the larger team and to preserve that vision through the process of
iteration, scoping, and testing. Here are specific steps that can be taken:
• Sharing the vision as the team grows.
• Spread the word among the entire production team about the social bench-
marks for all characters. Include write-ups in the design document from the
preproduction phase and go over them in meetings.
• Review the key social-expression strategies in the book with asset-creation
teams and programmers who will craft character behaviors—if they under-
stand the principles, they can make valuable incremental additions to charac-
ters as they work (see Part III on face, body, and voice; Part IV on principles of
the four-layers of player-characters, social roles, and emotional moments; and
Part I on first impressions).
• Keeping to the vision.
• During level and art reviews, ask whether results meet social guidelines that
the team set for characters. Revise accordingly (e.g., better facial expressions or
body movement [Part III], better intercharacter game-play dynamics [Part IV],
more emotionally and socially relevant dialogue [Part III], etc.).
• When making the inevitable cuts to the game’s size based on time frame,
make sure to revisit the core social goals of the game’s player- and nonplayer-
characters to preserve the integrity of that vision. Pay particular attention to
whether NPCs’ key emotional moments have been preserved [Part IV] and to
the experience of the player-character at all four layers [Part IV].
• Play-testing.
• Include character social qualities in play-testing cycles. Use the benchmarks
from preproduction as heuristics for in-house testing, handing out traits on
checklists and looking for exceptions and “deal breakers” for the target audi-
ence (see Part II for a description of some mistakes to avoid; see Chapter 11

Interview:Tim Schafer
Tim Schafer is a game designer known for his original and engaging character design
work, including the LucasArts adventure classic Grim Fandango. Schafer recently
completed directing development of a game called Psychonauts at his studio, Double
Fine Productions (www.doublefine.com). He gave a talk at the 2004 Game Devel-
oper’s Conference on character design, and we caught up with him afterward to ask
about his development process in more detail.

for more details on evaluation techniques). Have play testers identify failure
moments and frustration points that can be taken back to asset-creation and
programming-team members for modification.
• When possible, do some testing with the target audience and ask them for
feedback on the social qualities of the characters in the game (see Chapter 11
for more detail on evaluation techniques).
• Marketing.
• Guide marketers as they release materials so that they highlight the right
social qualities of your characters, based on target audience, as determined in
preproduction. Provide them with key emotional moments between characters
from the game as footage for demos (Part IV).
10.4.3
Postproduction
Once the game has been released, if there is talk of a sequel or of expanding to
other markets or platforms, the tools in this book can be helpful in refining plans.
• Use fan-site reviews and postrelease surveys that ask players for reactions to
characters to identify strengths and weaknesses. Allow for capitalizing on unex-
pected connections and appeal (see Chapter 11 for more detail).
• Apply the caveats and concerns about culture and gender (Part II) to help iden-
tify potential sticking points with new audiences.
• If the game is being considered for another platform with different affordances
(for example, GameBoy after a release on the PC), rethink whether characters’
social equipment will function in the same ways in the new format (Part III on
face, body, and voice).

CHAPTER TEN • PROCESS
262
Q: So,how do you make such great characters anyway? Just kidding (sort of) . . .
Okay, here’s my first piece of advice: study! If you are going to be making characters, sto-
ries, and settings for games, you should start with an understanding about how to do it
on paper.Take some writing classes! If you are in school,sign up for every creative writing
class your school has.If you are out of school,you can still take them at a community,jun-
ior, or state college. You learn something from every class, and if nothing else, it’s very
motivating.The only time I really write is when I have a deadline. And it’s important that
you write every day if you’re going to be a writer—whether you’re writing short stories or
video games.There is a lot of theory you’re going to need to know about how to create
character, plot, setting, and dialogue. Don’t skip that step! I mean, the artists I know that
work in games didn’t start doing art for games.They started drawing on paper, and long
after they had that skill down they transferred it to the computer. Learn the fundamen-
tals,kid!
Q: How do you dream up the initial concepts themselves? What sorts of tools do you
use to explore concepts? To put them onto paper to share them?
I seem to start with a desire to bring a certain world to life. Like the world I saw in
Mexican folk art. Those little figurines with the skeleton dentist, the skeleton bride and
groom, etc.How fun would it be to see a whole city of those skeletons going about their
lives? Similarly, someone was telling me stories about a biker friend of theirs, and it
was such an exotic (to me) and crazy world, I just wanted to walk around in it for a while
(but from the safety of my own house). Then once the world is set, I start to think who
would be the STARS of that world? If you’re going to drop the player into a world you’ve
created for them, you should make them the star of it! Not just “some dude.”There is a

tendency to say,“Okay, you are some dude, in this crazy world...”and that’s bad. (See last
question,page 266.)
So who would be the star of that world? That’s your protagonist. And then who
would be a good foil for that character? Who, by standing in opposition to your hero,
would give that hero a chance to define him or herself, and demonstrate their heroic
qualities? That’s your antagonist. And so on.The rest of your characters fall out of these
first few,critical decisions.
Q: Do you personally preside over play testing? Over art creation? Over coding? How
do you ensure the vision stays true all the way to release?
Well, you work with good people and create a shared vision among all of you for what
the game should be. Everyone brings their own take to it, but there are some big issues
that you should all agree on. Like the tone of the game, the audience, the complexity
level, etc. It’s a truly collaborative art form if done correctly. Everybody brings something
unique to it. And if you are all moving in compatible directions, then you don’t have to
oversee every tiny detail yourself.You can just trust the people doing the work.
Q: What kinds of tools do you use to communicate your (and your design team’s)
vision of your characters to the production team?
That changes a lot from game to game.I used to just use one big Word document.But as
the games get more complicated, the design doc turns into more of a “design database.”
A lot of people I know are using wiki, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki so they have all
their info up on intranet pages that the whole team can read and modify. So that might
work for the written spec.But then there is also art.I’ll work with the artists to illustrate on
paper every character and environment in the game, and then we’ll throw all of that up
on the wall so everyone can see it and be surrounded by it and inspired by it all the time.
Psychonauts is set in a summer camp for psychic children. We had 20 kids in all, and
they all needed unique personalities, abilities, and motivations. Getting it all straight in
my head was proving to be very confusing, and beyond that how was I going to convey
it to the team? Right about that time, the online social network Friendster.com came on-
line. It was really popular and new then, and I was spending a lot of time on it.You could
put up a profile about yourself, listing your likes and dislikes and other critical informa-
tion. You could also put up six pictures of yourself (but people often put up pictures of
their car or their cats instead), and most importantly, you had an area where you put a
collection of your friends, and this collection was a collection of links—little pictures of
your friends that if you clicked would take you to that person’s profile.You could then see
your friend’s friends, and your friend’s friends’ friends! You could kind of surf your social
network. It was a perfect format for describing a group of people and their relationships
to each other,so I made 20 fake Friendster profiles,one for each camp kid.They had a pic-
ture of themselves and links to which camp kids were their friends.They left little “testi-
monials” on each other’s pages, so you could see how they talked to each other. And
when it came time to pick which six pictures each camp kid would put up on their

CHAPTER TEN • PROCESS
264
profile—that was really fun.I had never thought that way about a character before.What
sort of visual collage would that character make about themselves? It was an interesting
new way to think FROM THE CHARACTER’S POINT OF VIEW, which is the trick to making
your characters real. If you can think from their point of view, you can really flesh them
out.It’s like character development through role playing,which is often how they do it in
theater.
Anyway, when the fake Friendster doc was done, I shared it with the whole Psycho-
nauts team,and everybody could read this entertaining,visual,easy-to-browse thing that
made the characters seem like real kids who existed out there in the world and had
hopes and dreams and love triangles and favorite colors and the whole deal. I think I’m
going to do that for every game I make from now on,it was such a big success.
Q: How do your visions adjust as you move into production? Any funny changes,
mistakes or catches you would be willing to share?
Q: Do you think user testing is helpful? Why (or why not)?
These two questions go together. We used to have a different main character than we
have now in Psychonauts.We started with this kid named D’Art (short for D’Artagnan) in
the game that seemed pretty cool at first. The idea was that he was kind of an acrobat
and a gypsy.So he had these loose,silk clothes and a long stocking cap.We thought that
would look cool,the hat,but we just couldn’t get the tech right for it,and it always looked
like a chunk of rock attached to his head. We were really inspired by artists like Joe
Sorren, so we made D’Art’s face an interesting, nontraditional color. And then we
designed all of the other characters in the game. By the time we came back to this guy,
he didn’t look so cool anymore. And the animators were having trouble with his stubby
little limbs, getting him to move like an acrobat. And then our publisher did a focus-
group test and we sat behind one-way glass and watched potential customers look at
our guy, D’Art. And they hated him.“Are those pajamas?”they asked. And “That blue face
freaks me out.” But the worst comment was actually the very first one. As soon as we
unveiled D’Art,some kid said,“What’s up with her hair?”
“That’s a hat,”I silently whimpered to myself on the other side of the glass,“And that’s not
a girl!”
Luckily, Scott Campbell, our art director and designer of all our characters was now done
with most of the other characters in the game and was much more clear on what he
wanted from the characters than when he started,so he went back to the drawing board
and came back with Raz, a much more agile and likeable fellow! So I guess the moral is,
don’t design your main character first.
Q: Any words of warning about what not to do to your characters when developing
the game? Things to watch out for?
Avoid “Bland Lead Character Syndrome,”no matter what anyone tells you.You hear peo-
ple saying all the time that having a blank,bland,boring main character is good because

265
that makes a “blank slate” that the player can project their own personality onto. It’s a
dirty lie! A lazy cop out! People just fall back on that because interesting main characters
are hard to write (mostly because you’re so afraid that people won’t like them, you don’t
put in any spice or risky qualities).If your main character is EXCITING and COOL, then the
player will still project themselves (or “ego-invest” as someone more academic than me
might say) into your hero.But they’ll think,“Hey,I’m that cool guy.I’m awesome.”
10.6
Summary and What Is Next
This chapter is meant to serve as a guide for when and how to apply the social-
psychological principles discussed in this book. Chapter 11 discusses evaluation
techniques for making sure that game characters function socially in the ways that
developers intend.
10.7
Exercise:Sequel Planning
Imagine that you have been asked to develop a sequel to a popular game (choose
any current best-seller with strong characters in it). Each person should draft a
development plan for the sequel, including techniques and guidelines from this
book for character development and where they will be used within the plan. Make
sure to include the postproduction phase from the current game, as well as prepro-
duction and production phases for the sequel, in your plan. Compare what you
wrote. Most likely, each of you will have incorporated a somewhat different set of
techniques and tools, partly due to your own focus within development. Trading
notes about this can help everyone to understand one another’s process and
perspective.

CHAPTER
Eleven
Evaluation
11.1
What Is Covered and Why
This chapter explains why evaluation is a crucial step in delivering great game
characters, and it provides tips for incorporating evaluation into the development
process in reasonable and sustainable ways. The chapter also includes interviews
with two forward-thinking game usability experts.
11.2
The Psychological Principles
11.2.1
Importance of Empirical Confirmation
Getting accurate feedback on whether character designs are succeeding with players
is crucial to the development process. Yet this aspect of design is often given short
shrift. Tight time lines and a tradition of developers doing double-duty as testers
until the latest stages of development mean that games have been losing out on the
value of empirical feedback for most of their history. This was less damaging when
games were a niche product for a narrow audience whose members were similar to
developers themselves in their preferences and reactions.
Here are some reasons why a development team should build evaluation into the
process:
• Need for the right fresh pair of eyes to see what has really been created. All devel-
opment team members are biased observers. They have done the work and are
highly motivated to believe that they did it right and well. Their familiarity with
the content means they can no longer see characters through a beginner’s eyes,
even if they were able to be objective about what they were seeing. A core prin-
ciple of the scientific approach is confirming your own intuitions and hypotheses
with objectively collected data from the world. Using this approach in character
design will help ensure that the team really achieves the intended effects.
• Finding out what the audience really thinks—external validity. Particularly if the
target audience includes people quite unlike the core development team, it is very
267

CHAPTER ELEVEN • EVALUATION
268
easy to wander during the design process far from an engaging experience for that
audience. Doing evaluation along the way reduces the distance between the final
design and the audience, avoiding costly disasters. Early audience feedback may
also lead to unlikely design innovations or direction shifts based on what’s work-
ing well, and that can make the game’s characters even more powerful.
• Helps justify design choices to the powers that be, when that is needed. Some-
times, especially when working with large publishers who wish to reduce risk in
a challenging market, some early evaluation data to support design choices can
make the difference in getting a concept through. It may also help to thwart
efforts to dilute the design in directions that do not truly support the game’s core
experience.
• Focus. A healthy amount of evaluation done at the right times keeps the team’s
eye on the prize—great experiences with the characters for the player. Evaluation
results can be used to help resolve internal conflicts about design directions and
keep everyone focused on the player’s overall experience instead of on individual
innovations or particular content choices.
11.2.2
Some General Guidelines
Before delving into specific methods, here are a few practical guidelines for judging
the potential usefulness of any kind of evaluation. These rules of thumb will help in
avoiding time-consuming and expensive tests with unhelpful results.
• Make sure questions are clear. Fuzzy questions produce fuzzy results. Asking the
wrong questions can produce answers that do not make sense for the stage of
development, or even that make no sense at all. These are basic truths in empiri-
cal research. The design team and evaluators need to agree on what questions
should be asked, working both from identified concerns and issues and from out-
come possibilities.
• Ask the right people. Questions should be addressed, whenever possible, to those
who will be playing the game at the end of the development process. If there are
team members who fit the audience profile, make sure they have relatively fresh
eyes for the project if they are asked to be test players. It is not possible to effec-
tively design for a target audience very different than the core development team
without using evaluation. As an example, see this article, which describes a
game that was way too hard for the adults in the team but worked just fine for
the children who were the target audience: http://www.gamasutra.com/
features/20001106/turnure_pfv.htm.
• Have a plan for how and when results will be used (and by whom). Be ready
to fix issues that arise from tests. Rather than waiting to create a summary

11.3
CURRENT EVALUATION PRACTICE IN GAME DESIGN
document, have the right people in the room so that they can see what is hap-
pening in real time and list fixes for their own teams. It is possible, if time is bud-
geted for it, to plan to make changes as problems occur during testing so that
each succeeding test player will engage with the improved version. This helps
avoid the problem of several players pointing out the same issue. Microsoft’s
Game Usability engineers use this method, which they call the RITE method
(Fulton and Medlock 2002).
• Create a team culture that embraces critique. Make sure everyone is open to and
ready to hear about what went wrong, and to make it better. It can be invaluable
to have key team members present to witness evaluation (or to show them
videotape afterward). Seeing is believing.
11.3
Current Evaluation Practice in Game Design:
Market Research and Play Testing
At present, the most common forms of evaluation in the games industry happen at
the very beginning and the very end of the process.
11.3.1
Market Research
Some publishers work with development houses to conduct market research on ini-
tial character and game concepts. This usually involves showing small focus groups
of people from the target audience sketches of characters and then walking the
audience through the basic structure of the game play. A trained moderator helps
ensure that any prior concerns the publisher has about how the audience will react
are covered during the discussion that follows. These types of tests are meant to
flush out unexpected negative reactions to characters and concepts and to identify
interest level. This tactic is relied upon to help uncover culture-specific issues (see,
for example, [Tsurumi and Hasegawa 2003], who discuss the ways that Crash

• Can be helpful in uncovering cultural faux pas in character design (e.g., inadver-
tently lewd gestures, unappealing stylization, or alienating physical qualities).
• Can be used early in the design process.
• May provide unexpected design ideas and insights as well as valuable informa-
tion about reactions to competing games’ characters.

Cons
• Can be quite unreliable, if the moderator is not good.
• May not be an effective strategy for testing a game concept with teens or other
extremely peer-sensitive audiences who may fall into group dynamics that skew
the commentary toward a dominant member’s viewpoint.
• May not be a great indicator of game success because focus groups can address
what is in front of them but cannot accurately tell you if this will lead to liking
the final product or to purchase.
11.3.2
Play Testing
The other evaluation method widely used in the games industry at present is play
testing. In contrast to market research, play testing comes toward the end of the
development cycle. Typically, play testing begins once the project has moved into
the latter end of the production stage, when design has already been completed.
Play testers ferret out bugs and help to tune the game by pointing out stuck points
and boring moments.
Play testing is usually conducted inhouse, and play testers are most often avid
gamers eager to break into the game development industry. As such, their demo-
graphic profile is typically close to that of the developers themselves.
Play testers can uncover aspects of how a character will be experienced by the
player that are difficult to see without being able to play through; for example,
overly repetitive dialogue, excessively difficult physical controls, inappropriate inter-
ventions by helper characters. They can also log bugs in characters, such as missing
dialogue or audio, strange visual artifacts, and other problems.
If asked, a play tester could probably tell the development team a great deal
about his or her general impressions of the game’s characters. This informa-
tion comes too late to result in major design changes but could result in helpful
tweaks to small-scale issues that really interfere with the desired impressions of
characters.
Pros
• Can be helpful in uncovering glitches in character production.
• Can be useful for tuning the in-game feel of characters. If play testers are
given the checklists developed in Parts II and IV of this book, they can help
ensure that the final characters in a game create the desired effects on players by
pointing out production and game-play problems that get in the way of these
effects.

TAKING DESIGN TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH PREPRODUCTION EVALUATION
Cons
• Can provide some insights about general character qualities too late to be useful.
• Will require a working, reasonably filled-in version of the game.
• Typically done by hard-core players, so may not accurately reflect the impres-
sions that the larger target audience will form.
11.4
Taking Design to the Next Level with
Preproduction Evaluation
The methods discussed above come at the beginning and end of the development
process, yet many of the crucial design decisions about characters in a game come
in the late preproduction stages, when the team is refining concepts from early
sketches, doing initial prototyping, and crafting the design vision that will shape the
final game. This is the phase where there is room for growth and improvement in
use of evaluation. Market testing typically happens too early to affect this stage, and
play testing happens too late. As Figure 11.1 shows, testing is crucial in the late pre-
production stages of a game, when change is still relatively inexpensive. Subsequent
testing should ideally be an integral aid to iteration and refinement, based upon cri-
teria and approaches established in this early phase.
Sections 11.4.1 to 11.4.3 present three evaluation techniques that can be used in
the brainstorming and early prototyping stages, as a game’s character designs get
finalized for production.
11.4.1
Informal Early Testing of Character Prototype “Hacks”
It is extremely helpful to put some visualization of the character concepts in a
gaming context to show to people in the target audience as early as possible. This
can be done even before there is a working prototype of the game. Use paper and
pencil sketches of the look and feel of the characters, combined with demonstrating
“like” interactions from existing games (e.g., the game mechanics will be like
game X, the physics of your character will feel like game Y, and the interactions
with the NPCs will work like game Z). Once there are working prototypes of some
of the character interactions, these can be substituted in follow-up tests. Use the
social roles and defining moments from Part IV to compare with players’ initial
reactions. Do they come up with a similar set of traits when asked to describe what
they see (that is, are the social qualities legible)? Do they ask questions about rela-
tionships among characters, or about the abilities and motivations of the player
character(s) that can help round out the social design for the characters? Do they
express hesitations or frustrations that could mean your concepts are in need of
major revision?
271

CHAPTER ELEVEN • EVALUATION
This process helps gauge broad reactions to character concepts. It also provides
the development team with a better-integrated picture of how characters will func-
tion, even prior to having a working prototype. Because the best characters work
both top-down, in terms of surface qualities, and bottom-up, in terms of game-play
dynamics, this will help everyone get a feel for whether the characters work overall
(instead of just whether the visuals are appealing).
This sort of testing is meant to be informal and conducted in service of the
design (not as a “go or no go” tool for publishers). It will work most efficiently if
the design team is able to witness the test (either by watching during or by looking
at videos as a group later on) rather than waiting for a written report from a testing
service. These types of tests can be built into a preproduction schedule alongside
internal design reviews. If your development house can cultivate a pool of test can-
didates from the target audience who can be quickly brought in for some informal

interaction, it is more likely that you will use this technique. These could be friends
and relatives of coworkers, so long as they fit the desired demographics. Building it
into the process will help reduce unpleasant surprises later on and will keep the
team from wandering too far down a character-concept path that looks exciting but
does not resonate with players.
11.4.2
Social Heuristics
It helps to have guiding qualities by which to judge design iterations even before
putting anything in front of players. The suggestions in Part IV can also be used to
create heuristics during the design iteration process (see [Nielsen 1994] for empiri-
cal validation of the power of design heuristics to catch problems). Asking (as a
team) whether a player-character works at all four layers as planned, or whether an
NPC is delivering on role expectations and giving the player the right key emotional
moments, will keep the overall experience of the characters in mind as designs shift
and evolve and will focus development efforts. When there are design reviews, go
back to the lists of qualities and relationships you created to see if the desired
effects are being achieved, and make changes to these checklists based on new
qualities that have emerged from the design process that make the concepts even
stronger. These checklists should be used simultaneously—in reviewing artwork,
early game physics, and interaction mock-ups—to keep the experience of the char-
acters integrated.
11.4.3
Preproduction Reality Check
When the team feels the design is ready to go, it is time for a more formal evalua-
tion using the target audience. Players should be able to clearly “read” the social
traits of characters and should find the characters engaging and appealing in
the ways that have been outlined by the team. (In particular, the four layers of
the player-character should be working well, and interactions with the NPCs should
be socially satisfying and emotionally engaging in the ways that have been
planned.)
It is very difficult to correct appeal problems once full-scale production begins.
Also, if the traits that have been specified are not legible to the target audience
testers, they will probably not be clear to developers who are added to the full-scale
production team. This means the characters are likely to get even muddier in terms
of social traits through the rest of the process, lowering the social clarity of the
game and making the overall game experience less engaging and satisfying.
As with the early informal testing, this evaluation process will go most quickly
and smoothly if the whole design team is present to see the tests for themselves or to
watch video as a group and make joint decisions about any actions. This preproduc-
tion reality check is an appropriate tool to use in aiding a “go” or “no go” decision
273

CHAPTER ELEVEN • EVALUATION
for a publisher, and results can help to bolster the case for a design that may feel
risky to a publisher.
11.5
A Note on Postproduction Evaluation
Often a development team is more than ready to stop thinking about a game once it
has been released and move on to the next one. However, particularly if there is
some talk of a sequel, it is worth doing some postproduction analysis of a game’s
characters to plan for their evolution in future (and to learn from mistakes made in
the current release).
Consider combining an analysis of comments about characters on game-review
Web sites with some kind of player survey. Ask registered players questions about
the character qualities discussed in this chapter, and in Part IV, along with questions
about their own demographics. It is possible to find that the game appeals to
an unexpected audience segment or that players are responding powerfully to a
character that was not central to the development team or to a trait that seemed
very minor. Logging these effects allows the team to capitalize on them in the
next release. Why not take advantage of the momentum of release to gather this
information?
11.6
Evaluation Checklist
Whether using market research, preproduction audience tests and heuristics, or
play testing, there is a common set of social qualities that can be used to guide
observations. In combination with the guidelines from Part IV, these can serve as
criteria to test at any stage. Be careful to tie the answers to these questions to spe-
cific observed interactions with characters whenever possible so that the team
knows what to change to fix the problem.
• General response.
Does the player like this character?
Are they interested in seeing more of this character?
Does the character seem to come to life or does it seem mechanical?
Is it fun to play with this character?
Does the player want to know more about the character?
What makes the person say so? (Ask them to provide memorable impressions of
the character that led to this overall impression.)
• Emotional direction.
Is the player having the desired emotional responses to the character’s actions?
(Target moments that should be very emotional for a player and look to see if
this is actually happening.)
274

11.7
GAMES USABILITY PERSPECTIVES
• Social legibility.
If asked to describe the character, does the player describe the traits that were
sketched out for this character?
Can the player identify the social role of each NPC?
• Affordances.
Is the player clear about how to interact with NPCs?
Does what is possible match up with what the player thinks of doing and/or
wants to do?
Is the player clear on the use value of NPCs (that is, what they can do for the
player)?
Is it fun to interact with the NPC, or is it in some way burdensome, annoying, or
repetitive?
• Identification.
Does the player enjoy being the player-character?
Does the experience of being this character work well at all four layers (visceral,
cognitive, social, and fantasy—see Part IV)?
What specific affordances or behaviors of the player-character cause very nega-
tive or positive reactions?
• Connection.
Does the player enjoy interaction with NPCs, beyond their functional value?
Does the player want to see more (or less) of an NPC?
How connected does the player feel to an NPC?
How much empathy or antipathy does she or he express toward the NPC?
What specific behaviors of the NPC cause very negative or positive reactions?
• Danger signs that a player does not like a character:
obvious or expressed boredom,
rude behavior toward or comments about a character that is supposed to evoke
empathy,
avoidance of interaction with characters when it is optional, and
expression of dissociation and impatience with the story of the game.

Games Usability Perspectives
Following are interviews with two practitioners in the emerging field of games
usability. Randy Pagulayan is a user research lead at Microsoft, one of the first
major development/publishing houses to systematically incorporate user testing
into the game-development process. Pagulayan and his colleagues have presented
work on user testing at the Game Developers Conference several times in the last
few years, helping to broaden interest in incorporating these tactics into the devel-
opment process.

Nicole Lazzaro founded an independent consultancy that is doing ground-breaking
work in understanding player emotions during game play, as well as conducting
various forms of user research. She has given talks about the user experience at the
Game Developers Conference in 2004 and 2005.
11.8
Interview:Randy Pagulayan
Q: What’s your method, in a nutshell, for incorporating user testing and evaluation
into a game-design cycle? Where in the cycle and how?
I don’t know if we have a method per se, mainly because the game-design cycle can be
quite different for different development teams. That said, I guess the philosophy we
use . . . could be summed up in a few statements; if it’s a researchable question or a
situation where the perspective of your audience is required and/or useful, then we can
probably provide some value.From concept phase,to user-testing core game mechanics,
final game polishing, to evaluations on the finished product, there is usually something
we can do to help out.
Q: Why do you think user testing is valuable?
I guess two things come to mind for this question; user testing can be a “sanity check”,
and it can also be your “Magic 8 Ball.” More often than not, the most successful games
out there are a result of a large group of extremely passionate individuals. In a lot of
ways,your level of passion for a given project is what can make the difference between a
good game and a great game. On the other side of that coin though, you run the risk of
losing objectivity. User testing done throughout the dev process is like a splash of cold

water. It’s not hard to reset your viewpoint when you see a new user interacting with
your game. It will often remind you of things you forgot, and also uncover new things
you couldn’t predict.
Regarding the “Magic 8 Ball,” well, there will always be questions and assumptions
made throughout the entire dev process. For some of these questions, user testing can
provide those answers.Will players understand right away how to use that new “energy
sword”? How long will it take players to find all “five keys”to open up the treasure chest?
Can players discover the new multiplayer feature you implemented? And so on.
Q: How has this created value for the games you’ve worked on? Bugs you’ve caught?
Broader user appeal? Both specific stories and general information appreciated here.
Good question. Most of our work over the past few years focused on the initial game
experience.Our goal was to make sure that the entry point into games was as smooth as
possible, so we focused much of our energies on the first hour (give or take a few min-
utes) of game play. This includes the usability of the game shell (option screens, game
setup, etc.), in-game displays, understanding game-play objectives, understanding core
game-play mechanics, and making sure the difficulty level was appropriate, that kind of
thing, and of course that it was fun! More recently, we’ve been developing methods for
user testing the entire game experience.To use Halo as an example, in the original Halo,
our team focused on core game components (player and vehicle controls, aiming, etc.),
did fairly extensive user testing on the first mission and the tutorial and part of the sec-
ond one, and did usability work on the interface (game shell and in-game display). For
Halo 2, our team was able to do much more.We did similar types of usability testing on
new game-play mechanics (dual-wielding weapons, new weapon usage, new training
system, etc.). However, we also provided user-testing coverage on the entire game—
at least several iterations on every level—and were able to identify problem areas, make
changes, then verify with additional user-testing sessions. More importantly, we were

able to do it within the constraints of a tight shipping schedule by being so integrated
with the project team.
Q: Do you specifically test game characters? For example, reactions to characters,
legibility of the character’s personality and purpose,look and feel of player-characters,
controllability of NPCS,and so on? How so?
We do, but more often in the context of a specific game-play mechanic.Take Brute Force
for example. This is a third-person shooter game where you are part of a squad of four
characters.Each character has a unique special ability.You are in control of only one char-
acter at a time, but you can give commands to the other three, and you as a player can
also hop from character to character as well (i.e., control each character separately). In
this case,there were many design challenges to overcome that user testing assisted with:
the interface for giving commands to each or multiple characters, understanding the
special ability of each character and when and how to use them,etc.
Q: What would you say to a developer who said it is too complicated or too expen-
sive to do user testing?
I guess I’d start with some of the things I’ve said earlier about why user testing is valu-
able, then give specific examples and success stories. From there, getting the developer
to see it in action is worth more than any discussions or logical arguments you may pres-
ent.The best part is, giving them a taste of what it’s like can cost next to nothing and be
fairly simple. In my experience, developers seeing a real user interact with their product
the first time is almost like a light switch that turns on. They usually see the value fairly
quickly.
Q: What do you think are the most interesting challenges in user testing?
For this question,I’m referring to user testing more broadly,that is,user testing as a disci-
pline as opposed to user testing as an activity or particular methodology.
User testing in games is still in its infancy (relative to other disciplines in the field), so
interesting challenges can be widespread, not to mention that the games industry is
evolving quite rapidly. So from there, I guess I see two categories of challenges that will
always be there: content accessibility challenges and logistical challenges. From the con-
tent perspective, there are a ton of research areas that can help game developers and
game designers (e.g., sociology, psychology, ethnography, and other related fields
regarding human behavior). The problem here is making that information accessible,
something that developers can use when thinking about designing their games. It’s not
an issue of educating them on the differences between the indirect and direct models of
perception (for example), but an issue of taking bits and pieces of those models to pro-
vide a framework that is useful to them. I’d be very surprised if game designers spent
much time reading peer-reviewed journals to see what the latest research is saying. I
think the character work you’re doing is a good example of this, taking techniques from
research that can be applied in their everyday work.

INTERVIEW: NICOLE LAZZARO
279
From the logistics side of things, there will always be challenges with how one gets
inserted into the development cycle.One thing to recognize is that no matter how much
you plan, you never have enough time when trying to get a game on the shelves. The
challenges here lie in your ability to integrate yourself as early as you can in the schedule
to try and catch potential problems that may surface later. A simple example is doing
prototype tests on a UI (user interface) flow before it is coded.But where things get really
sticky are in the “crunch,”those infamous few months toward the end of the cycle where
every second counts.To be successful, you need to have a system that allows you to still
collect valuable user-centered data, but still be able to analyze it, and turn it around in
time for designers to still utilize. Any user-testing methods you can develop to exist in
that kind of an environment should be considered a big win!
Q: Any pitfalls you’d advise readers to watch out for? Methods you think are
especially good?
Pitfalls? A couple come to mind, but these are just my personal opinions. For one, I do
believe that bad or misleading data is worse than no data. User-testing methods are
often suited to answer a particular kind of question,and projecting conclusions based on
incorrect methodologies can be dangerous.Leave the data analysis to those trained in it.
Another pitfall to watch out for is to not rely on user testing for design.For you designers,
know what you are designing and have a strong vision for it. Once you know that, then
user testing will help you realize that vision.
Q: Any thoughts on future directions of games usability or testing? New techniques?
Technologies? Giving people a hint about the future here would be great.
Games have always been a social experience, whether it’s between two friends battling
out a game against one another, or a single player against a swarm of digital bad guys.
Investigating methods and techniques that can tap into that social element of gaming is
definitely a worthy cause. Other future directions? Corner a game designer, ask them
what they want to know when designing a game, what information do they need that
would persuade them to make a design change? Any methods you come up with to
help answer those questions would be a step toward the future as well.
11.9
Interview:Nicole Lazzaro
Q: What’s your method, in a nutshell, for incorporating user testing and evaluation
into a game-design cycle? Where in the cycle and how?
At XEODesign we call it Player Experience Research; because, more than testing users, we
look at their experiences playing. Because we focus on improving the game, we think of
it as design research rather than market research. It’s important to differentiate between
market focus groups and usability testing. In usability testing you watch how people
learn to play.To do this we watch people play, what they do, what they find difficult, and

CHAPTER ELEVEN • EVALUATION
280
what they find fun or not fun.We want to know how easily players build a mental model
of how to play and how closely it matches the designer’s intent.
Save money: test early, test often. Clients come to us feeling it’s too early to test, and
leave wishing they’d hired us a lot sooner.We recommend starting as early as possible in
the design cycle starting with paper prototypes and ending with playable builds during
alpha and beta testing. The user interface (UI) for most games can be worked out and
tested on paper before any of the code is built.
Q: Why do you think user testing is valuable?
Life’s full of surprises; your player experience shouldn’t be one of them. Seriously, unless
you watch people outside of your company play your game, you have no idea what it
feels like for someone to play your game for the first time. Player experience testing is
one of the most cost-effective methods to improve product quality. The people who
design games are fundamentally different than the people who play them. It takes a lot
of specialized skills and talent to make a great game. Chances are your customer has a
different set of life experiences and expectations than developers.Ironically, most games
require experience with other games in the same genre to understand how to play. By
testing early with players,a team can identify show-stopping issues before they get built
into the game.Customers only have access to what ships, and so what ships needs to be
self-explanatory.
Q: How has this created value for the games you’ve worked on? Bugs you’ve caught?
Broader user appeal? Both specific stories and general information appreciated here.
XEODesign’s Player Experience Research adds value by making it possible to serve, sup-
port, sell, and satisfy more customers.First, it identifies usability issues so more people are
able to play (for example,in one study nine out of ten players could not find the start but-
ton!). Second, it reduces support calls. Third, it makes selling easier by creating positive

281
word of mouth. Fourth, we look at how the game’s emotional profile matches player
expectations.
Most of the value comes from knowing how players will react to aspects of your game
before it ships, so the team can make changes.The developers of a game were surprised
to see that it mystified people from the target market (a more casual demographic). It
was remarkable to watch how prior experience with other games “filled in the gaps” for
some players to succeed, while it left other players in the dark, unsure if they were mak-
ing progress or what the goal was.
Having a consistent and well-organized UI means that more people will be able to
play the game. For another project, the client came to us so late in the development
process that they didn’t have time to fix the issues players encountered.The subsequent
New York Times review neatly summarized the usability issues we identified. By knowing
earlier in the process, the team would have had time to react and the game would have
done much better.
Q: Do you specifically test game characters? For example,reactions to characters,legi-
bility of the character’s personality and purpose, look and feel of player-characters,
controllability of NPCs,and so on? How so?
We have run focus groups on characters such as how cool they look, what special pow-
ers they have, and how they are dressed. There are interesting differences between
Asia and the United States in terms of preferences for character design. So it is impor-
tant to do these types of tests in your major target markets with a large enough sam-
ple size.
Beyond aesthetics, I think it is equally if not more important to get feedback on a
character interaction—how it feels to be that character. Game characters are a very
important part of the player experience and require special attention during testing.Fre-
quently, character action and motion requires such a steep learning curve that many
players stop. That’s what makes Grand Theft Auto and Katamari Damacy so easy to start
and play.You don’t have to be that good at the controller to have fun.
Simply providing “appealing” characters doesn’t guarantee engagement. One game
concept turned a first-person game into a third-person experience. Even though the
characters could be customized to look like the player,this wasn’t how they liked playing.
You have to make sure the experience of being that character provides the type of fun
that your audience wants.
Q: What would you say to a developer who said it is too complicated or too expen-
sive to do user testing?
Given the amount of money at stake and the complexity of today’s game designs,
who can afford not to do player testing? The cost to obtain player experience feedback
is small when you look at the cost of lost sales, product returns, and customer support
calls. It surprises me how many games are evaluated based on what the guy in the next
cubicle thinks is fun. I ask this of my clients all the time:“If you don’t have the time or

CHAPTER ELEVEN • EVALUATION
282
budget to do it right, do you have the luxury of doing it wrong?”The cost of not selling
units because of usability is high. Most UI issues can be looked at with paper and pencil
testing before the first prototype is built. If you find out that players don’t like the new
innovative game mechanic in late beta or after the game ships, there is not a lot the
developer can do.
Q: What do you think are the most interesting challenges in user testing?
Observing the game without influencing the player’s experience and not providing help
is challenging. It is very easy to bias a game study. Not long ago one of our clients had
already done a lot of what they thought was user testing, but because of the way they
set it up, they influenced the results. Unfortunately, there were issues that they had no
idea were there because of the way they ran their internal testing.We see this a lot.
Q: Any pitfalls you’d advise readers to watch out for? Methods you think are
especially good?
Too many people confuse user testing with market testing. It is very important to watch
people, who haven’t seen your game, play for the first time unassisted.Talking with play-
ers seated around a table (as in a marketing focus group), if done well, can answer ques-
tions about packaging,price,and positioning.However,this style of testing will yield very
little data on player experiences,what it feels like to play your game.
My advice to others is, bring in people from your target market and watch them play.
While they play, don’t provide help. Instead, give them a card with a basic description of
the game and watch to see how much they can discover on their own. Pay attention to
how they do so. In looking at your results, don’t let players design your game (that’s the
game designer’s job). Do listen to what they have to say, and note what they try to do
and how they try to do it. These are clues to increasing usability. Pay attention to what
they find fun or not fun. Look for patterns in their needs and interests. If I’m not com-
pletely surprised by at least one thing in a study,I run the study again.
Never run your own observation sessions.Watch them, but don’t be there in the same
room.You’d be surprised at how easy it is to influence the player.Even I have someone else
run observations on my own designs.The insights of a neutral third party are highly valu-
able. Plus, they will come up with angles on your design that you hadn’t thought of and
others you’ve forgotten about. Be sure to watch the observations, preferably in person.
Don’t just rely on the report. Player experiences are qualitative and happen over time.
You’ll get a deeper visceral understanding of a player’s pains and joys by being there.
Q: Any thoughts on future directions of games usability or testing? New techniques?
Technologies? Giving people a hint about the future here would be great.
XEODesign is doing a lot of groundbreaking research on how games create emotions
through doing (as opposed to story or art). This cross-genre research on why we play
games looks at what processes players most enjoy about games and how they produce
emotions. We’ve found that people play games for the experiences that games create.

11.11
SUMMARY
283
Whether it’s the way the game changes how they feel inside,like blowing off frustrations
from work, or the warm feeling of spending time with friends, games affect how players
think and feel.What I’m looking forward to is to continue to refine these models to help
game designers make player experiences that are more engaging and produce a wider
spectrum of emotions than frustration and fear.
The most interesting technology I’m tracking is FMRI (functional magnetic resonance
imaging) studies. I’d like to watch what parts of the brain are engaged at different
moments in play. It would be fascinating to see what structures are engaged in com-
puter games and compare the activity to what happens during other forms of recreation
such as board games or movies.
11.10
Affective Sensing:An Evaluation Method for
the Future?
One interesting direction in evaluation that is relevant to character design for games
is the physical measurement of emotion. People can be inaccurate (both intention-
ally and unintentionally) when asked to report their emotional state. Usually they are
asked to report emotions after an experience is over, and it can be hard to remember
all the feelings that occurred during the course of an experience. Increasingly, scien-
tists are able to detect traces of emotion through physical monitoring—reading gal-
vanic skin response, heart rate, pupil dilation, voice qualities, facial expressions (for
example, work at MIT—see Kapoor et al., 2003), and even images of blood flow in
the brain (the FMRI that Lazzaro mentions in her interview). It may not be long
before such systems are ready for trials in everyday evaluation situations. Being able
to trace the arc of a player’s emotions during play could help pinpoint moments of
frustration, confusion, and boredom, and could give designers a clearer picture
of when and where their designs are failing. Of course, these benefits will have to
be balanced against concerns about privacy and about potential abuse of such
systems.

Summary
This chapter highlighted the importance of evaluation to the character-
design and development process. Common methods in the industry at present—
market research and play testing—were discussed, as well as some suggested
methods for improving character design in the critical preproduction stage.
Guidelines applicable to any character evaluation situation were presented, and
the chapter ended with interviews with two user research specialists from the
games industry.

CHAPTER ELEVEN • EVALUATION
284
11.12
Exercises
11.12.1
Market Research—Compare and Contrast
Take a character concept that you have developed and conduct two
separate focus groups—one with your target audience and one with an
audience you think will definitely not like your designs. Show the
sketches, discuss the game concept, and then let the group share their
impressions with you. Did you get the results you expected with each
audience? Were there surprises? What design choices might you make
based upon what you have found?
11.12.2
Character Quality Control
At the end of the design phase of your game, use the suggestions
regarding player-character and NPC qualities from Part IV to create
guidelines for your production team. Share them with the other teams
if you are in a class. After your first development milestone, conduct
play-testing evaluations for one another, based on these lists. How well
did you stick to your goals? Where did you diverge and why? Use this
information to guide any necessary course correction.

APPENDIX
GAME SUMMARY:
Animal Crossing, though categorized as a role-playing game, has quite a few simi-
larities to the open play-style and customization possibilities of The Sims. The
player is given a character who is a new arrival to a small town, where she or he
must choose and furnish a house and earn a living. “Chatting” with other citizens
and helping them is a large part of the game dynamic, as is shopping for clothing
and household items. There is an extensive range of collectible objects, from bugs
to wallpaper to Nintendo Entertainment System emulator games for your household
game console. The game world includes season changes and holiday events, using
the system clock to keep time passing. It is possible to travel from your village to a
friend’s, using memory cards. The game also has components that can be played on
a GameBoy when hooked to the GameCube. This game’s simple game-play style
makes it very approachable. Animal Crossing developed a broad grassroots fan base
of both male and female players. Image courtesy of Nintendo.

2001 BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Interactive
awards for Interactivity and Moving Images
GAME SUMMARY:
Black & White: Creature Isle, is a genre-crossing addition to the real-time strategy
game Black & White for the PC. This version of the game features a trainable crea-
ture that acts as the player’s pet and minion, using artificial intelligence so that it
can learn and evolve a moral character, depending upon the player’s commands
and feedback. Peter Molyneaux joined in the development of this game and was
the creative visionary behind the use of such extensive AI and adaptability in the
creature.

PLATFORM:
PlayStation
RELEASED:
1996
GAME SUMMARY:
This title launched one of the most popular game characters of the 1990s on the
original PlayStation platform. Crash Bandicoot was a transitional game—partly 3D,
partly the more traditional side-scroller game style from whence it evolved. Game-
play involves collecting fruit and crashing into enemies, with a heavy emphasis on
jumping. Crash was wildly popular in the Japanese market, although it was devel-
oped in America. Crash Bandicot and related characters are ® and ©Universal Inter-
active, Inc. and are utilized with permission.

(Computer Games Strategy Plus)
GAME SUMMARY:
The Curse of Monkey Island is the third in a popular series of adventure games featur-
ing the escapades of the comic hero Guybrush Threepwood. Guybrush, unlike the
typical pirate, relies more upon his wit than his sword. The player meets game-play
challenges primarily through a combination of witty repartee with other characters
and clever puzzle-solving using collectible items. The game has a Saturday-morning
cartoon feel to it—there is an evil archenemy pirate named Le Chuck and a love inter-
est who must be rescued named Elaine. Like other LucasArts adventure games of this
era, The Curse of Monkey Island features amazing voice talent as well as artful use of
2D graphics. ©1997 Lucasfilm Entertainment Company Ltd. All rights reserved.

ection and which foot to tap onto a pressure-sensitive foot pad. DDRMAX is typi-
cally played two at a time, side by side. The game has a widespread fan base and
tournament culture. Players are given letter grades for their performance and can
compete based upon grade. They also sometimes create their own style-based
criteria for success, such as dancing facing away from the screen or using two pads
at once. KONAMI and DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution are registered trademarks

GAME SUMMARY:
Hailed for ground-breaking technical advances that resulted in amazingly lifelike
graphics, Doom 3 is at heart a classic, first-person shooter in the tradition of the
prior Doom games. The player is a space Marine shooting at various demons as she
or he works through a series of levels. This game marks the transition of game NPC
animation to a whole new level of realism.

DEVELOPER:

AWARDS:
2001 Game of the Year Award,CESA (Tokyo Game Show)
GAME SUMMARY:
Final Fantasy X is number ten in a long-standing series of role-playing games
designed by Japan’s Squaresoft. The more recent Final Fantasy games are known for
their unique combination of extended animated sequences, or “cut-scenes,” with
turn-based combat that draws upon the old paper-and-pencil Dungeons and Dragons
model. As with any other role-playing game, players build the skills and powers of
their characters slowly over time; however, this version of the game continues to
refine Squaresoft’s own character-advancement system, which is not modeled strictly
upon the Dungeons and Dragons rules. Players either love or hate the cut-scenes,
which reveal the soap-operaesque relationships among the characters in the player’s
fighting party and show the complex mythology of the game-world itself. The game
requires quite a time investment—it is not something that can be picked up and
quickly completed. This game drew great praise for its stunning graphics. Final Fan-
tasy X ©2001 Square Enix Co., Ltd. Character Design: Tetsuya Nomura.

GAME SUMMARY:
The player-character, Manny Calavera, has recently passed away in this LucasArts
film-noir adventure-game classic, designed by Tim Schafer. Grim Fandango is based
on Mexican folklore, which suffuses the story line as well as the visuals. According
to tradition, the dead spend four years in the underworld, working off debt for their
sins before reaching the final resting place. Your mode of travel during this time is
determined by your previous life on earth, so a virtuous and wealthy person travels
first class, while a poor sinner has to hoof it. In Grim Fandango, our hero Manny
falls into the latter category—he works in the Department of Death, selling first-
class tickets to newly dead customers while working off his own debt.
Grim Fandango

APPENDIX
The story and game play progress as Manny slowly realizes, through point-and-
click exploration and dialogue with other characters, that the underworld is plagued
by corruption. He sets out to discover what has gone wrong. Leading Manny
through the underworld, the player solves various puzzles and encounters many
colorful characters en route to solving the mystery and saving the day. To interact,
the player chooses lines of dialogue for Manny from carefully crafted menus of
options. The writing for this game is revered for its depth, originality, and style.

GAME SUMMARY:
This is the story of Gordon Freeman’s quest to save humanity from an extra-
dimensional alien invasion. Gordon, a research physicist at an underground facility,
inadvertently opens a portal to another dimension. Gordon blasts, shoots, and
crowbars his way out of the facility only to encounter Marines and assassins
attempting to cover up any evidence of the aliens and the scientists who released
them. Gordon is then chased through the facility by both the Marines and aliens,
winding his way to the Lambda Core where he enters a portal to take the fight to
the aliens’ home world.
Gordon finds increasingly lethal weapons as the game progresses. He begins with
a crowbar that is only useful for opening ventilation ducts and boarded doorways
and for bludgeoning crabs. He finishes with the Gluon Gun, an experimental laser
beam straight out of Ghostbusters, that tears through everything in a matter of sec-
onds.
Half-Life does an excellent job of integrating story elements into game play.
Instead of pulling away from the action and presenting information as a series
of cut-scenes or text descriptions, Half-Life has them unfold inside the game.
The player retains control of Gordon as he watches the Marines mow down a
group of scientists that believe they are about to be rescued. Even when the
scientists give Gordon mission briefings, he is still free to run and jump around
the room or to beat them with his weapons. The option to pay attention is up to
the player.
The game mixes minor puzzles with the combat. For instance, at one
point Gordon must lead a group of scientists to a retina scanner in order to open
the door to the next area. While leading them to the scanner, he must defeat a Spe-
cial Forces unit that blocks his path. Occasionally, Gordon runs into a “Barney,”
facility security guards who all look alike, who offers to team up with Gordon. This
helper NPC shoots at the enemy with a weak gun but perfect aim and sometimes
serves as a distraction so Gordon can sneak around in the midst of the enemy,
unharmed. Half-Life ©1995–2005 Value Corporation. All rights reserved.

GAME SUMMARY:
This science fiction shooter title was released at the launch of the Xbox, helping to
push the sales of the console. The player-character is Master Chief, a cyborg soldier
fighting aliens known as the Covenant. Master Chief’s goal is to prevent the aliens
from obtaining an unknown object on the planet Halo. The game requires more
strategy on the player’s part than perhaps would be the case in its first-person
shooter predecessors. The player-character is limited to carrying two weapons at a
time, which requires some decisions about which weapons are best to have on
hand given each battle situation. In addition, the artificial intelligence of the
enemies works to keep the player thinking about tactics; the Covenant work in a

tains many changing variables, such as the placement of objects and enemies, as
well as enemy reaction to the player’s different strategies.
In addition to the single-player mode, Halo supports up to 16 players simultane-
ously (by hooking up four Xbox consoles each with four controllers). These multi-
player, split-screen modes include games like “capture the flag” and “king of the
hill,” as well as team-based fighting. Screenshot from Halo®: Combat Evolved ©2005

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
DEVELOPER:
Infocom
GENRE:
text adventure
PLATFORM:
Apple II,Atari ST,Commodore 64,DOS
RELEASED:
1984
GAME SUMMARY:
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy united Douglas Adams with Steve Meretsky,
the programmer of Planetfall. The result was perhaps the first game written by a
writer instead of a programmer. The text adventure game was not quite a retelling
of Adam’s classic, but it did present all of the book’s major set pieces. The player
gets to experience the book’s events from the point of view of all of the major char-
acters—Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian. The game shows Arthur’s house, the
pub, the Vogon spaceship, the Heart of Gold, and even Traal.
299

APPENDIX
The game begins in the dark and returns there frequently. The puzzles are
extremely difficult, and most of them have lethal consequences if they go unsolved.
In fact, the game is very unforgiving and taunts the player for failing to complete it.
When the player has been floundering around in the dark for too long, the game
informs the player, “Something stinks in here, and it’s not just your puzzle-solving
ability!” The notice is as much a hint as it is an insult. It is possible to beat the
game without knowledge of the book, and it is very likely that knowledge of the
book may hinder completing the game since the two deviate from one another a bit.
Adams said in an interview that after the game was released, he found that it had
an unbalanced difficulty distribution: instead of starting easy and building up to
more difficult puzzles later in the game, many of the most difficult and crucial puz-
zles occur fairly early in the game.
For a text adventure, the game’s text engine was relatively successful. It could
parse six-word sentences and had clever responses to unexpected commands: after
entering a command the game did not have a real response for, the game tells the
player that the command caused an interstellar war in which billions died and to be
more careful when choosing words in the future.
Hitchhiker’s Guide shipped with a box of accessories that included “Peril-sensitive
glasses,” pocket fluff, a plastic bag containing a microscopic space fleet, and a
wearable “Don’t Panic” button. Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy ©Ed Victor Ltd.

GAME SUMMARY:
ICO is the story of a boy banished from his village because he was born with horns.
The boy, Ico, escapes from his confinement within a large castle, soon to find his
companion for most of the game, a fairy-like girl named Yorda. The player discovers
more of the story line as the game progresses, meanwhile exploring the castle and sur-
roundings, solving puzzles that block the characters’ path, battling dark shapeless ene-
mies, and helping both Yorda and Ico escape. To keep Yorda from disappearing down
black enemy holes, the player may hold her hand to tug her toward safety . . . or call

her to Ico’s side. As Ico vigilantly protects Yorda, she returns the favor by unlocking
magical doors throughout the game, which Ico cannot do by himself.
ICO is renowned for its elegant, aesthetic environment and ambient sound,
adding to the game’s immersive quality, similar to the experience within the Myst
series. The dramatic scale of the environment—vast, vacant rooms and bottomless
depths—contrasts with the diminutive size of Ico. This is an interesting choice of
hero: a small boy shunned by society, rather than a powerful fighter, as seen in sev-
eral popular action-adventure games. Although the game was not a best seller, it
acquired a strong following and was much appreciated, as evidenced by the numer-
ous awards it has received. ICO is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment

AWARDS:

GAME SUMMARY:
Jak and Daxter are adventurous best friends who disregard warnings against travel-
ing to nearby Misty Island. At the game’s beginning, they have set off to investigate
the ruins of the ancient Precursor people. Unfortunately, Daxter falls in an evil
substance that transforms him into a muskrat. After conferring with their mentor

APPENDIX
back at home, Jak, with Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a quest to find a way to
return Daxter to his human form.
Although the game is primarily a 3D platformer, it has a bit of adventure genre game
play as well—the player is asked to solve small puzzles, and to retrieve items for
characters encountered along the way. These elements, as well as several minigames,
are part of the central story line as the two friends close in on the wise sage who
holds the muskrat cure. Most of the game play is action-based; Jak can jump, kick,
spin, stomp, pilot vehicles, battle enemies, and make use of magical potions to
extend his powers of speed, attack range, health, and weapon selection. Daxter is
along for the ride, perched on Jak’s shoulder, and occasionally offering game-play
tips or witty commentary. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is a registered trade-

AWARDS:
GameSpot Editor’s Choice; and Golden Joystick 2003:GameCube Game
of the Year

APPENDIX
GAME SUMMARY:
A continuation of the successful Zelda series, Nintendo’s colorful Windwaker opens
with a cut-scene of the main player-character, Link, and his sister playing around
their home island. The sister is soon carried away by an evil bird, and Link’s adven-
ture begins. Link sets out to save his sister in hopes of eventually realizing the
higher goal of defeating a growing evil throughout the islands.
As Link confronts various helpers, enemies, and boss monsters on the several
islands throughout the game, he also acquires objects that enable him to perform
certain actions and thus progress further in the game. These objects include bombs,
arrows, a grappling hook, iron boots, and power bracelets. A key object in the game
is its namesake, the windwaker, a baton which allows Link to perform various mag-
ical spells, from controlling the direction of the wind to controlling the movements
of another character. Game play can be open-ended, especially in the latter half of
the game in which the player-character is encouraged to visit various islands to
explore, trade, collect, and to engage in minigames. Alternatively, the player may
choose to be more direct in following the story line to defeat the pervading evil.
The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker may initially have shocked some fans of
the series by not offering a more realistic art style. Instead, it uses cel-shaded graph-
ics that seem Disneyesque. The effect seems to work, creating a lively 3D cartoon
infused with excellent animation and emotion. Image courtesy of Nintendo.

GAME SUMMARY:
This is a continuation of the popular adventure game series based on an unlikely
hero’s stereotypical bachelor escapades. The Leisure Suit Larry games have always
pushed the boundaries of taste with plenty of sexual innuendo along the lines of the
TV show Three’s Company. The player advances by helping Larry choose dialogue
artfully with the goal of getting close to a series of women. The first game was a text
adventure; this edition of the game allows the player to use the text interface as well
as dialogue menu choices. The game takes place on a cruise, hence the subtitle.

GAME SUMMARY:
Max Payne, a young and energetic narcotics cop, arrives home to find his baby and
wife being murdered upstairs before he can save them. With nothing to live for, he
goes deep undercover in the hopes of rooting out those behind his family’s death.
The game occurs in real time during the worst snow storm in New York’s recent
history. Max unleashes his fury-laden brand of justice on an entire drug distribution
network, starting at the bottom and ending literally at the top of the empire.
The game embraces graphic-novel motifs to illustrate Max’s monologues and
dialogues throughout the game with impressionistic images and stereo sound
effects. Max provides the voiceover to his own life while annihilating everyone in
his path. The game is divided into “chapters” at the beginning of which Max pro-
vides the details about what he is about to do and the level of self-loathing and
vengeance he is feeling. His words are melodramatic and heavy with metaphor, but
it works, and works well.
Max’s health indicator is a “pain meter”—a chalk outline graphic that fills with
red when enemies harm him. When the meter fills up to its head, Max begins limp-
ing around until the level drops to the shoulders. When the meter is red from head
to toe, Max dies and the player has to restart from the last saved position. In order
to heal himself, Max chomps on painkillers that he takes from medicine cabinets
and from his enemies’ remains.
Since the game is a retelling of Max’s life, the player does not make any deci-
sions about the direction the story takes. The only influence the player has is how
long the story takes to unfold and how many people die in the process.
The quality writing holds the game together, and Max Payne was also lauded for
showing how The Matrix’s “bullet time” effect can work in video games. Max has
the ability to slow down time so that he can dodge bullets more easily, aim more

hero who combines stealth with fighting prowess. The game was a landmark due
to the extensive (some would say too-extensive) use of breathtaking cut-scenes
using the game engine itself, directed by Hideo Kojima and rivaling the cinematog-
raphy in an action movie. The game was also noteworthy for a sound-track
develped by a Hollywood sound designer, which adjusted to shifts in game play.

to first-person for easier targeting. Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid, and Sons of Lib-

GAME SUMMARY:
Mortal Kombat brought video motion capture and gratuitous gore to the arcades and
consoles. The game pits the player against a series of fighters in a tournament-style
competition. Each character has a standard set of punches and kicks and a set of
special and unique moves that influence the character’s fighting style. For instance,
Johnny Cage’s special moves tend to be effective only at close range, while Scor-
pion’s tend to work well at a distance, and Sonya’s rarely work well at all. The spe-
cial moves are activated by pressing the attack and directional buttons in a certain
order for each character, which gives an edge to the experienced player.
At the end of each match, the player has an opportunity to execute his opponent
with a “fatality” move. After pressing the buttons in an order specific to that charac-
ter, the player kills the opponent via moves like super uppercuts, electric shocks,
and deadly kisses. Players can also forgo the tournament mode and its tenuous
story line to play head-to-head with a human opponent.
When the characters get punched or kicked, they scream and, in the noncensored
version, they spurt blood. Mortal Kombat’s popularity in the arcades and on the Sega
systems made Nintendo reconsider its ban on realistic violence. Nintendo released the
game as a heavily censored fighter, changed all of the fatalities to be more “family
friendly,” and replaced the blood with a white liquid that was interpreted as sweat.
Nintendo’s version did not sell nearly as well as Sega’s, which kept the blood
and gore. The game’s graphic violence was cited as the cause for formation of the

GENRE:

PLATFORM:
PlayStation 2,Xbox,Nintendo GameCube,PC
RELEASED:
2003
GAME SUMMARY:
NBA Live 2004 continues a tradition of NBA basketball games from developer Elec-
tronic Arts. This popular series focuses on realistic team basketball in which you
play as one NBA team against another. Teams are composed of the real-life 2004
season NBA rosters. For example, you could be playing as the 2004 Sacramento
Kings against the Los Angeles Lakers, complete with realistic statistics for every
player. Other modes of play include one-on-one practice and dynasty, in which you
build up a team franchise.
During the game, the currently activated player is indicated by a blue circle at his
feet. The player can execute offensive or defensive moves or can switch to control
another player on his or her team. Players on your team who you are not control-
ling act as one might expect on the court, positioning themselves to cover an oppo-
nent or to accept a pass.
The game, and its predecessors in the series, have focused on a realistic NBA
basketball experience, from the player’s probability of making that three-point shot
and the realistic arena representations down to the accuracy of players’ tattoos and
brands of sneakers. Commentary is provided by well-known Marv Albert and Mike
Fratatello, and hip-hop music supplies an upbeat backdrop for the game. Anima-
tions in NBA Live 2004 are successful, thanks to 10-man motion capture during pro-
duction, and famous athlete faces also seem realistic.

GAME SUMMARY:
This game confused those who first viewed it at games trade shows—some spec-
ulated that it was designed to teach players how to operate the buttons on the
PlayStation controller. The rest is history: PaRappa launched the rhythm-game
genre—games in which the player must hit buttons in time to music. The
player’s button-mashing in PaRappa causes the player-character to rap, and he
must rap well enough to make it through the game’s simple story. PaRappa was
also noteworthy for its original art style—characters rendered in 3D but resem-
bling flexible cardboard cutouts that the player could see the edges of as they
moved onscreen. The game was designed by Masaya Matsuura, now a legend for
his innovations in the rhythm-game genre. ©1997 Sony Computer Entertainment

GAME SUMMARY:
Originally released in 1995, with sequels released in 1998 and 2003, Dogz and Catz
were the world’s first virtual pets, on the scene before Tamagotchi and Nintendogs.
These artificially intelligent, emotional, 3-D characters, rendered in a cartoony style,
come in a wide variety of breeds and personalities including grumpy bulldogs,
finicky siamese cats, lovable mutts, snooty poodles, crazy alley cats, and so on. The

APPENDIX
animation and behavior of the Petz are very fluid and dynamic, allowing players to
directly touch, pet, and pick up the characters using a mouse hand-cursor, causing
the Petz to react in very immediate and lifelike ways. Players adopt them as puppiez
and kittenz at an adoption center, and they grow up over the course of several
weeks to full adult size. Although they never die, if neglected or abused, they can
run away. Players feed and nurture their Petz, play with a variety of toys in or out-
side a house, and dress them up in a wide selection of clothin. Through positive
and negative reinforcement (treats and a water squirt-bottle), as well as voice recog-
nition, Petz can be trained to do tricks and to modify their their behavior in general.
Petz can mate and  produce offspring, inheriting the characteristics of their parents.
Over 2 million copies of Petz have been sold worldwide; other products include
Oddballz (1997) and Babyz (1999). ©Ubisoft Entertainment. Ubisoft is registered

APPENDIX
314
GAME SUMMARY:
Created by design heavyweight Shigeru Miyamoto of Mario Brothers fame, Pikmin
provides a cute and fun game experience that has become synonymous with Nin-
tendo releases. In this strategy and problem-solving game, the player instructs small
lemming-like creatures to engage in certain tasks to achieve the goals of the main
character, Captain Olimar. This space cadet has crashed on an unknown planet that
is inhabited by tiny creatures resembling carrots, which he has named “Pikmin.”
Captain Olimar uses the creatures to find parts to fix his broken ship, which allows
him to further explore uncharted territory.
Certain numbers of Pikmin are required for a given task. For example, a mechani-
cal part may require 20 Pikmin to carry it back to the ship. In addition, different Pik-
min have different skill sets. Some Pikmin can carry bombs, some survive in water,
and others are fire-resistant. A smart player delegates the Pikmin efficiently to get the
tasks accomplished before the end of the day. At dusk, all remaining Pikmin must
beam up into the space ship for a safe night’s sleep. Pikmin left on the ground
overnight will die. Pikmin are also killed by various other creatures in the world or
by natural elements such as fire and water. Pikmin provides a lush environment
steeped in nature, with colorful, entertaining characters and ambient sound. Image

Listed as Infocom’s first “Comedy Adventure,” Planetfall is a classic text adventure.
The player navigates through interstellar challenges using text commands which
must be supplemented (for most players) by a large sheet of paper upon which you
try to reconstruct the terrain of the game. Planetfall was written by Steve Meretsky
and includes the famous NPC Floyd—a robot who becomes the player’s sidekick.
Many players still remember the powerful feelings they had when Floyd sacrificed
himself during play—early evidence of the possiblity for strong player feelings
toward NPCs. Planetfull ©Activision, Inc. Image reprinted with permission.

RELEASED:

AWARDS:
PC Gamers Ranked 43rd“Best Games of All Time,”1999;“Game of the
Decade,”Generation 4/Canal, 1997
GAME SUMMARY:
The Prince of Persia has 60 minutes to break out of the kingdom’s dungeon in
order to save the Princess Jazmin from marrying the evil vizier, Jaffar. The Prince
runs, jumps, climbs, and fights his way through the dungeon’s levels by avoiding
traps and using a variety of helpful potions to gain strength and replenish
his health.
Prince of Persia uses the natural-looking character animations that Jordan Mech-
ner pioneered in Karateka. The Prince really looks like he strains to hold on to the
ledges and is slow to recover when he takes damage from a fall. He leans forward
when running and throws out his arms when leaping across chasms. Even in the
black and white version, the Prince comes across as a sympathetic character that
the player is compelled to take care of to ensure he rescues the princess. He cries
out in pain when he is injured, screams as he plummets to his death, and groans
when he runs into a wall.
Along the way to the princess, the Prince encounters an interesting helper,
increasingly challenging enemy guards, and more and more difficult jumps and

APPENDIX
317
traps. At regular intervals, cut-scenes of the princess are shown to reinforce the
Prince’s mission, and the ever-running clock appears at the beginning of each level
to remind the player of the time pressure. The game’s difficulty comes more from the
time limit than from the obstacle courses and enemies. Image courtesy of Nintendo.

Interactive Achievement Awards:Outstanding Achievement in Game
Design; 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards:Outstanding
Achievement in Game Play Engineering; 3rd Annual Interactive
Achievement Awards:Game of the Year
GAME SUMMARY:
The Sims™is the social simulation game from the creators of the SimCity™series,
the city simulator. The goals of the game are largely determined by its player; one
player may choose to strive for optimal wealth and power for his or her character,
while another may seek to maintain a balance of social, work, and personal lives.
The player is in control of how the game characters, called “Sims,” lead their lives.

The player begins by selecting a ready-made Sim, or by customizing one or more
Sims by adjusting gender, age, physical build, face, hairstyle, clothes, and personal-
ity traits such as playfulness and neatness. Next, the Sim or Sim family is moved
into an existing house in the game’s neighborhood, or the player constructs and
decorates a house for the Sims. Objects are purchased and placed in the house for
the Sims to use, such as a sofa, toilet, bed, and kitchen appliances. Basic game play
involves controlling the Sims’ lives in a household and directing them towards vari-
ous actions with objects or characters while monitoring the Sims’ life meters. These
meters measure hunger, social, bladder, energy, fun, hygiene, room, and comfort
needs. Keeping these values in the green keeps the Sim happy.
The life meters are intertwined with other systems within the game, each affect-
ing others. These include social relations with family members and neighbors, job
performance, ability to improve skills, and, ultimately, money. For example, if a Sim
has not eaten, the “hunger” meter becomes increasingly red, causing his overall
mood score to go down; he will not want to socialize with other Sims, and he may
refuse to go to work. As a result, job performance will suffer, as will the family’s
cash flow. If the goal is to amass wealth and material possessions, influence people
and win friends, the Sim will eventually have to eat.
The Sims is the best selling PC game ever, keeping fans playing with numerous
expansion packs such as The Sims Hot Date and The Sims Vacation. About half of
the players of these games are women, a small breakthrough for this relatively
untapped market.

RELEASED:

GAME SUMMARY:
Space Invaders was a wildly popular early arcade game that helped to launch the
home-gaming revolution of the 1980s. Initially released in Japan, the game was
brought to the United States by Midway, and some estimate that 300,000 machines
were produced. The player shoots at aliens as they descend from the top of the
screen, using the base at the bottom of the screen as a defense. The steady thump-
ing sound of the aliens as their rows inexorably march downward effectively
produced a relentless and ominous feeling, despite the simple graphics of the
time period. Space Invaders ©Taito Corporation 1987. All rights reserved.

APPENDIX

DEVELOPER:

GENRE:

PLATFORM:
PlayStation 2,Xbox,Nintendo GameCube
RELEASED:
2003
GAME SUMMARY:
SSX™ 3 is the third in a series of snowboarding games developed by Electronic Arts.
The game brings back familiar characters from the previous two games in addition
to some new faces. Each character has his or her own repertoire of special tricks
and “Übertricks” (i.e., “super” tricks). Successfully pulling off ubertricks unlocks
additional moves and more power. Accessories such as outfits and board styles for
the character can be purchased within the game as well. The characters’ ratings in
areas such as speed, acceleration, and tricks improve as you play.
The third game introduces the concept of “you against the mountain,” with all
game play taking place on three different peaks of the same mountain. As the charac-
ter progresses in races on the lower peaks, she or he advances up while the mountain
conditions continue to deteriorate. This provides more obstacles, such as racing ava-
lanches or jumping off of chunks of snowing falling out from under the snowboarder.
Each peak has a lot to explore, such as shortcuts, alternative paths, and the back
country. In addition to the mountain as competition, other snowboarders provide
challenges. You have the option to attack other characters during races, by punching
to either side of the player-character’s body. Verbal responses are entertaining, as are
the other characters’ increasing attempts to knock you down if you are riding “dirty.”

Visuals in this game are well done, offering beautiful vistas and realistic environ-
ments and movement. The lifelike snow stands out in particular as a testament to
the game’s amazing graphics. The snow has different textures and consistencies,
which affect the characters’ ride and can be detected visually by the player. Rounded
off with a great soundtrack full of famous artists, the game offers an adrenaline-filled
snowboarding experience.

PLATFORM:
Xbox,Windows
RELEASED:
2003
AWARDS:
PC Gamer 2003:Game of the Year; Computer Gaming World 2003:Game
of the Year
GAME SUMMARY:
Taking place 4,000 years before the Star Wars movies, Knights of the Old Republic
chronicles the fall or redemption of a great Jedi. The story begins with the player-
character waking up in the midst of a space battle and ends with the character
defeating Malak, a dark Jedi in control of a powerful fleet capable of destroying the
Republic. How the story unfolds from the beginning to the end is up to the player.
As an RPG, the player chooses the character’s name, face, gender, stats, and

APPENDIX
powers. The player then adjusts the character’s alignment through interactions with
the game’s NPCs. At a basic level, all interactions can be seen as good, neutral, or
evil. Good choices lead to Lightside points being awarded, and evil decisions lead to
Darkside points. A character’s goodness or evilness manifests itself in the charac-
ter’s face. A good character has a healthy tone in its face, while an evil character is
so pale, you can see its veins through the skin. At the end of the game, the player
must choose whether the character is good or evil, and the final outcome is
revealed accordingly.
Like Planescape, KotOR uses a party system where the companion NPCs have
skills and abilities that complement those of the main character. The player can
select two NPCs to tag along on the adventure, and the other NPCs remain on the
ship or at the hideout in case the player wants to switch them out later.
The game blends several genres of both video games and cinema. KotOR has
three minigames to break up the action and provide a respite from lengthy dia-
logues: a card game, a space combat game, and a racing game. The latter two
games are important in order to advance the main story line, while the card game is
a way to earn money but is not essential. The game tells tales of redemption, love
and loss, epic battles, unsolved mysteries, and trust and betrayal. At one point, the
main character is asked to solve a CSI-type of murder mystery. Later, the main char-
acter must deal with party members that have lied to it.
The companion NPCs occasionally steal the initiative from the player and engage
in conversations with each other or minor character NPCs. The game also prompts
the player to ask the companion NPCs about their backgrounds and histories by
noting something along the lines of “Carth looks like he has something on his
mind. Would you like to talk to him?”
The planets of KotOR are so rich and detailed that the game provides area maps
and automatically labels important landmarks when they are encountered. It also
gives important NPCs proper names and gives scenery NPCs labels like “Man,”
“Droid,” and “Guard.” Knights of the Old Republic ©2003 Lucasfilm Entertainment

GENRE:

PLATFORM:

RELEASED:
2002
GAME SUMMARY:
Second in a series that started with a GameCube launch title, Super Monkey Ball 2
provides an arcade-like party-game experience. Players can select a single-player
game, throughout which a story unfolds as levels are completed. Reminiscent of
Marble Madness, each level consists of various obstacles for a monkey to negotiate
while running inside a ball to get to the goal within the specified time. Levels usually
hang high in the sky, threatening a long drop if the monkey falls off the edge. Instead
of providing a strictly action-based game, this game goes a bit further to require the
player to think strategically within each maze in order to complete it. For example, a
player must have the monkey roll over a series of switches in order to raise platforms
necessary to reach the goal. Also provided are several multiplayer party games, such
as races, boxing matches, bowling, billiards, and golf. The easy mechanics of these
games allow them to be quickly accessible to games of varying abilities.
The game is popular for its lively arcade feel, its humorous monkey reactions to
failure and success, and its party-game options. Graphics are well rendered, illus-
trating themed levels, such as the inside of a volcano, outer space, and a jungle.
Animations of monkey interactions and activities are also entertaining. The music
and arcade-like annotations provide a heart-thumping complement to the fast pace

lent graphics and music that adds to its macabre, gothic theme. Players can play in
ten different arenas, in multiplayer competitive or cooperative modes, or through a
three-part, single-player game.

cle equipped for shooting at opponents. The player also has to avoid oncoming
attacks by other characters in their own vehicles. Each level consists of a race to
defeat all of the opponents for the particular level. The player has two lives for each
level but can increase health by finding objects throughout the environment.
Weapons and weapon power-ups can also be found throughout the levels, bringing
an element of exploration to this battle game. Twisted Metal: Black is a registered

GAME SUMMARY:
Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is a sequel to a real-time strategy game classic. Play con-
sists of gathering resources, taking over neighboring lands, and protecting your land
from attacks. Players choose from one of the four available factions within the
game. Each faction consists of certain types of characters (elves, orcs, trolls, mino-
taur, etc.) with differing abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. For example, the
humans have the most advanced technology, while the orcs provide brute strength.
A player acts as a commander within the game, instructing units to attack or
defend. Players may also lead hero characters, whose abilities progress throughout
the game, providing a valuable game resource.
Warcraft III was highly anticipated before its release, with two successful prior
versions, as well as the popular Starcraft game. Fans of the game continue to play
Reign of Chaos, as well as its expansion pack, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne,
years after their release. Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos provided courtesy of Blizzard
