Introduction
Welcome to Adobe InDesign CS6 On Demand, a visual quick
reference book that shows you how to work efficiently with
InDesign.  This book provides complete coverage of basic to
advanced InDesign skills.
How This Book Works
You don’t have to read this book in any particular order.
We’ve designed the book so that you can jump in, get the
information you need, and jump out. However, the book does
follow a logical progression from simple tasks to more com-
plex ones. Each task is presented on no more than two facing
pages, which lets you focus on a single task without having
to turn the page. To find the information that you need, just
look up the task in the table of contents or index, and turn to
the page listed. Read the task introduction, follow the step-
by-step instructions in the left column along with screen illus-
trations in the right column, and you’re done.
What’s New
If you’re searching for what’s new in InDesign CS6, just look
for the icon: New!. For InDesign CS5.5, look for the icon:
New5.5. The new icon appears in the table of contents and
throughout this book so you can quickly and easily identify a
new or improved feature in InDesign. A complete description
of each new feature appears in the New Features guide in the
back of this book.
Keyboard Shortcuts
Most menu commands have a keyboard equivalent, such as
Ctrl+P (Win) or A+P (Mac), as a quicker alternative to using
the mouse. A complete list of keyboard shortcuts is available
on the web at www.perspection.com.

Step-by-Step
Instructions
This book provides concise step-
by-step instructions that show you
“how” to accomplish a task. Each
set of instructions includes illus-
trations that directly correspond to
the easy-to-read steps. Also
included in the text are time-
savers, tables, and sidebars to
help you work more efficiently or
to teach you more in-depth infor-
mation. A “Did You Know?” pro-
vides tips and techniques to help
you work smarter, while a “See
Also” leads you to other parts of
the book containing related infor-
mation about the task. 
Real World Examples
This book uses real world exam-
ple files to give you a context in
which to use the task. By using
the example files, you won’t waste
time looking for or creating sam-
ple files. You get a start file and a
result file, so you can compare
your work. Not every topic needs
an example file, such as changing
options, so we provide a complete
list of the example files used
throughout the book. The example
files that you need for project
tasks along with a complete file
list are available on the web at
www.perspection.com.
Real world
examples help
you apply what
you’ve learned
to other tasks.
Illustrations

numbered
steps.
Numbered
steps guide
you through
each task.
Did You Know? alerts
you to tips, techniques
and related information.
See Also points you to
related information in
the book.
Easy-to-follow
introductions
focus on a
single concept.

The Workshops
walk you through
in-depth projects
to help you put
InDesign to work.
Introduction
xix
Workshops
This book shows you how to put
together the individual step-by-
step tasks into in-depth projects
with the Workshops. You start each
project with a sample file, work
through the steps, and then com-
pare your results with a project
results file at the end. The Work-
shop projects and associated files
are available on the web at
www.perspection.com.
Adobe Certified Expert
This book prepares you fully for
the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE)
exam for Adobe InDesign CS6.
Each Adobe Certified Expert certifi-
cation level has a set of objec-
tives, which are organized into
broader skill sets. To prepare for
the certification exam, you should
review and perform each task
identified with an ACE objective to
confirm that you can meet the
requirements for the exam. Infor-
mation about the ACE program is
available in the back of this book.
The Adobe Certified Expert objec-
tives and the specific pages that
cover them are available on the
web at www.perspection.com.

Getting Started with 
InDesign CS6
Introduction
Adobe InDesign CS6 is a desktop publishing and page layout
program that runs seamlessly on both Windows and
Macintosh platforms. Adobe InDesign CS6 is a stand-alone
program, but it’s also part of Adobe's Creative Suite of pro-
fessional programs that work together to help you create
designs in print, on the web, or on mobile devices. Many of
the Creative Suite 6 programs also include additional Adobe
programs and services—Bridge, Camera Raw plug-in,
Extension Manager, and ExtendScript Toolkit—to help you
manage and work with files.
With InDesign, you can create books, brochures, catalogs,
manuals, CD-DVD labels, certificates, newsletters, flyers,
forms, label sheets, and even interactive presentations. As a
page layout program, you can create a one page flyer, a 500
or more page book, or something in between. InDesign pro-
vides all the tools you need to create a page layout design,
import or enter text, insert images, add drawings, create
tables, and finalize the document. When you’re done, you can
print the document to a local desktop or commercial printer,

The process of installing the InDesign application is fairly straightfor-
ward; you insert the InDesign CS6 or Adobe Collection CS6 install disc
into your DVD drive or download the software online to your computer,
double-click the setup program and simply follow the on-screen instruc-
tions. The first thing that will happen is that the installer will check to
see if you have the minimum system requirements. If you meet the mini-
mums, the installer will guide you through the steps to complete the
installation. The whole process takes about ten minutes, and at the end
of the process you can launch InDesign for the first time. Remember to
have your serial number handy, because you will have to type it in dur-
ing the installation process. It's a good idea to have that serial number in
a safe place, just in case you would need to reinstall InDesign.

You can start InDesign in several ways, depending on the platform you
are using. When you start InDesign, the software displays a Welcome
screen and then the InDesign window. When you start a new InDesign
session or close all documents, a Welcome screen appears in the
InDesign window, providing easy access links to open a file, open a
recent file, create a new file, and create a new file from a template. You
can also use links to access help information, such as Getting Started,
New Features, and online Community resources, such as the InDesign
Exchange web site, where you can download additional applications
and information.

Viewing the InDesign Window
When you start InDesign, the program win-
dow displays several windows of varying
types you can use to work with documents. In
InDesign, windows appear in the workspace
in panels. A panel is a window you can col-
lapse, expand, and group with other panels,
known as a panel group, to improve accessi-
bility and workflow. A panel group consists of
either individual panels stacked one on top of
the other or related panels organized together
with tabs to navigate from one panel to
another. 
The Tools panel contains a set of tools you
can use to create shapes, such as lines, rec-
tangles, and ellipses. You can fill and stroke
shapes and text with different colors and
stroke widths. When you select a tool, addi-
tional options appear on the Control panel.
A menu is a list of commands that you use
to accomplish specific tasks. A command is a
directive that accesses a feature of a program.
InDesign has its own set of menus. The
Application bar provides easy access to com-
monly used features, such as choosing zoom
levels, view options, screen mode, document
arrangement, workspaces, and InDesign’s
community online Help.
The Document window displays open
InDesign documents. InDesign includes tabs
to make it easier to switch back and forth
between documents and a close button to
quickly close a document.

Panels give you easy access to many task-specific commands and
operations from color control to vector path information. By default, the
main panel display is located along the right side of your window. You
can use the Window menu or click a panel tab within a group to display
it, and then select options on the panel or choose panel-specific 
commands from the Panel Options menu to perform actions. Instead of
continually moving, resizing, or opening and closing windows, you can
use the header bar with the panel tabs to collapse or expand individual
panels within a window to save space.

Click the Window menu.  
Point to a submenu (if needed),
such as Color, Editorial,

can also dock (add) or undock (subtract) specific panels within a group
to customize your workspace. A panel appears with a header, which
includes the tab titles and three options: the Collapse To Icons or
Expand Panels button, the Close button, and an Options menu. The
Options menu provides you with panel commands. The entire set of
panels includes a double arrow at the top you can use to collapse and

Chapter 1
InDesign has an abundance of tools that give
an InDesign designer tremendous control
over any creative designing problems that
may crop up. For example, the InDesign tool-
box contains a variety of different tools: selec-
tion tools (you can never have enough
selection tools), drawing or shape tools, type
tools, and other tools dedicated to creating
documents, transforming objects, and work-
ing with pages. Add viewing tools and you
have everything you need to do any job. 
When you work on a document, it's impor-
tant to know what tools are available, and
how they can help in achieving your design
goals. InDesign likes to save space, so it con-
solidates similar tools under one button. To
access multiple tools, click and hold on any
Tools panel button that contains a small black
triangle, located in the lower right corner of
the tool button. Take a moment to explore the
InDesign toolbox and get to know the tools.
The InDesign Tools panel contains the
tools needed to work through any InDesign
job, but it's not necessary to click on a tool to
access it. Simply using a letter of the alphabet
can access all of InDesign's tools. For exam-
ple, pressing the P key switches to the Pen
tool, and pressing the T key switches to the
Type tool. If you’re not sure what letter to
press, you can use the Tools Hints panel,
which lists all the hidden modifier keys avail-
able for the currently selected tool. Click the
Window menu, point to Utilities, and then
click Tool Hints. If you prefer a complete list of
letter assignments for all the tools, you can
refer to Adobe InDesign CS6 Keyboard
Shortcuts (available for download on the web
at www.perspection.com). You can temporar-

ily switch from the current tool to any other
tool by holding down the appropriate letter
key. As you hold down the key, your current
tool changes to the new tool, and when you
release it, you return to the previous tool. To
really get efficient in InDesign, you need to
learn to use both hands. Use one hand for
your mouse or drawing tablet, and the other
on the keyboard to make quick changes of
tools and options. Think of using InDesign like
playing a piano—you need to use both hands. 
Using the Control Panel
The Control panel displays the options for
the currently selected tool. For most tools,
your options include X and Y Location, W and
H dimensions, Scale X and Y, Rotation and
Shear Angle, Rotate and Flip, Fill and Stroke
Color, Stroke Weight and Style, Apply Effect,
Opacity, Drop Shadow, Quick Apply, and the
Options menu.  The important thing to
remember is that the Control panel is cus-
tomized based on the tool you have selected,
so options will vary.

InDesign lets you open document files created in different formats, such
as InDesign (INDD), InDesign CS3 Interchange (INX), InDesign Markup
(IDML), PageMaker (6.0-7.0), and QuarkXPress (3.3-4.1x). If you want to
simply open an InDesign document, the Welcome Screen or Open dialog
box are the most efficient ways. However, if you need to manage, organ-
ize, or process files, Adobe Bridge is the way to go. You open an existing
InDesign document file the same way you open documents in other pro-
grams. In Windows Explorer (Win) or Finder (Mac), you can double-click
an InDesign document to open the InDesign program and the document.
When you open a document, a tab appears across the top of the
Document window, with the document title. When you open an InDesign
CS5 or CS5.5 document, the document tab includes “[Converted],”
which you can save to update it to InDesign CS6 (New!). You can click
the tab at any time to display that particular document.

Chapter 1
As time passes, InDesign—like any other program—will change. There
are two types of changes to a program: updates and patches. Updates
are improvements to a program such as a new feature, option, or com-
mand. Patches are software fixes for problems discovered after the
public release of the program. The good news is that both updates and
patches are free, and once downloaded, are self-installing. Adobe
gives you two ways to check for changes. You can check manually by
going to the Adobe web site, or automatically through the Adobe
Application Manager. The Adobe Application Manager Preferences
dialog box allows you to set update options for InDesign and other
installed Adobe products, such as Bridge. You can also set an option to
have Adobe notify you of updates in the menu bar.
Checking for Updates
Online
Check for Updates Directly from
the Internet
Open your Internet browser.
Go to the following web address:
www.adobe.com/downloads/
updates/
Click the list arrow, and then click
InDesign - Macintosh or InDesign

Click Go.
Any updates or patches appear in
a list.
Based on your operating system,
follow the onscreen instructions to
download and install the software.
IMPORTANT Checking on your
own requires a computer with a
connection to the Internet. Since
some of the updates can be rather
large, it’s recommended you have
high-speed access.

When you finish working on your InDesign document, you need to save
it before you close the document or exit InDesign. You can save an
InDesign CS6 document in the programs default file format (INDD) or as
a template in the default template format (INDT). A template is a special
document that makes it easier to create a new document. You might
want to change the type if you’re creating a custom template or sharing
files with someone who doesn’t have the Adobe InDesign program.
When you open an InDesign CS5 or CS5.5 document (New5.5), the
document tab includes “[Converted].” A converted document in
InDesign CS6 acts like an untitled document, which you need to save to
update it. You cannot save the CS5 or CS5.5 document in the CS5 or
CS5.5 document format (INDD). However, you can save it to IDML
(InDesign Markup Language), which you can open in InDesign CS4 or
later (make sure software is updated) (New!).

Understanding the IDML File Format
IDML (InDesign Markup Language) files provide an interchangable
format for Adobe InDesign documents, as well as a way for third-
party tools to modify and assemble InDesign documents. An IDML
file is actually a compressed package using Zip compression. It
contains a collection of XML files in a hierarchy of folders. The
entire set of files represent a complete InDesign document. If you
have a document in the InDesign CS6 Document file format (INDD),
and you want to open it in InDesign CS4, CS5, or CS5.5, you can
save it in the IDML file format from InDesign CS6, and then open it
from the InDesign software version you want. It’s important to make
sure the InDesign software is up-to-date before you open the IDML
file; click the Help menu, and then click Updates.

After you work on a document, you can finish up by closing the docu-
ment or by exiting InDesign. You should save the document before clos-
ing it. Exiting InDesign closes the current document and the InDesign
program and returns you to the desktop. You can use the Exit command
on the File menu (Win) or Quit InDesign command on the InDesign
menu (Mac) to close a document and exit InDesign, or you can use the
Close button on the InDesign Document tab. If you try to close a docu-
ment without saving your final changes, a dialog box opens, asking if
you want to do so.

Creating and Viewing a
Document
Introduction
You can either open an existing document or create a new
one to work on in InDesign. When you create a new docu-
ment, you can create one from scratch or use one of the
built-in types, such as document, book or library. The built-in
document presets make it easy to create documents for spe-
cific purposes without the hassle of specifying individual set-
tings. However, if you know the individual settings you want,
you can create a new document from scratch. 
InDesign uses two main Screen Modes: Normal and
Preview. Normal mode displays the area inside document
pages, guides, pasteboard, bleed, and slug areas, while
Preview mode simply displays the area inside document
pages. There are two additional Screen Modes: Bleed and
Slug. The bleed is an area outside the trim of the page where
objects still print, while slug is an area outside the page trim
that may or may not print. If you want to view pages as a
slide show, you can use Presentation mode, which hides the
Application bar and all panels.
Having problems squinting at the small details of a docu-
ment? Using the Zoom tool is a great way to get you focused
where you need to be. Zooming into a specific section of a
document makes touching up the fine details just that much
easier. 
InDesign's navigation and measurement systems—rulers,
grid, guides, smart guides—are more than just information;
they represent control of the document and control of the
creative process. In addition, the Info panel gives you up-to-
date information on the exact position of the cursor inside
the document, as well as detailed color space and profile
information that can be indispensable in preparing your
designs.

Creating a new InDesign document requires more thought than creating
a new word processing document. For example, there are the intended
output type, either print, web, or digital publishing (New!) for tablets,
number of pages, start page number, page size (preset or custom),
columns, and margins considerations to keep in mind. The page size
option include US business card and compact disc for print, monitor
sizes for web (interactive documents) and tablet and mobile device
types (New!) for digital publishing and allows you to create and name
multiple custom page sizes within a single document. You can also set
advanced options for the bleed and slug. The bleed is an area outside
the trim of the page where objects still print, while slug is an area out-
side the page trim that may or may not print. The slug is typically used to
add non-printing information to a document. As you specify new docu-
ment settings, you can save your settings as a preset for future use.

A template is a special document that makes it easier to create a new
document. If you frequently use an existing document, such as Books
or Brochures, to start a new document, then you should create a tem-
plate, which uses the InDesign Template (INDT) file format. You can
create your own template or use one already done. When you create a
new document from a template, the document appears with the tem-
plate extension (INDT), which you can then save as a normal InDesign
document with the INDD extension. You can use the Open dialog box
from within InDesign to select a template or use Adobe Bridge to
access and select a template for use back in InDesign.

If you frequently use custom settings to create an InDesign document,
you can save time by creating a preset. You can create a preset when
you create a new document in the New Document dialog box or you
can create and manage presets in the Document Presets dialog box.
After you create a preset, you can export and share it with others,
which they can import with the Load button in the Document Presets
dialog box. When you no longer need a preset, you can delete it.
However, you can’t delete the [Default] preset.

create and name multiple custom page sizes within a single document,
which is useful keeping different sized designs, such as a business
card and letter head, in the same document. In the Margins and
Columns dialog box, you can specify margin, column, and gutter set-

InDesign uses two main modes: Normal and Preview. Normal mode dis-
plays document pages, guides, pasteboard, bleed, and slug areas,
while Preview mode displays the area inside the page boundaries.
There are two additional modes: Bleed and Slug. The bleed is an area
outside the trim of the page where objects still print, while slug is an
area outside the page trim that may or may not print. Bleed mode dis-
plays the bleed area and document pages, while Slug mode displays
the slug area and document pages. If you want to view pages as a slide
show, you can use Presentation mode, which hides the Application bar
and all panels. You can use keystrokes and mouse clicks to move for-
ward or backwards through the document one spread at a time. In
addition to the display modes, you can also preview aspects of your
output, such as overprinting, color proofs and separations, and flat-
tened artwork.

Working with the Zoom tool gives you one more way to control exactly
what you see in InDesign. The Zoom tool does not change the active
image, but allows you to view the image at different magnifications.
The Zoom tool is located towards the bottom of InDesign's Tools panel,
and resembles a magnifying glass. The maximum magnification of an
InDesign document is 4000%, and the minimum size is 5.0%. Large doc-
uments are difficult to work with and difficult to view. Many large docu-
ments, when viewed at 100%, are larger than the maximum size of the
document window, requiring you to reduce the zoom in order to view
the entire image. In addition to the Zoom tool, you can also select view
options to fit the page or spread to the window, show the actual size, or
show the entire pasteboard.

Chapter 2
Carpenters know that precise measurements are essential to making
things fit, so they have a rule:  Measure Twice, Cut Once. The designers
of InDesign also know that measurements are essential and give you
several measuring systems—among them are the rulers. Rulers are
located on the top and left sides of the active document window, and
serve several purposes. Rulers start numbering at the top left corner of
the page. You can move this point, known as the zero point, to another
position. Rulers let you measure the width and height of the active
image, they let you place guides on the screen to control placement of
other image elements, and they create markers that follow your cursor
as you move. As you can see, rulers are critical in the design of a docu-
ment by helping you correctly align image design elements. The default
measurement is in picas, which you can change in Preferences. You
can also change the origin, which allows you to use rulers across
spreads and spines.

Rulers

magazine.
◆Page. Displays rulers for one
page at a time.
◆Spine. Displays rulers for the

are bound together.
Click the Horizontal and Vertical
list arrows, and then select a
measurement from the available
options.
◆If you selected Custom, enter

A guide is a nonprinting vertical or horizontal line that helps you align
text and graphic objects. You can quickly show and hide guides, lock
them in place, and align objects to them. With the Snap to Guides com-
mand, you can align an object to a guide. When the object’s edge
comes within a specified distance in pixels of a guide, it snaps to the
guide point. When you no longer need one or all of the guides, you can
quickly select and remove them.

InDesign uses several different types of guides to show different areas
of a document. Ruler guides are user-defined guides for moving and
aligning objects. Margin guides show the current margins in the docu-
ment. Column guides show current column settings for a page or mas-
ter page. Bleed and Slug guides show the bleed and slug areas in a
document. You can use Guides & Pasteboard preferences to set guide
settings, such as color and display options, and pasteboard settings,
such as color in Preview view and size above and below the document.
You can also specify a snap to distance to align an object to a guide.

InDesign gives you the ability to use Smart Guides to help align shapes
and objects as you draw or drag to move, rotate, or resize. They appear
automatically as you draw or move an element, and then disappear
after the element is drawn or moved. They enable you to visually align
one object to another with a minimum of effort. Smart Guides also dis-
play alignment and measurement information, known as Smart
Dimensions, such as distances between objects, angles of rotation, and
whether an object matches the size of nearby objects, to make drawing
and alignment even easier. You can also use Smart Spacing to evenly
space multiple elements by snapping objects into position. Smart
Guides are automatically turned on by default. You can use Guides &

A grid is a checkerboard display that you can use to help you align text
and graphic objects. There are two types of grids: Document and
Baseline. The document grid displays a checkerboard pattern, which is
helpful for aligning objects, while the baseline grid displays horizontal
lines, which is helpful for aligning text. The grid appears behind your
text and artwork, so it doesn’t get in the way. With the Snap to
Document Grid command, you can align an object to a gridline. When
the object’s edge comes within a specified number of pixels of a grid-
line, it snaps to the gridline point. You can use Grids preferences to set
grid settings, such as color and spacing.

One of those little used, but handy, tools is InDesign's Hand tool. The
Hand tool (so named because it resembles an open hand) lets you
quickly move the active image within the document window without
ever using the scroll bars. For example, you've zoomed the image
beyond the size that fits within the document window and you need to
change the visible portion of the document. It's a simple operation, but
a handy one to know.

measuring, or transformation tools, the Info panel gives you up-to-date
information on the size of the object you're creating. When an object is
selected, the Info panel display the x and y position, width (w) and
height (h). If you select multiple objects, only information that is the
same for all selected objects appears in the Info panel. When you’re

Managing Pages and Books
Introduction
Most documents are more than one page, so inserting new
pages is a common practice in InDesign. You can quickly add
a new blank page to a document using the Pages panel. The
Pages panel allows you to visually display and navigate
through all the pages in your document. When you work with
multiple page documents, moving pages around is
inevitable. You can simply drag pages in the Pages panel to
rearrange them within a document or use the Move Page
command on the Options menu to move them between doc-
uments. When you no longer need a page, you can quickly
delete it from your document using the Pages panel. 
A master page is one of the most important parts of creat-
ing an InDesign document. A master page holds and displays
all the elements that you want to appear on every page in a
document, such as headers, logos, page numbers, and foot-
ers. The master is like a background layer to a page.
Everything on the background layer appears on the page in
front of it. When you make a change to a master page, the
change appears in all document pages unless you override
the change.
Instead of creating long documents, you can break them
up into smaller documents, like chapters, and then add them
to a book. In InDesign, a book is not a single document. It
simply keeps track of all the documents in the book and coor-
dinates document page numbers, colors, and styles. When
you create a book, you can synchronize page numbers, col-
ors, and styles for all the documents in the book. Each book
uses a file called the style source to control the style sheets,
swatches, and master pages for all the documents in the
book. When you make changes to the style source file, all the
documents in the book are synchronized to the file.

The Pages panel allows you to visually display all the pages in your doc-
ument. The Pages panel shows thumbnails for each page. At the top of
the panel are the master pages for the document. A master page con-
tains elements that are repeated on every page. When you’re working
with a multi-page document with or without multi-layouts, the Pages
panel is an essential part of working with pages. You can add and
remove pages as well as navigate to and from pages. The Pages panel,
like all panels, provides an Options menu where you can select page-
related commands and Pages panel view and display options. The view
options (New!) allow you to view page icons horizontally, vertically, or
by alternate layouts (for different size mobile devices). The display
options allow you to change page icons size, position, and location. In
addition, you can also set options to show or hide icons for page trans-
parency, transition, and spread rotation.

Most documents will be more than one page, so inserting new pages is
a common practice in InDesign. You can quickly add a new blank page
to a document using the Pages panel. You have several different meth-
ods to complete the task. You can use the New Page button on the
page, drag a master page to the document area in the Pages panel, or
use the Insert Pages command on the Options menu. If you’re inserting
only one or two pages, the first two methods work the best. If you want
to insert multiple pages, the Insert Pages command is your best option,
where you can use the Insert Pages dialog box to set additional
options.
Did You Know?
You can duplicate a page. Select the
Pages panel, select the pages or
spreads you want to duplicate, and
then drag the selected pages to the
Create New Page button on the panel
or use the Duplicate Spread command
on the Options menu.

After you insert new pages into a document, you can use the Pages
panel, Layout menu commands, and Status bar to navigate between
them. As you work with pages in the Pages panel, there are two types
of page selections. One targets a page and the other activates a page.
A targeted page is a page selected in the Pages panel, while an acti-
vated page is a working page in the document window. When you 
target a page, you can apply a command in the Pages panel even
though it may not be the current working page in the document
window.

you want InDesign to adjust objects on the resized page (New!) with
the Liquid Page Rule. You can have different pages within a single doc-
ument, which is useful keeping different sized designs, such as a busi-
ness card and letterhead, in the same document.

Most documents are either one or two page spreads. A single-page
spread displays pages one at a time (top to bottom), while a two-page
spread displays pages as facing pages (left and right). If you want to
create a larger spread for a magazine foldout or a brochure, you can
add more pages to a one or two page spread. These multiple-page
spreads are also called island spreads. When you no longer want a
larger spread, you can remove pages from the spread.

Everything on the background layer appears on the page above it.
Master elements appear on document pages surrounded by a dotted
border to make them easy to identify. When you create a new docu-
ment, you also create a master page. If you want to create additional
master pages, you can create them from scratch or from an existing

When you apply a master page to a document page, all the elements on
the master page are attached and displayed on the document page. A
master page can also contain a single (only one) primary text frame
(New!), which you can use to flow or type your text on all document
pages. When you only want a selected number of elements from the
master page on a document page, you can override or detach the ele-
ments you want. Overriding a master puts a copy of the master element
on the document page and keeps the link, where you can make
changes to it. The changes made on the document page don’t affect
the master; however, any changes to the same element on the master
(separate from the document page) still appear from the master on the
document page. Detaching a master overrides a master element and
removes the link. Instead of overriding or detaching master elements,
you have the option of hiding them.

One of the most common elements added to a master page is a page
number. InDesign uses a special character to designate page numbers.
On a master page, simply create a text box, place the insertion point in
the box, and then insert the current page number marker. You can also
insert and format additional text and variables in the text box to create
a header or footer across the top or bottom of the page. You can also
use the Numbering & Section Options dialog box to change the format
of page numbers or the starting page number. If you want to insert text
before the page number, you can specify a section prefix. In addition to
page numbers, you can also define a section within a document with
separate numbering. A section indicator icon (black triangle) appears

A text variable is an element that varies based on circumstances in the
document. You can use one of the preset text variables that comes with
InDesign or you can create your own. Some of the preset variables
include Running Header and Chapter Number. These are useful for
adding information to master pages. Other variables, such as Creation
Date, Modification Date, Output Date, and File Name, are useful for
adding file information to the slug area for printing. To use a text vari-
able, simply create a text box, place the insertion point in the box, and
then insert the variable using the Text Variable submenu on the Type
menu. You can also insert and format additional text along with the
Running Header variable in the text box to create a header or footer
across the top or bottom of the page on a document or master page.

Instead of creating long InDesign documents, you can break them up
into smaller documents, like chapters, and then create a book to bring
them all together. A book is not a document. It simply keeps track of all
the documents in the book and coordinates document page numbers,
colors, and styles. When you create a new book or open an existing
book, the Book panel appears, displaying the book name in the title tab.
In the Book panel, you can add, remove, move, or open documents.

A table of contents (TOC) appears at the beginning of a document, typi-
cally a long one, with page numbers associated with the beginning of
main sections of the document. InDesign creates a table of contents
based on the styles applied to paragraphs in the document. The table of
content displays the text and page number associated with the para-
graph styles. For example, when you apply different styles for chapter
and topic titles in this book, you create a table of contents based on
chapters and topics. So, before you can create a table of contents, you
need to apply paragraph styles to text in your document.

An index is a table of entries in alphabetical order that reference top-
ics, names, and other information in a book. The entries usually provide
the page on which a particular word or topic is located in the book. The
index is typically located in the back of a book. In InDesign, you can
create only one index for a document or book. The single index can be
a simple or comprehensive one to the information in a document or
book. To create an index, you create a topic list (optional), create index
entries (assign index markers to topics), generate the index, and then
flow the index into a story. You create, edit, and preview an index in the
Index panel, which displays index information using the Reference and
Topic modes. The Reference mode displays complete index entries,
while the Topic mode displays only topic (no page references and
cross-references—”See” or “ See also”). Instead of typing each topic
when you create an index entry, you can create or import a list of top-
ics to save time and create consistency.

Tips for Creating an Index
When you create an index, it’s important to be well-planned and
consistent. During the planning process you need to think about
what type of index you want to create, either a simple index or a
complex one with cross-references and equivalent terms. You also
need to think about a topic list to ensure coverage of the material
and consistency in the index. Readers look for content in different
ways, so you need to think about how a reader might look up infor-
mation in order to make it easier for them to find what they want.
Some consistency problems can occur when you fluxuate between
the use of uppercase and lowercase letters and plurals and non
plurals. For example, the words Book, book, and books are treated
as separate entries in InDesign, which can cause confusion for
readers. 
For Your Information
Did You Know?
You can create a new entry from an
existing one. Click an insertion point in

Reference option in the Index panel,
and then drag the existing entry to the
New Entry button, make any changes,
and then click Add or OK.
You can import a topic list. In the
Index panel, click the Options menu,

An index entry consists of a topic and a reference. You can create or
import topics ahead of time or provide them when you create an index
entry. A reference is a page number, page range, or cross-reference.
Instead of indexing to a page number or range, you can index to a
cross-reference, which refers to equivalent terms (denoted by “See”)
or another related entry (denoted by “See also”) in the index. You can
add an index entry several different ways in InDesign. You can use the
New Page Reference dialog box, shortcut keys (see previous page for
details), or the Index panel. If you want to index all occurrences of a
word in a document or book, you can use the Add All button in the New
Page Reference dialog box.

Working with Text
Introduction
InDesign comes with two main type tools: Type and Type on a
Path. The Type tool allows you to create a rectangle text
frame where you can store text in your document, while the
Type on a Path tool allows you to add text along the inner or
outer edge of a path. 
Before you can work with text in InDesign, you need to
select it. You can select the entire text frame or the characters
in the text frame. You can use the type tools to select only the
characters in the text frame, not the text frame itself, or use
the Selection and Direct Selection tools to select both charac-
ters and the text frame. If you type, paste, or import more
text than a text frame can hold, an overflow symbol (a tiny
red plus sign in a square) appears on the edge of the text
frame. You can reshape the text frame to accommodate the
extra text or create a thread (link) to another text frame. You
can thread overflow text from one text frame to a new or
existing text frame. 
InDesign provides two panels to modify characters and
paragraphs. With the Character panel, you can change the
font family (for example, Arial or Times New Roman) and
style (Italic, Bold, or Condensed), as well as change other text
attributes, such as size, kerning, scale, tracking, leading, and
language. With the Paragraphs panel, you can change text
alignment, indenting, and before and after spacing. 
When integrating artwork and graphics with your text,
you can wrap the text in a text frame around another object,
such as a graphic. Another type effect, Create Outlines,
allows you to convert characters in a text frame into a sepa-
rate object with a path. 4

InDesign comes with two main type tools: Type and Type on a Path. The
Type tool allows you to create a rectangle text frame where you can
store text in your document, while the Type on a Path tool allows you to
add text along the inner or outer edge of a path. In addition to the type
tools, you can also use the Frame tools—Rectangle, Ellipse, and
Polygon—to add text to your document. The default font is now the
cross-platform Open Type version of Minion Pro Regular instead of
Times (Mac) and Times New Roman (Win).

With the Type tool, you can create a rectangle text box any size that
you want. Simply, select the Type tool on the Tools pane, drag to create
a text frame and then start typing. When you type text in a text frame, it
automatically wraps to the size of the frame. If you type more text than
the frame can hold, an overflow symbol (a tiny red plus sign in a
square) appears on the edge of the rectangle box. You can reshape the
text frame object to display the text or create a thread (link) to another
text frame.

Filling a Text Frame with Placeholder Text
If you don’t have any text at the moment to enter into a text frame,
you can have InDesign insert placeholder text (New!). Create an
empty text frame, and then select it. Right-click (Win) or Control-
click (Mac) the text frame, and then click Fill with Placeholder Text.
On the Mac, if you want to specify a language, such as Cyrillic,
Roman, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese,
hold down A when you select the Fill with Placeholder Text 
command.  
For Your Information

In addition to the Type tool, you can also use the Frame tools—
Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon—to add text to your document. Instead
of a rectangle shape for type, you can create irregular shapes to store
text in your document. In addition to creating a polygon shape, you can
also use the Polygon Frame tool to create a star shape for type. You
can drag to create a frame box to the size that you want. If you need a
frame box to be an exact size, you can click a blank area with the
Rectangle and Ellipse tools or set width and height settings on the
Control panel.

If you have text from another document that you want to use in your
InDesign document, you can use the Place command to import it. You
can import text from the following text formats: plain text (TXT), Rich
Text Format (RTF), Microsoft Word (DOC or DOCX), or Microsoft Excel
(XLS or XLSX). When you import text using the Place command on the
File menu, InDesign allows you to place the text in a new text frame or
an existing one.

When you import text into your document, InDesign imports the text
into a loaded text cursor with a small text icon and the first part of the
text. When the text is loaded, you have several options to place the text
into your document. You can create a new text frame or add the text to
an existing text frame in a document or master page. When the loaded
text cursor displays straight lines, the text will be placed in a new text
frame. When the loaded text cursor displays curved lines, the text will
be placed in an existing text frame. After you import the text, you can
reflow the text manually with the overflow symbol (a tiny red plus sign
in a square), or automatically with keyboard options.

If you type, paste, or import more text than a text frame can hold, an
overflow symbol (a tiny red plus sign in a square) appears on the edge
of the text frame. You can reshape the text frame to display the text or
create a thread (link) to another text frame. You can thread overflow
text from one text frame to a new or existing text frame. After you cre-
ate a thread between two or more text frames, you can use the Show
Text Threads command on the Extras submenu (on View menu) to dis-
play the thread connection. If you no longer want to thread two or more
text frames, you can unthread or disconnect them. When you unthread
text frames, the text in the text frame remains in the first text frame (it
may still overflow). When you disconnect text frames, the text in the
text frames remains where it is.

Like most programs, you can copy and move text by using the Copy or
Cut and Paste commands or drag-and-drop techniques. InDesign is no
different. There are a couple of differences. When you paste text, you
can paste it without formatting. Another difference is that InDesign
allows you to inherit formatting from the destination text when you drag
and drop text. You can use the Type preferences dialog box to enable
drag and drop editing in Layout view and Story Editor.

A font is a collection of alphanumeric characters that share the same
typeface, or design, and have similar characteristics. With the
Character panel, you can change the font family (Arial or Times New
Roman) and style (Italic, Bold, or Condensed), as well as change other
type attributes, such as size, kerning, scale, tracking, leading, and lan-
guage. You can also change these and other attributes by using the
Type menu and Control panel. After you select the text that you want to
change, you can change font attributes directly on the Control panel.
For example, you can style text using All Caps, Small Caps, Underline,
Strikethrough, Subscript and Superscript. As you can see, there are
several ways to change font attributes. You can use any one of them.

After setting the font family and style, the next attribute to set is the
font size. The font size can range from 6 points to 72 points and beyond
depending on the font. Open or TrueType fonts can be scaled to any
size and still look and print well. Bitmap (screen fonts) fonts, on the
other hand, cannot be scaled and you need to use the available sizes to
print well. However, bitmap fonts are the best choice for commercial
print jobs. An “O” appears next to an OpenType font, a “TT” appears
next to a TrueType font, and an “a” appears next to a bitmap font on the
Font submenu.

What is a point? The size of each font
character is measured in points (a point
is approximately 1/72 of an inch). You
can use any font that is installed on

Leading is the distance from the baseline of one line to the baseline of
the next line and is measured in points. Each line of text can have a dif-
ferent leading size. You can specify a specific setting or use Auto,
which is a percentage of the largest text size on each line. Leading is
applied to horizontal text. If you want to change vertical spacing in text,
you need to adjust horizontal tracking.

Kerning is adding or removing space between pairs of characters in
your text. Sometimes the space between two characters is larger than
others, which makes the word look uneven. You can use the Character
panel to change the kerning setting for selected characters. You can
expand or condense character spacing to create a special effect for a
title, or realign the position of characters to the bottom edge of the
text—this is helpful for positioning copyright or trademark symbols.

Tracking is the adjustment of space between three or more characters.
Typically, you’ll track a line of text or a few words depending on the
length and design application. This is useful for creating specialize text
for a caption or short heading. To adjust space between two charac-
ters, kerning is the best choice. To track characters, you need to select
them first and then set the Tracking option in the Character panel.

Quickly indent lines of text to precise locations from the left or right
margin with the horizontal ruler. Indent the first or last line of a para-
graph (called a first-line or last-line indent) as books do to distinguish
paragraphs. Indent the second and subsequent lines of a paragraph
from the left margin (called a hanging indent) to create a properly for-
matted bibliography. Indent the entire paragraph any amount from the
left and right margins (called left indents and right indents) to separate
quoted passages. In addition to indenting paragraphs, you can also set
the spacing you want before or after a paragraph.

Using Single-line or Paragraph Composer
As you type or edit a paragraph, InDesign adjusts word spacing,
hyphenation, and line breaks a paragraph at a time with Adobe
Paragraph Composer or a single-line at a time with Adobe Single-
line Composer. This explains why you may notice text reflowing
above the line you are editing. For headings and other short text
boxes, Adobe Single-line Composer looks better, while for long text
boxes, Adobe Paragraph Composer (default setting) looks better. For
international uses, Adobe includes options for World-Ready (New!)
Single-line or Paragraph Composer. To set a composer option,
select the Paragraph panel, click the Options menu, and then click

A glyph is a style variation—such as ligatures, ordinals, swashes, and
fractions—for a given character in an OpenType font. OpenType fonts
appear with an “O” next to the font name on the Font submenu.
OpenType fonts are designed to work well on both Windows and
Macintosh operating systems, which reduces font substitution prob-
lems when going back and forth between platforms. However, you can
always add more character styles to extend the font format. For exam-
ple, you can change fractions with numerals and slashes to properly
formatted fractions. You can automatically insert alternate glyphs with
the OpenType panel or insert them manually with the Glyphs panel to
extend the font format.

The Create Outlines command converts characters in a text frame into
a separate object with a path. Some characters, such as “A” or “B,”
that contain an interior shape (known as a counter) are converted into
compound objects. After you create an outline, you can reshape the
path, use it as a mask object, fill it with a gradient or a mesh, or use it in
a compound object. When you create outlines, the fill and stroke attrib-
utes and any appearances of the type are applied to the outlines.
Before you use the Create Outlines command, it’s a good idea to make
a copy of the text frame or your document as a backup to preserve a
copy of the original text frame.

Placing and Working with
Graphics
Introduction
You can use InDesign's Place command to insert artwork into
an open document. InDesign lets you place graphic files
saved in Illustrator AI, Photoshop PSD, JPEG, EPS,  TIFF, PICT
(Mac), and PDF (Portable Document Format) formats, to
name a few. You can even place another InDesign INDD file
into a document. With the Place command, you can place
multiple graphics of different types at the same time. If you
need more control over the import and placement of graph-
ics in your document, you can display and use an import dia-
log box for the type of graphic that you want to place. 
When you place graphics, InDesign loads them into a
graphic preview cursor, which you can use to place them into
a new or existing frame. When you place a graphic, InDesign
creates a link to the original file. You can display and work
with linked graphics in the Links panel. 
Before you can work with the graphic in a frame, you
need to select it first. You have several options depending on
what you want to accomplish. You can select the frame and
graphic, just the frame, or just the graphic. When you place a
graphic into a frame, it doesn’t always fit the way you want.
You can automatically resize the graphic to fill the entire
frame or proportionally fill the frame. In some cases you
want to place a graphic on top of an existing graphic. This is
called a nesting graphic. For example, you can place a
graphic in a rectangle frame, and then place another graphic
in a circle frame inside the rectangle frame. 
When you place multiple graphics in a document, the dis-
play performance of your screen can slow down. You can
change display resolution settings for the entire document or
for individual graphics to improve performance. 5

You can use InDesign's Place command to insert artwork into an open
document. InDesign lets you place graphic files saved in Illustrator AI,
Photoshop PSD, BMP, JPEG, EPS, PNG, TIFF, GIF, WMF, PICT (Mac),
SCT, DCS, and PDF formats, to name a few. You can even place another
InDesign INDD file into a document. You can place multiple graphics of
different types at the same time. When you place graphics, InDesign
loads them into a graphic preview cursor, which you can use to place
them into a new or existing frame. When you draw a new frame, the
frame constrains to the proportions of the graphic unless you hold
down Shift. The scale is displayed as part of the loaded cursor.

If you need more control over the import and placement of graphics in
your document, you can display and use an import dialog box for the
type of graphic that you want to place. For example, when you import
Illustrator artwork, you can specify import options to select individual
artboards, layers, and a transparent background. When you import
most images, such as TIFF and JPEG, you can specify import options to
apply a clipping path along with an Alpha Channel and specify a color
profile. For a Photoshop image, you can also select layers.

When you import graphics saved from Photoshop, Illustrator, or other
compatible graphics programs, you can specify import options to use
the same transparency as the original file, set the visibility of layers,
and use clipping paths, which allows you to use only part of a graphic
(the rest is transparent). If you save a Photoshop file with an Alpha
Channel (white or shades of gray) as a PSD, TIFF or JPEG, or with a
clipping path as a PSD, TIFF or EPS, you can import the graphic into
your document and retain the Alpha Channel transparency or clipping
path. For Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and PDF files, you can spec-
ify which layers in the file you want to import into your document.

A caption is a description that appears below a graphic. Within
InDesign, you can create static or live caption. A static caption remains
the same unless you manually modify it, while a live caption can
change if the graphic is updated or the metadata changes. A caption is
placed in a text frame. You can create a caption from an existing
graphic or while placing a graphic. When you create a caption,
InDesign creates the text—either static text or variable text—based on
the current caption settings. A live caption displays a string of variable
text. If you move a live caption text frame to another graphic, the cap-
tion display changes.

Instead of using the Place command, you can also copy and paste or
drag-and-drop graphics from other programs directly into frames in
your document. When you copy and paste graphics, InDesign converts
the image to a compatible format during the transfer and embeds the
graphic in your document at full resolution. Embedding inserts a copy
from one document into another. An embedded graphic doesn’t appear
in the Links panel. When you drag-and-drop a graphic, InDesign 
creates a link just like when using the Place command.

When you place a graphic, InDesign creates a link to the original file.
Linking displays information stored in one document (the source file) in
another (the destination file). You can edit the linked object from either
file, although changes are stored in the source file. If you break the link
between a linked object and its source file, the object becomes embed-
ded. Embedding inserts a copy from one document into another. You
can display and work with linked graphics in the Links panel. The Links
panel allows you to relink a missing graphic, display a linked graphic,
update a linked graphic, or edit a linked graphic in another program.
Special icons appear next to linked graphics indicating a missing or
modified link. You can also sort items and display information about a
linked graphic, such as name, color space (mode), dimension (resolu-
tion), scale, format, and the path to the source in the Links panel.

After you link or embed a graphic image file into an InDesign document,
you can use the Links panel in InDesign to manage and work with the
files. The Links panel displays a list of all the linked or embedded (con-
tained within the document) files in your document. You can use the
Links panel to update, replace, or relink a graphic image file. If a linked
file is moved from its original location, you need to repair the link the
next time you open the document. If a linked file needs to be updated, a
warning icon appears in the Links panel to let you know. If you place the
same graphic in multiple locations, the link collapses into a single row in
the Links panel, which you can expand using the triangle.

When you place a graphic into an InDesign document, the graphic file
includes information and data about itself. This data is saved with the
file as metadata in the XMP format (Extensible Metadata Platform), and
can be recognized and accessed by InDesign or any other application,
such as Adobe Bridge, that reads and edits XMP metadata. For exam-
ple, if an image is a photograph, the metadata includes the type 
of image, where the image was shot, the camera used, shutter speed,
f-stop, and other information, such as author and copyright. You can do
the same with video and audio data, too.

Instead of using the standard rectangle, ellipse, or polygon frames to
place graphics, you can create and use specialty frames. A specialty
frame is a vector-based compound path. You can create a compound
path from one or more standard frames or text in InDesign, or you can
import one from another vector-based program, such as Adobe
Illustrator, that uses the AICB (Adobe Illustrator Clipboard). When you
combine multiple frames into one compound path, the placed graphic
appears across all the frames. You can create unique specialty frames
from text characters. The Create Outlines command converts charac-
ters in a text frame into a compound path. If you no longer want to use
a compound path, you can use the Release Compound Path command
to split the compound path up into individual frames.
Creating Specialty
Frames for Graphics
Create and Release a Compound
Path as a Frame

Selection tool on the Tools panel.

A compound path displays
diagonal lines across the entire set
of frames instead of individual
frames.
To release a compound path,
select the compound path, click
the Object menu, point to Paths,
and then click Release Compound
Path.
If there is a graphic in the
compound path, it will only appear
in the first frame after you release
the compound path. The other
frames will be empty.

Before you can work with the graphic in a frame, you need to select it
first. There are two bounding boxes around the graphic. One for the
frame (blue) and another for the graphic (brown). You have several
options depending on what you want to accomplish. You can select the
frame and graphic, just the frame, or just the graphic. If you want to
resize the frame as well as the graphic inside, you can select them both
or use the Auto-Fit option. With the Auto-Fit option enabled, when you
resize the frame, the graphic inside automatically resizes too. If you
want to keep the frame the current size and resize the graphic, you
need to just select the graphic and not the frame. The Selection and
Direct Selection tools allow you to select the parts you want. To reposi-
tion the graphic and not the frame, you can use the Selection tool and
content grabber (which replaces the Position tool).

In some cases you may want to place a graphic on top of an existing
graphic. This is called a nesting graphic. For example, you can place a
graphic in a rectangle frame, and then place another graphic in a circle
frame inside the rectangle frame. You can also nest a text frame in a
graphic frame. Frames can hold multiple levels of nested frames. After
you nest graphics in a frame, you can use commands from the Select
submenu on the Object menu to select the main container frame or
nested frames.

Alternative text, or alt text, is a brief text-based description of a graphic
used to provide information to screen-readers or assistive devices, or to
users when the graphic is not rendered. You can set alt text for a
selected graphic by using the Object Export Options dialog box
(New5.5). You can enter alt text manually, use text specified in the
document structure (elements marked with XML tags), or use text from
metadata in the XMP format (Extensible Metadata Platform) applied to
the graphic. You can view and change XMP data in applications like
Adobe Bridge. When you import content from Microsoft, InDesign also
imports alt text applied to graphics. In InDesign, you can view XMP data
for a graphic in the Links panel; see “Displaying XMP Graphic

Working with Objects

Introduction
A frame is a container that holds graphics, text, and shapes.
There are three types of frames: unassigned, graphic, and
text. The unassigned frame is useful for adding fill and stroke
color to a layout. You use the Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, and
Line tools to create unassigned frames, while you use the
Rectangle Frame, Ellipse Frame and Polygon Frame tools to
create a graphic frame. A dot appears in the middle of an
unassigned frame, while diagonal lines appear in a graphic
frame. You can create shapes using unassigned or graphic
shapes. You use the Type tool to create a text frame, which
appears with small ports to thread text between frames. 
With the transformation tools in InDesign, you can quickly
move, scale (resize), shear (distort), and rotate an object.
InDesign provides several ways to transform objects: tools
(Rotate, Scale, and Shear) on the Tools panel, options on the
Transform and Control panels, and commands on the
Transform submenu on the Object menu. 
Layers give you the ability to separate individual elements
of your design, and then control how those elements appear.
You can think of Layers as a group of transparent sheets
stacked on top of each other, where each layer contains a
separate aspect of the total design. Having multiple layers
allows you to adjust and move each element independently.

A frame is a container that holds graphics, text, and shapes. There are
three types of frames: unassigned, graphic, and text. The unassigned
frame is useful for adding fill and stroke color to a layout. You use the
Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon tools to create unassigned frames,
while you use the Rectangle Frame, Ellipse Frame and Polygon Frame
tools to create a graphic frame. A dot appears in the middle of an unas-
signed frame, while diagonal lines appear in a graphic frame.  You can
create shapes using unassigned or graphic shapes. In addition to cre-
ating a polygon shape, you can also use the Polygon Frame tool to cre-
ate a star shape for type. You can drag to create a frame box to the size
you want using the tool tip which displays width and height. If you need
a frame box to be an exact size, you can click a blank area with the
Rectangle and Ellipse tools or set width and height settings on the
Control panel.

The Line tool draws perfectly straight lines in any direction you drag
your mouse. In InDesign, a line is called a stroke and there is a variety
of thicknesses, styles, colors, and fills that can be applied to it using the
Control, Stroke, and Color panels. You can also create your own line
style for specific types of dashed, dotted or artistic lines. You can draw
lines at precise 45- or 90-degree angles by holding down the Shift key
as you drag.

Instead of creating one shape at a time, you can create a grid of
equally spaced frames or objects by using one or two shortcut keys
while you drag. You can use any of the frame creation tools on the
Tools panel, such as Rectangle, Rectangle Frame, Ellipse, Ellipse Frame,
Polygon, Polygon Frame, Line, and Type, to create a grid. The arrow
keys allow you to specify how many columns and rows of frames or
objects you want to create. If you add the Ctrl (Win) or A (Mac) keys,
you can adjust the spacing between the frames. If multiple column
guides appear on the current spread, InDesign uses the gutter width as
the spacing between frames. In addition to creating a grid of shapes
from scratch, you can also duplicate existing objects into a grid using a
similar technique.

There are several ways to select objects in InDesign. The Selection
tool selects entire objects, while the Direct Selection tool selects a
point on an object or images inside objects. With the Selection tool, you
can select an object's stroke or fill. When you point to an object,
InDesign displays the frame edge (or dashed line for a group) in the
object’s layer color to make it easier to find before you select it, which
is useful in Preview mode or with hidden frame edges. After you select
one or more objects, you can add or subtract objects to/from the selec-
tion. In addition, you can use the Selection tool and drag a marquee to
select parts of the object or drag over a portion of it to create a selec-
tion rectangle. When you work with graphics, you can double-click the
content or graphic frame to select the other (it no longer switches to
the Direct Selection tool) or use the content grabber to position the
content frame (which replaces the Position tool).  If you don’t want the
content grabber to appear, you can hide it.

With the Direct Selection tool, you can select a point on an object or
graphics inside an object. When you point to or select an object with
the Direct Selection tool, path and anchor points appear on the corners
of the frame to make it easier to identify and view. You no longer need to
select an object to select an anchor point. You can hover over the object
to show the anchor points and drag to change the shape of the frame.
With the Direct Selection tool, you can also select a graphic. There are
two bounding boxes around a graphic frame. One for the frame (blue)
and another for the graphic (brown). You can select the frame or
graphic. When you select the frame, anchor points appear. When you
select the graphic, square resizing handles appear on each corner and
midpoint line. When you select a graphic, the Direct Selection tool
works like the Selection tool.

When an object is too big or small for its location, you can resize the
object to fit. When you select one or more objects with the Selection
tool, square resizing handles appears on the corner and midpoint, which
you can drag to change the size of the object. If you’re working with
multiple objects, you no longer have to group objects before you resize,
scale, or rotate them with the Selection tool; a bounding box appears
with resizing handles, which you can use to resize them all together. You
can also use Live Distribute to resize the space between objects propor-
tionally. Resizing an object is different than scaling an object. Resizing
an object changes the width and height, but the scaling remains the
same. Scaling an object changes the width and height by a percentage.
If you need to resize an object to an exact size, you can select the
object, and then enter specific values in the Control panel.

enabled, Smart Guides appear automatically to make it easier for you to
align objects with other objects. With the Smart Cursor enabled, the
cursor displays the current X and Y coordinate values on the page.

Duplicating objects can be a powerful way of creating geometrical art-
work. You can duplicate one or more selected objects by dragging
them, using keys, copying to and pasting from the Clipboard, or using
the Step and Repeat command. While you drag, you can also duplicate
existing objects into a grid using keyboard shortcuts. The Step and
Repeat command duplicates copies of an object and positions them at
specific horizontal and vertical intervals. For example, you can create a
span of objects across the page, or a grid of objects.

Selecting and grouping objects makes it easier to work with multiple
objects as if they were a single object. You can easily select, cut, copy,
paste, move, recolor, and transform a grouped object. You can group all
types of objects, yet still edit individual objects within the group as
needed without having to ungroup them first by using the Direct
Selection tool. You can double-click an object in a group to select it and
then double-click the selected object to reselect the group again. If you
no longer need to group objects, you can ungroup them. You can also
use the Paste In command to combine objects.

Multiple objects on a document appear in a stacking order, like layers
of transparencies. Stacking is the placement of objects one on top of
another. In other words, the first object that you draw is on the bottom
and the last object that you draw is on top. You can change the order of
this stack of objects by using Bring to Front, Send to Back, Bring
Forward, and Send Backward commands on the Arrange submenu
from the Object menu.

With the transformation tools in InDesign, you can quickly move, scale
(resize), shear (distort), and rotate an object. InDesign provides several
ways to transform objects: tools (Rotate, Scale, and Shear) on the Tools
panel, options on the Transform and Control panels, and commands on
the Transform submenu on the Object menu. All transformations are
performed based on a reference point; center is the default, however,
you can change it on the Control or Transform panel. When you per-
form a transformation on an object, InDesign remembers it, which
allows you to repeat the last transformation by using commands on the
Transform Again submenu on the Object menu. If you don’t like a trans-
formation, you can use the Clear Transformation command to remove it.

(slant) an object. However, you cannot copy an object or move the ref-
erence point. As you drag to transform an object, you can use keyboard
keys to alter the results of a transformation. Free Transform makes it
easy to transform an object by using the mouse to visually get the
results that you want. The Free Transform tool works just like the one in
Illustrator and Photoshop. If you need to use exact values for a trans-
formation, you can use the Control or Transform panel.

You can think of Layers as a group of transparent sheets stacked on top
of each other, where each layer can contain a separate aspect of the
total design. Layers give you control over the design elements of your
document. When you open a document, a default layer is already there
for you to work on. Everything you create in the document appears on
the default layer until you create a new one. Each object is given a
generic name, such as <rectangle>, until you change it. Each layer uses
an Expand/Collapse triangle in the Layers panel to show/hide the
objects on it and their stacking order. You can quickly create a new
layer or duplicate an existing one using a button in the Layers panel or
selecting options in a dialog box. When you create a new layer, it’s
given a generic name, such as Layer 1, and a color, which is used to
highlight object frames and paths. When you duplicate a layer, any
objects on the layer are also duplicated. When you no longer need a
layer, you can quickly delete it. Remember that once you've deleted a
layer and saved the document, there is no way to recover the deleted
layer. However, while the document is open, you can use the Undo com-
mand to recover a deleted layer.

When you create a layer, it’s given a generic name, (Layer 1, Layer 2,
etc.) and a distinctive color. The color is used to highlight object frames
and paths. To avoid confusion, it’s a good idea to specify names for lay-
ers in a document. You can quickly rename and set layer options by
double-clicking the layer you want to change. In the Layer Options dia-
log box, you can set options for color, showing and hiding layers, lock-

When you have a lot of objects in the document window, it can be hard
to work with them. In the Layers panel, you can hide layers and objects
to reduce the clutter and make it easier to work with the layers and
objects that you want. Each layer uses an Expand/Collapse triangle  in
the Layers panel to show/hide the objects on it and their stacking order.
When you click the visibility (first) column, an eye icon appears indicat-
ing the layer is visible. To hide a layer or object, you simply click the eye
icon to remove visibility. When objects are hidden, they are not printed
or exported, and cannot be selected. When you save, close, and reopen

If you have objects on multiple layers and want to consolidate them
onto one layer, you can merge them together. You can merge two or
more layers. However, you can’t merge an object with another object. If
a layer is locked or hidden, you can still use it in a merge. Before you
use the Merge Layers command, it’s a good idea to make a copy of
your document as a backup to preserve a copy of the separate layers.

a layer, all you need to do is select an object on the layer in the docu-
ment window or select a layer or object in the Layers panel. Each layer
in the Layers panel uses an Expand/Collapse triangle to show/hide the
objects on it and their stacking order. The color of an object’s frame
indicates the layer on which it is located. Blue is the default color of
the first layer when you create a new document. This makes it easy to
identify objects and layers. When you select an object, a square object
icon appears in the Layers panel. A quick way to move an object from
one layer to another is to drag the object name or square object icon
from one layer to another in the Layers panel.

Applying and Managing
Color
Introduction
Color management is an important part of working with
InDesign. Setting up document and graphic image color set-
tings in the right way will make it easier for a printer to pro-
duce the results that you want. 
InDesign does its best to manage color for you. However,
sometimes there are color conflicts or you have specific color
requirements that you want to use. If a document’s profile
doesn’t match the current working color space or is not
assigned a color profile, you can use the Assign Profile dialog
box to change or remove a profile to avoid conflicts. A work-
ing space is a temporary color space used to define and edit
color in Adobe programs. Each color mode has a working
space profile. InDesign's color modes are Lab, RGB (Red,
Green, and Blue), and CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and
Black). Color modes not only define the working color space
of the active document, they also represent the color space of
the output document. You can use the Color Settings dialog
box to select a working space profile. 
InDesign not only lets you select virtually any colors you
desire in the Color panel, it also lets you store those colors
for future use in the Swatches panel. You can also create
swatches with color tints, gradients, and mixed inks. If you’re
not sure what colors to use, you can use the swatch libraries
from color systems, such as Trumatch and Pantone, to select
colors with predictable results. 
After you create the colors and swatches you want, you
can apply them to objects in your documents. The Tools panel
provides color boxes to make it easy for you to apply fill and
stroke colors and the Eyedropper tool on the Tools panel
makes it easy to quickly pick up a color from one area of your
artwork and apply it to another area. 7

InDesign does its best to manage color for you. However, sometimes
there are color conflicts or you have specific color requirements that
you want to use. When you create or open a document, InDesign cre-
ates or looks for a color profile, which specifies color usage in the doc-
ument. The Color Settings dialog box allows you to specify color
settings and select options to deal with conflicts. The two main color
settings are Working Space and Color Management Policies. Working
Space controls how RGB and CMYK colors are used in a document that
doesn’t have an embedded profile, while Color Management Policies
controls how InDesign works with color when opening files that don’t
have a color profile or one that doesn’t match your current color set-
tings from the RGB and CMYK menus. If you need to convert colors
between color spaces, use Advanced mode.

missing an assigned color profile, you can use the Assign Profiles dia-
log box to change or remove a profile to avoid conflicts. You can also
specify rendering intent (object display or print) for the transition from
one color space to another. When you change a color profile, color in
your document may shift to match the new color profile.

Chapter 7
Color modes define the colors represented in
the active document. Although you can
change the color mode of a document, it is
best to select the correct color mode at the
start of the project. InDesign's color modes
are Lab, RGB (Red, Green, and Blue), and
CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black).
Color modes not only define the working
color space of the active document, they also
represent the color space of the output docu-
ment. It's the document output (print, press,
or monitor) that ultimately determines the
correct document color mode. Color modes
do not just determine what colors the eye
sees; they represent how the colors are
mixed, and that's very important because dif-
ferent output devices use different color
mixes. 
Lab Mode
The Lab color mode is an old color measuring
system. Created in France, its purpose was to
measure color based on visual perception.
Since personal computers had not been cre-
ated at that time, the Lab mode is not based
on a particular computer or operating system,
and so Lab color is device independent. The
Lab mode measures color using a lightness
channel, an "a" channel (red to green), and a
"b" channel (blue to yellow). Lab color works
well for moving images between operating
systems (Mac to Win), and for printing color
images to PostScript Level 2 or 3 devices.
Because of its ability to separate the gray
tones of an image into an individual channel
(lightness), the Lab color mode is excellent for
sharpening, or increasing the contrast of an
image without changing its colors. 
RGB Mode
The RGB color mode is probably the most
widely used of all the color modes. RGB gen-
erates color using three 8-bit channels: 1 red,
1 green, and 1 blue. Since each channel is
capable of generating 256 steps of color,
mathematically, that translates into 16,777,216
possible colors per image pixel. The RGB
color mode (sometimes referred to as
Additive RGB) is the color space of computer
monitors, televisions, and any electronic dis-
play. This also includes PDAs (Personal Digital
Assistants), and cellular phones. RGB is con-
sidered a device-dependent color mode.
Device independent means that the colors in
images created in the RGB color mode will
appear differently on various devices. In the
world of computer monitors and the web,
what you see is very seldom what someone
else sees; however, understanding how
InDesign manages color information goes a
long way to gaining consistency over color.
CMYK Mode
The CMYK color mode is the color mode of
paper and press. Printing presses (sometimes
referred to as 4-color presses) convert an
image's colors into percentages of CMYK
(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black), which
eventually become the color plates on the
press. One at a time, the plates apply color to
a sheet of paper, and when all 4 colors have
been applied, the paper contains an image
similar to the CMYK image created in
InDesign. The CMYK color mode can take an
image from a computer monitor to a printed
document. Before converting an image into
the CMYK mode, however, it's important to
understand that you will lose some color sat-
uration during the conversion. The colors that
will not print are defined as being out of
gamut. Out of gamut means that the current
RGB or Lab color doesn’t have a CMYK
equivalent, which means you can’t use it on a
commercial project unless you select a sub-
stitute color close to a CMYK equivalent.

The Eyedropper tool on the Tools panel makes it easy to quickly pick up
a color from one area of your artwork and apply it to another area.
When you click an object with the Eyedropper tool, it picks up the
object’s color and stroke attributes and displays them in the Tools,
Color, and Stroke panels. You can pick up attributes from any type of
object, even a graphic image, and the object doesn’t even need to be
selected. If an object is selected, the color and stroke attributes are
applied to the selected object. The Eyedropper tool also provides
options for you to customize the attributes—such as Stroke, Fill,
Character, Paragraph, and Object—that you want to pick up with 
the tool.

In addition to adding and editing swatches, you can also move, delete,
duplicate, merge, save, load, rename, and name unnamed color
swatches in the Swatches panel. Unnamed colors are colors that are
applied to objects using the Color panel or Color Picker, while named
colors are applied from the Swatches panel. If you no longer use a
color or you want to change the use of a color, you can use the Delete
Swatches button on the Swatches panel. If a color is not in use,
InDesign simply deletes it. If the color is in use, InDesign gives you an
opportunity to delete the color and use another one or specify the color
as unnamed. The default swatches for None, Paper, Black, and
Registration cannot be edited or deleted.

Instead of creating your own color swatches, you can use the swatch
libraries from color systems, such as Trumatch and Pantone. Trumatch
and Pantone are common color libraries in North America for prepress
and desktop color printing. These color systems are universally used by
printers, so you can produce consistent results. Other color libraries
include ANPA (commonly used for newspapers), DIC (commonly used
in Japan), Focoltone (commonly used in France and Great Britain), HKS
(commonly used in Europe), System (Macintosh), System (Windows),
Toyo (commonly used in Japan), and Web. Web is a common color
library of 216 web-safe colors for use on the web by both the
Macintosh and Windows operating systems.

A tint is a shade of a base color. The base color is a 100% tint. You can
adjust the tint of a color by lowering the percentage from 1% to 99%.
You can create a new tint swatch by using a dialog box or the Tint
option at the top of the Swatches panel. I like the dialog box method
better. After you create a new tint color swatch, it appears in the
Swatches panel list with the new tint percentage in the name. If you
need to edit a tint swatch, simply double-click the swatch to open the
Swatch Options dialog box to make the changes you want.

A gradient is a smooth transition between two or more colors in an
object. You can create and save a gradient of your own by using the
Swatches panel. You can create a gradient with two or more colors.
There are two types of gradients: Radial (circular) and Linear (horizon-
tal). You can adjust the number and blend of gradient colors by adding
or changing color stops. After you create a gradient, you can apply it to
objects just like any other swatch in the Swatches panel. In addition to
the Swatches panel, you can also create a gradient by using the
Gradient panel. The gradient is unnamed and not saved unless you

Mixed inks combine a spot color with other spot colors or process 
colors to give you more color options for your custom designs. Mixed
inks can be useful when you want a darker shade of a color to make it
stand out in your design or to create a new spot color from two other
existing spot colors. You can even use a mixed ink group to create a
collection of mixed inks. This is useful when you want to create a
series of color mixes.

Overprinting allows you to set the color of one object to mix with any
colors underneath. For example, when you have a red object overlap-
ping a blue object, the red object knocks out the overlapped area
underneath in the blue object. When you set the red object to overprint,
the red object mixes with the blue object underneath to create another
color. You can individually set fill, stroke, and gap colors to overprint.
After you set overprint options for an object, you can preview your
results by using Overprint Preview.

Applying Fills, Strokes, 
and Effects
Introduction
After you draw an object, you can apply fills, strokes, gradi-
ents, and other effects to enhance your documents. The Tools
panel provides color boxes to make it easy for you to apply
fill and stroke colors to objects. The Stroke panel provides
additional options to quickly change stroke attributes, such as
weight (width), position on the path, and stroke style. In addi-
tion to the typical stroke styles found in the Stroke panel, you
can create and use custom stroke styles with stripes, dashes,
and dots. For example, you can create a custom dashed
stroke where you can specify the length of the dashes and
gaps. 
A gradient is a smooth transition between two or more
colors in an object. You can apply a gradient from the
Swatches or Gradient panel. The Gradient and Gradient
Feather tools on the Tools panel allows you to change how a
gradient appear for an object. You can specify how gradient
colors blend, the angle of a linear gradient, and the location
of the center for a radial gradient with a drag of the mouse
over the gradient fill. 
If you want to create a cool effect, you can apply blending
modes, transparency, and other effects—shadow, glow, bevel
and emboss, satin, and feather—to objects. A blend mode
allows you to apply colors and shades to one object and
have the effect interact with the objects underneath. InDesign
comes with a variety of blend modes, including Overlay, Soft
Light, Hard Light, Darken, Lighten, and Color. Transparency
allows you to create see-through objects. Other special
effects allow you to be creative without even knowing how to
draw. 
If you always create an object with a certain fill or stroke
attribute, you can make those settings the default. InDesign
has its own default fill and stroke settings of a black stroke
and no fill. These are separate from any defaults that you
may set.

The Stroke panel makes it easy to change stroke attributes, such as
weight (width), position on the path, and stroke style. The weight of a
stroke represents the thickness of the line. A weight smaller than .25
may not print and a weight of 0 completely removes the stroke. In addi-
tion to the width of a stroke, you can also specify the position (known
as alignment) of the stroke on the path (either center, inside, or outside)
as well as specify the stroke cap, end join, and miter limit. You can
apply these options to any object, even a text object. Style is what
stands out on the page. You can change the stroke style by applying
dashes and endpoints, such as arrows, circles, and squares.

Blend mode allows you to apply colors and shades to one object and
have the effect interact with the objects underneath. InDesign comes
with a variety of blend modes, including Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light,
Darken, Lighten, and Color. Experiment with them to find out what
works best for you. When you work with groups of objects, you can set
options to apply blending modes and opacity settings with the objects
in the group or not. The Knockout Group option doesn’t apply settings
to object groups, but it does to objects not in the group, while the
Isolate Blending option does apply settings to object groups. You can
set options in the Effects panel or Effects dialog box for Transparency.

The Drop Shadow style is probably the most common effect used (next
to Bevel and Emboss). The Inner Shadow style applies a shadow to the
inside of an object. When you apply the Inner Shadow style, the
shadow effect appears on the inside edges—like a reverse drop
shadow. In addition to the distance and angle of the drop shadow, you
can apply a blending mode and transparency. Other options include
Global Light, Choke (inner), Spread (outer), and Noise. The Use Global

The Bevel and Emboss style, second only to Drop Shadow in popularity,
creates a 3D illusion of roundness to a flat surface. You can apply the
Bevel effect to outline text to get the impression of 3D text. If the object
you're applying the Bevel and Emboss has no transparent areas, the
style will be applied to the outer edge of the image, and if you want to
experiment beyond the standard rounded bevel, you can use a Chisel
Hard option that makes text appear as if it's carved out of stone.

A feather effect softens the edges of an object to appear transparent.
InDesign provides three different feather effects: Basic, Directional,
and Gradient. The Basic Feather effect creates a soft edge around the
outside of objects. The Directional Feather effect creates soft edges for
the top, bottom, left, or right sides of objects. The Gradient Feather
effect creates soft edges in a gradient. Instead of making a transition
from one color to another, a gradient feather makes a transition from a
color to a transparent fade. Some common feather options include
Choke (inner) and Noise. The Choke option determines the amount of
transparency used for the inner part of the feather. The Noise option
introduces a random shift to the colors of the feather.

weight to 1 point. Then I don’t have to do it every time I create a new

of no fill and a black stroke. These program defaults are separate from

Working with Points and
Paths
Introduction
When you use InDesign's vector drawing or pen tools,
InDesign creates a path to store that information. Paths are
defined mathematically using anchor points and segments.
Once created, they can be precisely modified to fit any design
situation. 
Working with the various Pen tools, it's possible to create
precise paths, and even create complicated selections around
virtually any shape. Once the path is created, it's a simple
matter to subtract anchor points, and add new or modify
existing anchor points to produce complex paths. It's even
possible to convert straight segments (the visible line that
connects two anchor points together) into elegantly curved
segments, or you can remove the curve from a segment with
a single click. 
Paths can be used to precisely guide a brush stroke, or
the interior of a path can be filled with any color or gradient
available in InDesign using the Color, Stroke and Gradient
panels. Paths can even be used as a clipping mask, which is
an object whose shape masks out everything except the con-
tents behind the shape. 9

When you work with InDesign's Pen tool, you're creating a path. The
path consists of curved and straight segments connected by anchor
points. When you click with the Pen tool, you create corner points and
straight segments. When you drag with the Pen tool, you can create
smooth points and curve segments, which have direction handles 
you can use to change the curved segment. The shape of the curve
segment is defined by the length and direction of the direction handles.
As you create drawings with the Pen tool, you can turn on Smart
Guides to help you align the segments.

It’s hard to draw a segment right the first time. Moving anchor points
and segments is all part of the process of creating artwork. When you
move an anchor point, the segments that are connected to it change.
When you move a straight segment, the anchor points on the segment
move with it. If an anchor point connects two segments, moving the
anchor point changes both segments. When you move a curve seg-
ment, the curve changes, but the connecting anchors remain the same.
You can also change a curve segment by adjusting a direction point on
the direction handle.

segment. If you want the second curve segment to appear on the same
side as the first, you need to convert the anchor point from a smooth
point to a corner point. You can make this conversion as you create the

Creating a path is not necessarily the end of the job; in fact, there are
many ways you can modify a path once it's been created. For example,
you can add, subtract, or delete anchor points on an existing path. You
can also modify those points to conform to any desired shape. In addi-
tion, existing anchor points can be modified to change the segments
connecting the points. Just like anything else in InDesign, paths are
flexible. They can be modified to meet whatever design considerations
are needed to make the job successful.

The Scissors tool on the Tools panel allows you to split an open path
into two paths or open a closed path. If you just want to open a closed
path, you can also use the Open Path button on the Pathfinder panel or
the same command on the Paths submenu. You can split a path at an
anchor point or in the middle of a segment. The Scissors tool creates
two points, one on top of the other. You can use the Direct Selection
tool to move one point away from the other. If a path contains text, you
cannot split it into two segments.

Instead of selecting and deleting individual anchor points to reshape a
path, you can use the Eraser tool on the Tools panel to delete parts of a
path. When you use the Eraser tool to remove parts of a closed path,
InDesign creates an open path. If you remove parts of an open path,
InDesign creates two separate open paths. When you erase inside of a
filled path, InDesign creates a compound path. This is useful when you
want to simplify a complex drawing or remove a background.

A compound path is a single object made up from two or more objects.
In overlapping areas, a compound path removes the overlapping space
displaying the attributes of the backmost object behind it. Think of it like
a cookie cutter. After you create a compound path, you can release
(restore) it at any time. However, the results are not exact. If you want
to add another object to the compound path, you need to arrange the
object in front or back of the compound object, select them both, and
then reuse the Make Compound Path command.

A clipping path, or clipping mask, is a path whose shape masks out
everything except the image contents behind the shape. You can create
one in Adobe Photoshop and then place it into your InDesign document
with the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option in the Import Options
dialog box, or you can have InDesign try to create a clipping path from
the edges of an image. Once you have a clipping path, you can select
and modify it like any other path using the Direct Selection tool and
change options using the Clipping Path dialog box.

Working with Tables
Introduction
There are times when typing a paragraph will not do your
text justice. Creating a bulleted or numbered list might better
show your information. Another way to organize items in a
document is with a table. A table is an object that is inserted
into the document that displays text in rows and columns.
You can set up your table with existing or imported text, or
create a blank table and enter in new text. Once created, you
can adjust the cells (where the text is contained in the rows
and columns). You can also adjust the table to insert or delete
rows, columns or individual cells, or change the alignment of
text or graphics in cells. 
In InDesign, a table is placed in a text frame, which might
be larger or smaller than the table. You can drag the corner of
the text frame to adjust the frame. If the text frame is smaller
than the table, an overflow symbol appears in the bottom
right corner. The overflow symbol works the same for tables
as it does for normal text. When a table overflows, you can
repeat the first (header) and last (footer) rows of a table
when it appears in a different text frame on the same or dif-
ferent page. The information you enter in the header and
footer automatically appears in the repeated headers and
footers. 
When you create a table, InDesign automatically creates
strokes around cells to format it. You can remove or cus-
tomize the strokes or add fills by using the Strokes and Fills
tab on the Cell Options dialog box. If that is not enough, you
can apply a border to the table. If you want to take formatting
to the next level, you can add an alternating pattern to rows
or columns to make it easier to read information in a table.10

A table organizes your information into rows and columns. The inter-
section of a row and column is called a cell. You can create a blank
table, and then enter text, or make a table from existing text separated
by paragraphs, tabs, or commas. The first row in the table is good for
column headings, whereas the leftmost column is good for row labels.
Knowing how to select the rows and columns of a table is also essen-
tial to working with the table itself. If you want create a table within a
table, you can create nested tables. If you decide a particular table is
not really necessary after all, you can convert it to text.

In addition to creating a table from text in an InDesign document, you
can copy tabbed text from other programs and paste it into a table in
your document. If you have a table in Microsoft Word or a spreadsheet
in Microsoft Excel that you want to use in a document, you can import
the table by using the Place command on the File menu. During the
import process, you can specify import options to place the information
you want in the way you want. A red dot inside a table cell indicates
there is overflow text.

After you insert and delete rows and columns in a table, you can adjust
them to any size you want. If you want to create evenly sized rows and
columns, you can use the Distribute Rows Evenly or Distribute Columns
Evenly command to quickly do the job. If you want custom sizes, you
can drag the row or column borders to the size you want or set exact
sizing in the Rows and Columns tab in the Cell Options dialog box.
Sometimes a long table doesn’t fit in a text frame. You can also set cell
options to keep rows together.

Often, there is more to modifying a table than adding or deleting rows
or columns; you need to make cells just the right size to accommodate
the text or graphics you are entering in the table. For example, a title in
the first row of a table might be longer than the first cell in that row. To
spread the title across the top of the table, you can merge (combine)
the cells to form one long cell. Sometimes, to indicate a division in a
topic, you need to split (or divide) a cell into two. You can also split one
table into two at any row. Moreover, you can modify the width of any
column and height of any row to better present your data.

After you enter or insert text and graphics into cells in a table, you can
adjust the spacing of the content to position it where you want in a cell.
You can control how text is positioned vertically or horizontally in the
cell as well as the text baseline. A graphic appears in a table as an
inline graphic, so you can adjust its position like you would text. If the
graphic is larger than the cell, you can set the Clip Content to Cell
option to crop the image to the cell boundaries.

Table headers are the first row in a table and footers are the last row.
Sometimes a long table doesn’t fit in a text frame. You can repeat the
first and last rows of a table when they appear in a different text frame
on the same or a different page. The information you enter in the
header and footer automatically appears in the repeated headers and
footers. If you already have text in the table that you want to use as a
header or footer, you can convert the rows into a table header or
footer. On the flip side, you can also convert header or footer rows into
normal rows.

When you create a table, InDesign automatically creates strokes
around cells. You can remove or customize the strokes, and even add
custom fills by using the Strokes and Fills tab on the Cell Options dialog
box. In the dialog box, you select cell lines in a proxy preview to specify
to which actual lines in the cell you want to apply formatting. When you
mix and match stroke colors and styles in a table, you also need to
specify stroke drawing order to determine how the table should be
drawn. After you apply formatting once, you don’t need to reselect the
proxy preview lines the next time you want to apply formatting changes
to the same cells.

Alternating rows or columns with a color or a pattern can make it eas-
ier to read information in a table. With this thought in mind, InDesign
allows you to format a table with repeating alternating fills and strokes.
The alternating fills and strokes remain in place until you change the
alternating option to None. If you insert or delete a row or column, the
alternating pattern reapplies to the table. You can create alternating
patterns with fills in a table and strokes in a row or column.

What You’ll Do
301
Working with Styles
Introduction
A style is a group of format settings that you can create or
modify to get the exact look you want. In InDesign, you can
create two types of styles, character and paragraph.
Character styles apply formatting to only character attributes,
while paragraph styles apply formatting for both characters
and paragraphs attributes. 
The styles panels for paragraphs, characters, objects,
tables, and cells are centralized places to work with the differ-
ent types of styles in InDesign. The panels display the current
styles in the InDesign document. You can use buttons on the
bottom of the panel to quickly create a new style group, clear
overrides in a selection, create a new style, and delete styles.
If you have styles in one InDesign document that you want to
use in another, you can transfer them from one document
into another. If you have styles in a word processing docu-
ment, such as Microsoft Word, you can import them into an
InDesign document, too. 
After you create styles, you can use any of the style pan-
els or keyboard shortcuts to apply them. However, you can
also use the Quick Apply button. The Quick Apply button pro-
vides an easy way to apply any style in your InDesign docu-
ment. You can even use keyboard shortcuts to speed up the
process. After you apply a style, you can still apply additional
formatting, known as local or override formatting, by using
the Control, Paragraph, or Character panels. Instead of apply-
ing individual character styles for a line of text, you can cre-
ate and apply a nested style to do it for you. A nested style is
useful for a list of predictable elements on a line, such as a
name, address, and phone number.

The Paragraph Styles and Character Styles panels are centralized
places to work with paragraph and character styles in InDesign. The
panels display the current paragraph and character styles in the
InDesign document. You can use buttons on the bottom of the panel to
quickly create a new style group, clear overrides in a selection
(Paragraph only), create a new style, and delete styles. You can also
use the Options menu to duplicate and edit styles, as well as sort styles
in the panel by name.

create a new style. To modify the Basic Paragraph style or any style for
that matter, adjust the formatting settings for the existing style. When
you see a plus (+) sign after the name, it means that the text with the

A paragraph style is a group of paragraph and character format set-

from the formatting of existing text or use the New Paragraph Styles
dialog box to specify the formatting and other attributes you want.
When you create a new paragraph style with the New Paragraph
Styles dialog box, you can create a new style from scratch or base the
new style on an existing style and then modify it. You can also select a
style for the next paragraph. When you press Enter (Win) or Return
(Mac), InDesign automatically switches from the current style to the
next style. If you like using keyboard shortcuts, you can attach a short-
cut to the style to make it easy to apply.

Exporting Tags to EPUB, HTML, or PDF
In order to prepare your document styles for export in EPUB, HTML,
or PDF output, you need to map styles to export tags. Mapping styles
to export tags specifies how you want to translate your current doc-
ument paragraph and character styles into HTML and PDF tags. By
mapping styles to tags, you’ll ensure the best possible results for
export to EPUB, HTML, or PDF output. For example, you can map an
InDesign body text style to an HTML <p> tag, and then add a class
named paragraph1 to differentiate between a typical paragraph and
the first paragraph. For EPUB, you can also specify whether you
want to split the document after a style (New!). You can define indi-
vidual mapping styles using the paragraph or character Style
Options dialog box. See “Mapping Styles to Export Tags,” on page
322 for more details.

A character style is a group of format settings that is applied to any
block of text. Rather than formatting text from the Control or Character
panels, using the character styles features allows you to quickly make
changes later. You can create a new character style from the format-
ting of existing text or use the New Character Style dialog box to spec-
ify the formatting and other attributes you want. When you create a
new character style with the New Character Style dialog box, you can

cial characters in a document. GREP (Global Regular Expression Print)
is used by the Find/Change dialog box to find and replace text and 
special characters, such as tabs, ends of paragraphs, white space,
variables, and wildcards. You can create a style to apply a character
style to text that conforms to a GREP expression. A GREP style is a
Character style with a GREP expression. When text matches the GREP
expression, the character style is applied to the text. In the GREP Styles
and Find/Change dialog boxes (where you can select a character or
paragraph style), you can create a style without having to exit the 
dialog box.

As you continue to create styles, the list in the Paragraph and
Character panels can become long and difficult to use. A style group is
a folder you can use to organize styles in the Paragraph or Character
panels. This can help you reduce the clutter in the panels and make it
easier to find and work with the styles you want. After you create a
style group, you can drag styles into it, just like you drag files into a
folder in Windows Explorer (Win) or Finder (Mac).

If you have styles in one InDesign document that you want to use in
another, you can transfer (or load) them from one document into
another. If you have styles in a word processing document, such as a
Microsoft Word file, you can import them into an InDesign document,
too. When you place text from a word processing document, the styles
associated with the text are added to the Paragraph or Character pan-
els in the InDesign document. When you add styles to an InDesign doc-
ument, there may be times when style names are the same. In this
case, you need to resolve the conflict between the styles. Style names
are case-sensitive, so the name Header text is different than header
text. If you want text with an imported style to be used by a current
style, you can map the incoming style to the current style. This way,
you don’t have to reapply the text style.

After you create paragraph and character styles, you can use the
Paragraph Styles and Character Styles panels or keyboard shortcuts to
apply styles to text. For a GREP style, you can use the GREP styles dia-
log box to apply styles to selected paragraphs. After you apply a style,
you can still apply additional formatting, known as local or override for-
matting, by using the Control, Paragraph, or Character panels. When
the applied style also contains other formatting, a plus sign (+) appears
after the style name, which you can remove to redefine the style. You
can use the Clear Override button on the Paragraph Styles panel to
remove formatting overrides in a text selection.

Instead of applying individual character styles for a line of text, you can
create and apply a nested style to do it for you. A nested style is useful
for a list of predictable elements, such as a name, address, and phone
number, on a line. You can also create and use nested inline styles to
apply complex character formatting through the end of a line. Before
you create a nested style, you need to create the individual characters
that you want to make up the nested style. If you want a nested style to
end at a certain place in the text, you can insert the End Nested Style
Here special character.

an object. You can create and modify object styles in the Object Styles

In order to prepare your document styles for export in EPUB, HTML, or
PDF output, you need to map styles to export tags. Mapping styles to
export tags specifies how you want to translate your current document
paragraph and character styles into HTML and PDF tags (New!). By
mapping styles to tags, you’ll ensure the best possible results for export
to EPUB, HTML, or PDF output. For EPUB and HTML, you can also spec-
ify CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) class names (optional) to add to differ-
entiate between slight variations in styling. For example, you can map
an InDesign body text style to an HTML <p> tag, and then add a class
named paragraph1 to differentiate between a typical paragraph and the
first paragraph. You can define individual mapping styles using the para-
graph or character Style Options dialog box or all mapping styles in one
place using the Edit All Export Tags dialog box (New!).

Finalizing a Document
Introduction
Finalizing your document is an important thing to do prior to
printing. Of course, no document should be printed without
first going through the spell checker to check your spelling.
You can add personalized names, terms, and company infor-
mation to a user dictionary, so that when you are using the
spell checker, there won’t be unnecessary stops on words
that are spelled and used correctly. If you need to make text
fit in text frames and on pages, you can adjust the hyphen-
ation, choose to keep lines together, and change justification
options to help you finalize your document.
Sometimes you use a certain font in a document, but later
you decide to change it. Instead of manually changing each
use of the font, you can use the Find Font command to
quickly find and change every instance of the font in your
document. You can also use the Find/Change dialog box to
find and replace elements—including text, GREP expressions,
glyphs, and objects—in your document. The dialog box pro-
vides powerful features to find and change special characters,
including tabs, line breaks, end of paragraph returns, sym-
bols, markers, hyphens and dashes, white space, variables,
and wildcards to name a few. 
If you want to focus solely on the text in your document,
the Story Editor is the tool for you. The Story Editor displays
text and tables in a separate window with unformatted
sequential columns and rows for easy editing. Any graphics,
shapes, text formatting, and other design elements in your
document do not appear in the Story Editor. 12

There's nothing more embarrassing than creating a document that con-
tains misspelled words. InDesign includes a fully functional spell check-
ing system, which lets you make sure all of your words are spelled
correctly. Instead of using Spell Check, you can also use dynamic
spelling, which displays misspelled or unrecognized words in your docu-
ment with a red underline as you type. You can right-click (Win) or
Control-click (Mac) the word to select a correction on the context menu.
Using Spell Check 
Use Spell Check on a Document
Click the Edit menu, point to
Spelling, and then click Check
Spelling.
TIMESAVER Ctrl+I (Win) or
A+I (Mac).
Click Start, if necessary.
When InDesign encounters a word
not in the dictionary, it displays
that word, and allows you to
choose one of the following
options:
◆Skip. Leaves the word alone
and moves on.
◆Change. Changes the word,
based on the selected
suggestion.
◆Ignore All. Ignores all
instances of this word in the
document.
◆Change All. Changes all
occurrences of the word,
based on the selected
suggestion.
◆Dictionary. Opens the
Dictionary dialog box.
◆Add. Adds the word to the
selected dictionary. Click the
Add To list arrow to select a
dictionary.
InDesign continues to highlight
misspelled and other incorrectly
used words until the document is
completely scanned.
When you’re finished, click Done.

InDesign comes with a custom dictionary for the spell checker. If you
need to manage dictionary content, you can use the Edit Custom
Dictionary dialog box to add, delete, or edit words. The ability to edit
the dictionary becomes useful when you accidentally enter a word that
you don’t want in the dictionary, or you have some specialty words that
you want to enter in all at once. When you add a custom word, name,
or phrase to a custom dictionary, all languages treat the item as cor-
rectly spelled. InDesign supports the user dictionary to verify spelling
and to hyphenate words. In addition, you can find Hunspell dictionaries
at Adobe.com from InDesign (New!).

A footnote is a note placed at the bottom of a text frame to cite a refer-

ters (1, 2, 3, etc.). InDesign provides you with various options in order to
customize the reference marks. If you’d like to change your footnotes
to alpha characters (a, b, c, etc.) or Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.), you
can do that through the Footnote Options dialog box. You can also have
InDesign renumber your footnotes after each page, section, or spread
in your document, and change the style and other formatting for refer-
ence marks.

Creating an Interactive
Document
Introduction
In the past, desktop publishing was exclusively considered a
print-based medium. However, with the introduction and
popularity of the PDF (Portable Document Format) file format
and the Adobe Reader as well as the SWF (ShockWave Flash)
file format and the Adobe Flash Player, interactive documents
are more popular than ever. Instead of creating a document
just for printing, you can now create an interactive document
with hyperlinks, bookmarks, and buttons for presentations.
You can even add animation using motion presets, page tran-
sitions, such as a wipe or dissolve, when you turn a page and
insert sounds and videos into an InDesign document in addi-
tion to graphics. 
With the Hyperlinks panel, you can create hyperlinks that
navigate to external URLs, link to files with supplemental
information, launch an e-mail client, or jump to a page or
section of a page within the same or even a different docu-
ment. You can also verify your hyperlinks directly in InDesign
with no need to export the document to a PDF or Flash (SWF)
file for testing. 
The Buttons and Forms panel is a centralized place to
work with interactive buttons and forms in InDesign. The
Buttons and Forms panel makes it easy to create interactive
buttons that perform actions when the document is exported
to Flash (SWF file) or Acrobat (PDF). You can create a custom
button from a selected object in an InDesign document or
select a button from the built-in Samples button library. When
you create an interactive button, you can add events and
actions to enable navigation within a document, launch a
movie, play a sound, or open a web page.
When you’re finished with your interactive document, you
can use the SWF Preview panel to view animation and inter-
activity for the current selection, current spread, or the entire
document.

A hyperlink is a text or graphic object that is linked to other parts of the
document, other documents, or web pages. A hyperlink consists of a
source and a destination. The source is the text or graphic object that
you click to jump to the hyperlink location while the destination is the
place that InDesign sends you to. The destination can be in the same
document, another document, an e-mail message, or a web page on
the Internet. You need to define a destination before you can define the
source.

The Hyperlinks panel is a centralized place to work with hyperlinks and
cross references in InDesign. The redesigned Hyperlinks panel makes
it easy to create hyperlinks that navigate to external URLs, link to files
with supplemental information, launch an e-mail client, or jump to a
page or section of a page within the same or even a different docu-
ment. You can also verify your hyperlinks directly in InDesign with no
need to export the document to a PDF or Flash (SWF file) for testing.
You can use buttons on the bottom of the panel to go to the hyperlink
source or destination, create a new hyperlink, or delete hyperlinks.

With the Place command or Media panel, you can import the sound or
video clips that you want to play in your interactive document. You can
import video files in Flash Video format (FLV and F4Vm), H.264-encoded
files (such as MP4), and SWF (ShockWave Flash) files. You can import
audio files in MP3 format. Legacy media files, such as QuickTime (MOV),
AVI, WMV, and MPEG, are still supported. However, if you want to take
advantage of the rich media support in Acrobat 9 or later, Adobe Reader
9 or later, and Adobe Flash Player 10 or later, you need to convert and
relink your legacy media to FLV, F4V, SWF, MP4, or MP3 using Adobe
Media Encoder CS6 (New!) or later. With the Preset Browser (New!),
you can select user conversion presets for systems, such as desktops
and the web, and devices, such as Apple iOS and Android. After you
import sound and video files, you can preview them in the SWF Preview
panel in InDesign or export them to Adobe PDF or SWF, or XML. You can
export legacy media files to PDF files, but not to SWF or FLA files. If you
have video on a web server, you can place the video from a URL. If
you’re not sure what to play, you can create an empty frame (with diag-
onal lines) and then import the clip later. When you import a media file, a
poster image appears, which you can change or remove later.

other legacy media cannot be viewed in the Media panel. You can
select the playback controls you want, and select the placeholder
poster image for FLV, F4V, and MP4 files. A placeholder poster image is
the still image that appears for the media in the frame, which you can
change or remove later. In addition, you can create navigation points,
which are time-code markers, that you can use with button actions to
play a video starting from any of the navigation points. You can work

In an InDesign document, you can add animation to objects for use in
exported SWF files, not in an Interactive PDF. To add animation to a
PDF, export a selection as a SWF and place it in an InDesign document,
and then export it as a PDF. With the Animation panel, you can animate
an object quickly using motion presets, which are pre-defined anima-
tions that come along with InDesign. The motion presets are the same
ones used in Adobe Flash Professional CS6 or later. You can import any
custom presets from XML created in Flash or save your own in
InDesign. After you apply a motion preset, you can modify animation
settings, such as speed, duration, and when the animation plays. If you
no longer want to use an animation, you can remove it.

An event determines when to trigger an action that will execute a button
or form control operation. For example, the On Release or Tap event
(New!) triggers an action when the mouse button is released after a
button click or when a tap is pressed from a gesture. An action is asso-
ciated with an event. You can assign an action type to a button to per-
form an action. For example, the Go To URL action type opens a web
page in your default browser from the PDF document with the interac-
tive button. You can create actions to navigate to anchor text or book-
marks, document pages and views, to launch a movie, play a sound, or
open a web page. You can work with events and actions for a selected
button or form control in the Buttons and Forms panel.

A button consists of a group of individual objects. When you view a but-
ton, an object appears. When you point to or click on a button, another
object appears. Each object represents a button state. Each button can
have up to three states: Normal, Rollover, and Click. The button is in
Normal state when you don’t point to or click on the button, Rollover
occurs when you point to the button, and Click occurs when you click
the button. When you’re working with form controls (New!) for a PDF,
the Radio Button and Check Box controls include button states, which
you can change the same way. You can work with button states for a
selected button or form control in the Buttons and Forms panel. When
you activate a state in the Buttons and Forms panel, the Normal state
(default) is copied to it. After it’s copied, you can change the appear-
ance of the element using InDesign color, text, and image tools.

With the Object States panel, you can create multiple versions of an
object, known as a state, on a page. An object with multiple states is
called a multi-state object. Each time you create a new state, you cre-
ate a new version of the selected object to the page. Only one state is
visible on the page at a time. For example, you can create a slide show
for use in a PDF or SWF, where each image is stacked and aligned on
top of each other as a multi-state object. When you print the document
or export it as a PDF, only the active state appears. After you create a
multi-state object, you can edit it in a variety of ways. You can edit an
object in a state, add to or duplicate objects in a state, or delete a state
and its contents. If you want to break apart a multi-state object, you
can convert it to independent objects.

Creating a Digital Publication
Introduction
In addition to creating print and interactive documents, you
can also create a digital publication for use on mobile
devices, such as an iPad or iPhone, as well as your desktop. 
If you create a document with a primary layout, yet need
another unique layout for another orientation or different
device class, such as a tablet, you can create an alternate lay-
out to create new linked pages based on an existing layout.
This allows you to leverage content on the primary layout to
create an alternate one. After you create a document with a
primary layout, you can apply Liquid Layout options to allow
page content to adapt to different aspect ratios within a
device class.
Adobe Digital Publishing Suite (DPS) is a set of tools used
by publishers to create, distribute, and sell interactive publi-
cations for tablet devices. The DPS fee-based solution is avail-
able at www.adobe.com under Products; the Single Edition
allows for publishing to iPad. DPS tools are integrated into
InDesign by adding the Folio Overlays and Folio Builder pan-
els and Preview commands on the File menu. The Folio
Overlays panel allows you to create the interactive content,
while the Folio Builder panel assembles (in a container) all of
the necessary files into a format compatible with tablets.
After you finish a folio publication, you can preview it on a
device with the Adobe Content Viewer application (available
free from Adobe).

Instead of creating multiple fixed positioned layouts for every possible
size and orientation, Liquid Layout allows page layout content to adapt
to different page dimensions within the same category of devices,
known as a device class, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, desk-
tops, or televisions. After you create a document with a primary layout
(using a specified intent—either print, web, or digital publishing—and
page size), you can apply Liquid Layout (New!) options to allow page
content to adapt to different aspect ratios within a device class. Liquid
Layout applies Liquid Page Rules: Off, Scale, Re-center, Object-based,
Guide-based and Controlled by Master. Except for the Object-based
option, all rules are applied to all elements on a page. If you need a lay-
out for a new device class or another orientation, you need to create
an alternate layout to create new pages.

Using the Page Tool to Set Liquid Page Rules
In addition to the Liquid Layout panel, you can also use the Page tool
on the Tools panel along with the Control panel to set Liquid Page
Rules for a specific page. Select the Page tool on the Tools panel,
select the page you want to resize in the layout, click the Liquid
Page Rule list arrow on the Control panel, and then select a rule. You
can apply a rule to any page. when you create an alternate layout,
you can select the Preserve Existing option to use the options set on
each page. See “Changing the Page Size,” on pages 62-63 for more
information on using the Page tool to set Liquid Page Rules.

If you create a document with a primary layout (using a specified
intent—either print, web, or digital publishing—and page size), yet
need another unique layout for another orientation or different device
class, you can create an alternate layout (New!) to create new linked
pages based on an existing layout all in the same document. This allows
you to leverage content on the primary layout to create an alternate
one. When you update the primary layout, you can update the link for
the alternate one to keep the content consistent. If you want to adapt
the content in the layout for use in the same device class, you can use
Liquid Layout options. As you create alternate layouts, it’s important to
name them by target device and orientation for easy identification later.
For example, iPad-H and iPad-V. InDesign creates new masters for an
alternate layout and preserves the use of a primary text frame.

Adobe Digital Publishing Suite (DPS) is a set of tools used by larger pub-
lishers to create, distribute, and sell interactive publications for tablet
devices. The DPS fee-based solution is available at www.adobe.com
under Products; the Single Edition allows for publishing to iPad. DPS
tools are integrated into InDesign by adding the Folio Overlays and Folio
Builder panels. The Folio Overlays panel (New!) allows you to create
the interactive content, while the Folio Builder panel (New!) assembles
(in a container) all of the necessary files into a format compatible with
tablets. You can create local or online publications. For online publica-
tions, you need an Adobe ID (available free) to access Adobe DPS and
the Adobe Cloud, where documents are stored and distributed to
tablets. As an InDesign user, you can use DPS to create one free online
publication to try it out and share it with as many people as you want.
Before you can get started, you need to download Folio Producer tools
(Folio Overlays panel, Digital Publishing plug-in, and Content Viewer for
Desktop) and the Folio Builder panel update for InDesign CS6 or later,
and install them on your computer. When you sign in to DPS with your
Adobe ID on a tablet, it allows you to download and view it.

Creating a Folio
Overlay
Use the Folio Overlays Panel
Select the Folio Overlays panel.
◆Click the Window menu, and
then click Folio Overlays.
Add interactivity to your document
using the following:
◆Hyperlink. Create a hyperlink
using the Hyperlinks panel (as
text) or the Buttons and Forms
panel (as a button). In the
Buttons and Forms panel,
create a Go To URL.
◆Slideshow. Create a multi-state
object using the Object States
panel.
◆Image Sequence. Create a
folder that contains the images
for the sequence. Name the
images using ascending
numbers, such as image001.jpg,
image002.jpg, and so on. Create
a placeholder image frame.
◆Audio & Video. Place an audio
(mp3) or video (mp4 with h.264)
file and set options in the
Media panel. To display an
audio controller, create a folder
that contains a set of image
buttons for play and pause,
named audio_play.png and
audio_pause.png.
◆Panorama. Create a folder
containing the six images that
represent a cube (four outside
images, top and bottom). Create
a placeholder image frame.

The Folio Overlays panel (New!) allows you to create the interactive
content with hyperlinks (links or buttons), slide shows, image sequences
(rotating 360 effect with images), audio & video, panoramas (360 views),
web content (access URLs or embed HTML), and pan & zoom for display
on tablet devices. The interactive content is an overlay on top of all non-
interactive elements, which are compressed into a single image in the
background. When you create a publication for a tablet, known as a
folio, you need to create horizontal and vertical layouts in separate
InDesign documents. In a folio, you cannot mix and match orientations;
it must be portrait, landscape, or dual (both for when a device rotates).

Designing Folio Publications
The document dimensions for a folio (digital) publication are impor-
tant to establish at the beginning so you don’t have to make adjust-
ments later. When you create a folio publication, the document size
needs to be designed with the same aspect ratio as the folio, or
designed as a single page with the same horizontal size as the folio
for smooth scrolling. Aspect ratio is the shape of a document or
image and is described as the ratio of its width and height dimen-
sion. For example, an 8 (w) x 10 (h) document size has a 5:4 aspect
ratio. A typical folio for a tablet device (1024 x 768 monitor resolution)
has a 4:3 aspect ratio. This translates to a document size of 14.2 (w)
x 10.6 (h). The 4:3 aspect ratio is the same for 800 x 600 and 1280 x
960 monitor resolutions, however the document size for each of
those is different. So, the aspect ratio of width and height needs to
be the same, not necessarily the actual width and height. If you cre-
ate a single page document with the same horizontal (width) size as
the folio, you can enable Smooth Scrolling to allow for vertical scroll-
ing down the page. You can set page size in the Document Setup dia-
log box; click the File menu, and then click Document Setup. In addi-
tion to document dimensions, you also need to turn off Facing Pages
in the Document Setup dialog box to display only single pages.

After you add interactivity to an InDesign document using the Folio
Overlays panel and InDesign media tools, you can use the Folio Builder
panel (New!) to assemble all of the individual InDesign files, called arti-
cles, into a format for tablet devices. The Folio Builder panel works in
conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite (DPS) at acrobat.com to
create, distribute, and sell interactive publications for tablet devices.
You can create local or online publications. For online publications, you
need an Adobe ID (available free) to access Adobe DPS and the Adobe
Cloud, where documents are stored and distributed to tablets. You can
use DPS to create one free online publication to try it out and share it
with others. The process is easy: (1) create a new folio publication, (2)

Instead of adding one article at a time in the Folio Builder panel (New!),
you can import multiple articles all at one time. Before you can import
articles, you need to set up the InDesign files (articles) according to a
set of folder structure and file naming conventions. In Windows Explorer
(Win) or Finder (Mac), create a folder for the folio that consists of indi-
vidual article folders. Each article folder contains one (single orienta-
tion) or two (dual orientation) article documents named with a suffix of
“_v” (vertical layout) or “_h” (horizontal layout), such as article_v.indd.
You cannot mix and match orientations; it can only be one orientation.
Each article folder can also contain a PNG file for table-of-contents
thumbnails. If this file is missing, the TOC image is generated automati-
cally. Any files you link to in InDesign do not have to be in the article
folder; the links simply need to corrected linked.

make sure your content looks the way you want. To view a folio publica-
tion on a desktop, tablet, or other device, you need to have the Adobe
Content Viewer application (New!) installed (available free from
Adobe). When you install Folio Producer tools for InDesign, the Adobe

Automating the Way You
Work
Introduction
A library stores InDesign items, such as text frames, graphics
frames, shapes, buttons, sounds, and movies so you can use
them in other documents. A library is not an InDesign docu-
ment; it’s a separate file (INDL). After you add items to a
library, you can use them in any InDesign document. A snip-
pet is an item from an InDesign document that you can save
as an external InDesign Snippet file (IDMS) for use later.
Snippets and libraries are similar. However, there are a few
differences. Libraries are composed of a group of items,
while snippets as individual items. You can store hundreds of
items in a library. You may not want to do that, but you can if
you want. When a library contains a lot of items, it can be
hard to find the one you want. You can use the Show Subset
dialog box to search for any item in a library. The powerful
search features allow you to specify one or more levels of
search criteria to find exactly what you want. 
Conditional text allows you to create different versions of
the same document. If you want to create two versions of the
same document without having to create two separate files,
you can create conditions for different text, and then show
and hide conditions to create multiple versions. You can also
merge data between documents. With the Data Merge panel,
you can create a form letter, envelopes, or mailing labels by
merging data from a source file with an InDesign target doc-
ument. 
A script is external code that allows you to extend the
functionality of InDesign. InDesign comes with a set of sam-
ple scripts that you can run at any time. If you know how to
write code for a script, you can create your own. XML
(Extensible Markup Language) provides a way to reuse data
from one file in another file. If you have some experience
with XML, it’s a good way to reuse information and automate
the way you work with content. 15

A library stores InDesign items, such as text frames, graphics frames,

(INDL). When you create a new library or open an existing library, the
Library panel appears, displaying the library name in the title tab. In the
Library panel, you can add, remove, or update items. You can add items
to the library one at a time, all items from a page, or as a whole page.

InDesign tries to assign an object type to the item, but it may not
always be what you want. If an item contains multiple objects, such as
a shape with text or a button with text, you may want to change the
object type. You can change the item name and object type, as well as

A snippet is an item from an InDesign document, such as a text frame,
graphics frame, shape, button, sound, or movie, that you can save as
an external InDesign Snippet file (IDMS) for use later. You can’t use a
text selection as a snippet, but you can use a text frame. Snippets and
libraries are similar. However, there are a few differences. Libraries are
composed of a group of items, while snippets individual items. You can
drag individual snippets from a folder, desktop, or the Adobe Bridge into
an InDesign document, which you can’t do with library items. Since
snippets are individual items, you can preview them (unlike library
items). Snippets also typically have a smaller file size than a library file.

Conditional text allows you to create different versions of the same
document. If you want to create two versions of the same document
without having to create two separate files, you can create conditions
for different text, and then show and hide different conditions to create
multiple versions. For example, if you’re creating a computer book for
the Macintosh and Windows operating systems, like the one you’re
reading, you can create text conditions for each Macintosh and
Windows step instead of creating two separate files. You can apply
conditions to text in a frame or table. A condition includes formatting
indicators to make each condition easy to see in a document. To dis-
play different versions quickly, you can create condition sets. A condi-
tion set saves the visibility settings (the Eye icon) for all conditions.

With the Place and Link command (New!), you can reuse content—
including text, shapes, graphics, groups and interactivity elements (such
as a button)—in the same InDesign document or in other documents
(New!). By creating a link (to a parent), you create an identical object
(child) in a layout, which you can update as desired as content changes.
This is useful when you want to create stationery and want to use boil-
erplate text and logo on different size letterhead or envelopes or when
you want to create an InDesign document as a centralized repository to
storage and manage reusable content. When content is placed, one or
more links appear in the Links panel (New!), where you can update all
or individual linked content. InDesign views content and frames as
unique elements to differentiate between the content and container. Any
unique changes to child content are overwritten by parent content,
except for specified style mapping exceptions and local edits.

When you link content in the same document or in a different document,
the child element is set by default to update to exactly the same as the
parent. However, there are situations where you want the child to be a
little different than the parent. For example, between the print and digital
version of the same document publication, you want the headline and
body text to be larger in the digital version than the print version. With
the Link Options dialog box (New!), you can set options to preserve
local edits while updating object links and specify style mapping excep-
tions. In addition, there are options to update links when saving a docu-
ment or display a warning if an update will overwrite local edits.

A script is external code that allows you to extend the functionality of
InDesign. InDesign comes with a set of sample scripts that you can run
at any time. If you know how to write code for a script, you can create
your own. InDesign works with AppleScripts on the Macintosh and
Visual Basic scripts in Windows. If you want to use the same scripts on
both platforms, you can use JavaScript. The Scripts panel displays all
the available scripts in InDesign. The sample scripts are located in the
Samples folder within the InDesign application folder. You can double-
click a script in the Scripts panel to run it, or you can run scripts using
Quick Apply on the Control panel. You can also attach text to an object
on a page using the Script Label panel. The text you attach can be any
text, which you can search for or manipulate using a script.

in CSV (comma-delimited) or TXT (tab-delimited) contains data fields
(columns) and records (rows). Each column of data is a field, such as
Name, Address, and so on, while each row of data is a record. If you

XML (Extensible Markup Language) provides a way to reuse data from
one file in another file. XML uses tags to describe data in the XML file
that you can export into a different file. Tagged data are called 
elements. InDesign can create and use XML data. You can tag data as
elements in an InDesign document, save and export data as XML, and
then reuse it in other documents. InDesign provides the Structure pane
and the Tags panel for working with XML data. The Structure pane
shows you the hierarchy and structure of XML data and text snippets
for viewing purposes, while the Tags panel lists tags for elements and
provides tools to import, export, add, delete, and rename tags.

hierarchy of the tagged elements in the Structure pane, you’re ready to
export your document to XML for use in other documents. In addition to
XML files, you can also export to the InDesign Markup Language (IDML)
format, which is an XML-based format. This allows you to create
(export) and open XML InDesign documents using standard XML tools. If
you’re exporting large documents to PDF or IDML, you can continue to

Exporting a Document
Introduction
After you finish creating your document in InDesign, you can
export your work in another file format for use in other pro-
grams. There are eight main file formats to which you can
export your document, which include Adobe Flash CS
Professional (FLA), Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format)
for print or interactive, EPS (Encapsulated PostScript), JPEG,
Flash SWF (ShockWave Flash), and XML (Extensible Markup
Language). In addition to these file formats, you can also
export text in the Adobe InDesign Tagged Text, Rich Text
Format, and Text Only file formats. When you export from
InDesign, your content can be altered using the Options dia-
log box for the specific file format. 
If a co-worker or client doesn’t have InDesign, you can
create an Adobe PDF of a print or interactive document for
them to review your work. Adobe PDF is a useful file format
for document sharing, viewing, and proofing with Adobe
Acrobat Reader or Adobe Acrobat Professional, which can be
used to add comments and annotations. If you frequently use
custom settings to export an InDesign document to an Adobe
PDF file, you can save time by creating a preset. 
If you use Adobe Flash Professional CS6 or later to create
vector-based animation and interactivity, you can export con-
tent from InDesign to the FLA format for use in Flash. You can
open FLA files in Flash and then use the authoring environ-
ment to add video, audio, animation, and complex interactiv-
ity. If you want to use InDesign content on the web, you can
export your document as a Digital Editions eBook file or a
HTML file, which you can open in Adobe Dreamweaver. A
digital edition is a XHTML-based EPUB ebook that is compati-
ble with the Adobe Digital Editions reader software.
Dreamweaver is a HTML editor that allows you to create and
manage web sites and pages. 16

After you finish creating your document in InDesign, you can export it
for use in other programs. If you want to share a document with some-
one who doesn’t have InDesign, you can export the file as a PDF
(Portable Document Format) in print or interactive form. If you have a
document that is composed primarily of text, you can export the file as a
text document, which you can open in a word processing program. If
you have a document composed mostly of artwork, you can export it as
a JPEG or PNG (New!) file (for use on the web). If you want to use con-
tent from an InDesign document in Adobe Flash CS6 Professional or
later, you can export it as a FLA file. If you want to use content from your
InDesign document on the web, you can export your document as an
eBook EPUB (New!) file or HTML (New!) file. In addition, you can
export a document as a SWF movie for use in the Flash Player. If you
want to open a CS6 document in InDesign CS4 or later (make sure soft-
ware is updated), you can export it to IDML (InDesign Markup).

If a co-worker or client doesn’t have InDesign, you can create an Adobe
PDF of a document for them to review your work in a print or interactive
form. Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is a useful file format for
document sharing, viewing, and proofing with Adobe Acrobat Reader,
which is free for download on the web at www.adobe.com. InDesign,
you have two PDF export options. You can export and optimize your PDF
document for print using the Adobe PDF (Print) format or for interactivity
using the Adobe PDF (Interactive) format.

Understanding PDF/X Formats
PDF/X is a standard—a defined set of rules—that ensures page lay-
out or graphic files are consistent, predictable, and compliant for
print-ready purposes. PDF/X rules require certain content, prohibit
others, and leaves some alone. Using PDF/X compliant files elimi-
nates many common errors in file preparation, such as fonts not
embedded, incorrect color spaces, missing images, and overprinting
and trapping issues. There are three PDF/X formats: PDF/X-1a,
PDF/X-3 and PDF/X-4. Each format has different versions. InDesign
supports PDF/X-4:2010 (New5.5), which is the same as PDF/X-
4:2008, except that it relaxes certain restrictions on how layers can
be specified in the PDF. This provides the functionality to create lay-
ers in an exported PDF and PDF 1.6 compatibility. In addition, PDF 1.6
allows JPEG2000 compression as an option for the color and
grayscale images.

The Compression PDF Print options allow you to specify compression
settings for color, grayscale, and monochrome (black and white) images.
The important settings to consider are sampling, compression method,
and image quality. The sampling option allows you to select how much
downsampling of pixels takes place. The greater the downsampling, the
greater compression and lower the quality. The compression option lets
you select a compression method. Automatic (JPEG) is recommended.
The higher the image quality level, the lower the compression and vice
versa. So, choose an image quality level that best suits your needs.

box, which you can open from the Media panel. When you import a
video, the video object and the poster appear in a frame. When you
export to PDF, the video object’s frame determines the size of the video
in the PDF document, not the frame or poster size. If you keep the video
frame size and the poster and frame size the same, you shouldn’t have
any problems on export to PDF. Also, be aware that videos always

An EPS file can contain vector and bitmap graphics, so it makes the
format more versatile for use in other programs. EPS does a good job of

If you have a document that you want to post on the web, you can
export it as a JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) or PNG
(Portable Network Graphic) (New!) file. The Export command for JPEG
or PNG gives you options to specify image quality and resolution,
select the color space, use anti-alias to smooth jagged edges for text
and images, use document bleed settings, and simulate overprinting.
For JPEG, you can also set options to embed the color profile and
specify how you want to display the image on the screen (format
method). For PNG, you can also set an option to use a transparent
background. JPEG and PNG are a compressed format with relatively
high quality, so it’s a common file format for the web.

The SWF file format delivers vector graphics, text, video, and sound to
the web using Adobe Flash player or Adobe AIR software. Adobe Flash
Pro produces SWF (ShockWave Flash) movie files as a native format.
However, you can also create SWF files directly from InDesign by using
the Export command. The Export command for SWF gives you general
and advanced options to specify how you want to create a SWF movie.
You can export a selection, all pages, or a range of pages. When you
export SWF files from within InDesign, you can include interactivity and
media or just their appearance. When InDesign finishes the export, you
can have your browser automatically open and display the SWF file
using the Adobe Flash Player.

If you use Adobe Flash CS6 Professional or later to create vector-based
animation and interactivity, you can export content from InDesign to the
FLA format for use in Flash; this replaces XFL export in InDesign CS4.
You can open FLA files (default file format) in Flash and then use the
authoring environment to add video, audio, animation, and complex
interactivity. You can export a selection, all pages, or a range of pages.
InDesign text exported as FLA remains fully editable when the FLA file
is opened in Flash. InDesign automatically converts high-resolution
print assets (CMYK) to low-resolution web assets (RGB) upon export as
an FLA file. An image placed multiple times in your InDesign document
is saved as a single image asset with shared locations when exported
as an FLA file.

The Articles panel (New5.5) allows you to specify the content reading
order of your document for EPUB, HTML, or Accessible PDFs without
using the Structure panel. It’s a simple drag and drop objects from a
page (including Master Page objects) to the Articles panel. InDesign
uses the Layers panel to help order the initial placement of the content
in the Articles panel. Once the content is in the Articles panel, you can
manually reorder it to meet your needs. For EPUB and HTML, you are
good to go. For Accessible PDFs, you need to enable an option to use
the structure in the Articles panel in Acrobat. The Articles panel allows
you to create multiple articles and order them in the sequence you
want and then export the ones you want to create custom content.

With InDesign, you can more efficiently create an accessible PDF that
people with disabilities can access using a screen reader or assistive
device. You can establish content reading order in the Article panel, add
alt text to graphics, add tags to paragraph styles, and anchor objects.
InDesign automatically creates tags (New5.5) for tables, nested tables,
lists, nested lists, footnotes, bookmarks, hyperlinks, and cross-refer-
ences and translates them directly from InDesign to Acrobat. In order to
finalize an accessible PDF, you need to make some changes in Acrobat
that you can’t do in InDesign. You need to set the document language,
remove unnecessary information in a Properties field, and set the tab
order to use the order from the Articles panel (New5.5) in InDesign.

In addition to normal content, such as text, graphics, and links, PDFs also
include a structure. The structure is a set of tags that define the content
layout, such as the correct reading order, and the meaning of elements,
such as figures, lists, and tables. A PDF with well-formed tags may be
reflowed to fit different pages or screen widths. The more you tag a PDF,
the more control you have over the output. Tagged PDFs work well with
screen-readers as well as make the file compliant with Section 508 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which makes web content accessible to
people with disabilities. You can use the Object Export Options dialog box
(New5.5) to apply tags and actual text, which is a way to apply text (as
an image) to graphics elements within tagged PDFs.

An ebook is an electronic book file that displays content in a linear,
reflowing format with different sizes of viewing. The EPUB or OEBPS for-
mat is one of the most widely supported file formats for ebooks. The
EPUB format is compatible with the Adobe Digital Editions reader soft-
ware and devices, such as Barnes & Noble Nook, Sony Reader, iRiver,
Kobo, and Apple iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). The notable excep-
tion is Amazon Kindle (MOBI), however there is a plug-in available.
EPUB is an XHTML-based format that can display text, graphics, video
and audio, however, only the Apple iOS can display video and audio at
this time. Within InDesign, you can export a document or book as an
EPUB with version 2.0.1 (current standard) or 3.0 (coming standard)
(New!). During the export process, you can specify book metadata for
search engines, a book cover, content ordering and formatting options,
image display and conversion settings, and the use of styles and CSS
(Cascading Style Sheets: formatting rules that control page look).

Looking Inside the ePUB Structure
An ePUB file is a collection of files in a zip file. If you change its
extension from .epub to .zip, the file becomes a ZIP file that you can
unzip. The most important folder is the OEBPS folder, which con-
tains the ePub content. The OEBPS folder includes the following:
content.opf, template.css, .xhtml or .html files, toc.ncx, images fold-
er, and fonts folder. If you want to get into it, you can unzip it on
Windows, or use Springy (third-party app) on the Mac. At this point,
you can open the OEBPS folder as a site in Adobe Dreamweaver,
view the content in Live view, and edit the HTML code to tweak or
customize it. When you’re done, rezip it or bring it back into Springy.

styles to create CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) style classes in HTML.
InDesign exports the following: stories, linked and embedded graphics,
SWF movie files, footnotes, text variables (as text), bulleted and num-
bered lists, cross-references, hyperlinks (to text and web pages), and
tables along with some formatting. For exported audio and h.264 video,
files are enclosed in HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags. There are some
elements that don’t get exported, such as drawn objects, pasted objects,
text converted to outlines, XML tags, books, bookmarks, SING glyphlets,

Printing and Outputting a
Document
Introduction
The Print command is probably the most used of all
InDesign's print options. The Print command is a portal to
other menus that let you control specific printing functions,
such as crop marks and bleeds, output ink, graphics, and
color management. Color separations divide artwork into
four plates by color, known as process colors. Each plate rep-
resents a CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) color. The
Separations Preview panel allows you to preview color sepa-
rations on your screen. If you frequently use custom settings
to send an InDesign document to a local printer or commer-
cial printer for printing, you can save time by creating a pre-
set. Before you print your document, it’s important to check
the Summary category in the Print dialog box. The summary
information is good to check if you’re having problems print-
ing your job at a commercial printer. 
When you print a document with spreads (for example, as
a booklet), the pages need to be arranged as imposing pages,
also known as printer’s spreads. For example, page one of a
4 page project is paired with page four while page two and
page three are paired together. You can arrange your docu-
ment into imposing pages by using the Print Booklet com-
mand on the File menu.
Before you print or send your document to a commercial
printer or service provider, you can should check your docu-
ment for errors. Catching errors before you send out a print
job can save you time and lower production costs. You can
use live preflighting in the Preflight panel to catch errors,
such as missing files or fonts, low-resolution images, and
overset text. When you’re ready to send a document, you can
create a package file, which gathers together all the files
related to your document, including linked graphics and
fonts, to make it easy to deliver.

The Print command is probably the most used of all InDesign's print
options. The Print command is a portal to other menus that let you con-
trol specific printing functions, such as crop marks and bleeds, output
ink, graphics, and color management. Understand that the options
available for the Print command will be partially determined by your
default printer. For example, if your default printer uses more than one
paper tray, you will see options for selecting a specific tray for the cur-
rent print job. In spite of the differences, there are some universal
options for all print jobs, and these are covered here.

The Marks and Bleed category in the Print dialog box allows you to
select printer’s marks and create a bleed. Printer’s marks appear at the
edge of the printable page. Commercial printers use printer’s marks to
trim the paper, registration marks to align printing plates, and color bars
to print colors properly. Bleed is the amount of the document that
appears outside of the printing area, which includes the bounding box
and trim marks. The bleed is useful to give you a margin of error. Having
a bleed ensures that ink is printed all the way to the edge of the page
so there are no gaps between the page and the edge of the trimmed
document page. Your commercial printer can advise you on the best
bleed settings based on your print job.

Catching errors before you send out a print or digital job can save you
time and lower production costs. Instead of using an external program,
you can use live preflighting in the Preflight panel to catch errors, such
as missing files or fonts, low-resolution images, and overset text. You

one of your own to catch the type of errors you want. If you create your
own, you can embed the profile into your document for use on other

When you save a document, you have the ability to save more than just
InDesign information. You can save title, author, keywords, copyright,
contact, and even image category information. This data is saved with
the file as metadata in the XMP format (Extensible Metadata Platform) in
InDesign files, and can be recognized and accessed by any application,
such as Adobe Bridge, that reads XMP metadata. In addition, if an
image is a photograph, you can save data specifying the type of image,
where it was shot, the camera used, GPS data (New!), and IPTC
(International Press Telecommunications Council) core and extension
(New!) metadata. You can even get information on shutter speed and f-
stop. You can do the same with video and audio data. That information
will not only protect your intellectual property, but will supply you with
vital statistics on exactly how you created that one-of-a-kind document.

Did You Know?
You can add metadata to files saved in
the PSD, PDF, EPS, PNG, GIF, JPEG,
and TIFF formats. The information is
embedded in the file using XMP
(Extensible Metadata Platform). This
allows metadata to be exchanged
between Adobe applications and
across operating systems. 
You can use the XMP Software
Development Kit to customize the 
creation, processing, and interchange
of metadata. You can also use the XMP
kit to add fields to the File Info dialog
box. For information on XMP and the
XMP SDK, check the Adobe Solutions
Network.

A package file gathers all the files related to your document or book,
including linked graphics and fonts, to make it easy to deliver to a
printer or service provider. During the packaging process, you can dis-
play any problems, so you can fix them before you continue. When you
create a package, you create a folder that contains your document,
linked graphics and InDesign content (New!), text files, any fonts (in a
Document Fonts subfolder), and a customized report. Externally linked
InDesign content will not show missing links, but it may or may not be
updated. The report includes information about all the files in the pack-
age and any printer instructions required to print your document.

A document font is a font that is only available in an open InDesign doc-
ument. Document fonts are any fonts in a Document Fonts folder located
in the same location as an InDesign document. When the InDesign doc-
ument is open, the fonts are used and available; they appear in the Font
submenu. When you close the document, the fonts are not available.
Fonts used by one document are not available to other documents
unless the documents are in the same folder. Document fonts are not
the same as the fonts available from your operating system. They are
separate, yet displayed together in InDesign when the document is
open. If there is a system font with the same name as a document font,
the document font is used in its place. When you package an InDesign
document, you create a Document Fonts folder with any necessary fonts
for use with the document on another computer.

What You’ll Do

Customizing the Way 
You Work
Introduction
No description of Adobe InDesign would be complete with-
out that well-known, but little utilized area called Preferences.
InDesign preferences serve several purposes. They help cus-
tomize the program to your particular designing style, and
they help you utilize available computer resources to
increase the overall performance of the program. 
As you use InDesign, you'll come to realize the impor-
tance of working with units and rulers. Precision is the name
of the game when you are working with graphic designs and
text. What about the color of your guides and grids? No big
deal, you say. Well, if you've ever tried viewing a blue guide
against predominantly blue artwork, you know exactly why
guide color is important. By setting your own preferences,
such as Display Performance, you can increase speed by up
to 20%. 
In addition, customizing the program helps make you
more comfortable, and studies show that the more comfort-
able you are as a designer, the better your designs. Plus,
being comfortable allows you to work faster, and that means
you'll accomplish more in the same amount of time. What
does setting up preferences do for you? They make InDesign
run faster, you work more efficiently, and your designs are
better. That's a pretty good combination. InDesign doesn't
give you Preferences to confuse you, but to give you choices,
and those choices give you control.

InDesign's General preferences help you configure some of the more
general features of the program. Some of the options include how to
implement page numbering, font downloading and embedding, and text
scaling. You can also enable or disable the use of JavaScript in your
document. Disabling JavaScript can protect your computer from harm-
ful security threats. Enable it only when you know the script is safe. You
can also click the Reset All Warning Dialogs to allow warnings for
which you previously selected the Don’t Show Again check box.

InDesign is by definition a typesetting application, so it contains some
powerful type features. Instead of manually threading text from text
frame to text frame, you can let InDesign add or remove pages automati-
cally when you type text or change your text flow. InDesign allows you to
set options to customize the way you display, select, and drag-and-drop
text. The Type menu lets you quickly access recently used fonts at the
top of the font list (New!) and see fonts exactly as they will print or dis-
play. For designers who use a lot of fonts, this WYSIWYG (What You See
Is What You Get) font menu is a big timesaver. You can use Type prefer-
ences to help you select the type and font options you want to use.

options for superscript, subscript and small caps, and specify the lan-

can set size and position values to control the size and position above
or below the baseline of characters. Latin typefaces, such as English,
French, and Spanish, use a different character structure than other
non-latin languages, such as Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. If you
want to use a non-Latin language, you need to enable an option to use

Units & Increments preferences allow you to set ruler measurement
units, text size and stroke measurement units, the number of points per
inch, and the amount that keyboard shortcuts change text. When you
use a ruler in a document, InDesign uses the settings in the Ruler Units
section to display the ruler with the measurement system and origin
you want. You can also set the number of points per inch. Typically this
is set to PostScript (72 pts/inch). This is the recommended setting
unless a commercial printer asks you to change it. When you change
text, such as size/leading, baseline shift, or kerning/tracking using key-
board shortcuts, you can specify the amounts you want to apply for
each keystroke.

The Story Editor is a separate window that only displays the text in your
document. This is helpful when you want to focus just on the text and
not on any of the other elements in your document. Story Editor Display
preferences allow you to set text and background display options for
the Story Editor window. You can specify the display font, font size, line
spacing, text color, background or theme, and cursor or insertion point,
style. A theme is a preset background and text color. If you want to dis-
play smoother text, you can enable the anti-aliasing option and select
the type of anti-aliasing that best works for you. If the insertion point
cursor is hard to see in the Story Editor, you can select cursor options
to make it easier to see.

When you copy and paste information into an InDesign document, the
information is temporarily stored on the Clipboard until something else
replaces it. Copying and pasting information from other programs is an
important part of creating an InDesign document, so InDesign allows
you to set Clipboard preferences. Clipboard preferences allow you to
specify how you want information to be pasted into a document. For
example, you can have graphics or data pasted into a document as a
PDF file, or paste text and tables from other programs with or without
formatting.

A wise man once wrote "time is money," and InDesign is a program that
can consume a lot of time. That's why the InDesign application uses
keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard Shortcuts, as their name implies, let you
perform tasks in a shorter period of time. For example, if you want to
open a new document in InDesign, you can click the File menu, and
then click New, or you can abandon the mouse and press Ctrl+N (Win)
or  A+N (Mac) to use shortcut keys. Using shortcut keys reduces the
use of the mouse and speeds up operations. InDesign raises the bar by
not only giving you hundreds of possible shortcut keys, but also actu-
ally allowing you to define your own shortcuts. In fact, you can select
options to create shortcuts for menus, panels, tools, and object editing,
such as scaling and sizing objects. In addition to adding shortcuts, you
can delete any of them you don't want and even print out a summary of
shortcuts defined in InDesign.

Plug-ins are external programs, also known as extensions, that provide
additional functionality for the program. InDesign uses plug-ins to per-
form standard operations in the program. If you want to add more func-
tionality, you can download and install a plug-in. InDesign uses Adobe
Extension Manager CS6 (New!) to help you work with plug-ins and
extensions for InDesign and other Adobe CS programs. Extension
Manager is automatically installed when you install InDesign and other
Adobe CS programs. You can use Extension Manager to access the
Adobe Exchange site, where you can locate, research, and download
many different types of extensions. Some are free and some are not.
With Extension Manager, you can search and filter (New!), enable, dis-
able, remove, and install—for all users or only the current user—exten-
sions using the ZXP file format (still compatible with MXP). ZXP is an
Adobe Zip Format Extension Package file. You can also create, edit, acti-
vate, import, and export extension sets for better management (New!).
Extension Manager can recognize dependency between different exten-
sions and employs the information when using them (New!).

Collaborating with Others
Introduction
InDesign allows you to collaborate with others using several
different program features. You can add notes to a document
to make comments, track changes to review document con-
tent or text, or use Adobe InCopy to manage content devel-
opment.
When you work with more than one person on a docu-
ment, it’s important to communicate changes and other 
information with each other. Notes are a great way to com-
municate and record the notes along with the document.
With the Notes panel, you can create and manage notes in a
document for others to read and respond.
With Track Changes, you can manage and view the
changes made to text in your document. With the Track
Changes panel (InDesign) or the Track Changes toolbar
(InCopy), you can turn Track Changes on and off in the cur-
rent story or all stories, and show, hide, accept and reject
changes in your document. 
Adobe InCopy is a stand-alone writing and editing pro-
gram that allows you to work seamlessly with Adobe
InDesign. The integration with InCopy allows InDesign users
to select text and graphics in a document, and then assign
the content to InCopy users for writing and editing. Exporting
content from InDesign allows you to make content available
to InCopy users to check out and change while still maintain-
ing a link back to the original document. The Assignments
panel is a centralized place to work with content assignment
in InDesign. You can quickly identify the assigned user,
update content, check out content, create new assignments,
and delete assignments. 19

When you work with more than one person on a document, it’s impor-
tant to communicate changes and other information with each other.
Notes are a great way to communicate with others and record the
notes along with the document. You can add inline notes in text and
tables to collaborate more effectively. Notes are linked to specific loca-
tions in text and tables. When you create a note with the Notes tool on
the Tools panel, you type text directly in the Notes panel. In the Notes
panel, you can show and hide notes, go to the note anchor in the docu-
ment, browse notes, create notes, and delete notes. The top of the
Notes panel displays information about the active note, including
author name, created date, modified date, story location, page number,
and the number of characters and words in the note.

you can turn Track Changes on and off in the current story or all sto-
ries, and show, hide, accept and reject changes—such as deleting text,
moving text, and inserting text—in your document. Before you start
track changes, it’s important to specify what you want to track and how
and where you want to track it in Track Changes preferences. You can

Adobe InCopy is a stand-alone writing and
editing program that allows you to work
seamlessly with Adobe InDesign. The integra-
tion with InCopy allows InDesign users to
select text and graphics in a document, and
then assign the content to InCopy users for
writing and editing. Content designates either
a body of text that flows through one or
more frames or an imported graphic.
InCopy users can open an assignment file
with only the material assigned to them and
then make changes to it. An assignment file
is a container that stores a piece of content
from an InDesign document and other related
file-locking and notification tools. You can
share assignment files on a server for easy
access or through assignment packages. 
InCopy uses live layout view to display
how the content changes affect the InDesign
document. Multiple InCopy or InDesign users
can open the same content file at the same
time as a read-only file. However, only one
user can check out the content file to make
changes. You can open a content file by open-
ing an assignment file, assignment package,
linked InCopy file, or InDesign file with linked
content. An assignment package is a com-
pressed version of an assignment file. If
users don’t have access to a common net-
work server, you can can create assignment
packages and then send them to the assigned
user as an e-mail attachment. The assigned
user can open the assignment package, make
changes, and then return it. If an assigned
user is done with the update or you no
longer want the user to make changes, you
can unlink or cancel the assignment.
Working Together on a Local Server
In InDesign, create assignments and add
content to them.
Save the assignment files for InCopy
users on a local server.
In InCopy, open the assignment file, and
check out and edit the content. When you
finish, check in the content.
In InDesign, while the content is checked
out, you can still make changes to the
rest of the InDesign document. When the
content file is checked back in, you can
make changes to the content. 
In InCopy, open the assignment file,
check out, and edit a story or graphic.
Exporting content from InDesign allows
you to make content available to InCopy
users to check out and change while still
maintaining a link back to the original docu-
ment. You can export content from an
InDesign document to InCopy by creating an
assignment file, or by exporting text and
graphics frames separately as files. After you
export content to InCopy, the file is called a
managed file. Icons appear at the top left of
the exported frames in InDesign and InCopy,
and in the Assignments panel to indicate the
content is currently assigned to another per-
son. A link to the exported file also appears
in the Links panel.

unique identification name. You can specify or change a unique user
Identification name and select a linked color by using the User com-
mand on the File menu or the Options menu on the Assignments panel.

document to InCopy by creating an assignment file (ICMA for CS6), or
by exporting text and graphics frames separately as files (ICML for CS6)
using one of the Export commands for InCopy. When you use one of the
Export commands, the managed file is unassigned, which you can
change later. Icons appear at the top left of the exported frame in
InDesign and InCopy, and in the Assignments panel to indicate the con-
tent is currently assigned to another person for changes. A link to the
exported file also appears in the Links panel.

You can create an assignment file several ways. One is to create an
empty assignment file and add content to it later. Another is to create
an assignment and add content at the same time. The last way is to add
content to an existing assignment. When you create an assignment, a
folder is created in the same location as the InDesign document file in
order to store the assignment files (ICMA) and any exported InCopy
story files (ICML). After you create an assignment, you can move the
folder into a location where all users have access to it or create and

Anyone can open an assignment file for review. However, only one user
at a time can open and edit the file. Before you can open and edit an
assignment file, the content needs to be checked out. This prevents
two users from accidentally editing the same file at the same time.
When you check out a file, a hidden lock file (IDLK) is attached to the
file on your computer. Once the file is locked, no one else can access it.
The user who checked out the file has exclusive use of it until the file is
checked in, even if you exit the program and come back later. You can
make changes to an assignment file (INCA) in InCopy or in the InDesign
document (INDD) that contains the assigned content. In this case, I’m
focusing on InCopy. The same commands are available in InDesign on
the InCopy submenu on the Edit menu.

Working Together with
Adobe Programs
Introduction
Adobe programs are designed to work together so you can
focus on what you need to do, rather than on how to do it. In
fact, the Adobe programs share tools and features for your
most common tasks so you can work uninterrupted and
move seamlessly from one program to another. Adobe
Creative Suite is an integrated collection of programs that
work together to help you create designs in print, on the
web, or on mobile devices. When you install Adobe Creative
Suite or a stand-alone Adobe program, you also get addi-
tional Adobe programs and services—Bridge, Camera Raw
plug-in, Media Encoder, Extension Manager, and ExtendScript
Toolkit—to help you perform specific jobs, such as locating,
downloading, and modifying images for projects, managing
files and program extensions, testing files for different
mobile devices, and creating scripts.
Adobe Bridge is a program that lets you view, open, mod-
ify, and manage images located on your computer from any
Adobe Creative Suite program. Adobe Bridge is literally the
glue that binds Adobe Creative Suite programs together into
one cohesive unit with shared tools. Bridge allows you to
search, sort, filter, manage, and process image files one at a
time or in batches. You can also use Bridge to do the follow-
ing: create new folders; rename, move, delete and group
files; edit metadata; rotate images; create web galleries and
contact sheets; and run batch commands. You can also
import files from your digital camera and view file informa-
tion and metadata.

Adobe Creative Suite
Adobe Creative Suite is an integrated collec-
tion of programs that work together to help
you create designs in print, on the web, or on
mobile devices. Adobe's Creative Suite comes
in different editions with different combina-
tions of Adobe programs. The main programs
for print design include InDesign and Acrobat
Professional; for graphic design the programs
include Photoshop, Illustrator, and Fireworks;
for video and sound design the programs
include Premiere Professional, After Effects
Professional, Encore, and Soundbooth; and
for web design the programs include Flash
Professional, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and
Contribute.
Working Together with Adobe
Programs
When you install Adobe Creative Suite or a
stand-alone Adobe program, you also get
additional Adobe programs—Bridge, Camera
Raw plug-in, Media Encoder, Extension
Manager, and ExtendScript Toolkit—to help
you perform specific jobs such as managing
files and program extensions and testing files
for mobile devices.
Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge is a file management/batching
program that manages and processes images
while you work. To use Bridge, click Browse in
Bridge on the File menu or the Go to Bridge
button on the Applications bar within an
Adobe CS product or from the desktop use
the Start menu (Win) or the App folder (Mac).
Camera Raw Plug-In
The Camera Raw plug-in—available in Adobe
Bridge, Adobe Photoshop, and other Adobe
programs—allows you to open and process
with fine control RAW image formats (not
processed, also known as digital negatives)
produced by digital cameras. Raw image for-
mats are intended to capture as closely as
possible the characteristics of the picture.
DNG (Digital NeGative) is a raw format
developed by Adobe.
Adobe Media Encoder
Adobe Media Encoder allows you to encode
and compress video and audio files and con-
vert them to distribution formats: F4V, FLV,
H.264, and MP3. You can select a format and
preset for systems—such as high-definition
(HD), desktops, and the web (Flash, Vimeo,
and YouTube)—and devices—such as Apple
TV, iPad, iPhone, and Android. The presets
include: size, bitrate (data rate), and frames
per second (fps) rate. 
Adobe Extension Manager
Adobe Extension Manager allows you to
install and delete added program functional-
ity, known as extensions, to many Adobe
programs. The Extension Manager is auto-
matically installed when you install InDesign,
Flash Professional, Dreamweaver, or
Fireworks. You can use the Extension
Manager to access the Adobe Exchange site,
where you can locate, research, and down-
load many different types of extensions for
use in Adobe programs.
Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit
Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit allows you to cre-
ate, edit, and debug an extended version of
JavaScript, called ExtendScript, to be used
for scripting Adobe programs. If you perform
the same set of tasks on a regular basis, you
can use scripting as a powerful tool to make
a lengthy set of tasks simple.

Adobe Bridge CS6 (New!) is a stand-alone program that lets you view,
open, and manage images located on your computer from any Adobe
Creative Suite program. Adobe Bridge is literally the glue that binds
Adobe Creative Suite programs and shared tools together into one cohe-
sive unit. The Bridge program provides a set of panels that make it easy
to find, view, and manage the files on your computer or network. As you
work with Bridge, you'll open, close, and move (dock and undock) the
panels to meet your individual needs. After you customize the work-
space, you can save the location of the panels as a custom workspace,
which you can display using the Workspace command on the Window
menu. Bridge also provides some predefined workspaces.

Raw image file formats are created by most mid- to high-end digital
cameras and contain information about how the image was taken. The
raw format turns off all camera adjustments, and simply saves the image
information. Using the raw format is as close to using traditional film as
a digital camera can get. Raw images are larger; however, the increase
in file size gives you more information that can be used by Camera Raw
to adjust the image. Camera Raw is installed along with an Adobe CS
program as a plug-in. Before you get started with Camera Raw, you can
set preferences to apply default image options and specify how you
want to open and work with work with DNG (Digital Negative), JPEG,
and TIFF images.

From Adobe Bridge, you can use Camera Raw to open raw files (exten-
sions differ based on the digital camera), JPEG, and TIFF files to make
image touch-ups and enhancements. For example, you can have a
poorly take image, and then use the Basic settings to automatically or
manually enhance image exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, clar-
ity, and vibrance. If you're not sure what to do, you can click Auto to
have Camera Raw do it or drag sliders to adjust options manually. You
can adjust color tones (Hue, Saturation, and Luminance or grayscale),
reduce luminance and color noise, add grain, add sharpening, correct
for lens defects, add post-crop vignetting and effects, and retouch
images with the Heal, Clone and Red Eye tools. In addition, raw images
can be converted into 16-bit mode, which provides more control over
adjustments such as tonal and color correction. Once processed, raw
images can be saved in the DNG (Digital Negative), TIFF, PSD, or JPEG
formats. After you make Camera Raw adjustments, you can save the
settings so you can use them later. All changes made to raw images are
non-destructive, meaning only the metadata is changed to make differ-
ent versions, leaving the original data unchanged.

What is the DNG File Format?
The DNG, or Digital Negative, format is an openly published raw file
format from Adobe that stores "raw" pixel data captured by digital
cameras before it has been converted to another format, such as
TIFF or JPEG. In addition, it captures standard ‘EXIF’ metadata, such
as date, time, camera used, and camera settings. Saving raw files in
the DNG format provides several advantages. DNG files are smaller
than uncompressed TIFFs, and they do not have the artifacts of com-
pressed JPEGs. Many key camera parameters, such as white bal-
ance, can be modified even after the image is captured. You have
access to 16-bit data for greater detail and fidelity, and the added
flexibility of converting a single file using multiple conversion set-
tings. When you convert raw images into the DNG format, you are
using a format that is openly published by Adobe and usable by other
software and hardware vendors, which makes it a safe format for
the long-term storage and archiving of digital images. The raw for-
mat used by digital cameras is proprietary to the specific camera
(e.g., NEF for Nikon, CR2 for Canon, RAF for Fuji), so the format might
not be supported once that camera and its proprietary software is
obsolete, which means at some point in the future, you might not be
able to open any of your archived raw images. The DNG format
solves that problem. To get a free copy of the DNG converter, go to
www.adobe.com and then search for DNG converter.

What is Metadata?
Metadata is information about an image file, such as its author,
copyright, creation date, size, version, color space, resolution, and
searchable keywords. This data is stored in the file or in a separate
file known as a sidecar file, using a standard format called
Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP). Bridge uses XMP files to help
you organize and search for files on your computer. Metadata is also
stored in other formats, such as EXIF (digital camera data), IPTC
(photographer and image data), GPS (global positioning system
data), and TIFF, which are all synchronized with XMP.

Adobe Bridge makes it easy to make adjustments to one image in
Camera Raw and then apply those adjustments to other images directly
from Bridge without going back into Camera Raw. For instance, you
may be correcting the white balance for an image and have many other
images that were shot at the same time, under the same lighting condi-
tions. You can use the initial settings to correct the rest of your images
right from Bridge. You can also make a preset from your favorite adjust-
ments, which will then be available as a develop setting within Bridge.

Adobe Bridge takes the drudgery out of creating a Web Photo Gallery
(thumbnail images on web pages). The pages generated with this com-
mand display small thumbnails of a group of images—when you click
on an image, a larger version is displayed within another window or
section of the page. If your goal is to show the world your photographs,
but you don't want to write all the HTML code involved in making that
happen, then the Web Photo Gallery is just what you need.

Adobe Media Encoder CS6 (New!) is a program you can use to encode
and compress video and audio files and convert them to a variety of dis-
tribution formats: F4V, FLV, H.264, and MP3. With the Preset Browser
(New!), you can select a format and preset for systems—such as high-
definition (HD), desktops and the web (Flash, Vimeo, and YouTube)—and
devices—such as Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, and Android. The presets
include: size, bitrate (data rate), and frames per second (fps) rate. When
you export a movie for playback on a specific type of device at a certain
bandwidth, you select an encoder (codec). Each encoder has a corre-
sponding decoder that decompresses and interprets the data for play-
back. You can batch process multiple media files to expedite the
workflow process. For example, you can add, reorder, and change the
encoding settings of files in the batch processing queue while Media
Encoder encodes other files. You can also use the Watch folder to help
you automate the process. It’s a folder you add to the Watch folder list
that automatically encodes any files you place in it.

Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit CS6 (New!) is a program you can use to
create and test scripts to control and automate features in many Adobe
Create Suite programs. If you perform the same set of tasks on a regu-
lar basis, you can use scripting as a powerful tool to make a lengthy set
of tasks simple. A script is a series of statements in a language—an
extended version of JavaScript, called ExtendScript—that tells a pro-
gram what to do. For example, you can write a script to open an image
in Photoshop, make some enhancements, and then insert the image
into an InDesign document. If you’re new to scripting, take a look at the
Adobe Intro To Scripting document, which you can open from the Help
menu. You can also use the Scripts panel to access favorite and sam-
ple scripts by target program. You can open the script, modify it, save it,
and run it within the target program. Another option is the search the
web for ExtendScript sample scripts. ExtendScript programs and
scripts end with the extension JSX. A normal JavaScript file ends with
the extension JS.
Scripting with Adobe

The Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) program is for graphic designers, Web designers,
systems integrators, value-added resellers, developers, and business professionals

What Is an ACE?
An Adobe Certified Expert is an individual who has passed an Adobe Product Profi-
ciency Exam for a specific Adobe software product. Adobe Certified Experts are eli-
gible to promote themselves to clients or employers as highly skilled, expert-level

excellence in Adobe software knowledge. There are three levels of ACE certification:
Single product certification, Specialist certification, and Master certification. To
become an ACE, you must pass one or more product-specific proficiency exams and
sign the ACE program agreement. When you become an ACE, you enjoy these spe-
cial benefits:

Choosing a Certification Level
There are three levels of certification to become an Adobe Certified Expert. 
◆
Single product certification. Recognizes your proficiency in a single Adobe
product. To qualify as an ACE, you must pass one product-specific exam. 
◆
Specialist certification. Recognizes your proficiency in multiple Adobe products
with a specific medium: print, Web, or video. To become certified as a Specialist,
you must pass the exams on the required products. To review the requirements,
go online to http://www.adobe.com/support/certification/ace_certify.html.
◆
Master certification. Recognizes your skills in terms of how they align with the
Adobe product suites. To become certified as a Master, you must pass the exam
for each of the products in the suite. 
Preparing for an Adobe Certified Expert Exam
Every Adobe Certified Expert Exam is developed from a list of objectives, which are
based on studies of how an Adobe program is actually used in the workplace. The
list of objectives determine the scope of each exam, so they provide you with the
information you need to prepare for ACE certification. Follow these steps to com-
plete the ACE Exam requirement: 
Review and perform each task identified with a Adobe Certified Expert objective
to confirm that you can meet the requirements for the exam. 
Identify the topic areas and objectives you need to study, and then prepare for
the exam.

Taking an Adobe Certified Expert Exam
The Adobe Certified Expert exams are computer-delivered, closed-book tests con-
sisting of 60 to 90 multiple-choice questions. Each exam is approximately one to
two hours long. A 15-minute tutorial will precede the test to familiarize you with the
function of the Windows-based driver. The exams are currently available worldwide
in English only. They are administered by Pearson VUE and Thomson Prometric,
independent third-party testing companies. 
Exam Results
At the end of the exam, a score report appears indicating whether you passed or failed
the exam. Diagnostic information is included in your exam report. When you pass
the exam, your score is electronically reported to Adobe. You will then be sent an
ACE Welcome Kit and access to the ACE program logo in four to six weeks. You are
also placed on the Adobe certification mailing list to receive special Adobe
announcements and information about promotions and events that take place
throughout the year.
When you pass the exam, you can get program information, check and update your
profile, or download ACE program logos for your promotional materials online at:
