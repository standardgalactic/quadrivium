Acknowledgments
Wiley Publishing, Inc. gratefully acknowledges the contributions of these authors
and contributing writers: Mark L. Chambers, Tony Bove, David D. Busch, Martin
Doucette, David Kushner, Andy Rathbone, Cheryl Rhodes, Todd Staufer, and Keith
Underdahl.
We would like to thank Mark Chambers for editing this book, Kim Darosett and
John Edwards for copy editing it, and Nicole Sholly for serving as project editor.
Thanks as well go to Keith Underdahl for his technical edits, Joan Griffitts for her
index, and Rich Tennant for the witty cartoons you will find in this book. Thanks
are also due to the many page layout technicians, graphic artists, proofreaders,
and others in Compositions Services who worked to bring this book to fruition.
From Mark Chambers: When I was asked by Wiley to take on this project, I had no
idea of the truly epic proportions of a Gigabook — sure, I’ve written several books
of 700 to 800 pages, but nothing had prepared me for the sheer number of chapters
and the organization involved in this project. Without the help and support of a
large number of folks, I would never have been able to meld together several For
Dummies books into one comprehensive, cohesive whole! It’s time I thank everyone
involved.
As with all my books, I’d like to first thank my wife, Anne, and my children, Erin,
Chelsea, and Rose, for their support and love — and for letting me follow my dream!
The Wiley Production team is the best in the business — hands down — and I
applaud the work of project coordinator Adrienne Martinez. Again, the Composition
Services team took the raw material I provided and prepared the beautifully-finished
work of publishing art you hold in your hands. Thanks to each of the team members
for yet another job well-done.
Next, I owe a debt of gratitude to my editorial manager, Kevin Kirschner, my copy
editors, Kim Darosett and John Edwards, and my technical editor, Keith Underdahl.
All of these folks worked together to check the technical accuracy of every word,
investigate every silly acronym and straighten out my logical mishaps — ensuring
that my work is the best it can be.
Finally, I send my appreciation across the pages to my acquisitions editor, Tiffany
Franklin, and my project editor, Nicole Sholly — two wonderful, hard-working indi-
viduals who decided (yet again) to add me to their team! The two of them provided
all the help and support any technology author could ask for . . . even with a book
so large that I often wondered if any bookstore had a shelf that would be strong
enough to bear all this weight. Thanks to both of you for yet another chance to put
pen to paper — well, actually, fingers to keyboard!

Introduction
L
ife used to be so simple.
In the old days — that’s 1983 for you computing youngsters — data came
on disks. Just plain disks. There were two kinds of floppy disks (high den-
sity and low density), and you couldn’t afford a hard disk subsystem for
your TRS-80 Model III or your Atari 800, so why even worry about it? And
data? Data was data . . . files and programs. That was it. Life was simple,
and everyone was happy.
Just look at us now: We’ve got digital audio, and digital video, and digital
photographs. Heck, we’ve even still got good old-fashioned files and pro-
grams to contend with as well. And who knows what all these different
fancy formats are stored on? Is it a hard drive, or a USB flash drive, or a
memory card, or a CD-ROM, or a DVD-ROM? From what my friends tell me,
this stuff can even be stored on the Internet and retrieved online!
Fellow computer owners, this is a book with a purpose . . . a book that was
specifically written to answer your questions on all forms of digital media.
Whether you watch it, listen to it, load it, open it, burn it, or download it,
this book will explain what you can do with your data and your digital
media. And it doesn’t matter whether you have a PC running Windows or
a Macintosh running Mac OS X — I’ve got ’em both, and this technology
author doesn’t play favorites.
What’s in This Book, Anyway?
As if the size of this book and the Table of Contents doesn’t give away the
secret, this one volume is really four different books — but my editors
believe in convenience. (I hope you don’t strain your back lifting it.)
Anyway, I’ve tried to squeeze every last tip, shortcut, step-by-step, and
personal recommendation I could fit between these covers.
Although you can certainly read this majestic tome from cover to cover in
a linear fashion, it’s really not meant to be consumed like a novel. (Here’s a
spoiler — Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both did it.) Instead, this Gigabook is a
reference book, organized to make it easy for you to solve problems, read
about new technology, and apply what you’ve learned to your computer.
Here’s a quick rundown on the four minibooks that make up the Digital
Photos, Movies, & Music Gigabook For Dummies:
✦Book I: Digital Photography: This is a guide to the entire spectrum of
digital photography. Sure, you find out about your camera and how to
download your photos — any book on this topic will tell you that — but
this minibook delves into serious amateur and professional Digital
Photography, including lighting, composition, studio and on-site work,
and sports and portrait photography. Plus, I demonstrate how to
restore and improve your photos and scanned images by using Adobe
Photoshop Elements.
1

What Makes This Book Special
✦Book II: Digital Movies: Analog video is fast disappearing from the
face of the planet, and this minibook introduces you to the new king,
digital video. Here you discover what to look for in a DV camcorder,
and I provide tips and tricks to help you use today’s digital-video-editing
software — both the low end (iMovie) and the high end (Adobe Premiere
Pro). If you’ve always dreamed of handling a camcorder like a true film-
maker, you’ll flip over the chapters on storyboarding, lighting, and
post-production.
✦Book III: Digital Music: I’ll be honest — separate me from my iPod
portable jukebox for too long and I get . . . well, rather cross. If you love
music like I do, you won’t be disappointed with this comprehensive
minibook on digital audio. It covers portable players, computers, and
streaming Internet radio, and even includes instructions on connecting
your computer to your home stereo system. Separate chapters on the
latest versions of iTunes, Winamp, and Musicmatch Jukebox keep the
jams flowing. (And yes, I lead you step by step through the process of
setting up your own Internet streaming radio station. You know you
want to.)
✦Book IV: CD & DVD Recording: Finally, I wrap things up with a mini-
book on a topic that crosses all the previous three minibooks: recording
all these great images, films, and songs onto CDs and DVDs so that you
can enjoy them for the next 100 years or so! Talk about comprehensive:
Burn DVD-Video, audio CDs, MP3 discs, digital photo albums, and more.
What Makes This Book Special
So why is this book so different? Besides its sheer size and scope, my edi-
tors have designed it to be a breed apart from other books that cover digi-
tal audio, video, images, and optical recording. Read on to see why.
Information that’s easy to find
If you’re like me, you reach for a reference book to find a specific piece of
information or a specific procedure, and you want that information fast.
That’s why both the authors and editors responsible for this book have
worked overtime to make sure that everything between these covers is
well organized and answers the questions you’re likely to ask, quickly and
concisely.
Specifically, I like bulleted and numbered lists, lots of tables, and headings
that immediately communicate what’s covered in a section. Sure, you’ll find
humor here too — after all, today’s digital art, both visual and audible, is all
about entertainment — but the humor never gets in the way of the informa-
tion you need. (Believe me, my editors wouldn’t let that happen.)
A task-oriented approach
Oh, and don’t forget the step-by-step, hands-on approach that has made the
For Dummies series so popular over the years! Instead of just describing
2

Foolish Assumptions
software, most of the chapters in this book show you how to do something —
burn a disc, set up a portrait studio in your garage, or export a finished
movie for distribution on your Web site. You came to the right place if you
like to get things done.
The author’s opinion
Oh, one more thing: I wouldn’t write a book if I wasn’t allowed to speak
my mind and recommend what I think is best in the world of computers.
(I steer you clear of the worst, too.) In fact, all the authors of the material
in this book pull no punches — these experts give you the benefit of their
experience and the recommendations that readers expect from a For
Dummies book.
A Greatest Hits Collection
The material in this book was culled from nine For Dummies books pub-
lished by Wiley. You can think of this book as a kind of greatest hits collec-
tion of computer books about digital media. If you stumble upon a topic in
this book that intrigues you and you want to know more about it, I suggest
looking into one of the nine books from which this book was created:
✦Digital Photography All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by David D.
Busch
✦iMovie 2 For Dummies, by Todd Stauffer
✦Adobe Premiere Pro For Dummies, by Keith Underdahl
✦Digital Video For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Martin Doucette
✦Digital Video For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Keith Underdahl
✦MP3 For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Andy Rathbone
✦iPod & iTunes For Dummies, by Tony Boves and Cheryl Rhodes
✦Music Online For Dummies, by David Kushner
✦CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Mark L. Chambers 
Foolish Assumptions
Please forgive me, but I made two foolish assumptions about you, the reader
of this book. I assumed that
✦You have a PC or Macintosh computer.
✦You’re reasonably familiar with your operating system, whether it be
the latest flavor of King Windows or one of the “big cats” that lend their
names to Mac OS X.
Believe it or not, that’s the whole list — this book assumes nothing else
about your level of hardware or software experience. After all, computers
are supposed to be getting easier to use, right?

Conventions Used in This Book
Conventions Used in This Book
This is a hands-on book, and the procedures you encounter sometimes
require techno-verbiage and typed commands. Therefore, I’ve adopted a
few conventions.
To show you how to step through command sequences, I use the ➪symbol.
For example, you can choose File➪Save to save a file. The ➪is just a short-
hand method of saying, “From the File menu, choose Save.”
Where you see boldface letters or numbers in this book, it means to type
the letters or numbers. For example, “Enter 25 in the Margin text box” means
to do exactly that: “Enter the number 25.”
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get the most out of this book, I’ve placed icons here and there.
Here’s what the icons mean:
Next to the Tip icon, you can find shortcuts and tricks of the trade to make
your visit to the digital world more enjoyable.
Where you see the Warning icon, tread softly and carefully. It means that
you are about to do something that you may regret later.
When I explain a juicy little fact that bears remembering, I mark it with a
Remember icon. When you see this icon, you’ll discover something that
you need to remember throughout your computer adventures.
When I am forced to describe high-tech stuff, a Technical Stuff icon appears
in the margin. You don’t have to read what’s beside the Technical Stuff icons
if you don’t want to, although these technical descriptions often help you
understand how a software or hardware feature works.
If you had a highlighter handy, you’d likely pick this stuff to underline.
My maxims are tips and recommendations that you should commit to
memory — they’ll save you money, time, and effort. (This way, you won’t
make the mistakes the rest of us have already made.)

Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Chapter 1: Becoming a Digital
Photography Maven
In This Chapter
 Choosing equipment
 Making great digital photos
 Converting other photos to digital format
 Making hard-copy prints
“I
s digital photography all that different from film photography?” I hear
that question all the time, and there’s a definitive answer: yes and no.
(So much for absolutes.)
Perhaps I should explain: The equipment you’ll use and the procedures
you’ll follow in digital photography are indeed very different from your ven-
erable 35mm camera. Forget film and traditional film processing — and, if
you’re a photographer with experience in the darkroom, you can also cast
off all those chemicals. If you have an inkjet or laser color printer, you can
produce all the prints you need right from your computer. Plus, you can use
an image editor like Photoshop Elements or Paint Shop Pro to modify your
images and repair problems, or add all sorts of artistic effects.
On the other hand, digital cameras look and operate very much like their
film cousins, and they share many of the same accessories: lenses, flash
units, tripods, and the like. The basic rules of photo composition are the
same no matter which kind of camera you’re using, and you’ll find that you
still need to plan ahead when buying supplies and outfitting your camera
bag for a trip.
In this chapter, I outline the guidelines you should follow to reach that
hallowed summit we all crave — the title of Serious Digital Photographer!
Knowing What Equipment You Need
I realize that not all of you are curled up with this book in one hand and
a digital camera in the other. You may already have a digital camera and
have just purchased this book to find out exactly what you can do with it.
However, I’m guessing that quite a few of you haven’t taken the plunge yet.
You bought this book to find out more about digital photography before
spending your hard-earned money on the equipment you need. You have
questions that need answers first: Can I afford a camera that does the
things I need it to do? Can a computer fumble-fingers like me really jump
into digital photography? What’s the best camera to buy? Still others are
7

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
digital camera veterans who are already thinking of upgrading. You, too,
need some advice about equipment, which you can find in this book.
Choosing a digital camera that’s right for you can be tricky because a lot
more goes into your selection than simply the specifications. Two cameras
with identical specs can perform quite differently. One may exceed your
expectations while another one frustrates the heck out of you. I explore
some of the subtleties of camera selection in Chapter 2 of Book I.
However, if you want to get the most from this book, your digital camera (or
digicam for short) should have certain minimal features and capabilities. For
example, if your digital camera is one of those Web cams that can capture
stills measuring 320 x 200 pixels, or maybe 640 x 480 pixels, you probably
don’t have what you need to take serious or semi-serious digital photos.
One of those $59 digicams with a lens that can’t be focused, no exposure
controls, and no removable storage probably won’t do the job for you
either, other than as a fun toy. If you believe the adage, “Any camera is
better than no camera,” go ahead and slip one in your pocket and be ready
to take a snapshot anytime, anyplace (as long as you have enough light,
your subject holds still, and a wallet-sized print will suffice). Such a mini-
malist digital photo system, however, won’t enable you to do much.
Any digital camera costing a couple hundred dollars or more will probably
do a fine job for you. Even the least expensive, true digital cameras boast
resolutions of at least 1 megapixel. (That is, at least 1 million pixels of infor-
mation, usually 1024 x 768 pixels or more.) Typical digital cameras have
automatic exposure, a color LCD viewing screen for previewing or reviewing
your photos, and removable storage so you can take out your digital film
card when it’s full and replace it with a new one to keep shooting. Most
have a zoom lens so that you can magnify an image without moving for-
ward, which is invaluable when you want to take pictures of different sub-
jects from one spot.
Those minimum specs give you everything you need to take great photos.
After all, it’s the photographer, not the camera, that produces the best
images. I once wrote an article for Petersen’s PhotoGraphic Magazine, in
which I presented photos of the same subjects, side by side, taken with an
inexpensive point-and-shoot camera and a full-blown professional system
that cost 100 times as much. After both sets of photos had been subjected
to the vagaries of halftone reproduction, it was difficult to tell them apart.
Spending a lot on a digital camera buys you a few new capabilities from
better zooms, enhanced resolution, or a more sophisticated built-in flash. If
you have a full-featured model, you can find lots of information in this book
on how to get the most from your camera’s capabilities (as well as
workarounds for those owning more modest equipment).
You can find digital cameras suitable for the most exotic of photographic
pursuits, such as the underwater setup shown in Figure 1-1. It’s a Canon
WP-DC300 waterproof case for the Canon PowerShot S40 digital camera. It
provides full access to all your camera’s controls, while letting you photo-
graph those colorful coral reefs in Tahiti at depths up to 100 feet!

Minimum and Maximum Specs
Minimum and Maximum Specs
For most of this book, I assume you have a digital camera with a resolution
of at least 2 megapixels. (If you don’t understand resolution right now, see
Chapter 2 of Book I, for an explanation.) A camera with a 2-megapixel sensor
corresponds to about 1600 x 1200 pixels, which is enough detail to give you
decent 6-x-8-inch prints or larger at 200 dpi printer resolution. A 2-megapixel
camera also can capture enough information to allow some cropping, espe-
cially if you plan to use the image on a Web page, where high resolution isn’t
necessary. A 4-megapixel resolution was a standard midrange spec as I wrote
this book.
However, if you have a 1.0- to 1.3-megapixel camera, you can still do plenty of
things. You can prepare images for dynamite Web pages and make sparkling
4-x-5-inch prints. I still use an ancient Epson digital camera that maxes out at
1024 x 768 resolution to take pictures for eBay auctions, and most of the
time, I take the snaps at a lower 640 x 480 setting that’s plenty sharp enough
for photos shown at small sizes.
Cameras with up to 6 megapixels of resolution have dipped into the $1,000
range and will probably become common during the life of this book. If you
own one of these babies, you can do even more. You can make tack-sharp 
8-x-10-inch prints (and even larger prints if your printer supports them), crop
out the center of an image, and still have sharpness to spare. Your camera
will have loads of automated features, such as automatic bracketing (taking
several exposures at different settings to make sure one is ideal) or a very
long zoom lens (to reach way out and capture distant objects).
Although I seem to focus on the number of pixels a camera has, other con-
siderations, such as the zoom lens I just mentioned, may also be important to
you. Even the least expensive cameras may have a 2:1 to 3:1 zoom, which can
magnify an image 2x and 3x (respectively). Better cameras have 4:1 or longer
zooms, up to 10:1 or more. Your camera probably has macro, or close-up,
capability, which lets you grab images from inches away from your subject.

Most of the other components (such as the amount and type of memory
storage, manual/automatic exposure and focusing options, built-in flash
capability, and so on) can vary widely. You can find discussions of these in
Chapter 2 of Book I.
Although I’ve been using single lens reflex (SLR) cameras, both digital and
conventional, for more years than I care to think about, very little in this
book actually requires a digital SLR to achieve. Those of you with high-end
cameras should still find lots to like in this book because one of my goals
has been to present pro-level techniques in ways that can help beginners,
too. If you have a digital SLR, you’ll find these techniques even more useful.
One thing I avoid in this book is mentioning the names of specific camera
models, except as a matter of interest from time to time. My oldest digital
camera in regular use is a 4-year-old (plus) Epson PhotoPC 600. Its capabili-
ties still compare favorably with the least expensive 1-megapixel models,
and that’s what’s important. When camera model matters, I may mention 
6- or 3.3- or 2-megapixel models in a generic sense. You won’t find any dis-
cussion in this book about the relative merits of the latest Nikon or Fuji
cameras, or other references that will be hopelessly outdated in a few
months. (Those of you reading this in the year 2005 with your $500 10-
megapixel cameras should refrain from laughing.)
Taking Great Digital Shots
So, when you have a camera in hand, what do you need to know to take
great digital photos? In this section, I discuss the knowledge that needs to
reside in your brain (or be otherwise available) to take great pictures.
Understand how your camera works
No digital photography book can tell you how to turn on your camera, how
to adjust the auto-exposure settings, or how to use your model’s self-timer
to take a picture with you in it. Those are things found only in your camera’s
instruction manual. Read it. I promise that the information you seek is in
there; it may just be hard to find. The instructions for my own Nikon digital
camera are so cryptic that I found myself creating a cheat sheet with lists 
of steps, such as, “To turn off the auto-sharpening feature, press the Menu
button, and then. . . .”
Some of the techniques in this book call for using a specific exposure mode
or lens setting. I may ask you to switch to your camera’s close-up mode to
take photos a few inches from your subject. You may need to use your
camera’s built-in flash. Find out how to do these now so that you can add
some simple but effective tools to your shooting repertoire.
Know some photography fundamentals
Certainly, you can point your camera and snap off a picture that may turn out
great. Some prize-winning shots were taken in an instant as a fast-breaking
news event unfolded without warning. Amateur photographers took more

than a few of those photos, such as the famous Pulitzer Prize winner of a
woman falling from a burning hotel captured by a 26-year-old Georgia Tech
student. However, whatever part instinct and luck take in the production of
great pictures, a little knowledge can be much more important.
✦If you know a little about composition, you can nudge your images into
a more pleasing arrangement. (See Book I, Chapter 7, for a full course in
photographic composition.) 
✦Understanding how focus can make parts of your image sharp or blurry
gives you the freedom to use focus selectively to isolate or emphasize
subjects (Book I, Chapter 8). 
✦Having some background in how shutter speeds can freeze action can
improve your sports photography (Book I, Chapter 11). 
✦You don’t need to become an expert in lighting effects, but understanding
how light works can improve your people pictures (Book I, Chapter 9).
Find out how to use an image editor
In digital photography, the pseudo-snap of an electronic shutter is only the
beginning. You can do lots of things after the shot to improve your photo —
or transform it into an entirely new one. Simple image editors enable you
to crop pictures, fix bad color, or remove defects such as those glaring red
eyes found in many flash photos. However, you can find even more creative
freedom in more advanced image editors that let you do anything from elim-
inating trees that appear to be growing out of your subject’s head to bringing
seriously damaged photos back to life. If you want to polish your reputation
as an all-around digital photographer, plan on developing at least a modicum
of skill with a decent image-editing program. You’ll find general information
on a broad range of image editors in Chapter 13 of Book I, as well as specifics
on Adobe Photoshop Elements in Chapters 14 through 18 also in Book I).
Master a scanner
Digital photographers don’t have to own a scanner, but you don’t have to
own a camera bag or an extra digital film card, either. Like other digital
accessories, a scanner provides you with some supplemental techniques
that let your scanner complement or substitute for your digital camera. For
example, a scanner can be used for producing close-up images of relatively
flat three-dimensional objects, such as coins. A scanner can grab pictures of
very small objects (less than 1 x 1 inch) that are difficult to capture with a
digital camera.
I won’t be going into scanners in any depth in this particular tome — I’ve
got a lot of ground to cover just by focusing on digital cameras! However, I
can recommend an excellent book with comprehensive coverage of all
types of scanners: Scanners For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by Mark L.
Chambers (Wiley). You find out everything you need to know about scan-
ning hardware and application software, as well as tips and tricks for
improving your scanned images with Paint Shop Pro or your favorite image
editor. Check it out!

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Making Any Photo Digital
In this book, you can find out how to transform any photo you happen to
have into a digital image. As I just mentioned, scanners are one way to do
this: Slap an existing photo down on the scanning bed and scan it into your
image editor, and you have a digital image that’s the equal of anything you
might capture with your digital camera — except it’s likely to have dust
spots!
Or, drop off your film at your local photo lab and request a Photo CD along
with (or instead of) your prints. Photo CDs can be produced from slide film,
too, or even stacks of existing prints. What you receive for your money is a
high-resolution scan of your images, perfect for manipulating in your image
editor and printing on your own color printer. You don’t even need to own a
scanner: Your photo lab does all the work for you.
Another option is using a local or mail-order service that processes your
film and puts the finished images on the Internet. You can download your
photos to your computer or make them available for viewing by family,
friends, and colleagues on a Web page. What could be easier? You can find
more information on this topic in Chapters 20 and 21 of Book I.
Printing Your Final Pictures
The final piece of the digital photography puzzle is the hard-copy print. You
may create photos electronically, view them on your computer, post them
on your Web site, and send them to others as e-mail, but nothing beats
having a stack of prints to pass around or an enlargement to hang over the
fireplace.
So, in Chapter 20 of Book I, you can find basic information on making prints.
The good news is that the equipment you need is inexpensive and easy to
use. A photo-quality inkjet printer can set you back $100 or so. It probably
plugs directly into a USB port on your computer and requires little or no
setup. Making the prints can be a point-and-click operation, and a variety of
printers can do the job for you. Today’s models can produce prints directly
from your digital camera, with no computer required at all!
The bad news, if it can be called that, is that the cost of materials can seem
a little high. You can pay $1 or more just for the paper and ink for a single 
8-x-10-inch print. The best news is that, unlike a photofinishing lab, you
don’t make a print of every single photo you take. You can view your prints
on your computer display and make hard copies of only the best images.
From that viewpoint, making your own prints isn’t expensive at all. You’re
printing only the pictures you want and, in the long run, probably paying 
a lot less overall than you used to spend on those prints that end up in a
shoebox.

C
hoosing the right digital camera isn’t as daunting a task as it might
appear to be on the surface. Most of the leading digital-equipment ven-
dors produce fine products that take great pictures. All you need to do is a
little homework so that as you make your purchase, you’re aware of the fea-
tures you need — and the features you don’t need. The vendors write their
brochures and ad copy so that those who don’t sort out features and bene-
fits ahead of time may think that every feature is essential.
I can tell you from personal experience that not even the most serious digital
photographers use every control and space-age feature on a high-end, high-
tech camera. For example, the ability to shoot several pictures consecutively,
each using different color settings, to make sure that one picture is perfectly
color balanced may sound cool, but it’s not something many people need
every day. But if you find yourself constantly taking pictures under varied
lighting conditions and color accuracy is important to you, a feature like
that may be a lifesaver. Only you can decide for sure.
The key is having the information you need to buy the camera that has the
largest number of your must-have features — and a nice sprinkling of good-
to-have features — at a price you can afford. So this chapter looks at each
of the following considerations in detail:
✦Lens requirements
✦Viewfinder options
✦Sensor resolution
✦Exposure controls
✦Storage options
✦Ease of use
Although much of this information can help you select a camera, you can
also find some basic explanations of digital camera nuts and bolts that will
be helpful as you take pictures. If you ever wanted to know what shutter
speeds and lens openings do, this is your chance.

Choosing a Camera Category
Digital cameras fall into several categories, each aimed at a particular audi-
ence of buyers, as well as particular kinds of applications for them. The
major types of camera categories include
✦Web cams: These are cheap DV (digital video) cameras that also offer
low-resolution, full-motion video and still images. They’re generally tied
down by a cable and sit on top of your computer, and they aren’t cov-
ered in this book.
✦Point-and-shoot models: These entry-level digital cameras, priced any-
where from $50 to $200, offer 1.3 to 2 megapixels of resolution, simple
lenses (frequently with digital zoom), and autoexposure.
✦Intermediate models: Priced in the $200 to $500 slot, intermediate digi-
tal cameras have 2- to 4-megapixel resolution, a 3:1 or better zoom lens,
and CompactFlash or SmartMedia storage. Many have close-up focusing
and some manual controls.
✦Advanced consumer models: In the $500 to $900 range, you can find
deluxe digital cameras with roughly 5 to 6 megapixels of resolution,
decent 4:1 to 6:1 zoom lenses, lots of accessories, optional exposure
modes, and a steep learning curve.
✦Prosumer models: Serious amateur and some professional photogra-
phers use these. They cost $1,000 to $3,000 and have all the features you
could want, including 6 or more megapixels of resolution, the highest
quality lenses, and every accessory you can dream of. Expect automatic
and manual focus, multiple automated exposure modes, and “motor
drive” multishot capabilities.
✦Professional models: Professional quality digital cameras cost $5,000 and
more, with 8 to 10 million pixels of resolution (and up), and operate much
more quickly, allowing the pro to grab shot after shot without pausing for
breath. They’re rugged, too, which means they can withstand the harsh
treatment pros often dish out to equipment — not because professional
photographers are mean, mind you, but because they’re busy. (Heck, even
Ansel Adams accidentally dropped a camera from time to time.)
Hence this chapter: The following sections should give you everything you
need to decide what type of camera fits your needs.
Evaluating Your Lens Requirements
The lens and the sensor (or film, in the case of a conventional camera) are
the two most important parts of any photographic system. The lens gath-
ers the light from your scene and focuses it onto the capture medium, digi-
tal or analog. The sensor or film transforms the light into something that
can be stored permanently and, after digital or chemical processing,
viewed as a picture.
Sharp lenses and high-quality sensors (or film) lead to technically good
images; poor lenses and bad sensors lead to poor photos. Indeed, in one
sense, most of the other components of a camera are for your convenience.
14

Book I
Chapter 2
Choosing the 
Right Camera
Evaluating Your Lens Requirements
Theoretically, you could mount a simple lens on one end of an oatmeal box,
focus it on a piece of film or a sensor affixed to the inside of the other end
of the box, and make an exposure by covering and uncovering the lens with
a dark cloth. Of course, the digital version of this science fair project would
require some additional electronics to handle the captured signal, but such
a system could work.
So, when you’re choosing a digital camera, the first thing to concentrate on
is the lens furnished with it. You probably don’t need to go into as much
detail as I provide, but understanding the components of a camera lens
does help you use your optics as much as it helps you choose them. The
major things you need to know fall into four simple categories:
✦The optical quality of the lens itself: Just how sharp a piece of glass
(or, these days, plastic) is it? The better the lens, the better it can capture,
or resolve, fine details. In most cases, the optical quality of digital camera
lenses marches in lockstep with the price of the camera and the resolu-
tion of the sensor. At the low and medium ends of the price spectrum,
digital cameras have good quality lenses that usually can resolve a lot
more detail than the 1- to 3-megapixel sensor can capture. Remember:
Camera vendors have been mass-producing lenses like these for film
cameras for decades, and any film camera can capture a lot more detail
than an inexpensive digital camera. At higher price levels, lenses have
better quality optics, which are necessary to keep up with the detail-
capturing capabilities of 6- to 8-megapixel (and higher) sensors.
✦The amount of light the lens can transmit: Some lenses can capture
larger amounts of light than others, generally because they have a greater
diameter that can transmit more light. This factor, called lens speed, is a
bit more complicated than that, but if you think of a 1-inch-diameter
pipe and a 2-inch-diameter pipe and visualize how much more water (or
light) the wider pipe can conduct, you’ll be thinking in the right direc-
tion. Lens speed, in part, controls how low a light level you can take pic-
tures in. So, if you take many pictures in dim light, you’ll want a faster
lens. I look at this factor in greater detail later in this chapter.
✦The focusing range of the lens: Some lenses can focus closer than others.
The ability to get up close and personal with your subject matter can be
very important if your hobbies are stamp or coin collecting, for example,
or if you want to take pictures of flowers or bugs. Indeed, close-focusing
can open whole new worlds of photography for you, worlds you can
explore in more detail in Chapter 8 of Book I. Figure 2-1 shows what you
can do if you can focus close enough.
✦The magnification range of the lens: Most digital cameras, except for
the least expensive, have a zoom lens, which allows you to vary the
magnification of the image. You may be able to take your basic image
and double it in size (a 2:1 zoom ratio), triple it (a 3:1 zoom), or magnify
it 10X or more (a 10:1 zoom). The zoom range determines how much or
how little of a subject you can include in an image from a particular
shooting distance. As you might expect, the ability to zoom enhances
your creative options significantly. At the widest settings (called wide-
angle settings), you can take in broad sweeps of landscape, whereas in
the narrowest view (called telephoto), you can reach out and bring a dis-
tant object much closer.
15

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Understanding How Lenses Work
You don’t need to have a degree in optical science to use a digital camera,
but understanding how lens openings (called f-stops) and some other com-
ponents work can help you use those components more effectively.
Lenses consist of several optical elements, made of glass or plastic, that
focus light in precise ways, much like you focus light with a magnifying
glass or with a telescope or binoculars. The very simplest lenses, like those
used on the least expensive digital cameras, are fixed focal length lenses,
usually comprised of just three or four pieces of glass. That is, the elements
can produce an image at only a single magnification. You find these in the
simplest point-and-shoot cameras that have no zooming capabilities.
Most digital cameras have zoom lenses, which have very complex optical
systems with 8, 10, 20, or more elements that move in precise ways to pro-
duce a continuous range of magnifications. Zoom lenses must be carefully
designed to avoid bad things, such as stray beams of light that degrade the
image bouncing around inside the lens. For that reason, when choosing a
digital camera with a zoom lens, you need to pay attention to the quality of
the image. All 4:1 zooms are not created equal; one vendor may produce an
excellent lens with this range, whereas another may offer a lens that is less
sharp. Among digital cameras with similar or identical sensors, lens quality
can make the biggest difference in the final quality of an image. You find out
how to select the best lens for your needs in the next few sections.

Optical zoom versus digital zoom
Digital cameras have two kinds of zooming capa-
bilities: optical and digital. Optical zoom uses the
arrangement of the lens elements to control the
amount of magnification — this is the type of zoom
that conventional film cameras use. Usually, opti-
cal zoom is the specification mentioned first in the
camera’s list of features. Digital zoom is a supple-
mentary magnification system, in which the center
pixels of an image are enlarged using a mathemat-
ical algorithm to fill the entire image area with the
information contained in those center pixels. Digital
zoom doesn’t really provide much in the way of
extra information; you could “zoom” in on an image
in your image editor if you like. However, digital
zoom is a (clumsy) way of turning a 4:1 zoom into an
8:1 (or even higher) zoom lens, even if the results
aren’t as good as those you’d obtain with a true
optical 8:1 zoom. I recommend that you discount
digital zoom capabilities when buying a camera; I
want the sharpest picture possible, and many cam-
eras make switching to digital zoom a clumsy pro-
cedure anyway.

Book I
Chapter 2
Choosing the 
Right Camera
Understanding How Lenses Work
Magnifications and focal lengths
Comparing zoom ranges of digital cameras can be confusing because the
exact same lens can produce different magnifications on different cameras.
(Keep in mind that I’m talking about optical zoom throughout this section;
for the lowdown on optical zoom, see the nearby sidebar “Optical zoom
versus digital zoom.”) That’s why you usually see the zoom range of a digi-
tal camera presented as absolute magnifications, or in the “equivalents” of
the 35mm camera lenses that the zoom settings correspond to.
Zoom range doesn’t relate to lens quality. You’ll find excellent 4:1 zooms
and other 4:1 zooms that are only average in quality. However, the longer
the zoom range, the more difficult it is to produce a lens that makes good
pictures at all zoom settings. You should be especially careful in choosing a
lens with a longer zoom range (8:1 or above); test the camera and its lens
before you buy. However, lenses from the major manufacturers (Canon,
Nikon, Fuji, and so forth) are all generally quite good.
Until the advent of digital cameras, figuring the magnification of consumer
camera lenses was relatively easy because in recent years, most consumer
(and the workhorse professional) film cameras used a standard film size —
the 35mm film frame — which measures a nominal 24mm x 36mm. You can
easily calculate the magnification of any particular lens with that standard
film size by measuring how far from the film the lens must be positioned to
focus a sharp image on the film. (This is called the focal length of the lens.)
By convention, a lens with a 45mm to 50mm focal length is considered a
normal lens. (The figure was arrived at by measuring the diagonal of the
film frame; you can calculate the focal length of a normal lens for any size
film or digital camera sensor by measuring that diagonal.)
Lenses with a shorter focal length, such as 35mm, 28mm, 20mm, or less, are
described as wide-angle lenses. Those with longer focal lengths (such as
85mm, 105mm, or 200mm) are described as telephoto lenses. We’ve lived
happily with that nomenclature for more than 75 years, since the first 35mm
camera was introduced. Wide-angle and telephoto images are shown in
Figure 2-2.
Then came the digital camera, and all the simple conventions about focal
lengths and magnifications went out the window. For good and valid technical
reasons, digital camera sensors do not measure 24mm x 36mm. You wouldn’t
want a sensor that large (roughly 1 x 11⁄2 inches) anyway, because the digital
camera would have to be large enough to accommodate it. In addition, as
with all solid-state devices, the larger a device such as a sensor becomes,
the more expensive it is to manufacture. Sensors that are as large as the full
35mm film frame are just beginning to arrive for professional cameras, which
means the magnification effect doesn’t apply for these digital cameras.
Most sensors are more likely to measure, say, 16mm x 24mm or less. Even the
very largest digital camera sensors — currently a 16-megapixel (or more)
monster made by Kodak — might be no larger than about 38mm x 38mm.
So, a normal lens on one digital camera may be 8mm, whereas another
normal lens on another camera may be 6mm. A 4:1 zoom lens can range
from 8mm to 32mm, or 5.5mm to 22mm. What a mess! How can you com-
pare lenses and zoom ranges under those conditions?
17

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Camera vendors have solved the problem by quoting digital camera lens
focal lengths according to their 35mm equivalents. If you’re already familiar
with 35mm camera lenses, that’s great. If you’re not, at least you have a
standard measurement to compare to. That’s why you often see digital
camera zoom ranges expressed as 35mm to 135mm equivalent (roughly 4:1)
or some similar expression. You can safely use these figures to compare
lenses in your quest for the perfect digital camera.
Because digital camera lenses have such short focal lengths in the first
place, most models tend to be deficient in the wide-angle department.
Expect to see most digital cameras with no better than a 35mm to 28mm
wide-angle equivalent. That’s barely acceptable because 35mm isn’t very
wide. If you really need a wide field of view, consider a wide-angle attach-
ment that fits on the front of your lens.
Lens apertures
The lens aperture is an adjustable control that determines the width of the
opening that admits light to the sensor. The wider the aperture, the more light

angle or
telephoto?
It’s all in
the lens.
18

Book I
Chapter 2
Choosing the 
Right Camera
Understanding How Lenses Work
that can reach the sensor, making it possible to take pictures in dimmer light.
A narrow aperture reduces the amount of light that can reach the sensor,
letting you avoid “overloading” the imaging device in very bright light. (Go
figure.) These lens openings are used in tandem with shutter speed — the
amount of time the sensor is exposed to the light — to control the expo-
sure. (I explain more about exposure later in this chapter.) Your digital
camera needs a selection of lens apertures (called f-stops) so that you can
take pictures in a broad range of lighting conditions.
F-stops aren’t absolute values; they’re calculated by measuring the actual
size of the lens opening as it relates to the focal length of the lens using a
formula that I won’t repeat here. (Some things are just plain unnecessary
for normal human beings.) Anyway, the easiest way to visualize how f-stops
work is to imagine them as the denominators of fractions. Just as 1⁄2 is larger
than 1⁄4 or 1⁄8, so is f/2 larger than f/4 or f/8. The relationship is such that, as
the amount of light reaching the sensor is doubled, the f-stop increases
using an odd-looking series of numbers: f/2 is twice as large as f/2.8, which
is twice as large as f/4, and so on through f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22
(which is the smallest f-stop you’ll encounter in the digital realm). Figure 2-3
shows lens openings of various sizes.
If you’re taking photos in automatic mode, you don’t need to know what 
f-stop you’re using; the camera selects it for you automatically. Your digital
camera probably displays the f-stop being used, however, either in the
viewfinder or on an LCD panel, and the information can be helpful. Just
remember these things:
✦The larger the f-stop (and the smaller the number), the more light
that’s admitted. An f/2 lens (small number, large f-stop) is a “fast” lens,
whereas one with a maximum aperture of f/8 (larger number, smaller 
f-stop) is “slow.” If you need to take photos in dim light, you want to
buy a camera with a fast lens.
✦The smaller the f-stop (the larger the number), the more of your image
that is in sharp focus. (More on this later.)
✦As the f-stops get smaller (larger number), exposure time must be
increased to let in the same amount of light. For example, if you took
a photo at f/2 for 1⁄2 second, you’d need to double the exposure time to
1 full second if you “stopped down” to f/4. I discuss exposure a little
later, too.

Focus range
A digital camera’s focus range is simply how close it can be to a subject and
still create a sharp image. Digital cameras vary in their close-focusing (also
called macro) capabilities. If you want to photograph anything up close —
flowers, hobby collections, items for sale on eBay, or your big toe — make
sure that your camera is up to it. Close focus can vary from model to model.
Some vendors deem anything less than about a foot as macro capability.
Other cameras take you down to 1⁄2 inch from your subject. Here are some
things to consider when evaluating focus range.
✦There’s such a thing as too close. When you get to within a few inches
of your subject, you’ll find that the subject is difficult to light. The
camera itself may keep sufficient light from reaching your subject. You
find out more about lighting close-ups in Chapter 8 of Book I.
✦Some lenses don’t allow close focus at all zoom settings. You might
want to step back a foot and zoom in to get the best view of your sub-
ject. However, some lenses don’t allow automatic (or even manual
focus) at longer zoom settings. Some restrict macro capabilities to
midrange or wide zoom settings.
✦Close focusing is tricky. Make sure your digital camera includes auto-
matic macro-focusing capabilities so that you don’t have to focus manu-
ally when shooting close to the subject.
✦Keep attachment friendliness in mind. If your favored digital model
doesn’t have sufficient built-in macro options, see if you can attach
close-up lenses to the front of your lens. Not all digital cameras can
accept screw-on attachments of this type.
Exposure controls
Because light levels vary, digital cameras must vary the amount of light
reaching the sensor. One way to do that is to change the f-stop, as
described earlier in this chapter. The second way is to alter the amount of
time the sensor is exposed to the light. This is done either electronically or
with an actual mechanical device called a shutter, which opens and closes
quickly to expose the sensor for a period known as shutter speed.
Like f-stops, shutter speeds are the denominators of fractions, and the larger
the number, the less light that’s reaching the sensor. Typical shutter speeds
include 1⁄60, 1⁄125, 1⁄250, 1⁄500, and 1⁄1000 of a second. Your digital camera readout probably
shows them as 60, 125, 250, 500, or 1000 because the numerator is always 1.
Cameras (chiefly film models) using mechanical shutters may have only
exact intervals like those available. Electronic shutters aren’t limited to
those values and can provide you with any actual interval from a few sec-
onds through 1⁄2000, or sometimes 1⁄4000, of a second. The traditional shutter
speed values are useful only when calculating equivalent exposures.
For example, suppose a basic exposure were 1⁄250 of a second at f/16 (which is
a typical exposure for a digital camera in bright daylight). If you wanted to
stop some fast-moving action, you might want your camera to switch to 1⁄500
of a second to freeze the movement with the shorter exposure time. (You can
find out more about stopping action in Chapter 11 of Book I.)
20

Book I
Chapter 2
Choosing the 
Right Camera
Understanding How Lenses Work
Because you’ve cut the amount of light in half by reducing the shutter
speed from 1⁄250 to 1⁄500 of a second, your camera needs to compensate by dou-
bling the amount of light admitted through the lens. In this example, the
lens is opened up from f/16 to f/11, which lets in twice as much illumination.
Usually, this all happens automatically thanks to your digital camera’s
handy autoexposure modes, but you can set these controls manually on
some models if you want. It’s probably a better idea to choose a different
autoexposure mode (described later) that gives you the flexibility you need.
Sometimes, you’ll look at an image on your LCD review screen and decide
the picture is too dark or too light. A digital camera’s autoexposure modes
can take care of this, too. When shopping for a digital camera, look for the
following exposure options:
✦Plus/minus or overexposure/underexposure: With these modes, you
can specify a little more or a little less exposure than the ideal exposure
that your camera’s light-measuring system determines.
✦Full autoexposure: With this option, your digital camera selects the shut-
ter speed and lens opening for you, using built-in algorithms that allow it
to make some intelligent guesses about the best combination of settings.
For example, on bright days outdoors, the camera probably chooses a
short shutter speed and small f-stop to give you the best sharpness.
Outdoors in dimmer light, the camera may select a wider lens opening
while keeping the shutter speed the same until it “decides” to drop down
to a slower speed to keep more of your image in sharp focus. Some digi-
tal cameras have several autoexposure program modes to select from,
so if you are taking action pictures and have chosen an action-stopping
mode, the camera tries to use brief, action-stopping shutter speeds under
as many conditions as possible. These program modes are different from
the aperture/shutter-preferred modes described next.
Naturally, no “algorithm” will ever be as savvy as a professional photog-
rapher, but I’ve found that the autoexposure mode on my cameras pro-
duces better results if I’m in a hurry or I have only a couple of seconds
to compose the shot.
✦Aperture-preferred/shutter-preferred exposure: These options let you
choose a lens opening (aperture-preferred) or shutter speed (shutter-
preferred) and then set the other control to match. For example, by choos-
ing shutter-preferred, you can select a short shutter speed, such as 1⁄1000 of
a second, and the camera locks that in, varying only the f-stop. Unlike the
programmed modes described in the preceding bullet, if your camera
finds that the selected shutter speed, for example, can’t be mated with an
appropriate aperture (say, it’s too dark or too light out), it may not take a
photo at all. I’ve run into this at soccer games when I’ve set my camera to
an action-stopping shutter speed and clouds dim the field so much that
even the largest lens opening isn’t enough to take a picture. Figure 2-4
shows an action shot taken with the camera set on shutter-priority.
✦Full manual control: With this option, you can set any shutter speed or
aperture combination you like, giving you complete control over the
exposure of your photo. That means you can also completely ruin the
picture by making it way too dark or too light. However, complete con-
trol is good for creative reasons, because seriously underexposing, say,
to produce a silhouette effect, may be exactly what you want.
21

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Keep in mind that the need for full manual control is somewhat less impor-
tant with a digital camera: That’s because you can always experiment after
you’ve taken the shot, using your trusty image editor. Changes you can
make in your digital darkroom include lighting, brightness, contrast, and
even focus.
In addition to exposure options, you must consider other factors when eval-
uating the exposure controls of your dream digital camera. Here’s a quick
checklist of those you should look out for:
✦Sensor sensitivity: Like film, sensors have varying degrees of sensitivity
to light. The more sensitive the sensor is, the better it can capture
images in low light levels. Most digital cameras have a sensitivity that
corresponds roughly to that of ISO 100 to ISO 200 film, and the specs
often use that terminology. Many cameras let you specify the sensitivity,
increasing from the default value of, say, ISO 200 to ISO 400 or even ISO
800 to give you a “faster” camera. Unfortunately, upping the ISO rating
usually increases the amount of random fuzziness, called noise, in the
image. It’s like turning your radio up really loud when you’re driving a
convertible with the top down. The wind flying past your ears tends to
cancel out some of the audio information that your too-loud radio is
producing. Increasing the ISO boosts image information while at the
same time increases background noise.
✦Measurement mode: Just how does your digital camera’s exposure
system measure the light? Sometimes, it measures only the center of the
picture (which is probably your subject anyway), and sometimes, it may
measure the entire frame and average out the light that the sensor sees.

22

Book I
Chapter 2
Choosing the 
Right Camera
Choosing Your Resolution
You don’t always want the camera to measure the light the same way.
Sometimes, measuring a center spot produces the most accurate reading.
Other times, such as when the scene is evenly lit, an averaging system
works best. On still other occasions, say, when the photo includes a lot
of sky, you might want the camera to measure only the light in the lower
half of the picture. Many cameras have multiple exposure modes that
allow you to choose what part of the image is measured.
✦Compensation systems: Many exposure systems can sense when a
picture is backlit (most of the light is coming from behind the subject)
and add exposure to make the subject brighter. Sophisticated cameras
can analyze your scene and choose an exposure mode that best fits
each individual picture, compensating for potential trouble spots in
the photograph.
✦Manual exposure: If you’re seriously interested in photography, you’ll
want at least the option of setting exposure manually (both f-stop and
shutter speed) so that you can customize your exposure to the artistic
effect you’re trying to achieve.
Choosing Your Resolution
The best lens can’t produce any more sharpness than the sensor used to
capture its information. For that reason, the resolution of most digital cam-
eras is the specification most people use to choose their equipment. They
want a 3.3-megapixel camera, or a 5.1-megapixel model, or maybe a 6- to 
8-megapixel camera. They figure (with some justification) that the more
pixels they have, the more features the vendor packs into the camera. After
all, you can expect a 6-megapixel camera to have a decent zoom lens, lots of
exposure control choices, close focusing, and all the other goodies, right?
Most of the time, that’s true. The sensor is usually the most expensive part
of any digital camera, so if you’re building a camera that’s going to cost
$1,000 anyway, you might as well load on the other goodies to justify the
price.
However, all pixels are not created equal. For one thing, the true resolution
of a sensor is likely to be somewhat less than you might think. Take, for
example, a sensor measuring 2048 x 1536 pixels. You’d think that such a
sensor could image about 3.1 million different details. Bzzzt. Wrong answer!
That would be possible only if the image were captured in black and white.
In practice, the sensor has to capture red, green, and blue pixels. With cur-
rent sensors, each pixel can capture only one particular color, so those 3.1
million pixels are actually divided up into red-sensitive pixels, green-sensitive
pixels, and blue-sensitive pixels. If the pixels were divided up evenly, you’d
wind up with three 1-megapixel sensors, one each for red, green, and blue,
rather than the 3.1-megapixel sensor you thought you had.
However, the pixels aren’t divvied up in that way. Because our eyes are
more sensitive to green light than to the other colors, sensors typically
divide up their pixels unevenly: 50 percent are green, 25 percent are red,
23

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
and 25 percent are blue. That’s done by alternating red and green on one
line, and green and blue on the next, as shown here and also in Figure 2-5:
RGRGRGRGRGRGRGRG
GBGBGBGBGBGBGBGB
RGRGRGRGRGRGRGRG
Your camera’s brain examines the picture and calculates (or interpolates)
what the red and blue values probably are for each green-sensitive pixel posi-
tion, what the green and blue values are for each red-sensitive pixel position,
and what the green and red values likely are for each blue-sensitive pixel.
In addition, some sensors are more sensitive than others, and other factors
make a particular sensor not perform as well as another one with the same
number of pixels. For example, some sensors don’t register some colors
well or have pixels that bright light can easily overwhelm.
When buying a digital camera, you want to choose one with the resolution
you want and, if possible, compare the pictures taken with each camera
under consideration to see if that resolution is being put to good use.
When it comes to megapixels, you can estimate the resolution you require
with these guidelines:
✦Low res: If you’re shooting pictures intended for Web display, for online
auctions, or for pictures that either won’t be cropped or enlarged much,
you can get by with a lower-resolution camera in the 1-megapixel range.
✦Medium res: If you often need to crop your photos, want to make larger
prints, or need lots of detail, you want at least a 2-megapixel camera,
and more likely a 3.3- to 4-megapixel model.
✦High res: If you want to extract small portions of an image, make prints
8 x 10 inches or larger, or do a lot of manipulation in an image editor,
you want a 5- to 8-megapixel (or more) camera.
Keep in mind that most digital cameras allow shooting in a reduced mode,
so if you own a high-resolution camera, you can still shoot in low resolution
to pack more images on your digital film or to reduce file sizes on your hard
disk. Resizing images is rarely a good idea, even with a good image-editing
program, so you usually want to shoot at the resolution you intend for your
finished photo.
The mode in which your camera stores the image on your digital film can
also affect the final resolution of your image. Digital cameras usually store
photos in a compressed, space-saving format known as JPEG (taken from
Figure 2-5:
All is not
even when
comparing
sensors.
24

Book I
Chapter 2
Choosing the 
Right Camera
Choosing Your View
the tongue-twisting Joint Photographic Experts Group). The JPEG format
offers reduced file sizes by discarding some information. In most cases, a
JPEG file is still plenty good, but if you want to preserve all the quality of
your original image, you may want to set your camera to store in a lossless
image format (that is, one that doesn’t discard any image information when
compressing the file), such as TIFF, RAW, or EXIF. You may be able to choose
from different JPEG quality levels, too.
Expect these alternate formats to eat up your exposures quickly. One of my
digital cameras can store 32 images on a particular film card in JPEG format
but only 5 in TIFF.
Some cameras generally label their resolution choices with names such
as Standard, Fine, Superfine, Ultrafine, and so forth. These terms can vary
from vendor to vendor. A typical range in a megapixel model might look like
Table 2-1.

Choosing Your View
Generally, you want what you see to be what you get, but that’s not always
the case with digital cameras. That’s because the viewfinders available are
usually a compromise between what works best and what can economically
be provided at a particular price level. In the digital photography realm, the
solution has long been to provide you with two viewfinders per camera,
each with its own advantages and disadvantages. You usually find both an
optical viewfinder, which you can peer through to frame and compose your
image, as well as a color LCD display screen on the back of the camera,
which you can use to preview and review your electronic images. Neither is
ideal for every type of picture-taking application.
LCD viewfinders
The liquid crystal display (LCD), usually measuring about 2 inches diago-
nally, shows an electronic image of the scene as viewed by the sensor. On
the one hand, that’s good because you can view more or less the exact
image that will be captured. It’s also not-so-good because the LCD display is
likely to be difficult to view, washed out by surrounding light, and so small
that it doesn’t really show what you need to see. Moreover, the backlit LCD
display eats up battery power. I’ve used digital cameras that died after 20
minutes when the LCD had depleted their rechargeable batteries. Luckily,
some digital cameras let you specify that the LCD is turned on only when
composing a picture, or only for a few seconds after a picture is taken (so
that you can quickly review the shot).
25

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Although often not usable in bright daylight, LCDs, such as the one shown
in Figure 2-6, are better in more dimly lit conditions. If you mount your
camera on a tripod and make sure that all the light is directed on your sub-
ject, an LCD is entirely practical for framing, focusing, and evaluating a digi-
tal image. As you shop for a digital camera, check out the LCD display
under a variety of conditions to make sure it passes muster.
Optical viewfinders
Most of the time, you use an optical viewfinder, which is bright and clear,
uses no power, and lets you compose your image quickly. However, optical
viewfinders have problems of their own, most notably a problem called par-
allax. Parallax is caused by the difference in viewpoint between your
camera’s lens and the optical viewfinder. They don’t show the same thing.
If the optical viewfinder happens to be mounted directly above the camera
lens, its view will be a little higher than that of the lens itself. This becomes
a problem chiefly when shooting pictures from relatively close distances
(3 feet or less). Such a viewfinder tends to chop off the top of any subject
that is close to the camera. Optical viewfinders usually have a set of visible
lines, called parallax correction lines, that you can use to frame the picture.
If you keep the subject matter below the correction lines, you can avoid
chopping off heads. Of course, you get more of the lower part of your sub-
ject than you can view.
Parallax becomes worse when the optical viewfinder is located above and
to one side of the lens, as shown in Figure 2-7. In that case, a double set of
parallax correction lines is needed to help you avoid chopping off both the
top and the side of your subject. Yuk!

Choosing Your View
Hybrid viewfinders
Recently, some affordable cameras have been introduced with hybrid
viewfinders that work like optical viewfinders (that is, you put your eye up
to a window to view your subject) but that use an electronic display to
show you the image.
And there’s always the high-end, digital, single lens reflex camera, which
shows you the exact image the sensor sees through the taking lens, using
an optical system. It’s done with mirrors — although somewhat tired, the
pun is still intended. In the most common configuration, you view the sub-
ject through the lens using an image bounced off mirrors and (sometimes)
a glass prism. Then when you take the picture, the mirror moves out of the
Figure 2-7:

27

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
way to expose the sensor. You lose sight of the image for a fraction of a
second, but film SLR users have been tolerating that inconvenience for
decades.
Viewfinders with vision correction
Regardless of what optical or SLR viewing system you use, you want to make
sure your camera either has built-in eyesight (diopter) correction to adjust
for your near- or far-sightedness, or can be fitted with corrective lenses
matched to your prescription. This vision correction enables you to get
your eye close enough to the viewfinder to see the whole image. Some
viewfinders make it difficult for those wearing glasses to see through the
optical system, because a bezel or other part of the viewfinder prevents the
glasses from getting close enough.
Considering Your Storage Options
The kind of storage your digital dream camera uses will never be a factor in
making your selection, unless it’s a truly odious choice, and that’s a matter
of personal taste. The days of the digital cameras that used floppy disks and
other oddball media are long gone. Today, all digital cameras use one of the
following options:
✦SmartMedia: These digital film cards are more popular in Japan than in
other countries, chiefly because of their very small size. Because so
many digital cameras are made in Japan, you can expect to see lots of
cameras using SmartMedia. In the past, SmartMedia cost more than its
chief competitor, CompactFlash, and had lower capacity to boot. Today,
the most common sizes, 128MB and 256MB, are available in both formats
and at comparable prices.
✦CompactFlash: CompactFlash is the favored format in the United States.
Although slightly larger in size than SmartMedia, CompactFlash cards
are still very small and convenient to carry and use. As larger capacities
are introduced, they usually appear in CF format first. As a bonus, the
CompactFlash slot can also be used for mini hard drives, such as those
from IBM, with capacities of a gigabyte or more.
✦Mini hard drives: Until silicon technology catches up, mini hard drives
are your only option when you need more than a gigabyte of storage. If
you’re using a 6-megapixel or better camera and like to save your images
as TIFF files or in another lossless format, you need more than a gigabyte
of storage.
✦CD-R/R: Sony, in its never-ending quest to change its digital camera media
options annually, seems to have abandoned floppy storage in favor of
mini-CD-Rs and mini-CD-RWs. Although not really a bad idea, because the
media is relatively inexpensive (a 240MB mini-CD-R is a lot cheaper than
a 256MB CompactFlash card), this option hasn’t caught on yet.
✦Sony Memory Stick: About the size of a stick of gum, Sony’s Memory
Sticks are useful because you can also use them with other devices, such
as MP3 players. They’re not going to replace CompactFlash, though.

Checking Out Ease of Use
No Flash in the Pan: Determining Your Lighting Needs
Your digital dream camera’s electronic flash capabilities (or lack thereof)
should be on your list of things to evaluate before you make a purchase
decision. Not every photo is possible using existing light. Even if plenty of
light is available, you may still want to fill in those inky shadows by using an
electronic flash. So, your camera’s built-in flash features are something to
look at.
Most digital cameras have a built-in flash unit that can be turned on or
flipped up or swung out or otherwise activated when you want to use flash —
or when the camera decides for you that flash is required. (Usually a tip-off
is a flashing red light in your viewfinder. Time to flip up that flash!)
You should be aware that most flash units are good only over a particular
range. If you’ve ever seen a fan stand up in the balcony at a Bruce Springsteen
concert and take a flash picture of the Boss from 100 feet away, you’ll under-
stand just how limited flash is at long distances. Some units may be so feeble
that they can only illuminate subjects between 2 and 12 feet away. Others
may have special settings to spread the flash illumination for wide-angle
shots or tighten it up for telephoto pictures.
Here are some features to look for in electronic flash:
✦Auto-on: It’s useful to have a flash that can be set to flash only when it’s
needed. Some cameras may require you to flip up the flash to use it.
Others build the flash in to the camera’s body in such a way that the
flash can be used anytime.
✦Autoexposure: An electronic flash can sense the amount of light
reflected back from the subject and turn itself off when the exposure is
sufficient. See if your camera’s electronic flash uses a sensor built in to
the camera’s body or whether the sensor measures the light actually
being used to take the photo.
✦Red-eye prevention: Some flashes can be set to produce a short pre-
flash just before the picture is taken. That causes the subjects’ irises to
contract, reducing the possibility of the dreaded red-eye effect.
✦External flash capabilities: At times, you want to use an external flash,
either in concert or instead of your camera’s built-in flash. See if your
camera has a built-in flash-synch socket or a hot shoe that you can use
to mount an external flash and connect the camera to the flash. Keep in
mind that many digital cameras require that you use only a particular
brand of flash to retain the automated exposure features or, in some
cases, to avoid frying your camera’s flash-triggering circuit with too
much voltage.
Checking Out Ease of Use
I’ve saved the best for last because I want this topic to sink firmly into your
mind as you put this book down and continue to think about what you’re
looking for in a digital camera. Usability is one of the most important fac-
tors to keep in mind when choosing a camera. The sharpest lens, the most
29

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
sophisticated sensor, and the most advanced features are all useless if you
can’t figure out how to operate the stupid camera! I’ve owned digital cam-
eras that absolutely could not be used without having the manual at hand.
Even common features were so hard to access that I sometimes avoided
taking certain kinds of pictures because activating the feature took too long.
Ease of use is not limited to digital cameras, of course. Difficult-to-operate
cameras have been creeping up for 15 or 20 years. This was not always so.
When I began my photographic career as a newspaper photographer, film
cameras had a limited number of controls — a shutter speed dial, f-stops to
set on the lens, focusing, and maybe a rewind knob to move the film back
into the cassette when the roll was finished. Over the years, electronic
exposure controls were joined by exposure modes and a ton of other fea-
tures as film cameras became more and more computerlike.
Today, even digital cameras that most resemble their film counterparts bris-
tle with buttons, command dials, mode controls, menus, and icons. That’s
not necessarily a bad thing. What is evil is an interface that’s so convoluted
that even advanced users may have problems. You may have to wade
through nested menus to change the autofocus or exposure control mode.
Switching from aperture-priority to shutter-priority may be a pain. Something
as simple as changing from automatic focus to manual focus can be difficult,
particularly if you don’t make the switch very often and forget which combi-
nation of buttons to press.
Ease of use varies greatly, depending on which features are most important
to you. A camera that one person may find a breeze to use may be impossi-
ble for another person to manage, simply because a particular must-have
feature is hard to access.
So, I urge you to try out any digital camera you’re seriously considering
buying before you plunk down your money. A camera’s feature set, or the
vendor’s reputation, or recommendations of a friend won’t tell you how the
camera will work for you. Hold the camera in your hand. Make sure it feels
right, that its weight and heft are comfortable to you. Be certain your fin-
gers aren’t too large or too small to handle the controls. Can you see through
the viewfinder?
If possible, take the camera for a test drive, borrow a similar camera from a
friend or colleague, or at least shoot some photos in the store. Can you find
the features you use most? Can you figure out the menus and buttons? Is
the camera rugged enough to hold up under the kind of treatment you’ll
subject it to?
As much as I like buying by mail order or over the Internet, a digital camera
is too personal a tool to buy from specifications lists and photos. If you’re
reading this book, you’re probably serious enough about digital photogra-
phy that you’ll be spending a lot of time with your camera — and probably
will spend more money than you expected to get the camera you really want.
Make sure it really is the one you want by giving it a thorough workout.

You may be ready for digital photography, but is your computer up to the
task? The good news is that virtually any computer of recent vintage
probably has the horsepower and features needed to work with the digital
images that you capture with a camera. A Windows PC with a Pentium or an
AMD processor that operates at 800 MHz or faster — or, on the other side
of the street, any G3-, G4-, or G5-based Macintosh — has what it takes to
import, process, and output digital images.
Even so, the differences between a computer that’s good and one that’s
only “good enough” can be significant. Your system may be exceptional, or
it may be the exception. You probably don’t want to be working with the
minimal system possible, even if you’d rather invest your money in a better
digital camera. (I know if faced with the choice of a new, 3 GHz Pentium III
computer and an 8-megapixel digital single lens reflex, I’d choose the camera
every time. Unfortunately, I don’t get to make such choices.)
This chapter helps you develop your own checklist of recommended hard-
ware, shows you how to upgrade to make your work even easier, and offers
tips on setting up your computer to make working with digital images a
breeze.
I cover only the main equipment options for setting up a computer for digital-
photography editing and storage in this chapter. You can find information
on equipment used to transfer images between your camera and computer
in Chapter 4 of Book I.
Hardware Wars Revisited
Macs versus PCs. Why are we even having this conversation?
Digital photography, graphics work in general, music composition, and video
production are the key arenas in which the Macintosh versus PC battle is
still being waged. In most other areas, Windows-based systems have taken
31

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
over the desktop, with Macs relegated to specialized applications. Apple
keeps coming up with compelling hardware, interesting computer designs,
and lots of cool applications, but even the world’s first prime-time 64-bit
system — the Apple G5 Power Mac, teamed with Mac OS X — barely attracts
the attention of those in the Windows camp.
But in the digital photography world, that’s not the case. Visit any newspa-
per or magazine relying on digital cameras, and you’ll find Macs. Drop in to
any professional digital photographer’s studio, and you’ll see a brawny
Macintosh perched on the desktop. Talk to the top Photoshop users in the
country, and you’ll find that most of them are using Macintoshes, too, either
exclusively or in tandem with a Windows box.
Indeed, for a long period of time, the only logical choice for most photogra-
phers has been the Macintosh. The decision was along the lines of selecting
a 35mm Nikon or Canon SLR for photojournalism, or a Sinar view camera for
studio work: a no-brainer. Although I don’t have hard figures, my gut feeling
is that Macs outnumber PCs in imaging environments by at least 8 to 1. In
the rest of the business world, the figures are reversed.
By and large, the latest G4 Macintoshes provide enough muscle for virtually
any still-image work, particularly when equipped with at least a gigabyte of
memory. (Of course, a Power Mac G5 is the ultimate in performance, pro-
ducing results like the ’60s muscle cars of old Detroit.) No photographer
needs to be ashamed of driving a properly equipped Mac.
In the digital photography world, Macs are not only viable but also usually
the system of choice. However, in some cases, you may not have a choice
because you already own a computer or prefer to use a particular system
that you’re already familiar with.
Yet, if you aren’t locked into a particular platform and operating system,
should you be using a Macintosh or a Windows computer? If you want a
definitive answer, I’d say, “It depends.” (Which isn’t very definitive, is it?)
Each platform has its pros and cons. Here is a summary of some factors you
should consider:
✦The bandwagon effect: If you plan to make your living, at least in part,
from digital photography, you need to learn two things: how to use a
Mac and how to perform image magic with Photoshop. Both skills are
expected to be part of your résumé. Jump on the bandwagon while you
can. On the other hand, Windows proficiency is expected for most jobs
outside imaging. Unless you’re a full-time graphics professional, you
may have to wear two hats (and, like me, own both Macs and PCs).
✦Sheer seat-of-the-pants horsepower: Hands down, the Mac’s 64-bit G5
processor is the fastest desktop on the planet at the time of this writing.
Of course, that may last as long as a snowball in Florida, but until 64-bit
processors are in common use in the PC world (and Windows fully sup-
ports 64-bit processing, which Windows XP doesn’t), the Mac will be the
King of the Digital Racetrack.
✦Ease of use: The Macintosh is generally acknowledged to be a bit
easier to learn and somewhat easier to use for many tasks. Of course,

the Macintosh system’s vaunted ease of use has been subverted over
the years as Apple has tried to catch up with Windows systems. (For
example, the Mac’s sublimely simple single-button mouse must be
augmented by holding down the Control key while clicking to reproduce
the Windows mouse’s right-click option.) If you’re just starting out in
computing and don’t want to climb a steep learning curve, the Mac is
your computer.
✦Software compatibility: Not all applications are available for both 
Mac and PC. Most key applications are offered for both, including the
Photoshop image editor (shown in Figure 3-1 in both Mac and Windows
incarnations), the StuffIt archiving tool, browsers such as Netscape and
Internet Explorer, and word processing applications such as Microsoft
Word. But if you must be totally compatible with Windows, you need
Windows . . . or do you?

“Okay, what did you mean by that?” Here’s the trick: You can run
Windows XP on your Macintosh! If you’re not interested in playing the
latest games, a late-model G4 or G5 Macintosh can do double duty by
using Microsoft’s Virtual PC for Mac (www.microsoft.com/mac). Virtual
PC for Mac emulates a typical Windows PC in software, allowing you to
run just about any Windows program (complete with an Internet and
network connectivity, USB hardware, and access to your Mac’s CD-ROM
or DVD-ROM). Naturally, things run somewhat slower — hence my rec-
ommendation not to try playing Windows games — but I use this great
application every day, and on a 1 GHz (or faster) G4 or a G5, I think
you’ll be impressed by how well Virtual PC for Mac performs.
✦The cost factor: Macs have generally been more expensive than PCs
although the cost difference has decreased over the years. Even so, with
powerful Pentium 4 systems available in barebones configurations for
$500 or so, even the least expensive Mac still costs a bit more. In the
Mac’s favor, however, most peripherals and add-ons such as memory,
hard drives, DVD devices, monitors, and so forth cost the same whether
you’re purchasing them for a Mac or a PC.
✦Hardware reliability: Reliability is a two-edged sword. Macs are won-
derfully crafted machines, a beauty to behold when you dismantle one,
and filled with high-quality components. The insides of some of the
assembly-line-built PCs have a decided industrial look, and if you exam-
ine the parts, you may find a mixture of known brand-name pieces and
whatsis components. On the other hand, if something breaks on your
PC, you can run down to the local MegaMart and buy a new floppy
drive, a CD burner, and maybe some memory off the shelf next to the
cell phone batteries. My local grocery store carries these items. Parts for
your Mac may be harder to come by, and it’s unlikely you’ll know how to
replace them anyway. So, even assuming the Mac is more reliable than
the average PC, is that always an advantage?
✦Operating system reliability: Trust me, Mac OS X 10.3 (affectionately
nicknamed Panther) is just plain hard to crash, and I count Mac OS X as
a definite advantage over Windows XP — after all, Panther is built on a
UNIX foundation. Plus, Mac owners avoid applying the daily patches
that Microsoft issues for its software and OS and doing other fiddling
that can lead directly to the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Oh, and don’t
forget that virtually all viruses and worms that regularly plague
Windows users are unknown in the Mac universe. By any measure,
Windows has to be considered inherently less stable than Mac OS. (And
I won’t get into the frequent horrifying discoveries that things such as
the Windows Help system have bugs that let a hostile user invade your
system. No, I’m not making that up.) If no crashing is on your holiday
gift list, the Mac still has the edge.
✦Technological superiority and coolness: If owning a computer that
looks like a Tensor lamp is your cup of tea, and you like the idea of
having cool stuff before anyone else, you really, really need a Macintosh.
The most exotic hard disk interfaces (from SCSI in the ’80s to FireWire in
the ’90s) came to the Mac first, along with flat-panel displays, DVD burn-
ers, and other radical innovations that turned out to be a little (or a lot)
before their time.

What Equipment Do You Need?
Windows has its advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that it’s
almost universally available and has the broadest range of widely used
applications written for it. One disadvantage is that Windows still forces
you to do things the Microsoft way when you’d really rather do them your
own way. For example, Windows XP is fond of setting up your network the
way it likes, bludgeons you into using Internet Explorer even if you prefer
Netscape, and has a tendency to coerce you into using the Windows Media
Player for everything and anything.
Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, on the other hand, let you do things your own 
way quite easily. Would you prefer that your digital-camera application be
installed on your secondary hard disk rather than the one you first installed
it on? Just drag it to the new hard drive; you don’t need to uninstall it and
reinstall it as you must do with Windows.
Although you probably won’t choose a computer based on the operating
system, these things are nice to know.
What Equipment Do You Need?
Digital cameras themselves make few demands on a computer system, of
course. The real drain on your system is running your image-editing pro-
gram and storing your images for editing or archival purposes. Make no
mistake, image editing is among the most demanding types of work you can
lay on a computer, so before you start down this road, you’ll want to know
about the minefields that lie along the way. If you want the flying short
course, here are the ten most important things you need to consider:
✦Memory
✦More memory
✦Even more memory
✦Adequate local storage (a fast, big hard disk)
✦A fast microprocessor
✦Archival storage (usually a CD or DVD recorder)
✦Advanced video display capabilities
✦Other peripherals, such as digitizing tablet-and-pen devices
✦A little more memory
✦More RAM than you thought you’d ever need
Determining how much memory you need
If you noticed that I’ve listed memory five times on my top ten list, there’s 
a reason for that. Memory makes everything else possible. A fast, big hard
disk is also important because it gives you room to work with your current
project’s files and can a substitute for RAM (random access memory) when
you finally do run out. But nothing can replace memory when decent per-
formance is your goal.
35

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
I can’t emphasize this point enough: When you’re working with images, you
must have, as a bare minimum, at least six to ten times as much RAM as the
largest image file you plan to work with on a regular basis. Many digital
photos can amount to 18–60MB, which translates into 180–600MB of RAM
for each image you want open at once. If you’re working with more reason-
ably sized 4MB images but need to have ten of them open at one time, you
still need tons of memory to do the job.
Without sufficient RAM, all the bucks you spend on a super-speedy micro-
processor are totally wasted. Your other heavy-duty hardware will come to
a screeching halt every time you scroll, apply a filter, or perform any of a
number of simple functions with an image. That’s because without enough
RAM to keep the entire image in memory at once — plus your image editor’s
Undo files (basically copies of the image in its most recent states) — your
computer is forced to write some or all of the image to your hard disk to
make room for the next portion it needs to work with (a process that soft-
ware technowizards call virtual memory). If you’re working with a serious
camera in the 6-megapixel range and choose to save your files in the highest-
quality mode, you’re a candidate for maxing out your computer’s memory.
An 18MB image is fairly common these days, so you should be prepared with
as much RAM as you can cram into your computer.
Most systems have three to four memory slots, which can each hold a
256–512MB memory module, for a total of 2GB. (The exception is Apple’s
Power Mac G5, which can hold up to a whopping 8GB of memory.) Loading
your computer with 2GB of memory is not at all outlandish and is relatively
inexpensive. You can purchase that much memory for a few hundred dollars.
Any Mac or PC with 512MB or less of RAM is hopelessly underequipped for
digital photography. Beefing up your memory can be the least expensive
and most dramatic speed enhancement you can make.
Choosing local storage
Your graphics powerhouse is only as fast as its narrowest bottleneck, so you
should pay special attention to the biggest potential roadblock: your mass
storage subsystems. You need one or more big hard disks for several reasons:
✦To keep as many images as possible available for near-instant access:
A large hard disk enables you to store all your current projects — plus
many from recent months — all in one place for quick reference or
reuse. With a large hard drive, you can store a vast library of your own
photographic clip art, too, and avoid having to sort through stacks of
archive CDs.
✦To provide working space for your current projects: You’ll want scratch
space — space on your hard drive — to store images that you probably
won’t need but want to have on hand just in case. Alternate versions of
images eat up more space as you refine your project. Image editors such
as Photoshop also need spare hard disk space to keep multiple copies
of each image you’re editing.
✦To let you store additional applications: Good bets here would be
panorama-generating programs, a second or third image editor for spe-
cialized needs, utility programs, extra plug-in programs, and so forth.

What Equipment Do You Need?
In the recent past, your hard disk storage options were limited to internal
hard disks in one of two categories: fast, expensive hard disks using a SCSI
interface or inexpensive, slow hard disks using the EIDE interface. Today,
the technologies have converged. SCSI drives no longer cost that much
more than EIDE disks, and EIDE drives have gotten much, much faster.
Moreover, new options have appeared, chiefly in the form of external hard
disks that link to your computer via FireWire or USB, and a new kind of
internal serial drive.
SCSI and EIDE hard disks
You don’t see SCSI disks used much outside server environments these
days. Their chief advantage is that your computer can transfer information
to and from several SCSI disks simultaneously. That’s because SCSI is a
system-level interface that conveys information in logical terms: Multiple
devices can use the same connection in parallel fashion although more
intelligence is required to decode requests from the computer. Other kinds
of hard disks, particularly EIDE, may have to take turns in talking to your
computer, which can reduce performance. Peripherals are so fast these
days that the difference in performance between SCSI and other systems is
seldom important outside the server environment.
The chief advantage of drives in the EIDE/Super ATA — or whatever nomen-
clature you care to apply to the category — is that they are almost free. As I
was writing this book, 320GB Maxtor hard drives were available for around
$1 per gigabyte, and I expect the cost per byte to drop even more dramati-
cally during the life of this book. However, even at $1 per gigabyte, hard
drives aren’t that much more expensive than CD-R media.
External hard disks
With external hard disks, you’re no longer limited to the number of disk
drives you can cram into your computer’s housing. These disks, such as 
the one in Figure 3-2, link to your computer using an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) 
or USB 2.0 interface. (Two types of FireWire ports now exist — the original
FireWire 400 and the new FireWire 800, which is twice as fast — and they
use two different ports. However, you can get an adapter that allows one
type of device to use the other type of FireWire port.) 
The advantage of external storage is that you can install and remove FireWire
and USB 2.0 drives without opening your computer’s case, and you don’t
need to worry about how to fit them in the case. You can also easily move
such an external drive from computer to computer.
Archiving and backing up
Digital photos can fill even the largest hard disk faster than Yankee Stadium
on Bat Day. Your graphics powerhouse needs open-ended storage that is rel-
atively cheap and reliable and that provides near-online (permanent storage)
access speeds.

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Zip disks
For a while, Iomega’s Zip drives, which were initially available in 100MB and
250MB capacities, seemed to be the answer. However, as file sizes and hard
disks grew, a mere 250MB hardly seemed practical as a serious storage and
backup option. Can you really back up an 80GB hard drive on 320 Zip disks?
Not when the disks cost $5 to $15 each! Even extending the capacity of the
Zip drive to 750MB in late 2002 didn’t help. Zip drives have become the
floppy disk of the new millennium: They’re useful for transferring files from
one computer to another but not a serious consideration as an archival or
backup medium.
CD-Rs and CD-RWs
CD-Rs and CD-RWs have a bit more credibility in this arena because you can
cram a healthy 700MB on a CD that can cost as little as a nickel. You still
wouldn’t want to back up your 80GB drive to 100 CD-RWs (even though the
media itself might cost you only $10), but it’s entirely practical to archive
your digital photos on this media.
DVDs
More likely to emerge as a long-term storage medium is one of the various
versions of DVD. Depending on how many layers are used, DVDs can store
5G or more each. The cost of DVD burners is coming down, and this medium
should become more popular when the industry settles on a single, standard
format. In a world where DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, DVD+R/W, DVD-R/W, and
other options exist, most users are afraid to commit themselves to one . . .
hence the popularity of the dual-format DVD recorder, which can read and
record both DVD+R/W and DVD-R/W media.

Kodak Photo CD
The Kodak Photo CD is a viable alternative for storing digital images
although the writers for this media are not within the budgets of the aver-
age digital photographer. (You can’t burn a Photo CD on a standard CD or
DVD recorder.) However, you can have your images transferred to a Photo
CD and take advantage of the unique features of the format.
Photo CDs, originated by the Eastman Kodak Company, are a form of write-
once CD-ROM with some special advantages for photographers. Photo CDs
store each image in five compressed versions called Image Pacs, each with
a different resolution:
Base
Resolution
Size
Basic, or Base
512 x 768
1MB
Base/4
256 x 384
300K
Base/16
128 x 192
74K
Base x 4
1024 x 1536
5MB
Base x 16
Full resolution, 2048 x 3072
18MB
The Pro CD version adds a sixth, Base x 64, 4096 x 6144, 74MB version.
Here are some advantages of using Photo CDs:
✦Compatible image-editing software can choose which resolution to work
with. You can preview the tiny Base/16 images, use the Base version for
comps (layouts), edit and release the Base x 4 image for noncritical
work, or unleash the full-resolution Base x 16 or Base x 64 images for
full-page layouts, posters, or what have you.
✦You don’t need a high-resolution scanner to produce Photo CDs.
Photofinishers and pro labs can convert your images to Photo CD
format with their own Photo CD equipment.
✦You can specify either Photo CD Master Discs, which are designed for
35mm photography and hold up to 100 images at the five basic resolu-
tions, or Pro Photo CD Master Discs, which can store images in 35mm,
120mm, 70mm, or 4-x-5-inch format. Up to 25 images can be included
with the sixth Base x 64 resolution added.
✦Also available is the Photo CD Portfolio II disc, which is one you can
create yourself by using Kodak Portfolio II authoring software. The
Portfolio disc can include photos, stereo audio, graphics, text, and other
material. If you have a Photo CD writer ($3,000 and up), you can create
your own business presentations, trade show displays, or educational
programs.
✦You can encrypt images on Photo CDs. Photographers can use discs as
a portfolio and a stock-photo distribution tool and send out sample
discs to clients. The clients can retrieve the unencrypted Base versions
to see what your work looks like on their own computer screens. But no
one has access to the high-resolution versions needed for reproduction
until you supply a password.

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Avoiding microprocessor no-brainers
Several times in this book, I note that having the very fastest microproces-
sor is no longer essential for most digital-photography and image-editing
applications. If you have a Windows or Mac system operating at 800 MHz or
faster, you can do just fine. Microprocessor speeds have greatly outpaced
the requirements of most applications, even for processor-intensive appli-
cations such as image editors.
However, if you’re buying a new machine, there’s no reason not to buy one
with the fastest microprocessor available, within reason. The microproces-
sor is what processes many of your program instructions — everything that
isn’t handled by a separate digital signal processing chip. So the faster the
microprocessor runs, the faster your image-editing software will work, gen-
erally speaking.
Each individual element of an image involves from 1 to 4 or more bytes of
information. (An RGB image requires 3 bytes per pixel, a CYMK image needs
4, and additional alpha channels take up 1 byte each.) So, even a relatively
small 640 x 480, 24-bit image can involve nearly 1MB of data.
If you ask your image editor to apply an image-processing filter to an entire
image, your microprocessor must calculate the effects of that filter on every
one of those million bytes. That process can take a second or two with
a very fast system, or as long as a minute or much more with very slow
computers.
And although there are other constraints (such as memory or hard disk
speed), the speed of the microprocessor affects nearly everything you do
on your system. As you might guess, a fast CPU should be a major consider-
ation when assembling a graphics workstation from scratch. You may not
need the very fastest microprocessor available, but, then again, you never
hear anyone complaining that a computer is just too darn fast.
Determining what’s most important
I buy a new computer every year or two and upgrade most other compo-
nents more frequently than that. However, I have kept three pieces of equip-
ment for years and years. I lavish all available funds on the original purchases
and hang onto them as long as possible. Those three items are my display
screen, my keyboard, and my mouse.
This trio comprises the components you work with directly all day, every
day, usually for long periods of time. For efficiency and sanity’s sake, you
should insist that these pieces of equipment be the very best available and
don’t change them capriciously. I liked the IBM keyboard that was furnished
with my IBM PS/2 in 1987 so much that I am still using it a decade and a half
later (even on my Macintosh, thanks to a keyboard/video/monitor switch).
My ball-less infrared mouse has been serving me well for several years, and
I can’t recall exactly how long my beloved 19-inch monitor has been a fixture
on my desk. I look at or touch these components all day, every day, and
they’re worth every penny I spent. I know, it sounds a little kinky, but such
is the life of a technonerd.

What Equipment Do You Need?
For digital photographers, your display and video card are two of the most
important components in your system. You need a video card with at least
64MB of fast memory (or more) so that you can view 24-bit images with 16.8
million colors at resolutions of up to 2048 x 1536 (or more) on a 19- to 24-
inch monitor. A combination like that enables you to examine your photos
closely, array several large images side-by-side, and view pictures at a size
very close to their printed size. Here are some specific recommendations:
✦Unless you also play computer games, you don’t need to spend hun-
dreds of dollars on video cards with video accelerators so powerful that
they require their own fans. Instead, sink your funds into a video card
with enough RAM to display images at high resolution. Think 2-D instead
of 3-D.
✦Consider buying a dual-head video card capable of displaying separate
images on two different monitors. You’ll find that most serious Photo-
shop users and digital photographers work with two monitors (at least).
One monitor can contain your image editor, while another can display a
Web browser or another application. Or, you can move Photoshop’s
palettes to the second monitor to make more room for your images.
Another trick is to use different resolutions for each monitor, say 1920 x
1440 on one for a high res display, and 1024 x 768 for a larger view on
the second monitor. If a Web page is hard to read on my main display, I
often just slide it over to the second monitor at 1024 x 768 for a closer
view. Figure 3-3 shows a dual monitor setup.
✦Two video cards can also give you dual monitor capabilities. When I
upgraded, I purchased an “obsolete” 32MB PCI video card for about 
$40 and installed it in tandem with my system’s original AGP card. I pur-
chased a 17-inch monitor with multiple rebates for a net cost of $49, and
for less than a C-note, I was in dual monitor heaven.
✦Check out the monitor you buy in the store before you purchase it. You’ll
be staring at it all day, so you want a sharp image that you can live with.
✦Until the cost and quality of LCD monitors drops further, don’t buy one
of these unless you’re really cramped for desk space. An LCD monitor
might make a good second monitor, but the models worthy of your
image-editing workstation are still quite expensive.

Choosing pointing devices
Can you sign your name with a bar of soap? No? Can you sign your name
with a pen? If so, you probably would be more comfortable doing graphics
work with a pen-based graphics tablet, rather than a clunky old mouse.
Pressure-sensitive tablets with cordless pens are especially cool. Used with
applications that support pressure-sensitive pads, such as Photoshop, they
enable you to draw thicker lines just by pressing harder. Tablets and pens
are a very natural way of working with graphics; if you can draw, you can
use them faster and more accurately than you can sketch with a mouse.
Trackballs and alternate mice are also choices if you prefer them.

hen you take pictures with a conventional film camera, you end up
with a roll of exposed film that must go to a photo lab or darkroom
for processing and printing using special chemicals and equipment. When
you get the prints back a few hours or days later, you get to see how your
pictures turned out. Often, a fair number of pictures end up in the trash,
and you keep the rest. If you want extra prints or enlargements of the good
shots, it’s back to the lab to order reprints.
One of the great things about digital photography is that you don’t have to
process and print every image you shoot. Most digital cameras let you pre-
view your images right in the camera, so you know immediately how you
did. And you can discard the obvious blunders and bloopers before anyone
else sees them. What remains are the pictures you want to keep (and those
that you want to print).
With digital photography, you don’t need to go to a photo lab to get prints
from your pictures. The darkroom and lab are as close and convenient as
your own computer. But unlike conventional photography, you don’t have a
roll of exposed film to send off for processing. Instead, you move your digi-
tal pictures from your camera to your computer by copying the image files
from one device to the other.
How you do that depends on the features of your camera (and to a lesser
extent, your computer). This chapter addresses the various camera-to-
computer connections you’re likely to encounter.
Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
Before you can use your computer as a digital darkroom to process and
print pictures from your digital camera, you must get your picture files out
of the camera and into the computer. (Go figure.) After you save the images
as files on your computer’s hard disk, you can manipulate them with the
image-editing software of your choice and print them on your printer.
43

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Some printers are capable of accepting images directly from a digital camera
and printing them without going through an image-editing program or 
other software on your computer. These printers have slots that accept the
memory card straight from the camera and usually also have an LCD screen
so that you can preview and perform simple editing before you print. Sassy!
Several technologies for transferring pictures from your camera to your
computer are available. The range of options may seem confusing, but you
don’t need to worry about most of them because a given camera rarely sup-
ports more than one or two options. 
In general, the image-transfer technologies fall into two broad categories:
✦Wired (and wireless) connections: A cable, wire, or other connection
enables you to transfer picture information from the camera to the com-
puter. The communication between your computer and your camera is
similar to that between your computer and other peripheral devices,
such as printers, scanners, or external modems. Some cameras also
support infrared (or IrDA) connections to laptops and desktop comput-
ers with an infrared port.
✦Removable media: The camera stores picture data on a disk or memory
card that you can remove from the camera and then insert into a drive,
slot, or reader on your computer. This process is much like saving files
to a floppy disk and then moving the disk to another computer and
accessing the files there.
Getting wired up
When you look at the back of a typical computer, you see a variety of sock-
ets and ports in different shapes and sizes. Some of them probably have
cables attached that lead to assorted peripheral devices, such as your
mouse and printer. Camera manufacturers can choose from several of these
ports in order to connect the camera to the computer. However, you rarely
find any one camera with more than one type of wired connection. 
Do you find yourself missing USB or FireWire ports? If your PC doesn’t have
the ports to connect your new digital camera, fear not — you can add the
correct port by installing an adapter card. If you’ve never installed a card —
or, for that matter, you’ve never removed the case on your PC — then I can
heartily recommend Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition by Mark L.
Chambers (Wiley). You’ll find everything you need to navigate the mysteri-
ous innards of your PC and add the ports you crave.
Serial cable
The serial port is the old standby for connecting miscellaneous peripheral
devices to a computer. It’s used for everything from external modems to
pointing devices and, of course, many digital cameras. Nowadays, all digital
camera manufacturers use faster connections instead of the older serial
connection, but plenty of older cameras that are still in use rely on a serial
cable. (In other words, don’t buy a digital camera that has a serial connec-
tion, unless you’re collecting antiques.)
44

Book I
Chapter 4
Connecting the Camera
and Computer
Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
A typical desktop computer has two serial ports on the back, like those
shown in Figure 4-1. Look for a flattened D-shaped connector containing nine
small pins. It’s often labeled COM1 or COM2. Occasionally, the serial port
may be a larger, D-shaped connector containing 25 pins, but regardless of
the number of pins, it’s always a male connector. (The male connector con-
tains pins arranged to fit into holes in the female plug at the end of a serial
cable.) If the serial cable that came with your camera has a plug for the 9-pin
connector and your computer has a 25-pin port, you can use an adapter
(available in most computer supplies stores) to make the connection.
For best results, always shut off your computer before adding or removing
cables from the serial, parallel, or PS/2 ports on the back of the computer.
USB and FireWire connections, on the other hand, are designed to be hot
swappable or plug and play, which means you can plug them in and unplug
them while the computer is running.
After you identify the serial port on your computer, you can use the cable
that came with your camera to connect the camera to your computer by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Shut down your computer.
2. Plug one end of the cable into the serial port on your computer.
If two or more serial ports are available, always use the lowest num-
bered port first.
3. Plug the other end of the cable into your camera.
The plug on the camera end of the cable may look like a small telephone
plug or some other special connector. It’s a safe bet that this particular
plug fits in only one place on the camera. However, the socket may be
hidden behind a small door.
4. Turn on the camera and the computer.
Check your camera manual to see if your camera should be turned on
before you boot the computer. That often is the case.
5. Use the camera manufacturer’s software to transfer image files from
the camera to the computer.

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Use your camera’s AC power adapter to run the camera while you have it
hooked up to your computer, transferring files. That way, you don’t run
down your camera’s batteries.
Parallel port
The parallel port is normally used to send information from the computer
to a printer; in fact, it’s often called the printer port. However, the port itself
isn’t restricted to printing duty, and it sometimes gets pressed into service
to handle data transfers for other devices, such as scanners, external drives,
and (rarely) cameras. Nowadays, an external device is more likely to connect
to your computer via USB than the parallel port, but you may still find the
odd scanner or camera that requires a parallel port connection. (Again,
unless you’re scavenging, avoid buying a camera with a parallel connection.)
The parallel port is a D-shaped, 25-pin, female connector. (The connector on
your computer has two rows of small holes, and the plug on the end of the
corresponding cable has two rows of small pins.) The port may be labeled
with LPT1 or a printer icon.
After you identify the parallel port on your computer, follow these steps to
connect the camera to your computer by using the cable that came with
your camera:
1. Shut down your computer.
2. Plug one end of the cable into the parallel port on your computer.
You may need to unplug your printer to make room for the cable from
the camera. Often, the cable from the camera includes an extra plug into
which you can plug the printer cable. This enables both devices to share
the same port.
3. Plug the other end of the cable into your camera.
The plug on the camera end of the cable may look like a small telephone
plug or some other special connector. It’s a safe bet that this particular
plug fits in only one place on the camera. However, the socket may be
hidden behind a small door.
4. Turn on the camera and the computer.
Again, check your camera’s manual to see if the vendor recommends
turning on the camera before you boot the computer.
5. Use the camera manufacturer’s software to transfer image files from
the camera to the computer.
USB
The USB (Universal Serial Bus) port is the all-purpose connection that was
supposed to replace the older serial, parallel, and PS2 (mouse/keyboard)
ports. The older alternatives haven’t gone away yet, but USB is increasingly
becoming the connection of choice for many computer devices, including
digital cameras.
46

Chapter 4
Connecting the Camera
and Computer
Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
USB connections are capable of moving data much faster than the older
serial and parallel connections. USB connections are also hot swappable
(also called plug and play), which means that you can safely plug in and
unplug USB cables without shutting down your computer. You can also
expand the number of USB ports available by adding a hub (a small box con-
taining multiple USB ports) or a device, such as a keyboard or monitor, that
has extra USB ports built in. Then you can plug your camera or other USB
device in to the added ports, just as you can the USB ports on the back of
your computer.
Some older computers may not have USB or FireWire ports built in, and you
can upgrade most of those computers with a relatively inexpensive add-in
card to provide the needed ports. Another potential problem is that older
versions of Windows (Windows 95 and Windows NT 4) or Mac OS (prior to
Version 8.5) don’t support USB. Upgrading to a newer operating system that
does support USB is usually possible, but it’s likely to be more expensive
than a simple hardware upgrade.
The USB port is a small, flat, rectangular socket approximately 3⁄16 x 1⁄2 inch.
You usually find at least two of them on the back of your computer, clearly
marked with a special symbol. USB ports may also be available on the front
of the computer, or on a USB hub (like the one shown in Figure 4-2), or on
a keyboard or other device that has a built-in hub. Note that the faster
species of USB port, called a USB 2.0 port, is fully compatible with older
USB 1.1 cameras, and the ports look the same — your camera will work
with either type of port.

47

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
You can use any USB port to connect your camera to the computer. Just
follow these steps (with your computer still turned on):
1. Plug one end of the cable into the USB port on your camera.
The USB connector is often hidden behind a small door on your camera.
It’s usually a squared off, D-shaped socket, approximately 1⁄4 x 5⁄16 inch. If
your camera includes a standard USB port, you can use a standard USB
cable, which has a rectangular plug on one end and a square plug on the
other. However, some cameras use a smaller mini-USB connection to
save space. In that case, you need to use the special cable supplied with
your camera.
2. Plug the other end of the cable into the USB port on your computer or
USB hub.
3. Insert the camera manufacturer’s disc into your computer if prompted
to do so.
Windows automatically recognizes when a new device is added to a USB
port. The first time you connect your camera to the computer, Windows
may need to load drivers supplied by the camera manufacturer in order
to access the camera.
4. Use the camera manufacturer’s software (or other file-management
software) to transfer image files from the camera to the computer.
FireWire
FireWire connections (formally known as IEEE 1394) are an alternative to
USB connections. Like USB, FireWire transfers data faster than serial and
parallel ports, it’s hot swappable, and you can connect multiple FireWire-
equipped devices to the computer. Because Apple developed FireWire, these
connections are a standard feature on all Macintosh computers built in the
last few years. FireWire is also available for PCs, but you may need to pur-
chase and install an add-in adapter card for your PC.
Two different kinds of FireWire connectors exist, but unlike USB 1.1 and
USB 2.0, FireWire 400 (the original) and FireWire 800 (the much faster new
version) are not shaped the same. At the time of this writing, FireWire 800 is
found only on high-end Macintosh computers, so if your digital camera uses
FireWire, it will have an older FireWire 400 port. To connect a FireWire 400
camera to a FireWire 800 port, you need a converter cable.
FireWire is common only on high-end digital still cameras; you encounter it
more frequently on all types of digital video cameras. But because some dig-
ital video cameras can capture still images as well as digital video, I guess
that qualifies them as digital photography devices.
The FireWire 400 port is a small, rectangular socket that looks somewhat
similar to a USB port. The FireWire port is a little fatter than a USB port, so
you can’t mistakenly plug a FireWire cable into a USB port or vice versa.
To connect your camera to the computer with a FireWire connection, follow
these steps (with your computer still turned on):
48

Book I
Chapter 4
Connecting the Camera
and Computer
Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
1. Plug one end of the cable into the FireWire port on your camera.
The FireWire connector is often hidden behind a small door on your
camera. If your camera includes a standard FireWire port like the one on
your computer, you can use a standard FireWire cable, which has identi-
cal plugs on each end. However, if your camera uses a special cable con-
figuration to save space, you need to use the special cable that came
with it.
2. Plug the other end of the cable into the FireWire port on your 
computer.
3. Insert the camera manufacturer’s disc into your computer if prompted
to do so.
Like USB, Windows automatically recognizes when a new device is
added to a FireWire port and prompts you for a disc if it needs to load
drivers supplied by the camera manufacturer in order to access the
camera.
4. Use the camera manufacturer’s software (or other file-management
software) to transfer image files from the camera to the computer.
Riding the (infrared) light wave
An IrDA (Infrared Data Association) port enables you to transfer computer
data from one device to another by using pulses of infrared light instead of
a physical wire. The process is similar to the way most TV remote controls
send channel and volume adjustment instructions to the TV. Infrared con-
nections are slow and not very reliable, but those drawbacks are countered
by the convenience of not having to poke around the back of your computer
every time you want to make a connection or deal with wires that get tan-
gled and lost.
An IrDA port looks like a small, dark red (nearly black) lens or window. You
find these ports on some digital camera models from Kodak and Hewlett-
Packard, and on some printers and laptop computers, but rarely as stan-
dard equipment on a desktop computer. If your computer doesn’t have an
IrDA port, you can purchase an adapter that will probably connect via a
cable to one of the standard serial or USB ports on your computer.
To use an IrDA port to transfer pictures to your computer, follow these
steps:
1. Turn on your camera and set it for infrared data transfer.
Use the camera’s controls to select the infrared data transfer mode.
Each camera model is different, so refer to your camera’s instructions
for details.
2. Position the camera’s infrared port so that it points toward the
infrared port on your computer. 
Although it’s possible to make an infrared connection from several feet
away, you generally get better results when the two infrared ports are
close together (just a few inches apart). Ensure that no obstructions are
49

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
between the two IrDA ports and that no bright lights (such as sunlight
from a nearby window) are shining on the infrared sensors.
3. Use the camera manufacturer’s software on your computer to start
transferring picture data.
Memory cards and disks
All digital cameras have some form of built-in memory to store the pictures
you shoot. In many cases, the memory medium that the camera uses is a
card or disk that you can remove from the camera. Using removable media
to store image data has a couple of advantages over fixed, built-in memory: 
✦You can swap out a full memory card or disk and insert another to
increase the number of digital photos you can take without erasing
some from memory. It’s like putting a fresh roll of film in a conventional
camera. 
✦You can use the removable memory media to transfer images to your
computer for editing and printing. All you need is a suitable disk drive
or card reader on your computer, and you can read the image files
directly from the disk or memory card without attaching the camera
to the computer.
Manufacturers use several kinds of removable memory devices in digital
cameras. They range from the standard 31⁄2-inch floppy disk to solid state
memory cards, such as SmartMedia or CompactFlash cards, that are
scarcely bigger than a postage stamp.
PC cards
The PC card slot found in laptops accepts PC cards, also known as ATA
Type II PC cards or PCMCIA cards. PC cards come in many forms. They’re
typically used to provide plug-in components, such as modems or network
interface cards for laptop computers. Memory cards and miniature hard
disks also are available in the PC card form. It’s these hard disks and
memory cards that are used in some digital cameras.
A PC card is roughly the height and width of a credit card, and about four
times as thick, with holes for tiny connector pins in one edge. Just about
every laptop computer has at least one socket designed to accept a PC
card. You can also get add-on PC card sockets that fit into a drive bay in a
desktop computer, but it’s rare to find a desktop computer that comes with
a PC card socket preinstalled. It’s more common to attach a card reader
through the USB or FireWire port to read PC cards.
Here’s the lowdown on using PC cards:
✦To remove a PC card from your digital camera (or computer), just press
the eject button next to the card slot to pop the card loose from its con-
nection. Then you can grab the end of the card and pull it out of its slot.
50

Book I
Chapter 4
Connecting the Camera
and Computer
Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
✦To insert a PC card into a laptop computer (or digital camera), insert
the card into the slot, connector-edge first. Slide the card all the way in,
and then press it firmly but gently to seat the connectors along the edge
of the card. If the card won’t go all the way into the slot, you’ve proba-
bly got it in upside down. Flip it over and try again.
✦After you insert the card into your computer, you should be able to
access it as a virtual disk drive. You can use your normal file-management
techniques to copy and move image files from the PC card to your com-
puter’s hard drive. See Book I, Chapter 19, for more on managing your
digital photo files.
CompactFlash cards
CompactFlash cards, like the one shown in Figure 4-3, are used as remov-
able memory in a few other devices, but their primary application is for
image storage in digital cameras. They provide a much smaller and more
efficient form of removable memory than PC cards.
At about 11⁄2 inch square, a CompactFlash card isn’t much larger than 
a postage stamp, and it’s just a little thicker than a credit card. Still, 
there’s room for two rows of holes for connector pins along one edge. All
CompactFlash cards are physically the same size, but they can have various
memory capacities ranging from 4MB to 1GB or more. (A higher-capacity
version seems to come out every few months.)
Figure 4-3:

Flash card,

51

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Card reader attachments are available for your computer. These attach-
ments enable you to read and manipulate the contents of a CompactFlash
card. The card reader is usually a small, external device that attaches to
your computer via a FireWire or USB cable. Sometimes, a card reader for
your computer comes with the camera. If not, you can purchase one from
most computer supply stores for less than $50. PC card adapters are also
available. The adapters enable you to access your CompactFlash cards via
a PC card slot in a laptop computer.
You remove, insert, and access files on CompactFlash cards just like PC
cards. See the bulleted list in the preceding section for details.
CompactFlash cards and SmartMedia cards are often called digital film,
because inserting a memory card into a digital camera is analogous to load-
ing a conventional camera with a fresh roll of film.
SmartMedia cards
SmartMedia cards are similar to CompactFlash cards, but they’re in an even
smaller package. A SmartMedia card is slightly smaller than a CompactFlash
card in height and width, and it’s much thinner — only about the thickness of
a business card. Like a CompactFlash card, a SmartMedia card has connec-
tors along one edge, but the connectors are metallic foil strips instead of
rows of tiny holes. SmartMedia cards come in varying capacities, from 4MB to
256MB or more. SmartMedia cards tend to be one step behind CompactFlash
cards in maximum available capacity, but the card capacity keeps marching
upward.
You use a card reader attachment — similar to the one you would use to read
a CompactFlash card — to access the contents of a SmartMedia card. The
only difference is that the slot in the card reader is made to fit a SmartMedia
card. Card readers with slots for both SmartMedia and CompactFlash cards
are available.
Here’s how to use the SmartMedia card:
✦The SmartMedia card slot on your digital camera is often hidden behind
a small flip-up door. To remove the SmartMedia card from your camera,
open that door and then press in on the edge of the card to activate a
spring-loaded eject mechanism, and then release. When the card pops out
part way, grab the exposed edge of the card and slide it out of its slot.
✦To insert a SmartMedia card into the camera (or card reader), insert the
card into the slot, connector-edge first. Slide the card all the way in, and
then press it firmly but gently to seat the card into the slot. If the card
won’t go all the way into the slot, you’ve probably got it in upside down.
Flip it over and try again. If it pops out part way, try pressing in the edge
of the card again and then release the pressure slowly and gently so as
not to activate the ejection mechanism.
✦When you insert a SmartMedia card into the card reader attached to your
computer, it functions like a virtual disk drive. You copy, move, and erase
image files on the SmartMedia card using the same tools you would use to
work with files on a floppy disk. 
52

Chapter 4

Making the Connection between Camera and Computer
SD (Secure Digital) cards
SD cards are yet another memory card format and are similar to CompactFlash
and SmartMedia cards. SD cards are a newer format that hasn’t been widely
adopted yet; only a few high-end cameras use them. Using an SD card for
image storage is essentially the same as using a CompactFlash card except
that the card itself is slightly smaller, which means that the sockets in the
camera and the card reader must be made to fit the SD card. The Secure
Digital format is not interchangeable with the other formats.
Memory Stick
The Sony Memory Stick is one more form of memory card, functionally simi-
lar to the CompactFlash and SmartMedia cards. Sony uses the Memory
Stick in several of its high-end digital cameras and also in digital video cam-
eras, music players, and so on, which means that you can use your Memory
Sticks in various devices and use them for storing pictures, music, and
other files. 
The Memory Stick is about the size of a stick of chewing gum and comes in
capacities of 32MB to 256MB.
Several models of Sony laptop computers include a built-in Memory Stick
slot so that you can use the laptop computer to access the contents of your
Memory Sticks. You can also use a card reader similar to the card readers
for CompactFlash and SmartMedia cards to access Memory Sticks from
your desktop computer. The card reader is usually supplied with your
camera and attaches to your computer via a USB cable.
Here’s the skinny on using the Memory Stick:
✦To remove a Memory Stick from your digital camera (or card reader),
press the eject button next to the slot to pop the stick loose, and then
grasp the exposed end of the stick and slide it out of its slot.
✦To insert a Memory Stick into the camera (or card reader), insert the
stick into the slot in the direction of the arrow marked on the surface of
the stick. The arrow and a clipped corner help you orient the stick prop-
erly. The stick goes into its slot in only one way. Push the stick in firmly
but gently to seat it properly. 
✦Like the other memory cards, after you insert a Memory Stick into the
card reader attached to your computer, you can access and manipulate
the files on the stick as if they were located on a virtual disk drive. Copy,
move, and erase the files by using your normal file-management tools. 
The Memory Stick includes an Erasure Prevention switch that lets you pro-
tect the contents from accidental erasure. Make sure the switch is in the Off
position when you want to record images onto the stick in your camera or
erase files in the card reader.

Floppy disk
When it comes to removable storage, what could more familiar than the
plain old 31⁄2-inch floppy disk? For years, Sony has built a line of digital cam-
eras that use the ubiquitous floppy disk to store and transfer images. A
floppy disk drive is actually built into the camera. Because floppy disk
drives are standard equipment on almost all computers, you can generally
count on being able to access your images from any computer without wor-
rying about cables, card readers, drivers, or special software.
Unfortunately, the floppy disk isn’t an ideal storage media. At only 1.44MB,
its capacity is puny compared to even the lowest capacity CompactFlash
and SmartMedia cards, and the size of a floppy disk makes it an inefficient
storage medium. Plus, floppies are notoriously unreliable.
The exceptions to the universal availability of floppy disk drives are the
recent Macintosh computers, such as the Apple iMacs, as well as some
extremely lightweight laptop computers. These computers are about the
only ones that don’t come with built-in floppy disk drives. However, even for
these machines, add-on external drives that read floppy disks are available.
If your camera utilizes a floppy disk for storage, here’s how to use it:
✦To remove a floppy disk from your camera, press the eject button next
to the floppy disk slot. When the disk pops out part way, you can slide
the disk out of the drive. 
✦To insert a floppy disk into your camera or the disk drive in your com-
puter, slide the disk into the drive, metal-slide-edge first with the label
facing up. Push in the disk until it clicks in place and the eject button
pops out.
Mini-CD
To combat the problem of the limited capacity of floppy disk drives, Sony
builds some digital cameras with a mini-CD drive in place of the floppy disk
drive. The camera actually includes a CD burner to record picture data onto
mini-CDs, which are smaller versions of standard CD-ROMs. A standard
CD-ROM drive can read the mini-CDs, and because CD-ROM drives are stan-
dard equipment on almost all computers, the mini-CD enjoys the same uni-
versal accessibility as floppy disks. The downside is that mini-CDs aren’t
readily available like floppy disks or even memory cards.
Microdrive
The IBM Microdrive is a tiny hard disk drive that’s a little thicker than the
standard CompactFlash card, but it’s otherwise the same. If your camera is
equipped with a CompactFlash+ Type II slot, you can use the Microdrive.
The Microdrive is a bit pricey, but it provides a lot of storage space for your
images. It’s available in sizes up to 1GB or more. Using the Microdrive is just
like using a standard CompactFlash card except that because it is actually a
miniature hard drive, it must be handled with more TLC than a CompactFlash
card.

Connecting the Camera

Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
As the previous section shows, different digital cameras offer different tools
for connecting the camera to your computer. It may be a direct connection
such as a cable from the camera to a port on your computer, or it may be an
indirect connection such as a memory card or disk that you can remove
from the camera and then insert into a reader or drive attached to your
computer. 
After you make the connection between your camera and your computer,
you may have a few more options available regarding what software you use
to transfer pictures from the camera connection to your computer. Most
digital camera manufacturers supply a software program with the camera
that is designed to handle the task, but you may also have the option of
transferring pictures to your computer using image-editing software or your
computer’s normal file-management utilities.
Transferring pictures using camera utility software
Just about every digital camera on the market today ships with a disc con-
taining a software program designed specifically to transfer pictures from
the camera to your computer. Often, the software has a number of other fea-
tures as well, but its main purpose is to allow you to use your computer to
access the pictures you shot with your camera.
The details of the installation and use of the software accompanying the dif-
ferent digital cameras varies as much as the cameras themselves. It’s not
possible to cover all the programs in detail in this book, but the general
process goes something like this:
1. Make sure that the camera (or card reader) is connected to the com-
puter and is turned on.
This ensures that the software can find the camera/card reader connec-
tion if the installation searches for it. 
2. Insert the disc that came with your camera into your computer’s
disc drive and launch the installation utility (if it doesn’t start 
automatically).
The software disc is usually a CD-ROM, and the installation routine usu-
ally starts automatically a minute or so after you insert the disc into
your computer. However, if the installation doesn’t start automatically,
you can usually get things going by using Windows Explorer to double-
click a file icon labeled Setup or Install. You can probably find the file in
the root folder of the drive where you inserted the disc, or with Macs,
click the program’s icon on the Desktop.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the software.
A couple of mouse clicks to accept the defaults is all it usually takes.
4. Start the camera utility software.
Double-click the desktop icon that the installation program added or
look for the new addition to your Windows Start menu. If the camera or
55

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
card reader is connected and turned on when you start the program, it
will usually find your camera automatically. In some cases, you may need
to help the program locate the camera by choosing a command such as
File➪Connect and selecting the appropriate location in a dialog box. 
5. Click an icon or menu command to view the image files on the camera
(or removable media).
Here’s where the different software programs really go their own way.
You usually use an icon or menu command to display a list of picture
files on your computer. You might even be able to preview the pictures
as thumbnail images.
6. Select the picture files you want to transfer and click an icon or menu
command to begin moving the files to your computer.
Again, the details vary greatly in the different programs, but you usually
click a prominent icon to start the transfer process. If you don’t see an
obvious icon, check the File menu for a command, such as Import.
The same utility program that enables you to transfer pictures from your
camera to your computer often includes features that enable you to edit or
manage your image files. You can also erase pictures from your camera’s
memory after transferring them to your computer so that you have room
to shoot more pictures with the camera. 
After you transfer the images to your computer, you can view, edit, and
print them by using any appropriate program on your computer. The built-
in Windows utilities are sufficient for basic viewing and printing, but you’ll
undoubtedly want to use more capable programs (like Photoshop Elements
from Adobe Systems or Paint Shop Pro from Jasc Software) for most image-
editing tasks.
Copying files to your hard drive
Perhaps the simplest and most straightforward way to move pictures from
your camera to your computer is to treat them like any other computer file.
In other words, you simply use your standard file-handling utilities to copy,
move, and delete the image files. This is the technique you use with most
forms of removable media, and you can often use it with direct camera con-
nections via USB or FireWire as well.
The biggest advantage of this approach is that you don’t need to deal with a
specialized program to access your pictures. Instead, you use familiar tools,
such as Windows Explorer (or, on the Mac, the Finder window) and the File
Open dialog boxes, in your favorite programs.
For this technique to work, your computer’s operating system (Windows or
Mac) must be able to access your camera or card reader adapter as an exter-
nal hard drive. Fortunately, that’s exactly how most memory card readers and
many cameras (most cameras that connect via USB or FireWire) work. They
appear to your computer as virtual disk drives, and you can read, write, and
erase the files on those devices just like you can files on your hard drive or
floppy disk. 
56

Book I
Chapter 4
Connecting the Camera
and Computer
Transferring Images from Camera to Computer
To transfer pictures from your camera to your computer, you can use any
of the same techniques you would use to move files from one disk drive to
another. The only exception is the extra steps needed to connect a virtual
disk (your camera or card reader) to the computer. The following steps
summarize the process:
1. Connect the camera (or card reader) to your computer and turn it on.
After a moment or so, Windows displays a message box saying that it
has found new hardware and is installing the necessary software driv-
ers. An icon appears in the system tray portion of the taskbar next to
the clock.
2. If prompted to do so, insert the manufacturer’s disc containing driv-
ers for your camera or memory card reader.
You only need to do this the first time you attach your camera or card
reader to the computer.
3. Open Windows Explorer or a Mac OS Finder window and navigate to
the virtual disk drive representing your camera or card reader.
Under Windows, you can double-click the My Computer icon on your
desktop to open an Explorer window and then double-click the appro-
priate drive icon to display the contents of the camera memory or the
memory card in your card reader. Look for a new drive letter that doesn’t
correspond to one of the standard disk drives installed in your system.
The name of the drive may be the brand name of your computer or card
reader. (Macintosh owners can dispense with this foolishness because
the drive should automatically appear on your Desktop. If you’re using
Mac OS X Panther, you’ll see the drive listed in the sidebar on the left
side of the Finder window.)
4. Open another Windows Explorer or Mac OS Finder window and navi-
gate to the folder where you want to store the picture files from your
camera.
Be sure to position the two windows on your desktop so that you can
drag and drop between them.
5. Drag and drop one or more files from the first window onto the
second window.
That’s all it takes to copy pictures from your camera to your computer.
Of course, after you connect your camera (or the memory card from your
camera) to your computer as a virtual disk drive, you can use all the stan-
dard tools and techniques to manage your picture files. Under Windows,
the default action for dragging and dropping is to copy the files to their new
location. However, if you click and drag with the right mouse button rather
than the normal left button, Windows displays a context menu that gives you
the option to move the files rather than copy them. The Move command lets
you copy the files to their new location and erase them from the old location
all in one step. You can also return to the first Explorer window and erase
the picture files from your camera memory in a separate operation. 
57

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
You can even copy files from your computer to your camera’s memory so
that you can view the images in the camera. You’re not likely to do that very
often, but it’s possible.
After you finish transferring pictures from the camera to your computer,
don’t forget to disconnect the camera properly. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the device icon in the system tray and choose the Unplug
or Eject Hardware icon from the context menu that appears.
2. In the dialog box that appears, select the camera from the list and
click the Stop button to tell Windows that you want to disconnect the
device.
Windows displays a confirmation message, after which you can physi-
cally disconnect the camera and its cable from the computer.
With a Mac, you should drag the camera’s icon to the Trash before discon-
necting your camera.
Importing images into image-editing software
The normal sequence of events is to use your camera’s utility software to
transfer one or more picture files from your camera to your computer. Next,
you launch your favorite image-editing software and open the image file
to make some adjustments before finally saving or printing the picture.
However, several image-editing programs can do the transferring for you,
which shortens the whole process.
If Windows or Mac OS recognizes your camera or card reader as a mass
storage device (and most such devices that connect to the computer via
USB and FireWire are), then the device and all the files on it appear to
Windows just like any other disk drive. Consequently, to open a picture for
editing in your image-editing program, you simply select the file in the pro-
gram’s File Open dialog box. Make sure the camera is connected and turned
on (and recognized by your operating system) before you attempt to open
files in the photo editor.
In some cases, the image-editing software uses the camera manufacturer’s
software to access images on your camera. You still save time by having
the option to access that software with a menu command or button in the
image-editing software instead of opening the camera software separately.
The process is similar to the way you acquire images from a scanner
directly into your image-editing software. 
The advantage of this technique is that it not only streamlines and automates
the process of using the camera access software, but also often brings the
images directly into the image-editing program without making an intermedi-
ate stop as a file saved on your computer’s hard disk. As a result, you get to
view and edit each image before saving it. 
To transfer images from your camera directly to your image-editing software,
you first need to tell the program what camera you use and where to find it.
Make sure that the camera manufacturer’s software has been installed and is

operating properly on your computer, and then configure your image-editing
software to access images from the camera. The setup process varies depend-
ing on the program, but the following steps are typical:
1. Connect your camera to the computer and turn it on.
2. Choose File➪Import➪Digital Camera➪Configure (or an equivalent
command) in your image-editing program.
The program usually opens a dialog box, but it may also present a sub-
menu instead.
3. Select your camera and (if necessary) the port to which it’s connected;
then click OK to close the dialog box.
After you configure your image-editing software, you can use it to access
images from your camera. Here’s how:
1. Connect your computer to the camera and turn on the camera.
2. Choose File➪Import➪Digital Camera➪Access (or an equivalent com-
mand) in your image-editing program.
A dialog box appears, giving you access to the images stored on your
camera. This is usually a subset of the camera manufacturer’s access
software.
3. Select the image or images you want to open in the image-editing pro-
gram and then click the button or choose the command to begin the
transfer.
The software transfers the selected pictures from your camera to the
image-editing software.
4. If the image-editing software doesn’t return to the foreground auto-
matically, click its button in the taskbar.
The selected images appear in the image-editing program window, ready
for you to begin working with them.

othing shows us more dramatically how digital technology has changed
the face of photography as the ways in which we use prints. We’ve gone
from the days of the daguerreotype, in which every photographic image was
a unique and original hard copy, to the digital age, in which, if we want, a
photograph can exist entirely and solely in electronic form and never be
transferred to a piece of paper or film that we can hold in our hands. The
photographic print has gone from being the normal and expected result of
taking a picture to nothing more than an option.
In the digital age, prints have taken on an additional role as a source for dig-
ital images. If you have a scanner, the photographic fodder for your image-
editing software can come as easily from a hard-copy photograph that
you’ve scanned as from your digital camera. Indeed, some of the happiest
marriages of imagery come from mixing and matching photos that originate
in digital form with pictures that have been created on film, printed on
paper, and then scanned.
Even when you have the choice of viewing your finished photographs on a
computer screen, you have so many reasons for making prints. So, a better
color printer is probably the first accessory that a digital photographer pur-
chases after upgrading to a digital camera. And a scanner used to convert
existing prints and slides into pixels is probably the second accessory that
is considered.
This chapter looks into the factors that you need to take into account when
choosing a printer and a scanner for your digital photography outfit.
Why You Want Prints
Digital pictures are great when you want to show them on your computer
screen, project them on a screen during a presentation, or incorporate
them into your Web page. Even old-fashioned color slides have their uses.
Professional photographers like prints for their unsurpassed reproduction
capabilities. Amateurs have used slides as a tool for lulling neighbors to
sleep during a discussion of their last vacation.

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Yet, when it comes time to share your photographic efforts seriously, noth-
ing beats a print. You can hang a print in a frame over your fireplace. You can
pass around a stack of photos of your kids without worrying whether your
captive audience has the right viewing hardware or software. Photo prints
are used as proofs that are submitted for approval or as samples in a portfo-
lio. When you open an old shoebox of memories that’s tucked away in your
closet, you hope to find a slew of old prints inside, not a stack of Zip disks.
Indeed, students of photography have already noticed a dramatic change in
how the work of the very best photographers can be studied and evaluated
since digital photography became common. The photographic masters of
illustration and photojournalism of the past worked with prints and often
made proof copies, called contact sheets, that contained a rough, uncropped,
uncorrected version of every picture they took. We can look at those old
prints and see how photographic ideas evolved into the famous photos we
know today.
With digital photography, test shots, alternative angles that didn’t work out,
and other material can be erased and forgotten. A digital camera’s Quick
Erase feature can obliterate unwanted photos before they ever reach a com-
puter. Only the best images survive, and only the best of the best make it to
print form.
This doesn’t mean that prints are an endangered species. The same digital
technology that has eliminated some of the need for prints has given us whole
new capabilities that make them more useful than ever. For example, when
shooting pictures on film, you probably let your photofinisher make a print of
every single shot on the roll so that you can see which ones are the “good”
ones. (In these days of double prints, you probably get at least two copies of
every shot, including the blurry ones and the pictures of your shoes.)
With digital photography and inexpensive color printers, you don’t need to
accumulate stacks of 4-x-6-inch prints that you don’t want. You can not only
print just the pictures you want but also easily crop them the way you want
to see them, fix the color, sharpen the blurry parts, and print them as glori-
ous 5-x-7s or 8-x-10s. Digital photographers may not end up with more prints,
but they do have better prints and they like them better, too.
Choosing a Printer for Digital Photography
The good news is that printers that are capable of producing photo-quality
images are cheap to buy, and printers from all the vendors are comparable
in quality, ruggedness, and image quality. If all you want are a few photos
now and then, it’s hard to go wrong. All the well-known printer manufactur-
ers and most of the companies that sell cameras are hard at work building
faster, better, and cheaper printers for you to choose from.
The bad news is that the vendors have a nefarious purpose behind their
industrious efforts. Those who sell printers these days want to make their
devices so easy to use and produce hard copies that are so pleasing to the
eye that you’ll be tempted to make more and more prints. And that’s where
the money is: The cost of special photo papers and inks can easily exceed
62

and Scanner
Choosing a Printer for Digital Photography
the price you paid for a color printer during the first few months of use
alone. So, as you read the descriptions of your printing options that follow,
you need to keep foremost in your mind not just how much the equipment
costs to buy but how much it costs to use. I provide some guidelines and
tips as you go along.
The following sections outline your primary options.
Let somebody else do it
If you don’t need many prints, you can probably get by quite well without
owning a color printer. The color ink cartridges tend to dry out and clog up
if allowed to sit for a month or two without being used, so if you really aren’t
making many prints, you should consider just stopping by your local dis-
count or drug store with your CD and using a standalone kiosk such as the
Kodak Picture Maker. You pay $5 to $7 for a sheet of photos, but think of the
money you’ll save on equipment and dried-out ink cartridges! Many photo-
finishers will accept your “digital film” and deliver a stack of 4-x-6-inch
prints, if that’s what you want. You can even send your images to labs on
the Internet for delivery to you by mail.
Laser printers
If you have a black-and-white laser printer, you can make quick-and-dirty
monochrome prints of your digital images that may be good enough for
many applications, such as pasting up in publishing layouts or creating
simple posters to promote your rock band’s upcoming club date. Color
laser printers, at $900 to $3,000 and up, can create fairly decent full-color
pictures although these pictures don’t have the glossy sheen and true pho-
tographic appearance of some of the other options. Color lasers can be
fairly economical, too, because their color toners are inexpensive and can
be applied to inexpensive ordinary paper stocks. If you have some other
use for a color laser printer (say, printing documents, newsletters, or other
work that uses spot color), these devices can fill in for you as an output
option for the occasional digital photograph.
Ink-jet printers
Ink-jet printers are currently the most popular color output option for digi-
tal photography because they cost very little (decent ink-jets can be pur-
chased for $50 to $300 or more) and supplies for them can be purchased
everywhere, including your average all-night grocery store. Their output
looks almost exactly like a color photograph when printed on special glossy
photo papers. Unfortunately, for each photo that you print, you can pay as
much as 50 cents to $2 for the materials (ink and paper) alone. After paying
$35 for a single-ink-tank color ink cartridge that was good for only 20 to 30
8-x-10-inch prints and then repeating the process once a week for a month, I
junked a perfectly good ink-jet printer and replaced it with another model
that uses separate ink tanks for each color. Now, when I run out of yellow
ink, I drop in a new $8 yellow ink cartridge instead of replacing an entire
single-ink-tank color cartridge. I tried several ink-jet refilling kits, but the ink
seemed to be more easily applied to my hands and clothing than to the car-
tridge that I was refilling. So I like using separate, replaceable tanks, like
those shown in Figure 5-1.
63

Dye-sublimation printers
Dye-sublimation technology is used at the consumer level in small photo
printers that are limited to, say, 4-x-6-inch prints. In those sizes, a typical
$200-$400 dye-sub printer can be fairly economical even though it uses a
fairly complex printing system that involves a roll with a continuous ribbon
of color. Each section of the color ribbon is used only once, so you always
know exactly how many prints you’re going to get before it’s time to refill.
The quality of these printers is unsurpassed but, unlike ink-jet and laser
printers, you can’t use these printers for printing documents. Photos are all
that they can print.
Other printers
You can also find various alternate printing technologies, such as thermal
wax printers, solid-ink printers, and a few other offbeat types, each with its
own advantages. Some of them, called phase-change printers, for example,
can print photo-quality images on ordinary paper, partially offsetting the
cost of their solid wax or resin inks.
Choosing a Scanner
In many ways, digital cameras and scanners are two sides of the same coin,
each with its own advantages and limitations. Both use solid-state sensors

Choosing a Scanner
to capture a digital image of an object, providing you with fodder for your
image editor’s magic. Cameras are portable and can grab images of three-
dimensional objects of virtually any size, at any distance (up to the moon,
and beyond!). For the most part, scanners reside on your desktop next to
your computer, are limited (for the most part) to two-dimensional originals
such as photographs, and can work only with objects that are 81⁄2 x 11 inches
or smaller.
Digital cameras capture an image in an instant; a scanner takes a minimum
of 20 to 30 seconds to produce a scan. High-resolution digital cameras are
expensive; if you want 6 megapixels of information, you can pay $1,000 or
more. A scanner that is fully capable of grabbing 135 megapixels of image
information (1200 samples per inch over an 81⁄2-x-11-inch photo) can cost
less than $100.
Digital photographers carefully select what goes into a digital camera image
through use of composition and lighting; scanners pretty much capture
whatever is already on the original that you slap down on the glass. The
purposes and capabilities of digital cameras and scanners are so different
that if you’re serious about digital imaging, you’ll want both a digital camera
and a scanner.
One of the best things about scanners is that you can do a lot of other
things with them in addition to scanning photographs. Some highlights of
scanners are as follows:
✦Turn printed text into editable text. If you create newsletters and want
to convert hard-copy text documents, such as newspaper clippings, into
editable text, a scanner can use optical character recognition (OCR) to
capture the text and, using software that’s usually bundled with the scan-
ner, translate the image of the text into text files (often with the format-
ting and photos preserved). You can also use OCR with faxes that are
clear and legible to convert those faxes back into an editable document.
✦Photocopy documents. Most scanners have a Copy button on their
front panels. Slap an original down on the glass and press the Copy
button, and the scanner captures the image and directs it to your
printer. It’s almost as good as having a dedicated copy machine.
✦Send faxes. If a scanner can serve as a copier, it also works admirably
as half a fax machine. Regardless of whether your work environment
has a dedicated fax machine, nothing is quicker (or more confidential)
than using your scanner with your computer’s fax modem.
✦Manage documents more easily than you can with microfilm. Some
types of records must be retained in some semblance of their original
appearance, such as documents with signatures, checks, illustrated
reports, and so on. Offices used microfilm for this sort of document in
the past. Today, you can manage documents using a scanner as an input
source and a specialized document-management application to file and
retrieve the images.
✦Capture nonphotographic images. You may have some line art, charts,
logos, cartoons, or other artwork that you would like to have in digital
form. A scanner works as well with nonphotographic images as it does
with photos.
65

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Naturally, this chapter can’t cover all the specifics of selecting, installing,
using, and maintaining a scanner — in fact, the For Dummies series includes
a popular title that’s completely dedicated to scanning. For a comprehen-
sive guide to all things scanner, pick up a copy of Scanners For Dummies,
2nd Edition, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Types of scanners
For digital photography, your choices boil down to one of three kinds of
technology — and several categories — based on price and features. The
three scanner technologies are as follows:
✦Photo scanners: These small scanners are designed specifically for
scanning snapshots and are often used in tandem with equally compact
photo printers. You feed in a snapshot and get a digital image for edit-
ing. Or, you can skip the editing step and direct your scanned output to
a photo printer. You can use such a setup as a sort of photocopier for
prints, which is great when your scanning needs are limited to snap-
shots. These scanners can cost a few hundred dollars.
✦Flatbed scanners: These are the most widely used types of scanners.
They look and operate something like a small photocopier. You open the
lid, place your original face down on the glass, and scan. Flatbeds are
usually limited to scanning 81⁄2-x-11-inch (or sometimes 81⁄2-x-14-inch)
material, but the movable cover makes it simple to grab images of thick
originals, such as books or even some three-dimensional objects. Larger
originals can be scanned in sections and stitched together using your
image-editing software. Some flatbeds have an alternate light source
built in to the lid or available as an add-on that can illuminate trans-
parencies, giving you slide-scanning capabilities. Flatbed scanners can
cost from $50 to $1,000 or more.
✦Slide/transparency scanners: These high-resolution scanners are used
for scanning color slides (in 2-x-2-inch mounts) or strips of film in sizes
from 35mm to 6 cm in width, or sheet film up to 4 x 5 inches (or some-
times larger). Photographers who use transparency or negative film —
or who have archives of these kinds of film — prize the specialized
capabilities of slide scanners. These scanners cannot scan reflective
copy, such as photographic prints. They can easily cost $1,500 or more.
All three types of scanners use similar components. All have a place to posi-
tion the original to be scanned. A light source reflects off the surface of the
original or transilluminates it (in the case of transparencies or negatives).
A high-resolution sensor captures the original one line at a time either by
moving past the surface of the original or by capturing light that’s reflected
from a moving mirror. Electronics inside the scanner convert the analog
information that the sensor captures into digital form.
Scanner prices and features
Like digital cameras, flatbed scanners fall into several fairly well-defined price
and feature categories. You can find point-and-shoot scanners just like you
can find point-and-shoot digital cameras. General-purpose and advanced
scanners, as well as true professional scanners, are also available.
66

Chapter 5
Choosing a Printer
and Scanner
Choosing a Scanner
Unlike digital cameras, the primary criterion that’s used to choose a scanner
is not the resolution of the scanner. Virtually all scanners on the market claim
to have roughly the same resolution, even though in practice, the image qual-
ity of these devices can vary widely, even among those with similar specifica-
tions. The primary features that you should look for when choosing a scanner
are the image quality, speed, and convenience. I address these issues sepa-
rately later in the chapter; I concentrate on general specifications and fea-
tures for the main flatbed scanner categories first.
Entry-level scanners
Entry-level scanners are the $50 to $150 scanners that you see on special at
your local electronics superstores. They are designed for the casual scan-
ner user, someone who needs to grab an occasional photo or who doesn’t
have particularly high quality standards.
All you get with one of these scanners are simple scanning capabilities.
They’re often quite slow and use inexpensive sensors that often can’t cap-
ture the kind of sharp image that a digital photographer expects. They’re
typically connected via USB port and they’re easy to use, which makes
them ideal for scanning neophytes, but they usually aren’t expandable with
accessories, such as transparency adapters. Don’t expect even a “lite” ver-
sion of Photoshop to be bundled with a scanner like this; many are fur-
nished only with the most basic image-capturing and -editing software.
Entry-level scanners are a good introduction to scanning for people who
don’t know whether they want to get heavily involved with image editing.
These scanners are also good for noncritical applications, such as photo-
copying, faxing, or grabbing images for Web pages.
Intermediate scanners
Spend $150 to $250, and you can purchase an intermediate scanner with
better quality, higher speed, more features, and a great deal more versatil-
ity. These scanners have enough quality to please all but the pickiest digital
photographers and are fast enough that you won’t fall asleep between scans
when you’re capturing a stack of photos on a lazy afternoon.
Intermediate scanners usually have all the convenience features that you
could want (and again, they typically use a USB 1.1 connection). Your new toy
will probably have front-panel buttons that let you scan an item, make a pho-
tocopy, send a fax, or attach a scan to an e-mail. Some scanners can be aug-
mented with simple attachments for scanning slides and usually include a
good selection of software, such as optical character recognition programs,
stitching programs that let you stitch together multiple scans into a single
image, and image-management programs.
Advanced (or business) scanners
Serious digital photographers will probably be happiest with a scanner in
this category. Priced at $300 to $400 and up, these units include everything
that you need to scan and manipulate photos and other originals and to
produce better quality, and they are faster to boot (using USB 2.0, FireWire,
or SCSI connections).
67

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
You can find lots of flatbed scanners with slide-scanning capabilities in this
group as well as a few models with automatic document feeders so that you
can scan whole stacks of originals one after another. The image quality is
better, especially when you need to pull detail out of inky shadows or bright
highlights. Improved speed can be very important, because owners of these
scanners can spend a lot of time using them.
Expect a rich treasure-trove of software with a scanner in this class, includ-
ing a capable image editor (probably along the lines of Adobe Photoshop
Elements), OCR software, document-management software, fax software, and
specialized image-manipulation applications, such as applications that let you
create panoramas from multiple photos (also called stitching applications).
Professional scanners
Actually, I’m not sure whether a professional category exists in scanners
anymore. The advanced, or business, scanners described in the preceding
category can handle most needs of digital photographers and others who
aren’t using their scanner professionally. True graphics professionals are
really the only people who need to spend $500 to $2,000 or more for a
flatbed scanner, and then only if they need some of the special capabilities
that these scanners provide. Again, you’re in USB 2.0, FireWire, and SCSI ter-
ritory when it comes to connections.
Scanners in this category have all the features that are found in the advanced
category, but these scanners augment those features with the very best
optics, sensors, and electronics available. You truly get the very best scans
with these models, particularly if you know how to use the features.
These scanners are also very rugged, having what the automakers used to
call, euphemistically, “road-hugging weight.” You can bang one of these scan-
ners around without throwing anything out of alignment, and you can expect
them to scan hour after hour, day after day, without protest.
These are the scanners to consider if you are scanning larger originals. An
81⁄2-x-14-inch scanning bed is a must, and some models have 11-x-17 or larger
scanning beds.
Don’t expect to get a copy of Photoshop bundled with one of these models.
Anyone who can afford one of these scanners undoubtedly already has a
copy (or two) of Photoshop on hand. You can expect to receive a high-end
scanning program, though, with dozens of controls and adjustments so that
scans can be both automated as well as fine-tuned to the nth degree.
What scanner features do you need?
You find a lot of overlap in features within and between the various flatbed
scanner categories. Some features are more useful than others for the digi-
tal photography–inclined. Other features can be deceptive. I spend a little
time on the two most misunderstood features, resolution and the number
of colors captured, later in this chapter, and I describe the other features
briefly in this section.
68

Chapter 5

Choosing a Scanner
Scan quality
Scan quality is different from resolution, as I describe in the section
“Resolution mythconceptions,” later in this chapter. Resolution of the
sensor is only one of the factors that affect scan quality. The others include
the number of colors, or dynamic range of the scanner; the quality of the
optics; and the electronics that are used to translate the scanned image for
your computer. The most important thing that you want to think about is
How good does the final scan look? Often, you need to rely on reviews in
magazines or at Web sites — or your own testing — to determine this.
Scanner speed
Some scanners operate much faster than others. One scanner may capture
an 8-x-10 image at 300 samples per inch in 20 seconds, whereas another may
require a minute and a half. You may not care about the speed if you make
one scan a day. If you’re making 100 scans a day, speed matters. Reviews
may tell you how fast a scanner is, relatively speaking, but you still may
want to test a scanner before you buy it, using your own documents and a
computer that’s similar to your own.
Scanning size
Flatbed scanners have a fixed-size scanning bed, usually 8.5 x 11.7 inches to
8.5 x 14 inches. Even though you may rarely scan a 14-inch-long original, the
larger size is handy to have. I often slap down a bunch of 4-x-6-inch prints
and scan them all at once, cropping and sizing within Photoshop. It’s nice to
have a larger scanning bed to accommodate more and larger originals when
you need to.
Physical size
If your desktop space is limited, you may want a smaller scanner. I favor
larger scanners because they tend to stay put without sliding and can better
ignore vibrations when heavy-footed colleagues or family members stride
past. In any case, even the largest flatbed scanners are likely to be half to two-
thirds the size of the behemoths of five years ago, so you don’t have to worry
about handing over half your desktop to your image grabber.
Bundled software
If you’re already well equipped with software, you probably don’t need to
worry about the bundle that’s furnished with your scanner. I have several
copies of Adobe Photoshop Elements that came with scanners that I have,
but I rarely use this software. Of more interest to me are the advanced 
scanning programs, such as the versatile Silver Fast application that came
with my high-end Epson scanner.
You may be more interested in optical character recognition software (to
convert documents to editable text), copy utilities (to let you use your scan-
ner as a photocopier), document-management programs (to let you file doc-
ument images and retrieve them by keywords), and other software, such as
applications that let you stitch images together to create panoramas.
69

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Type of sensor
The kind of sensor that is used in a scanner can affect how you use the scan-
ner. In the past, Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) sensors were the most common
sensors used in consumer scanners. These solid-state devices capture an
image that is conveyed by a sophisticated optical system, often a path
measuring a foot or more in length, as mirrors and optics convey the light
that’s reflected from the original to the sensor itself.
More recently, a less expensive solid-state sensor, called a contact-image
sensor (CIS), has been used, especially for lower-priced scanners. A CIS
moves beneath the glass a few scant millimeters from the original in a much-
simplified system that requires no optical path. CIS scanners can be very
thin and compact (because there is no need to leave room for an optical
path), and they use inexpensive red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) instead of the fluorescent light tubes that are found in CCD scanners.
This permits a cheaper scanner, for the following reasons:
✦CIS scanners often produce poorer quality than the more sophisticated
CCD-sensor units produce. Although quality is improving (some $150 to
$200 CIS scanners produce great quality), this technology has not been
associated with the best overall quality.
✦CIS scanners typically have very little depth of field, which means that
they can scan only flat originals that are held in tight contact with the
scanning glass. Even a wrinkle in a paper original can affect the sharp-
ness of some CIS scanners. You can also forget about scanning three-
dimensional objects with these scanners.
Until CIS sensors catch up with their CCD counterparts, you should proba-
bly stick with a CCD-based scanner when making your purchase.
Scanner interface
The kind of interface that is used to connect your scanner to your computer
was once an important consideration. Back in the early ’90s, you had to
choose between SCSI or parallel port scanners, or even slow serial connec-
tions. Some scanners required a proprietary interface card.
Today, virtually all scanners come with Universal Serial Bus (USB) or IEEE
1394 (FireWire) connections, or both; SCSI scanners are still available, but
they’re a rapidly dying breed. Either USB or FireWire is fast enough for the
typical scanner; choose one with the interface that is available with your
computer. (I recommend a USB 2.0 scanner if your computer supports this
faster version of USB — you’ll thank me when producing really large scanned
files.)
Color depth
Color depth indicates the number of different colors that a scanner can cap-
ture. Color depth, measured in bits, is called the bit-depth. For example, a
24-bit scanner can capture 16.8 million different colors, while 30- to 48-bit
scanners can capture billions of colors. Most of the vendor-supplied specs
about color depth are misleading or false, so I don’t advise paying much
attention to color-depth specs, unless you’re scanning transparencies (which
require so-called deep color capabilities). Most of what you think you know
70

Book I
Chapter 5
Choosing a Printer
and Scanner
Choosing a Scanner
about scanner resolution and color depth is wrong anyway. I explain both in
more detail in the next section.
Resolution mythconceptions
I’ve written eight books solely on scanners since 1990, and I’ve tested and
reviewed hundreds of scanners for the major computer magazines and Web
sites. During this time, one thing that hasn’t changed in the last dozen-plus
years has been all the fuss over scanner resolution. I’ve received scanners for
testing that were packed in large boxes with 12-inch lettering on the side pro-
claiming 2400 x 2400 RESOLUTION in garish tones. A scanner is invariably
described as “a 1200-dpi, 36-bit color scanner” or some similar terminology,
as if those terms summed up the most important qualities of that scanner.
Well-meaning people write and ask me what resolution they should look for in
a scanner. All the scanner books that I’ve seen, including my own, include rec-
ommendations on what scanner resolution to use for particular tasks.
I’m about to share a little secret with you: Resolution is not the most impor-
tant specification to consider when choosing a scanner. It’s not even the
most important determiner of the scanner’s final quality. The optical system
and other attributes of the sensor are more important. Even the smooth-
ness of the sensor/mirror transport system can be important. To make mat-
ters worse, the resolution figures that vendors quote are likely to be false or
misleading. And to top it off, unless you are scanning tiny objects that have
lots of detail, you rarely have any use for a scanner’s top resolution in the
first place. Resolution figures are not only a myth, they’re a dangerous myth.
Until you’ve seen a 600-spi (600 sample-per-inch) scanner that produces
better images than a 2400-spi scanner, you won’t believe this, but it’s true.
To see why this is true, you need to know how the manufacturers arrive at
those figures.
Resolution is calculated from the number of individual sensors in the sensor
array that captures an image. This array is a narrow horizontal strip that
extends along the width of the scanner. There is one element for each pixel in
that width. For example, an 8.5-x-11.7-inch flatbed with “true” optical resolu-
tion of 1200 spi has 10,200 elements along the array’s width. The sensor itself
is less than 8.5 inches wide, of course, because the optical system focuses the
image onto the sensor’s somewhat narrower width.
The scanner grabs one line at a time by moving the sensor (or a mirror that
reflects through the optical system to the sensor) some distance between
lines. If the scanner sensor/mirror carriage moves 1⁄1200 of an inch between lines
in the vertical direction, the scanner is said to have an optical resolution in
that direction of 1200 spi. So, your scanner may be described as having a true
resolution of 1200 (horizontal) x 1200 (vertical) samples per inch.
Some vendors try to play tricks by moving the sensor a fraction of a full line
between scans — say, 1⁄2400 inch — so that they can claim perhaps 1200-x-2400-
spi resolution. In practice, blurring caused by the motion of the carriage
probably wipes out any resolution that is gained through this trick, so the
spec that’s reported by the vendor is already wrong on at least one count.
True resolution also depends on the sharpness of the optical system that is
used to focus the image on the sensor, so unless the optics are top quality,
even the horizontal resolution measurement doesn’t really mean a lot.
71

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Things get even more confusing when vendors quote interpolated resolution,
which is a figure that’s derived from mathematical algorithms that are used to
calculate what pixels would exist if the scanner were capable of capturing
them. So, you may have a scanner that boasts 1200-x-1200-spi optical resolu-
tion and up to 9600-x-9600-spi interpolated resolution, and neither figure tells
you much about the quality of the image.
If resolution is really important to you, the best way to estimate the kind of
quality that you can expect from a given scanner is to read the laboratory
reviews that many magazines publish or to test the scanner yourself. I’ve
seen 1200-x-1200-spi CIS scanners that were terrible and 600-x-600-spi CCD
scanners that were twice as good at half the resolution.
Color-depth confusion
The other misleading specification quoted for scanners is their color depth.
Does it really make a difference whether a scanner is a 24-bit, 30-bit, or 
48-bit unit? In practice, color depth — which is better thought of as dynamic
range — does make a difference. Greater dynamic range lets you capture
better-quality images, with more detail in the shadows and highlights.
Unfortunately, most of the dynamic range figures that are quoted by vendors
are as misleading and inaccurate as their resolution figures.
Why do you need all those colors? A 4-x-5-inch photo that’s scanned at 200 spi
has only 800,000 different pixels. Even if every pixel were a different color,
you would need only 800,000 unique colors to represent them all. Surely, the
16.8 million colors in a 24-bit image are enough, but alas, that’s not true. First,
scanners lose a lot of information because of noise in the electronic system.
Imagine trying to watch TV while a lively party is going on all around you.
Conversation, people walking, and even the tinkling of glasses provides extra-
neous noise that degrade the sounds that you hear from the TV. You’re trying
to listen to something while surrounded, quite literally, by noise. Scanners are
subject to the same interference, but this interference is random electrical
noise. Even a 30-bit scanner may barely end up with 24 bits of information
after the signal-to-noise factor is included.
Moreover, the greater range of colors in some types of originals, particularly
color transparencies, means that more colors must be available from the
scanner to represent them accurately. To capture detail in very dark areas
(called D-max areas by the techies) as well as in the very lightest areas
(called D-min areas), you need a heck of a lot of information. That’s where
extra color depth is valuable.
Unfortunately, scanner vendors quote dynamic range figures based on theo-
retical constraints rather than the real-world performance of their scanners.
I’ve seen 48-bit scanners that actually produced no better than 24-bit scans.
I’ve gotten superior results from scanners from more conservative vendors
who claimed no more than 36-bit dynamic ranges.
Scanners that are touted for their transparency-scanning capabilities usu-
ally have the best overall color-depth performance. But, as with resolution,
if dynamic range is important to you, you’re better off relying on independ-
ent lab results from the magazines or Web sites, or testing the equipment
yourself.

ost digital cameras have everything you need to take great pictures,
right? And they’re not really very expandable because they usually
have a nonremovable lens, a built-in flash, close-up capabilities, and other
features that you may normally purchase as accessories for film cameras.
What more could you want?
A lot. One of the most diabolic things about photography is that as you use
the capabilities of your camera equipment, you always find even more inter-
esting things that you could do if you just had this accessory or that gadget.
A digital camera with a long zoom lens, for example, makes you wish you
had a longer zoom. Discovering ways to use your digital camera’s built-in
flash effectively can make you yearn for a bigger, better external flash.
When the bug really hits you, you start searching for previously unknown
accessories to help you do things you didn’t even know could be done.
You’ll even think up ways in which having a second digital camera can help
you (as a spare, as a smaller camera to keep constantly on hand, and so
on). Once you become serious about photography, accessory-itis is sure to
strike. I say this from the viewpoint of someone who currently owns more
than a dozen single-lens reflex cameras, a clutch of digital cameras, some 15
lenses, eight or nine flash units, and a closetful of close-up attachments, fil-
ters, and other add-ons.
Don’t fight it. Enjoy your incurable disease. You can have a lot of fun playing
with your accessories, and most of them don’t cost that much, anyway. They
help you shoot better pictures, too. This chapter highlights some of the most
common — and most needed — accessories for digital photography.
Getting Support from Tripods
A tripod is a three-legged stand, as shown in Figure 6-1, that is designed to
hold your camera steady while a picture is composed and taken. Although
a tripod may be a little cumbersome to carry around, it is indispensable at
times. A tripod can do the following things for you:
✦Hold the camera steady for longer exposures. You need a slower shut-
ter speed to capture an image in dim light.
73

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
✦Hold the camera steady for photos that are taken at telephoto zoom
settings. Telephoto settings do a great job of magnifying the image, but
they also magnify the amount of vibration, or camera shake. Even tiny
wobbles can lead to photos that look like they’re out of focus, when
they’re actually just blurry from camera movement. A tripod can help
eliminate this sort of blur.
If your pictures keep ending up fuzzy when the camera is set for its max-
imum telephoto zoom setting, the problem is more likely to be camera
shake than a poor autofocus mechanism. At long zoom settings, most
digital cameras often switch to a slower shutter speed. The slower shut-
ter speed, coupled with the telephoto’s magnification of the tiniest bit
of camera shake, leads to a photo that appears out of focus. The picture
is not out of focus; the camera has just been vibrating. Mounting the
camera on a good, sturdy tripod is the best cure for this problem.
✦Hold the camera in place so that you can get in the picture, too, by
using your digital camera’s self-timer feature. This way, you only have
to worry about how you look as you make a mad dash to get into the
picture.
✦Allow precise positioning and composition so that you can get exactly
the image that you want. This is especially important when taking mul-
tiple shots from the same spot, and it is useful if you’re experimenting
with filters or trying different lighting ideas.
✦Hold the camera for multipicture panoramic shots that you stitch
together into one photo in your image editor. I discuss panoramas in
greater detail in Chapter 12 of Book I.
74
Getting multiple shots with a tripod
Here’s a trick that shows you just how useful a
tripod can be. Multiple shots can be merged to
solve difficult lighting situations. That’s because
using a tripod also allows multiple images from
exactly the same camera position. This is important
because it can help the photographer correct prob-
lems with lighting that delivers too much contrast.
Many times, a scene is lit in such a way that the dif-
ference between the brightest white and the dark-
est black is greater than the sensor can handle.
When this happens, pictures end up with areas that
are solid white or solid black and have no detail in
them.
When circumstances permit, pros correct this by
taking two or more images of exactly the same
scene with the camera mounted on the tripod. The
first image is exposed so that the highlights are
properly exposed; the second is exposed to let the
shadows have detail. When in doubt, take one 
picture that’s a little overexposed and one picture
that’s a little underexposed. (One setting above
what the camera recommends and one setting
below what the camera recommends is a good
rough estimate.) Some cameras have this capabil-
ity, usually called auto exposure bracketing, built in.
Back at the computer, the two images are merged
in an image-editing program such as Photoshop so
that the combined image carries detail throughout
the picture. Using this technique may stretch your
comfort zone with both your computer and your
camera, but it can also help you improve many
photos, such as scenics, that can be taken with the
camera mounted on a tripod. You can always take
an extra shot at the setting that the camera recom-
mends so that you still have the shot you would
have gotten anyway. That’s one of the nice things
about digital cameras; you don’t have to worry
about “wasting” shots!

Getting Support from Tripods
Because most modern digital cameras are pretty lightweight, you don’t
need to carry a massive tripod like many pros do; just be sure that the
tripod is strong enough to keep the camera steady. Beware of models that
claim to go from tabletop to full height (roughly eye level at 5 feet or more);
odds are, they sway like a reed when fully extended.

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Types of tripods
Tripods come in several types of materials, styles, and sizes. Pro units are
capable of handling heavy cameras and extending 5 to 6 feet high. These
tripods are made of wood, aluminum, or carbon fiber and may cost from
a couple of hundred dollars to a thousand dollars or more. You probably
don’t want one of these pro units. Your ideal tripod is probably a compact
model made of aluminum. The common types of tripods are as follows:
✦Less expensive units: These may range in size from 1 foot to 5 feet tall
and cost just a few dollars to a hundred dollars or more.
✦Full-sized models: These range from 4 to 6 feet tall when fully extended
and may have from two to four collapsing sections to reduce size for
carrying. The more sections, the smaller the collapsed tripod. The
downside is that the extra sections reduce stability and provide more
points in which problems can develop.
✦Tabletop tripods, or “minitripods”: These are promoted as lightweight,
expandable, and easy to carry, which they are. They’re also promoted to
be sturdy enough for a 35mm camera, which they probably aren’t —
unless they’re set to their lowest height. However, most can easily
handle a digital camera, and they can be small enough to carry around
comfortably. If used on a tabletop or braced against a wall with a small
digital camera, these units can do a decent job. They can come in handy
in places where you don’t have enough room to use a full-sized tripod.
To use a minitripod against a wall, brace it against the wall with your
left hand while pressing your left elbow into the wall. Use your right
hand to help stabilize the camera while tripping the shutter. Keep your
right elbow tight against your body for added stability.
✦Monopods: While not exactly a tripod (monopods have only one leg
versus three), a monopod can help reduce camera shake. These single-
leg, multisegment poles can just about double the steadiness of the
camera, compared to simply steadying it by hand.
✦Hiking-stick monopods: Another option is a combination hiking stick/
monopod. If you do a lot of hiking, these can be very worthwhile.
Although not as sturdy or stable as a high-quality monopod, these
hybrids can work well with the typical small digital camera. Most of
them have a wooden knob on top that unscrews, leaving a 1⁄4-inch screw
that mates with the camera’s tripod socket. (Check to make sure that
your digital camera has a tripod socket; not all models do.) Mount the
camera on the hiking stick, brace the bottom of the stick against your
left foot, pull it into your body with your left hand, and gently squeeze
the shutter-release button.
Scrutinizing tripod features
Not all tripods are made alike, so it pays to take a close look at how the
tripod you’re thinking of purchasing is put together. I cover what you
should look for in a tripod in the following sections.
Locking legs
All collapsible tripods offer some way of locking the legs into position. Most
common are rings that are twisted to loosen the legs or tighten the legs in
76

Book I
Chapter 6
Accessorizing Your
Digital Camera
Getting Support from Tripods
place. Some manufacturers use levers instead. When buying a tripod, check
this part closely. Remember, every time you want to fully extend or collapse
the tripod, you’re going to have six or more of these locks to manipulate. A
good tripod lets you open or close all the locks for one leg simultaneously
when the legs are collapsed. (It works like this: Cover all three rings at the
same time with your hand and twist; they’re all released, and then with one
simple movement, they’re all extended. This procedure is also used in
reverse.)
Range of movement
Some tripod legs can be set to a right angle from the camera mount. This
feature can be handy if you’re working on uneven ground, such as a hiking
trail.
Extra mounting screws
Some tripods offer an extra mounting screw on one of the legs. Hypothetic-
ally, this is useful, but its use is rare enough that I wouldn’t choose one
tripod over another just for this feature. A more useful extra is a center
column post that can accept a camera on its low end (for ground-level
shots) or that has a hook that holds a weight or camera bag. Placing extra
weight on a tripod makes it steadier for longer exposures, so this capability
is very useful.
Heads
A tripod head is the device that connects the camera to the tripod legs. On
inexpensive tripods, these heads are frequently permanently attached. On
better-quality models (although not necessarily expensive ones), the heads
are removable and can be replaced with a different type. Quite a few different
styles of tripod heads are available. Many tripod heads that offer a panning
capability (the ability to spin or rotate the camera on its horizontal axis) also
offer a series of 360 markings (one for each degree of rotation) to help orient
the camera for panoramas. Consider the following types of tripod heads:
✦Pan/tilt heads: These allow you to spin the camera on one axis and tilt it
on another. These are generally the cheapest and most labor intensive,
because you have to make adjustments to multiple levers to reposition
the camera.
✦Fluid, or video, heads: These usually have a longer handle that extends
from the head. Twist the grip to loosen it, and you can pivot and tilt the
camera simultaneously.
✦Joystick heads: Similar to the fluid or video head, this type has a lock-
ing lever that’s built into a tall head. By gripping the lever and head and
squeezing, you can pan and tilt the camera quickly and easily. These
heads were designed and marketed for 35mm cameras, but they don’t
work particularly well for these cameras because they’re subject to
creep. Basically, creep occurs when you reposition your camera on a
tripod head and lock it, and then notice the camera move a little as it
settles into the locked position. Creep can be a very annoying problem
with any tripod head, but the joystick models seem to have the most
77

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
trouble with it. Note: For a smaller digital camera, these heads may be a
better choice simply because these cameras weigh so little.
✦Ball heads: These are probably the most popular style with pro photog-
raphers because they provide a full range of movement for the camera
with a minimal amount of controls to adjust. This type of tripod head, as
shown in Figure 6-2, uses a ball mounted in a cylinder. The ball has a
stem with a camera mount on one end, and when the control knob is
released, you can move your camera freely until reaching the top of the
cylinder. A cutout on one side of the cylinder allows the stem to drop
low enough for the camera to be positioned vertically. Ball heads range
in price from just a few dollars to $500 or more. The best ones don’t
creep, which is why photographers pay so much for them.

Checking out tripod alternatives
Several other items on the market are also worth considering for those who
need to travel light. A tried and true classic for supporting bigger camera/lens
combinations is the beanbag. Whether you use the basic beanbag that you
tossed around as a kid or the one that’s specially designed for photography,
by putting the bag on a wall or car roof and then balancing the lens on the
bag, you can maneuver your equipment easily while letting the wall or car
take the weight of the lens.
You can also find a number of clamp-like devices coupled with the 1⁄4-inch
screw that’s necessary to attach them to your camera’s tripod socket. You
then clamp the camera to a tree limb, fence post, or other solid object, and
voilà! — instant tripod (don’t add water).
These camera-holding clamps range from a modest C-clamp device for just
a few bucks up to the Bogen Super Clamp system (www.bogenphoto.com).
The basic Super Clamp costs around $30. The basic C-clamp style should
do the job for travelers who use a shirt-pocket-sized digital camera. Those
working with one of the larger, SLR-style digital cameras may want to con-
sider buying a Super Clamp. Your local camera store can help you decide
which type is right for you.
Making Good Use of an Electronic Flash
Because available light (more commonly known as available darkness) is
undependable, digital photographers should consider carrying an acces-
sory flash unit. Although most digital cameras have some sort of built-in
flash capability, these flash units don’t produce a very powerful light. The
built-in flash unit is usually good only for a range of up to about 8 feet,
which isn’t always enough.
Accessory flash units do more than just provide extra light when it’s too
dark to shoot without it. Although I cover accessory lighting more thor-
oughly in Chapter 9 of Book I, make note of the following situations in which
an accessory flash is useful:
✦Fill flash: Is your subject standing in the shadows while another part of
the scene is brightly lit? Trust your camera’s light meter, and you’ll either
get a properly exposed subject and overexposed area where the light was
too bright, or you will end up with an unrecognizably dark subject and an
okay scene. Using an accessory flash lets you balance the light through-
out the scene by exposing for the bright area and using the flash to light
up the shadows.
✦Painting with light: You may want to take a picture of a building or other
large structure, and it’s, shall we say, pitch dark outside. One technique
for handling this situation is known as painting with light. Set your camera
on a tripod or something equally solid and then pull out your accessory
flash unit. Set your digital camera to its bulb or time-exposure setting if it
has one; if it doesn’t, use the longest exposure possible. While the shutter
is open, use your flash to light up sections of the building one section at a
time. Here’s where the true wonder of the digital camera comes in: You
79

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
can check your photo as soon as you’re done taking it. Although film pho-
tographers have been using this technique for years, they never knew
whether they got it right until they got their prints developed.
✦Macro, or close-up, photography: Getting in close calls for lots of light
simply because as the camera gets closer to its subject, the area of sharp
focus — or depth of field — diminishes. Using your external flash helps
provide enough light to allow an aperture setting for greater depth of
field. The external flash also provides more even illumination for your
subject. You should use a setup that allows your flash unit to operate
while off the camera because lighting your subject from the side brings
out more detail than lighting from straight ahead. Some flash units, such
as ring lights, are specifically designed for macro photography. (I take a
look at ring lights in the section “Lighting/flash accessories,” later in this
chapter.)
✦Bounce flash: Many accessory flash units include a tilt/swivel head that
lets you point the unit toward a reflective surface instead of right at
your subject. By bouncing the flash off the surface and toward your sub-
ject, you create softer light and shadows than you would if the flash
were directed straight at your subject.
Bouncing a flash unit this way weakens its effective output, because the
light has to travel a greater distance to reach the subject. This isn’t a
problem if the surface is reasonably close, but distance matters. Beware
of cathedral ceilings!
✦Multiflash: You can use multiple flash units to create a lighting setup
that comes reasonably close to studio lighting. By positioning these
flashes properly, you can either create a nicer portrait lighting setup or
distribute the lights well enough to evenly illuminate an entire room.
Built-in flash units can also speed the camera’s battery drain tremendously.
Because they’re positioned right above the lens, the built-in strobes are also
a prime cause of red-eye. This is a reddish tinge in human pupils (it’s green-
ish or yellowish in many animals). Red-eye is particularly difficult to pre-
vent when photographing young children with a flash. An accessory flash
can help reduce this effect because you can position it farther from the lens
than a built-in unit.
Many higher-end digital cameras offer some method of triggering an acces-
sory flash unit, either by a cable connection or via a hot shoe — the device
on a digital camera that holds an external flash and provides an electronic
connection to the camera. Many amateur and entry-level digital cameras,
however, offer no such provision. In this case, the answer is to use a “slaved”
flash that’s specifically designed for digital cameras. (I discuss this in more
detail in the next section.)
Types of electronic flash units
As many different electronic flash units are available as there are digital
cameras. The following sections give you a quick rundown on the kinds of
flash units that you should consider.
80

Book I
Chapter 6
Accessorizing Your
Digital Camera
Making Good Use of an Electronic Flash
Before buying flash equipment of any kind, be sure that it works with your
camera. Flash units can be triggered via the camera’s hot shoe, by electronic
slaves, by wireless radio triggers, and via several different types of cables.
Some cameras can use a generic, old-fashioned connection called a PC cable.
These cables are inexpensive and work with any camera that has a PC con-
nection, but all they do is trigger the flash unit. A camera’s manufacturer
makes another type of cable that is known by several different designations
(for example, TTL and E-TTL). This type is specifically designed for the manu-
facturer’s cameras (and sometimes for just one segment of its camera line)
and no other, although these cables work with third-party flashes. The advan-
tage of these types of flash cords (which are much more expensive than PC
cords) is that they allow the camera and flash unit to communicate with each
other so that the camera can turn the flash’s output off when the camera
determines that the proper exposure has been reached.
Small, light “minislaves”
These units are designed to help augment the camera’s built-in flash unit.
They’re generally useful for adding a little extra dimension to your lighting
and as a way of filling in background areas. These units are slaved to fire
when another flash unit goes off. Such photographic slaves are photoelec-
tric sensors that are designed to trigger a flash unit when another flash is
fired within the sensor’s field of view (in the case of a digital camera, when
the camera’s built-in flash fires). These slave-triggering circuits are sold as
independent units that you can attach to existing flash units, or the cir-
cuitry may be built right in to a flash unit.
Small hot-shoe mount flashes
These are more powerful than both the minislaves and the camera’s built-in
flash units. They may also offer a tilt or swivel capability. Some camera sys-
tems (usually higher-end digital cameras) offer a cable that connects to the
camera’s hot shoe and allows the flash to communicate with the camera’s
electronics while being positioned in ways that the hot shoe mount doesn’t
permit. The advantage to these cables over slaves is that they usually permit
the camera/flash combo’s full range of capabilities. (Some cameras are set to
turn off the flash as soon as the correct exposure is reached, whereas a
slaved flash continues pumping out light as set.)
Professional models
These units tend to be the manufacturer’s most powerful and most advanced
flash units. They have lots of features, including built-in slave capabilities and
the ability to work with wireless remote systems. In many cases, these units
can also take advantage of the digital camera’s lack of a true shutter. This
means that the flash can be used with faster shutter speeds than those used
with film cameras. In addition to the manufacturer’s flash models, dedicated
flashes that are offered by third-party manufacturers also work with many
existing camera systems, like the one shown in Figure 6-3.
81

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Many third-party flash units and lenses are reverse-engineered to work on
major brand-name cameras. Sometimes, this equipment may not work with
newer equipment from your camera’s manufacturer. If a third-party flash
causes damage to your camera (and today’s highly electronic cameras can
be susceptible to damage from improper voltage discharge), the camera
manufacturer may not repair the damage under warranty.
Portable studio lighting
Portable studio lighting kits are available that enable a photographer to
carry a complete set of lights with lighting stands and reflectors or umbrel-
las. These kits usually offer from two to three lights or more and may also
include a backdrop setup. Although these sets are fine for local or cross-
country trips, you may want to rent such a kit while traveling overseas
Figure 6-3:

rather than pack one along with all your camera equipment while flying.
The flash units in these kits often have built-in slaves as well; these slaves
are triggered either via a connection to the camera or via a flash unit on or
in the camera.
What to look for in a photographic slave flash
A basic slave unit is a small device that’s designed to mate with the flash
unit’s hot shoe. The slave (good ones have on/off switches) triggers the flash
when another flash unit is fired. These slaves have their own hot shoe foot
to mate with stands that are designed for such things or with the L-bracket
that I describe in a few paragraphs. The slaves also have 1⁄4-inch tripod sock-
ets in their base so that you can screw them onto an extra tripod.
Wireless, or radio, slaves are also available. These are significantly more
expensive than their wired counterparts, but they are worth the cost when
other photographers and their accompanying flashes are in the vicinity.
A regular photoelectric slave doesn’t care that it’s been triggered by the
wrong photographer’s flash unit; it has simply done its job. Wireless trig-
gers work via radio signals, not light signals. These devices generally offer
multiple frequencies to minimize the likelihood of another photographer
triggering them.
A standard photographic slave won’t work properly with a digital camera
because most prosumer and amateur digital cameras emit a preflash (to
help the camera make some internal settings) that triggers earlier slave
designs prematurely. So, if you’re interested in buying a slaved flash unit,
make sure that it’s designed to work with a digital camera. Nissin, an elec-
tronics firm, makes a flash unit known as the Digi-Slave Flash. You can find
about a half-dozen different units, ranging from basic slaves to pro units.
Check out SR Inc. (www.srelectronics.com) for pictures and descriptions
of the models that are available.
Although the slaved flash doesn’t help reduce the drain on the camera’s
battery, the more powerful light still helps improve photos. The photogra-
pher also gains the ability to position the light higher up from the lens (usu-
ally slightly to the right or left as well) to reduce the likelihood of red-eye
and to provide a more pleasing effect. Setting the camera’s exposure system
to automatic can generally handle the increased flash without a problem; if
you’re not satisfied with the result, switch to aperture-priority and experi-
ment! The exception is with close-up photos, where overexposure is likely.
Dialing in a correction (usually about two f-stops) through the camera’s
exposure-compensation system solves this problem.
An electronic flash unit without power is an expensive paperweight. With
the exception of the portable studio lighting kits, which require electrical
outlets, electronic flashes usually require AA batteries, although the small-
est may take AAAs instead. Rechargeable batteries generally provide an
inexpensive option although they tend to recycle (recharge the flash unit)
more slowly than alkaline batteries do. PC cables and manufacturer flash
cords can malfunction (take care not to crimp them), so for important trips,
carry extra cables (especially if you’re going overseas, where it may be hard
to find a replacement).
83

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
Lighting/flash accessories
Depending on your shooting requirements and how much weight you can
afford to carry, some accessories can help improve your photography. My
list of possibilities is as follows:
✦Brackets: A nice complement to the accessory flash route is an L-bracket
flash holder. This device mounts to the camera via the tripod socket and
has a flash shoe at the top of the L, where you position the flash. In addi-
tion to providing a secure hold for the flash unit, the L-bracket provides a
steadier grip for the camera. You can even find models that are designed
for the shorter, thinner digital cameras, such as the earlier Nikon Coolpix
series.
✦Background cloths or reflectors: Garden enthusiasts who are interested
in photographing flowers can bring swatches of colored cloth that are
large enough to serve as a background for your shot of a plant or bloom.
Black is a good all-purpose color, whereas red, green, and blue comple-
ment common flower colors. Another helpful item is a collapsible reflec-
tor. (Camera stores sell small reflectors, or you can pick up sun blockers
that are designed for car windows.) These reflectors can kick some sun-
light back into the shadow areas to help create a more pleasing image.
For the most serious flower photographers, a ring light, or circular flash
unit that mounts in front of the camera lens, provides an even, balanced
light for flower close-ups. A Digi-Slave Flash ring light unit can be config-
ured for many amateur- and pro-level digital cameras.
Choosing a Camera Bag
Depending on the size of a digital camera and the accessories that accom-
pany it, a camera bag or pouch may be a necessity. For just the basics —
a small camera, extra batteries, extra memory cards, and a lens cleaning
cloth — a simple fanny pack does the job and leaves room for hotel keys,
money, and identification.
A more serious photographer who is carrying a larger digital camera needs
more space. A larger camera bag may be the answer, but for the active trav-
eler, some interesting options are available. Because camera bags are espe-
cially useful for traveling photographers, I’ve included a longer description
of the options and features in Chapter 12 of Book I, where I discuss travel
photography.
Acquiring Other Useful Devices
Gizmos. Gadgets. Thing-a-ma-jigs. Many of these items don’t fall into any
particular type of category, but they often do something useful. I discuss
some of these gadgets in the following sections.
Filter holders
A helpful device that I especially like is a filter holder, sold by Cokin (www.
minoltausa.com/cokin/about.htm), that also mounts to the base of the
camera via the tripod socket. This adapter allows you to use Cokin’s square
84

Book I
Chapter 6

Digital Camera
Acquiring Other Useful Devices
filters, which slide right into the adapter to provide a variety of effects and
corrections. Note, however, that you could achieve many of the same results
in an image-editing program. To those who are more comfortable tweaking
things on the computer, filters aren’t important. On the other hand, if you’re
new to computer photo editing, relying on traditional filters may be easier.
You can always take one shot with a filter and one without, and then try to
tweak the filterless shot to look like the filtered one. This process may help
you figure out how to get the most from your image-editing software.
A second camera
At some point, you’ll consider buying a second camera — say, when you’re
ready to leave on that vacation of a lifetime. A small, inexpensive digital
camera may not cost much, but if your primary camera fails, this second
camera may be worth its weight in gold, photographically speaking. Shop
for — or borrow — one that uses the same type of batteries and storage
media as your primary camera, if possible. The extra camera can also
entice a spouse or child into sharing your love of photography.
Cleaning kits
You’ll also frequently need a good cleaning kit. An inexpensive microfiber
cleaning cloth is great for cleaning optics, but first use a blower to remove
any dust particles from the lens. You can then hold the lens near your head,
fog the lens with your breath, and gently (very gently) wipe the lens with
the cloth. “Canned” air also does a good job of blowing dust and dirt off the
camera, but make sure that the can is held level, or solvents from the
aerosol may contaminate the lens.
Damp or dusty conditions call for more serious efforts. The camera can be
protected inside heavy-duty plastic freezer or sandwich bags while inside
the camera bag, thus reducing exposure to dust and moisture. Keep the
small packets of silica that come with electronic equipment, and place one
or two of these packets in the camera bag to absorb moisture. The following
section provides more detailed information about dealing with extreme
weather conditions and discusses bags and containers for protecting gear.
(Call it the difference between shooting at a dusty ball field on a windy day
versus shooting in a windstorm in the desert.)
Waterproof casings and housings
Extreme conditions call for better protection for your camera. Better yet,
photography in wet weather, or even underwater, can be fun, too. Water-
proof casings that allow photography are available from several companies,
including Ewa Marine (www.ewa-marine.de). These are useful for both under-
water photography (careful on the depth though) and above-the-water
shots if you’re sailing or boating. Keep in mind that salt spray may be the
worst threat to camera electronics. Make sure that your camera casing pro-
vides good protection against wind and salt spray.
Another option for those who want to shoot in wet conditions is a new
underwater digital camera. The SeaLife Reefmaster Underwater Digital
camera (www.sealife-cameras.com) comes in a waterproof housing and
works both on land and underwater. This camera, which retails for under
85

Part I: Getting Ready for Digital Photography
$400, only produces a 1.3-megapixel file but saves you the trouble of trying
to find a housing to fit an existing digital camera. The camera also has a
liquid crystal display (LCD) that works underwater and a fast-delete func-
tion to make it easier to operate underwater.
For serious underwater enthusiasts, heavy-duty Plexiglas housings are now
available for small digital cameras. You can buy these housings for a wide
range of digital cameras for as little as a couple hundred dollars.
Filters
Filters, those glass disks that can be screwed onto the front of your camera’s
lens, are popular accessories. The following are popular types of filters:
✦Warming: Some filters produce what photographers refer to as a warm-
ing effect. This filter can make up for the lack of color in midday light by
adding some reddish-orange color to the scene. These filters are usually
coded in the 81 series: for example, 81A, 81B, 81C.
✦Cooling: These filters do just the opposite of the previous type. They
add blue to the scene to reduce the reddish-orange color. These fall into
the 82 series for daylight conditions.
✦Neutral-density: Another type of filter is used to reduce the amount of
light that’s available. These neutral-density filters (neutral because they
have no color and density because they block light) come in handy for
things such as achieving the spun-glass effect of moving water. The filter
blocks one f-stop’s worth of light or more, making a slower shutter speed
possible and increasing the blur of the moving water.
✦Neutral-density, Take II: You may want to photograph a street scene
without having cars driving through the photo. By stacking neutral-
density filters, you can create such a long exposure that no cars are in
the scene long enough to register in the image. Obviously, a camera sup-
port of some sort is required. (Hint: The ground must be pretty stable
too, unless of course you’re visiting California.) You must also have a
camera that is capable of extremely slow shutter speeds.
✦Split-neutral-density: Another version of the neutral-density filter is a
split-neutral-density design. This filter provides half neutral density and
half clear filtration, preferably with a graduated transition from the
light-blocking half to the clear half.
You primarily use a split-ND filter when half the scene is brighter than
the other. The most common example of this is a bright sky against a
significantly darker foreground. This condition is typical of midday
lighting conditions.
✦Polarizers: Polarizing filters can reduce the glare that bounces off shiny
surfaces in your photos. Simply attach the filter and view the image
through your LCD. Rotate the polarizer until the glare disappears.
Polarizers can also help increase the contrast of the sky from certain
angles.

R
andom snap-shooting can sometimes yield lucky shots — happy acci-
dents that look good and prompt you to say, “Actually, I meant to do
that” (even if it wasn’t the case). Some Pulitzer Prize–winning photos have
resulted when the photographer instinctively squeezed off a shot at what
turned out to be a decisive moment in some fast-breaking news event.
However, lacking a Pulitzer-winner’s intuition, most photographers end up
with a larger percentage of pleasing photos when they stop to think about
and plan their pictures before putting the viewfinder up to their eye.
In this chapter, I tell you about the essentials of photo composition that set
you on the road to taking great pictures. I introduce all the basic elements
of good composition, such as selecting what to include in a well-designed
photograph and what to leave out. You find out some basic rules, such as
the Rule of Thirds, and most importantly, when you should ignore the rules
for dramatic effect.
Photo Composition: The Big Picture
One difference between good photojournalists and superior photojournal-
ists is the ability to take a newsworthy picture quickly when circumstances
don’t allow much time for preparation or thought. If you examine the work
of these professionals, you find that even their grab shots are well com-
posed. With scarcely an instant’s notice, they can line up and shoot a pic-
ture that commands your attention.
The very best photos are usually not accidents; they are carefully planned
and composed. That is, such pictures display good composition, which is
the careful selection and arrangement of the photo’s subject matter within
a frame. I’m not suggesting you set up your camera on a tripod and wait
hours — à la Ansel Adams — in anticipation of the universe settling into
exactly the right arrangement. Instead, simply understanding how good
composition works and keeping that in mind as you plan your photos can
87

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
make a world of difference. The following list gives you an overview of how
to plan and execute good photo composition:
✦Visualize a concept for your picture: It’s important to know what you
want your picture to say and who your audience is.
✦Choosing your subject matter: This isn’t as easy as it appears to be. A
picture may be filled with interesting things to look at, but you must
select which one should be the subject of the picture.
✦Deciding on a center of interest: One point in the picture should natu-
rally draw the eye, a starting place for the viewer’s exploration of the
rest of the image. With a center of interest, the photo becomes focused
and not simply a collection of objects.
✦Picking the picture orientation: Some subjects look best when shown
in a tall, vertically-oriented frame. Some look best in a wide, horizontal
format. A few need a square composition. To make the most of your
camera’s resolution, choose an orientation when you take the photo
instead of cropping it in an image editor.
✦Establishing the distance and point of view: These elements affect
your photo’s composition and are sometimes difficult to control. For
example, when you’re attending that World Series game, you can’t easily
substitute your upper-deck seats for a choice position next to the
dugout (although it’s worth a try).
✦Planning for action: If your subjects are moving, you need to anticipate
where they will be and how they will be arranged when you take the 
picture.
✦Working with the background: Objects and textures in the background
can work for you or against you. The area behind your main subject is
an important part of the composition.
✦Arranging all within the frame: The way you accomplish arranging
within the frame depends on the situation. In some situations, such as
at sporting events, you can’t dictate how the subjects are arranged. For
example, no matter how much you want an action shot of Ichiro Suzuki,
the Seattle Mariners’ star isn’t likely to relocate to center field to accom-
modate your photo. 
Although these guidelines for composition can help you, remember that
they are only guidelines. Your instincts and creative sense will tell you when
it’s a good time to break those rules, grind them up into tiny pieces, and
stomp them under your feet in your quest for an unusual, eye-catching pic-
ture. If you examine Picasso’s earliest art, you’ll see he knew how to paint in
the classical style. His legacy is based on knowing when not to paint accord-
ing to the time-honored rules.
Visualizing a Concept for Your Picture
Take some time to visualize your photo before you begin the actual picture-
taking process. You don’t need to spend hours dwelling over your photo,
but you need to have at least a general plan in mind before starting to
shoot. The following sections ask — and then answer — the questions that
lead you through the process of visualizing a concept for a picture.
88

Book I
Chapter 7
Understanding Photo
Composition
Visualizing a Concept for Your Picture
What do you want your image to say?
Will your photo be a portrait, a sports action shot, or a scenic masterpiece?
The kind of picture you want to take can affect the composition. For exam-
ple, portraits of teenagers frequently include them within the composition
props (from skateboards to pigskins) that reflect their lifestyles. For a
sports picture, you may want to get a high angle or one from a particular
location to include the field of play or other elements that say, “Action!”
A scenic photo may be composed in different ways, depending on what you
want the image to say. For example, a photo taken in a national park can
picture the grandeur of nature with a dramatic skyline with purple moun-
tain majesties and amber waves of grain. On the other hand, you may be
tempted to make a statement about the environmental impact of humans by
focusing on trash left behind by careless visitors or, at worst, desiccated
amber mountain majesties and chemically tainted waves of purple grain.
Some of the best photographs use composition to take a stand or say some-
thing beyond the photo itself. Figure 7-1 is an example of a photo that
makes a subtle statement, juxtaposing the idyllic academic setting of Kent
State University in Ohio today with a stark memorial that shows where the
body of a slain student fell.
Where will it be used?
How the photo will be used can affect composition. If you plan to print the
picture in a publication or enlarge it for display in a frame, you want a tight
composition to maximize sharpness. If you want to use the shot on a Web
page, you may want to step back to take in a little extra and crop later with
your image editor because the resolution lost from cropping pixels isn’t as
critical for Web graphics.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Who are you creating the image for?
You compose a photo for your family differently from a photo that your col-
leagues or strangers will view. Your family may like a picture better if the
composition revolves around that cute new baby. Create a photo that says,
“I’ve been to Paris,” and you’ll want to include the Eiffel Tower somewhere
in the picture. Colleagues may want to see a product highlighted or the CEO
shown in a decisive pose. Subject matter that’s extraneous for one applica-
tion may be important for another.
Selecting a Center of Interest
Photographs shouldn’t send the person looking at them on a hunting expe-
dition. As interesting as your subject may be to you, you don’t want viewers
puzzling over what’s the most important part of the image or perhaps con-
ducting a vote by secret ballot to see who has successfully guessed your
intent. Every picture should have a single, strong center of interest. You
want to narrow down your subject matter: Rather than include everything
of interest in a photo, choose one main subject. Then find secondary
objects in the picture that are also interesting (this gives the photo depth
and richness), but that are still clearly subordinate to the main subject.
Narrowing down your subject matter
Narrowing your subject matter means eliminating everything from your
photo that doesn’t belong there and concentrating on fewer objects that
can form an interesting composition.
Find something in the photograph that the viewer’s eye should focus on,
forming a center of interest. Usually, your center of interest is a person, a
group, or the object you’re seeking to highlight. You don’t want viewers’
eyes roaming around your photo searching for something to look at. Some
aspect should jump out and grab your viewers’ attention. If other portions
of the photo compete for attention, look for ways to eliminate or minimize
them.
For example, you can crop more tightly, move to one side or change your
angle, ask the extraneous person to leave (your brother-in-law is a good
guy; he’ll understand), or physically move something to delete it from your
composition, as shown in Figures 7-2 and 7-3.
One good technique is to plan several photographs, each using a different
part of the subject matter in view. That way, each person or object can take
a turn at being the center of interest, and you won’t be looking for ways to
reduce the competition between them.

Selecting a Center of Interest
Choosing one main subject
You can use several compositional techniques to ensure that the main sub-
ject you’ve selected is, in fact, the center of interest. Here’s a quick check-
list you can follow:
✦Make sure your center of interest is the most prominent object in the
picture. You may think Aunt Mary is a worthy photo subject, but if she’s
standing next to a ’60s-era minibus with a psychedelic paint job, she

Figure 7-2:

91

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
may not even be noticed. Large, distinctive, highly unusual, or contro-
versial objects are likely to take on a life of their own and seize the focus
of attention in your photograph.
✦See that the center of interest is either the brightest object in the
photo or, at least, not overpowered by a brighter object. Gaudy colors
or bright shapes in the background distract viewers from the main sub-
ject. Some elements, such as spotlights at a rock concert or a reflection
of the sun on water, become part of the environment and aren’t neces-
sarily distracting. Other parts of a photo, such as a bright sail on a boat
or a white automobile located behind your subject, can interfere with
your carefully planned composition. Eliminate such objects, move them
behind something, or otherwise minimize their impact.
✦Make sure only one center of interest is in your composition. Other
things in a photo can be interesting, but they must clearly be subsidiary
to the main center of interest. A child seated on the floor playing with a
puppy would be interesting. But other puppies in the photo should be
watching or vying for the child’s interest, not off somewhere else in the
photo engaged in some distracting activity.
✦Avoid putting the center of interest in the exact center of the photo-
graph. Move the important subject to either side and a little toward the
top or bottom of the frame. Don’t take “center” literally. See Figure 7-4
for an example of a center of interest moved to one side, but still some-
what centrally located. I explain how to locate your “center” in interest-
ing spots later in this chapter.
Figure 7-4:

Chapter 7
Understanding Photo
Composition
Choosing an Orientation
Using secondary subjects
Having more than one center of interest is confusing. If you really have sev-
eral things of importance in a single picture, consider taking several sepa-
rate photos of each and using them to tell a story. Or, group them together
to form a single, new center of interest.
However, you can easily include (and should, in many cases) secondary
points of interest that give the photograph depth and richness. A portrait of
a child should concentrate on the child’s face, but a favorite toy can speak
volumes about what this youngster likes to do. A rock singer on stage can
command your attention, but a view showing the adoring fans in the front
row tells the viewer how popular the performer is. (Conversely, having a
scant few bored spectators as a secondary subject can make another state-
ment, and turn the picture into a bit of visual irony.)
To successfully use secondary subjects, they should clearly be subordinate
to your main center of interest. You can indicate what’s secondary in your
image through location, brightness, or even degree of sharpness (a bit of
image editing can help you after the fact).
Choosing an Orientation
The orientation of a photo — whether it is a wide or tall picture — affects
the way we look at the image. When we see a landscape-oriented photo, we
tend to think of panoramas and horizontal sprawl. A vertically oriented
photo, on the other hand, provides expectations of height. Most subjects fit
into one of these orientations, so very few photos are actually composed
within a perfectly square frame. Square photos are often static and uninter-
esting and are usually put to work only with subject matter that suits them,
such as circular objects or images that have important horizontal and verti-
cal components.
Digital cameras, like most of their conventional, film-camera brethren, are
built using a horizontal layout because that configuration is best suited for
holding in two hands positioned side by side. Unfortunately, many photog-
raphers unconsciously slip into the trap of viewing every potential photo in
a horizontal mode. They turn the camera 90 degrees only when confronted
by subject matter that simply can’t be photographed any other way, such
as the Eiffel Tower, a rocket headed skyward, or any NBA player taller than
a guard.
Here are some tips that will help you decide when it’s appropriate to use a
vertical composition, and when you should think horizontal instead:
✦If you’re taking pictures for a slide show or, more likely, for a com-
puter presentation, stick with horizontally composed pictures. Slide
show images are seen sequentially and should all have the same basic
frame that is often sized to fill up the horizontal screen as much as pos-
sible. Inserting a vertical picture may mean that the top and bottom of
your photograph is cut off or appears odd on-screen.
93

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
You can still have a vertically composed picture in your slide show; just
mask off the right and left sides in your image editor to produce a verti-
cal image within the fixed-size horizontal frame. The key is to make your
vertical image no taller than the short dimension (height) of a horizon-
tal picture in the same show.
✦If your subject has dominant horizontal lines, use a horizontally com-
posed image. Landscapes and seascapes with a prominent horizon,
photos of sprawling buildings or bridges (like the one shown in Fig-
ure 7-5), many sports photos focusing on more than one team member,
and the majority of four-legged animal pictures look their best in hori-
zontal mode.
✦If your subject has strong vertical lines, use a vertical composition.
The Eiffel Tower, trees, tall buildings, pictures of individuals (whether
full-length or portrait photos), and similar compositions all call for a
vertical orientation, as shown in Figure 7-6.
✦Use a square composition if vertical and horizontal objects in your
picture are equally important and you don’t want to emphasize one
over the other. A building that is wide but has a tall tower at one end
might look good in a square composition. The important vertical ele-
ment at one end would keep the image from being too static. Circular
images lend themselves to square compositions, as the round form fits
comfortably inside a square “frame,” as shown in Figure 7-7.

Arranging Your Subjects
A basic skill in composing great images is finding interesting arrangements
within the frame for your subject matter. You need to position your subjects,
make sure they’re facing an appropriate way, and ensure that they are well-
placed in relation to the horizon and other elements of your image. Your
first consideration in arranging your subject is to choose the subject’s dis-
tance from the camera.
Choosing subject distance
Choosing the distance to stand from your subject is one of the first things
to do, but it’s not something you do once and then forget about. As you take
pictures, constantly examine your distance from the subject and move
closer or farther away if adjusting your position will improve the composi-
tion. Here’s how to choose a subject distance:
✦To convey a feeling of space and depth, move back a bit or use a
wide-angle lens. Standing back from your subject does several things.
The foreground area becomes more prominent, adding to the feeling of
space. You’ll also take in more of the sky and other surrounding area,
giving additional depth.
✦Make sure your subjects don’t appear too small when you’re moving
back; they should still be large enough to be interesting. Moving too
far back is the most common mistake amateur photographers make, as
shown in Figure 7-8. If you’re showing wide-open spaces in your picture,
be certain that it’s because you want to.
Figure 7-8:
Whoops!

far back.
96

Book I
Chapter 7
Understanding Photo
Composition
Arranging Your Subjects
✦For photos that emphasize a person, group of people, or particular
object, move in as close as you can. A close-up viewpoint adds inti-
macy and shows details and textures of a subject that can’t be seen at
greater distances, as shown in Figure 7-9. A short telephoto setting is
often the best route to getting closer; with a normal or wide-angle lens,
you may get some apparent distortion of objects that are very close.
✦Move so you fill the frame completely with interesting things.
Whether you’re shooting close up to your subject or at a distance, your
composition should not include anything that isn’t needed to make the
picture. Full frames mean less enlargement and sharper pictures, too!
Optimizing backgrounds
Unless you’re taking a picture in the dead of night or on a featureless sand
dune or snow field, you’ll have some sort of background to contend with. A
background can be a plus or a minus, depending on how you use it in your
composition. Here are some tips for making the most of your background:
✦Check your background to make sure it’s not gaudy, brightly colored,
or busy. The background should not be more interesting than the sub-
ject, nor should it be a distraction.
✦For portraits, a plain background, such as a seamless backdrop, can
be effective. A plain, featureless background can work for portraits, as
long as it isn’t totally bland. Notice how pro photographers who pose
subjects against a seamless background still use lights to create an
interesting gradient or series of shadows in the background.

97

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Outdoors, trees, grass, cloud-studded skies, plain walls, and other tex-
tured surfaces can make good backgrounds. Such backgrounds are
interesting, without overpowering your subject.
✦Watch for strong lines or shapes in the background that don’t lead the
eye to your subject. Straight or curved lines are good for compositions,
but not if they distract the viewer from your subject.
✦Consider using depth of field (the amount of the image that’s in sharp
focus) to make your background blurry. Figure 7-9 uses this technique
to make the foliage background less distracting.
Because of the way their lenses are designed, consumer digital cameras
often show everything in sharp focus. Workarounds include using longer
lens zoom settings and wider lens openings.
The Rule of Thirds
The position of your subject matter within a picture is one of the most
important decisions you make. Whether you can move the subject or
objects around, change your position, or wait until everything moves to the
right spot, you should constantly be aware of how your subject matter is
arranged. Photographers often consciously or unconsciously follow a guide-
line called the Rule of Thirds, a way of dividing your picture horizontally and
vertically into thirds, as shown in Figure 7-10. The best place to position
important subject matter is often at one of the points located one-third of
the way from the top, bottom, and sides of the frame.
Figure 7-10:

Chapter 7
Understanding Photo
Composition
The Rule of Thirds
Placing important objects at 
imaginary junction points
Follow these steps to compose your pictures effectively using the Rule of
Thirds:
1. Divide the frame into thirds horizontally and vertically.
Above all, you want to avoid having your subject matter centered. By
imagining the frame in thirds, you automatically begin thinking of those
ideal, off-center positions.
2. Try to have important objects, particularly your center of interest, at
one of the four intersections of the imaginary lines that divide the
picture (refer to Figure 7-10).
Dividing a composition in this way is called the Rule of Thirds, and fol-
lowing this guideline typically arranges objects in a pleasing way.
3. Avoid having objects at the edge of a picture unless the part that isn’t
shown isn’t important.
If you’re taking a picture of a group of people, cropping out part of the
building they’re standing next to or trimming off half a tree that’s not an
important part of the composition is okay. But don’t cut off heads!
When to break the rule
Sometimes, you’ll want to break the Rule of Thirds. There are almost as
many exceptions to the rule as there are good reasons to apply it, which is
why the rule should be considered only as a guideline. Think of the Rule of
Thirds as a lane marker on a highway. Sometimes, you’ll want to stay within
the markers. Other times, like when you see an obstruction in the road,
you’ll want to wander outside the lines. If you happen to move from the
United States to the United Kingdom, you’ll find that it’s wise to swap sides
and use the lane markers on the opposite side of the road.
You might want to ignore this handy rule in some of the following cases:
✦When your main subject matter is too large to fit comfortably at one
of the imaginary intersection points: You may find that positioning an
object at the “correct” location crops it at the top, bottom, or side.
Move it a bit to another point in your composition if you need to see
the whole thing.
✦If centering the image would help illustrate a concept: Perhaps you
want to show your subject surrounded on all sides by adversity or a
threatening environment. Placing the subject at one of the intersection
points implies motion or direction, as if the subject were about to flee
the picture entirely. However, putting the center of interest in the very
center of the picture gives the subject nowhere to hide.
✦When you want to show symmetry: Centering a symmetrically oriented
subject that’s located in a symmetrically oriented background can pro-
duce a harmonious, geometric pattern that is pleasing, even if it is a bit
static. If the subject itself makes you think of motion, a square image
can even boast a bit of movement, as shown in Figure 7-11.
99

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Some corollaries
A photo composition creates an entire world for the viewer to explore. You
won’t want to destroy the illusion by calling attention to the rest of the uni-
verse outside the frame. Here’s how to orient people and other objects in a
picture:
✦If your subjects are people, animals, statues, or anything that you
think of as having a front end and back end, make sure they are
either facing the camera or facing into the frame rather than out of it.
If a person seems to be looking out of a picture, rather than somewhere
within it, viewers will spend more time wondering what the person is
looking at than examining the actual person. The human doesn’t actu-
ally have to be looking at any object in particular as long as he or she is
looking somewhere within the picture.
✦If objects in the frame are moving or pointed in a particular direction,
make sure they’re heading into the frame rather than out of it. A sta-
tionary automobile, a windmill, a palm tree bent over by a strong wind,
anything with a sense of direction to it should be facing into the frame
for the same reason that a person should be looking into it, as you can
see in Figure 7-12.

Composition
Using Straight Lines and Curves
✦Add extra space in front of any fast-moving object (such as a race car)
so that the object has somewhere to go while remaining in the frame.
It may seem odd, but if an object is moving, having a little more space in
the frame in front of it is best so that the viewer doesn’t get the impres-
sion that it’s on its way out of view. In Figure 7-12, for example, you
wouldn’t want to crop the image any more tightly on the left because
you need to leave room for the speeding ball.
Using Straight Lines and Curves
After you have the basics out of the way, progressing to the next level and
creating even better compositions is easy. All you need to know is when to
apply or break some simple rules. Just remember that one of the key ele-
ments of good composition is a bit of surprise. Viewers like to see subjects
arranged in interesting ways, rather than lined up in a row.
Lines within your image can help your compositions by directing the eye
toward the center of interest. The lines don’t have to be explicit; subtle
shapes can work just as well. Try these techniques:
✦Look for straight lines in your image and try to use them to lead the
eye to the main subject area. Some lines are obvious: fences, or a
seashore leading off into the distance, for example. These kinds of lines
are good when you want a dramatic composition, like Figure 7-13.
✦Find diagonal lines to direct the attention to the center of interest.
Diagonal lines are better than straight lines, which are static and not
particularly interesting.
✦Use repetitive lines to create an interesting pattern. Repetitive lines
can be multiple lines within a single object, such as the grout lines in a
brick wall. Or repetitive lines can be several different parallel or con-
verging objects, such as a road’s edges, the center line of the road, and
the fence that runs along the road. Strong repetitive lines can become a
pleasing composition themselves, like in Figure 7-13.

✦Curved lines are more graceful than straight lines and can lead the
viewer gently from one portion of the composition to another. Curving
roads are a good example of arcs and bends that can contribute to a com-
position. Other graceful curves include body parts of living things, such
as the necks of flamingos, as shown in Figure 7-14.
✦Look for shapes within your composition to add interest. Three
objects arranged in a triangle make a picture inherently more interest-
ing than if the objects formed a square shape. That’s because your eye
naturally follows the lines of the triangle towards each of the three
points or apexes, whereas squares or rectangles don’t “point” any-
where. Instead of posing groups of people in rows and columns, stack
them in interesting arrangements that make shapes that the viewer’s
eye can explore.

Balancing an Image
Balancing an Image
If you place every element of interest in a photograph on one side or
another, leaving little or nothing to look at on the other side, the picture is
imbalanced, like a see-saw with a large child at one end, and nothing on the
other. The best pictures have an inherent balance that makes them graceful
to look at.

103

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
To balance your image, arrange objects so that anything large on one side
is balanced by something of importance on the other side. This is not the
same as having multiple centers of interest. You can balance out a group of
people arrayed on one side by simply having a tree or building on the other.
The people are still the center of interest; the other objects simply serve to
balance the composition, as shown in Figure 7-15.
You can balance objects in two ways:
✦To create a symmetrical balance, have the objects on either side of the
frame be of roughly similar size or weight.
✦To create a nonsymmetrical balance, have the objects on opposing
sides be of different size or weight.
Framing an Image
Photos are frequently put in frames for a good reason: A border around a
picture defines the picture’s shape and concentrates our attention on the
image within the frame. You can use framing to provide an attractive border
around your own pictures by using these tips:
✦In the foreground, look for obvious framing shapes in which you can
place your composition. You won’t easily miss the most readily appar-
ent frames: doorways, windows, arches, and the space between build-
ings, for example. These have the advantage of being a natural part of
the scene and not something you contrived in order to create a frame,
as you can see in Figure 7-16. In this illustration, the cliffs at the left side
of the image partially frame the ocean inlet at right.
Figure 7-15:

104

Book I
Chapter 7
Understanding Photo
Composition
Framing an Image
✦Make your own frames by changing position until foreground objects
create a border around your image. Find a curving tree branch and
back up until the scenic view you want to capture is wrapped in its leafy
embrace. Climb inside something and use an opening as a frame.
✦Place your frame in the foreground. Shapes in the background that
delineate your image don’t make an effective frame. You want something
that appears to be in front of your subject matter, just as a real frame
would be.
✦Use a frame to create a feeling of depth. A flat-looking image can jump
to 3-D life when it’s placed in a frame. Usually, you want to have the
frame and your main subject in focus, but you can sometimes use an
out-of-focus frame to good effect.
✦Use a telephoto lens setting to compress your frame and your subject;
use a wide-angle lens setting to add distance between the frame and
your main subject. With a telephoto lens, however, you have to be espe-
cially careful to keep the frame in focus.

CHECK IT OUT
What’s That Tree Doing Growing Out of My Head?
Mergers are the unintentional combining of por-
tions of an image. With our stereoscopic vision,
our eyes and brain distinctly separate objects
that are farther apart. Other visual clues let us
keep objects separate, such as the relative size
of the objects compared to our knowledge of
their actual size. For example, we know that a
tiny human is located in the distance, whereas
another one in our field of view that’s four times
as large is simply closer. However, viewed
through the one-dimensional perspective of a
camera lens, objects that we know are distinct
easily become merged into one.
We’ve all seen photographs of hapless photo-
graphic subjects posed with what looks like a
telephone pole growing out of their heads.
Sometimes, the merger is with a border of the
image — this mistake is easier to make than
you may think, and easier to avoid than you real-
ize. Follow these steps to avoid an unwanted
merger:
1.
When composing an image, look behind
the subject at the objects in the back-
ground. Then examine the borders of the
image to look for things “attached” to the
edges.
By concentrating, you can see how the
background and foreground will appear
when merged in your final photograph.
2.
If an unwanted merger seems likely,
move the subject to either side, or change
your position slightly to eliminate the 
juxtaposition.
Like all the other rules discussed in this chapter,
you can ignore the antimerger guideline, even if
you aren’t a captain of industry looking to build a
giant conglomerate. Keep in mind that you can
creatively use mergers to make photographs that
are humorous. You just might want that forest
ranger to appear to have a tree growing out of his
or her head.

C
lose-up, or macro, photography can be one of the most satisfying forms
of digital photography. Any intermediate digital camera has all the fea-
tures that you need to take great close-ups to astound your family, friends,
and colleagues. A beautiful scenic photo or an attractive portrait can elicit
praise and appreciation, but a well-crafted, close-up photo is guaranteed to
generate oohs and aahs as well as the question that photographers love to
hear: “How did you ever take that picture?” Close-up photography takes us
into fascinating new worlds (without the time or expense of a trip to Europe).
If you’re a collector of coins or stamps, toy cars, porcelain figurines, model
trains, or nearly anything smaller than a breadbox (unless you collect
breadboxes), you’ll love the ability to document your collection. Have a
garden full of prize roses? Display them even in the dead of winter through
digital photos. Have a thing for insects? Grab a picture of the little beasts in
their natural habitat. Some of the best applications of close-up photography
involve crafts and hobbies.
You don’t have to be a forensic expert specializing in crime scene investiga-
tions to find interesting photos in the macro world. Just about any house-
hold object, if photographed from an inch or two away, is transformed into
an abstract scene worthy of the most artsy photographic expression.
If you haven’t tried close-up photography, I hope this chapter encourages
you to do so. I show you how to set up a close-up “studio” and take macro
photos the painless way.
What’s Macro Photography?
The first thing to do as you begin your exploration of close-up photography
is to get some jargon out of the way first. There’s nothing wrong with calling
up-close-and-personal pictures close-ups, but within the photography realm,
you’ll commonly find some other terms in frequent use (and misuse). Some
of them are as follows:
107

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Close-up photography: This term has been co-opted by the movie
industry (as in “Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up” in the classic
film Sunset Boulevard). A close-up is generally considered to be a tight
shot of a single person (say, only the face and shoulders) or another
object of similar size. It’s okay to refer to close-up photography for what
you do with your digital camera, as I’ve done in the chapter title. That’s
a term that most people, even photographic neophytes, understand.
✦Microphotography: Microphotography results in microphotographs:
that is, microfilm images. You wouldn’t apply this term to pictures that
are taken through a microscope, although it is sometimes (incorrectly)
used that way.
✦Photomicrography: This is the correct term for taking pictures through
a microscope. Although photomicrography is chiefly within the range of
scientists and researchers, it can also be a fun activity for digital pho-
tographers if you have the special equipment that’s needed to connect a
digital camera to a microscope. Everything from microscopic animals to
human hairs can make fascinating photographs, but you generally need
a higher-end digital camera and some specialized gear to capture the
images. Photomicrography is beyond the scope of this book.
✦Macro photography: This is the brand of close-up that is the focus of
this chapter. Generally, macro photography is considered to be any pic-
ture that is taken from about 12 inches from the subject down to half an
inch or even closer. Macro is derived from the Greek word makro, mean-
ing “long,” but the term has come to mean “large” and the opposite of
micro. However, that’s not exactly the case in photography. A macro
photograph is not a huge picture (the opposite of a microphotograph)
but rather a normal-sized photo of a tiny object that has been made to
appear large, as shown in Figure 8-1. You may not even be able to recog-
nize common objects when they are blown up in a macro photograph.
Why Digital Macro Photography Is Cool
Digital cameras and macro photography were made for each other. In many
ways, digital cameras can be far superior to an ordinary film camera when it
comes to taking close-up pictures. Consider the following advantages:

Book I
Chapter 8
Moving into Close-Up
Photography
Picking a Place to Shoot
✦Close-focusing lenses: Digital camera lenses are ideal for focusing up
close. Without getting too technical — too late — macro photos are
made with any camera by moving the lens farther away from the film (or
sensor, in the case of a digital camera). Film cameras require moving the
lens quite a distance out to get a decent macro effect. For example, a
50mm lens on a 35mm single-lens reflex camera must be moved 4 inches
out from the film to get a life-size (1:1) image. In contrast, an 8mm lens
on a digital camera (which may be roughly the equivalent of the 50mm
lens on the SLR) needs to move out only about 5⁄8 inch to provide the
same magnification. Clearly, close focusing is much easier to incorpo-
rate into a digital camera.
In the macro photography arena, you’ll see close-focusing capabilities
described in terms of magnification rather than the distance from the
subject. As a beginning macro photographer, you may be more interested
in how close you can get, for example, 6 inches, 3 inches, and so on.
However, realize that the size of the final image at any given distance
varies with the zoom setting of your lens (that is, an image taken from 6
inches away at the wide-angle setting may be one-fourth the size of one
taken from the same distance at the longest zoom setting). It’s more
useful to compare the amount of magnification. A 1:1 image is exactly the
same size in your camera whether it is taken from 1 inch away with the
wide-angle setting or 6 inches away with the zoom setting. (Although
the size is the same, the way the image looks is quite different, but that’s
something I discuss in the section “Close-up lenses,” later in this chapter.)
✦Easy framing of your image: Virtually every digital camera features an
LCD that shows almost exactly what you’ll get in your finished photo-
graph. (The LCD may trim a bit of the edges from the image, but getting
more than you expected is far superior to getting less.) Inexpensive
point-and-shoot film cameras, if they have macro capabilities at all,
don’t show you exactly what your image will look like. You need to get a
single-lens reflex film camera if you want the capability that’s built in to
many of the least expensive digital cameras.
✦Immediate results: Close-up photography can be tricky, and the last
thing you want is to have to wait for your film to come back from the
photofinisher before you know whether your pictures are good. With a
digital camera, you can review your results on the LCD immediately,
delete bad shots, and keep taking pictures until you get exactly what
you want.
Picking a Place to Shoot
Where you shoot your macro photos can be as significant as what you
shoot. You may want to take your photographs in the tightly controlled
environment of your kitchen, using a tabletop as your platform for your
model trains or other objects. Or, you may want to venture out into the field
to stalk the creatures of nature.
Sometimes you have a choice of where you shoot, and sometimes you
don’t. For example, to photograph sea life on the beach, you pretty much
have to take your pictures at the beach. You can photograph a tree frog on a
tree, or you can pop him in a mayonnaise jar and take him elsewhere.

Setting Up Your Macro Studio
You don’t need a real studio for macro photography, of course. That’s one of
the cool parts of taking close-ups. Any nook or cranny that you can spare in
your home or work environment can be designated as a studio area. All you
need to do is keep the area reasonably neat and free of clutter so that you
can set up and take macro photos with a few minutes’ notice. You can also
keep a semipermanent close-up studio, like I do, for stuff that my wife sells
on eBay. I’ve put a seamless backdrop up in a little-used corner, so an item
that’s destined for sale can be set up and photographed anytime. A macro
studio, such as the one shown in Figure 8-2, requires so little space that you
won’t hesitate to dedicate a small portion of your living space in exchange
for the convenience of having a special area that you can use anytime.
Of course, you’re free to create little macro studios on an ad hoc basis,
using your kitchen table, hearth, or any convenient location as you need to.
Many of the close-up photos in this book were taken on impulse right at the
desk where I work. I grab a piece of white paper from my ink-jet printer, lean
it against a convenient support, and drop the object I want to photograph
on my miniature, seamless backdrop. I often use the built-in flash of my digi-
tal camera with one or two other pieces of printer paper strategically located
to reflect the light onto my subject. Less than a minute after I started, I plug
my camera into the USB cable that rests by my keyboard and watch my
photos appear on the screen.

Moving into Close-Up
Photography
Setting Up Your Macro Studio
Of course, you can get better results than I get with my quickie photos if
you collect the right equipment and gear for your ministudio. The next sec-
tion explains exactly what you need.
Background check
In many cases, you’ll want close-up backgrounds that are plain and unobtru-
sive and that allow your subject matter to stand out without any distracting
extraneous material. That generally means a light background for darker
objects and a dark background for light objects. You do not need to stick
with stark white or inky black backgrounds unless your plan is to drop out
the background in Photoshop or another image editor so that you can com-
bine the subject with some other photograph. Often a light pastel color
background works well for dark objects, and a medium-dark shade looks
good with very light objects.
The amount of light that falls on the background helps determine its light-
ness or darkness. A soft gray background can appear to be almost white or
fairly dark, depending on the amount of illumination that reaches it. Don’t
be afraid to experiment.
So-called “seamless” backdrops are very popular. They provide a continu-
ous (seamless) surface on which the subject can rest, while blending
smoothly into a vertical background. Depending on how you light the seam-
less backdrop, it can appear to be a single shade, or you can provide vary-
ing amounts of separation between the foreground and background, as
shown in Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-2:

111

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
The following types of backgrounds are the most popular for macro 
photography:
✦A few yards of cloth: I really like plain, solid-colored cloth as a back-
drop. It’s rugged and versatile, and if it gets dirty, you can usually just
throw it in the wash. I buy pieces that are 45–54 inches wide and 8 or 9
feet long in several different colors, including pure black and pure white
as well as soft pastels and bright colors. The longer lengths let me use
the cloth as a portrait background if I need to.
Artificial velour is extremely useful. One side has a soft surface that
really soaks up light. A black velour cloth can make a perfectly black
background that’s almost guaranteed not to show shadows. The other
side of velour has a shinier texture that you can use for some types of
photos. Leave the cloth smooth.
✦A roll of seamless paper: Rolls of true photographic seamless paper
can be expensive (around $40 for a 9-x-36-foot roll) and hard to find (you
need to seek out a camera store that sells to professional photogra-
phers). Take a hacksaw and cut the roll in half to make the size a little
more manageable for ministudio work. Seamless paper eventually gets
torn and dirty, so it’s nice to be able to unroll a little more so that you
always have a fresh background.
You may want to check out craft and packaging stores for large rolls of
sturdy wrapping paper as an alternate source for seamless backgrounds.
Avoid the paper with mistletoe and bunnies, and look for plain colors.
However, don’t be afraid to experiment. A smooth section of kraft paper
can make a handsome backdrop for some subjects.
✦Posterboard: I’ve used a lot of posterboard as seamless backgrounds
for close-up photos of smaller objects. Use duct tape to curve it into
place. At a few cents a sheet, you can afford many different colors.
However, posterboard may have a slightly shiny surface. If you use it
with soft, diffuse lighting, you shouldn’t have a problem.

Visible means of support
You have to provide support for your background material, your lighting
equipment (if you use some), and your camera. Fortunately, the same sup-
ports that work for close-ups serve admirably for other types of photogra-
phy. (See Book I, Chapter 9 for a discussion of gear for people pictures.) If
you plan to take a lot of studio-type photos, buying some good-quality equip-
ment of this type can be a shrewd move. I’m still using the same tripod and
light stands that I purchased while in college. A few hundred dollars for that
stuff seemed like a lot of money at the time, but I haven’t had to spend a
penny since then, even though I’ve gone from large professional cameras to
tiny digital cameras in the interim.
You can buy tripods, light stands, and other equipment relatively inexpen-
sively; you may have to do so if your budget is tight. However, I can tell 
you from personal experience that a $100 tripod is a lot more than twice 
as sturdy and twice as useful as a $50 model. If you’re going to spend the
money replacing a flimsy tripod or two, why not start out with a good one?
You can find the following supports:
✦Background supports: You’ll find that cloth backgrounds are so light-
weight that you can support them with almost anything. Duct tape can
suspend a piece of cloth from any piece of furniture. I tend to use 7-foot
light stands, which are aluminum supports that telescope down to a
compact size and have tripod legs at the bottom to keep them upright.
Set up a pair of light stands and suspend a wooden dowel between them
as a horizontal support for your cloth, and you’re all set.
Light stands can also support some rolls of paper if you substitute a
wood closet pole or metal pipe for the wooden dowel. You can also
build a simple background stand out of lumber or, if you do a lot of
shooting in a basement area (as I do), use metal supports that are fas-
tened directly to the ceiling joists, as shown in Figure 8-4.

113

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Lighting supports: Light stands are good but may be a bit too large to
position effectively for close-up photography. In many cases, you can
skip light stands or special lights altogether and use household desk
lamps that rest right on your background setup.
✦Camera supports: A tripod is essential for macro photography. You
need to be able to fix your camera in one position and lock it down
while you take your photos. That’s particularly true if you use your digi-
tal camera’s LCD to compose or focus your image. It doesn’t matter
whether you’re relying on your camera’s automatic focus or are focus-
ing manually — a tripod can give you the fixed position that you need.
A tripod also allows you to photograph several subjects from the same
distance and angle, adding an important measure of consistency.
You can find more information on choosing a good tripod in Book I, Chap-
ter 6.
Lighting equipment
Unless your subject is a candle or a glow-in-the-dark Halloween skeleton,
you need some sort of lighting to illuminate the scene. Your choices include
the existing light in the room, an electronic flash, and incandescent illumi-
nation, such as desk lamps or photoflood lights. The following sections
explain what you need to know about each option.
Existing light
Photographers used to refer to existing light by the term available light until
someone pointed out that a 400-pound Klieg light is available if you happen
to have one left over from the last motion picture that you shot. (Insert
chuckle here.) Today, we refer to ambient light as existing light on the pre-
sumption that lighting doesn’t exist if it isn’t already available on-site. Some
tips for using existing light are as follows:
✦Use with modulation: You can modulate existing light, of course, if you
have reflectors or other gadgets handy. If existing light is too harsh, you
can soften it by using a piece of white cardboard as a reflector (avoid
other colors unless you really want a color cast in your photo). Foam
board also works and is stiffer and easier to position than cardboard.
✦Foiled again: A piece of aluminum foil can make a brighter reflector,
with more contrast. Crinkle it up so that the light it reflects is more dif-
fuse. Otherwise, foil behaves a lot like a mirror, which is something you
don’t want. Mylar “space blankets” also make a good lightweight,
portable metallic reflector.
✦For all in tents: Pros often use miniature white tents when photograph-
ing a shiny object. Place your subject inside the tent, apply plenty of
light from the outside of the tent, and then shoot through a hole in the
top or side. You end up with a beautiful soft lighting and no reflections
of the surrounding room on the shiny subject matter. (Make sure that
the camera lens itself doesn’t reflect on the object!)
✦Block that light: Sometimes, you want to subtract light rather than add
it to your subject. Place black cloth or cardboard outside the subject
area to absorb light and darken shadows for a dramatic effect.
114

Book I
Chapter 8
Moving into Close-Up
Photography
Setting Up Your Macro Studio
When using incandescent lights, make sure that your camera’s white balance
control has been set for interior illumination. Many digital cameras can be
set to automatically recognize and adjust the white balance for various light-
ing conditions. Fluorescent lighting often requires a different setting, and
some cameras have adjustments for both warm and cool fluorescent bulbs.
Electronic flash
Electronic flash is often useful for quickie shots like those that I take right at
my desk, but flash is often not the best choice for close-ups. The reasons for
this are as follows:
✦Flash is often too powerful for close-up pictures that are taken inches
away from the camera. Flash is intended for shooting from a distance of
several feet or more.
✦The effect of the lighting isn’t easy to visualize with electronic flash
because the subject is illuminated for only a fraction of a second. After
you’ve taken your photo and reviewed it on the LCD, you may find that
the light is too harsh, is placed incorrectly, or illuminates the wrong
part of your image.
✦One of the major advantages of electronic flash, stopping the action of
moving subjects, doesn’t really apply to close-up pictures, which are
usually taken of stationary subjects at a fixed distance.
You can use four kinds of electronic flash when taking close-up photos. I pro-
vide a more thorough discussion of these flash options in Book I, Chapter 9
(where I discuss photographing people). However, a quick summary of your
choices of electronic flash is as follows:
✦Your camera’s built-in flash: This is usually your worst choice for illu-
minating your subject. For one thing, the flash is likely to be aimed quite
a distance past your area of interest or, in many cases, is blocked by
parts of the camera or lens. When I use my camera’s built-in flash for
close-ups, I always include several pieces of white reflective material
outside the field of view to bounce the light back onto the subject. Your
flash is likely to be too harsh and will wash out the details of your sub-
ject. (Light that is placed at an angle, rather than straight on, can often
produce better close-up illumination.)
✦External flash: You can find a connector on many digital cameras for
linking to an external flash unit. These units range from more powerful
versions of your camera’s built-in flash to expensive studio flash units.
✦Slave flash: These are a kind of external electronic flash that includes a
photocell that triggers the unit automatically when another flash unit is
fired. Slaves let you use several flashes at once.
✦Ring lights: These are circular flash units that can be fitted around the
circumference of your camera’s lens. They provide even lighting that is
designed especially for close-ups. Usually, only professionals who do a
great deal of macro photography can justify buying a ring light.
115

Incandescent lights
Incandescent lights (including gooseneck desk lamps, which I use; high-
intensity lamps; or photographic flood lights) are great for lighting close-
ups. Their advantages are as follows:
✦Easy preview: You can see exactly what your lighting effect will be.
✦Flexibility: Use as many lamps as you need, and arrange them as you
like. Create backlit effects or soft lighting. Use a high-intensity lamp
when you want a high-contrast quality to your illumination. Turn to a
soft-white desk lamp when you need diffused light.
✦Inexpensive: I buy desk lamps for less than $10 and use them in various
combinations to get well-lit close-ups. What other photographic equip-
ment can you buy that cheaply?
Their disadvantages are as follows:
✦Heat: Don’t let your high-intensity lamps burn your subject. And forget
about using them to photograph ice cream sundaes.
✦Color of their light: Make sure that your camera’s white balance is set
correctly for the reddish hue of incandescent lights.
✦Burnout: Have some extra bulbs available in case one of your lamps
burns out during a shooting session.
Other equipment
You may find some other equipment handy when shooting macro photos.
For example, slide-copying attachments are available for some digital cam-
eras. These attachments let you make high-resolution digital grabs of 35mm
color slides without using an expensive slide scanner. Even if your digital
camera focuses close in, special close-up lenses let you get even closer.
This section gives you a rundown on some of the most popular add-ons for
close-up photography.
Slide copiers
Slide copiers are great for converting your existing collection of color trans-
parencies to digital form. All you need is a close-focusing digital camera and
a copier attachment. (This attachment consists of a holder for the slide and
a diffusing panel that sits behind the slide to soften the light that you use to
illuminate it.) You may be able to get good quality with such a device —
note, however, that you’ll get better results with a typical flatbed scanner
that offers a slide (often called a negative) attachment.
Single-lens reflex add-ons
If you own a digital camera with removable lenses (with basic SLR digital
cameras finally dipping below $2,000, that’s not altogether unlikely), you
can use accessories that are similar to those offered for film-oriented SLRs,
such as bellows, extension tubes, and reversing rings. Brief explanations of
these accessories are as follows:
116

Book I
Chapter 8
Moving into Close-Up
Photography
Setting Up Your Macro Studio
✦A bellows, such as the one shown in Figure 8-5, moves your camera’s
lens farther from the sensor, enlarging the image over a continuous
range. The downside is that the farther the bellows is extended, the less
light that reaches the sensor, producing long exposure times. Bellows
attachments are also expensive.
✦Extension tubes do much the same as a bellows, but over fixed distances.
✦Reversing rings let you mount your camera’s lens on a bellows so that
the front of the lens faces the sensor. With removable lenses that weren’t
designed for macro photography, reversing the lens can produce sharper
results and increase the magnification.
Close-up lenses
Even if your digital camera focuses very close, you may want to get even
closer. That’s where close-up lenses come in. Although they are called lenses
(because they function as one), close-up lenses look more like clear glass fil-
ters with a curved surface. These lenses fasten to the front of your digital
camera’s lens using a screw mount or other arrangement. Labeled with des-
ignations such as #1, #2, or #3 (these numbers refer to a measurement of
magnification called diopter strength), these lenses can be used alone or in
combination to produce varying amounts of magnification. The amount of
magnification that a particular close-up lens or combination provides
depends on the zoom setting of the lens and its normal close-focusing ability.

For example, if you have a lens that focuses as close as 1 meter, a +1 close-up
lens enables you to focus down to 1⁄2 meter, a +2 diopter allows focusing down
to 1⁄3 meter, and a +3 diopter permits focusing down to 1⁄4 meter (slightly less
than 10 inches for the nonmetrically inclined). As you can see, these close-
up lenses can bring macro capability to optics that aren’t able to focus very
close (from a close-up standpoint, 1 meter is the pits). These lenses can
bring super macro capability to lenses that can already focus very close to
your subject.
Serious macro photographers purchase a set of several close-up lenses and
use them in combination to get the magnification that they want.
Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
The first part of this chapter helps outfit you for macro photography. Most
of the equipment and gear that I discuss can be used for location shooting
or for home or office studio shooting (although outdoor close-ups may make
some of the tools, such as cardboard reflectors, tricky to use).
This next section provides you with tips for shooting good close-up photo-
graphs, using common techniques that the pros take advantage of all the
time — plus a few things I learned myself, the hard way.
Setting up your subject and background
You’ve chosen your subject to photograph, whether it’s a pewter soldier
from your collection or a terrified tree frog. You’ve selected a background
to isolate and/or flatter your subject. What’s next?
Set up your subject on its background so that it can’t move. Although this
can be tricky with the tree frog, it’s less of a challenge with an inanimate
object, such as the pewter soldier. I often use bits of modeling clay that can
be hidden underneath an object to hold it at the correct angle. I also use
pieces of wood, bent paper clips, or inexpensive clamps. One of the advan-
tages of digital photography is that you can easily remove any supporting
device in an image editor.
In the studio, positioning your subject may be all you have to do. On loca-
tion, it’s more likely that you’ll have to remove unsightly leaves, ugly rocks,
or maybe some bugs that wander through your frame. Clean up any dirt,
dying stems, or other objects that you don’t want to photograph.
Setting up your camera
In the studio, it’s fairly easy to set up your camera on a tripod or other sup-
port and not have to worry about it shifting. On location, you may need to
make sure that the ground underneath your tripod is firm and solid. Put a
rock under one or more legs, if necessary. If you’re shooting on a slope, you
may want to lengthen one or more legs of the tripod and shorten others.
Set the tripod a little shorter than the height that you actually want to use.
You can use the center pole to raise or lower the camera a bit. Don’t make
the common mistake of setting the tripod too low. If you really crank up the
center column, the tripod can become top-heavy and unstable. You can tie a
118

Book I
Chapter 8
Moving into Close-Up
Photography
Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
weight on the center pole to give the tripod a bit of ground-hugging heft. I
use the mesh bags that oranges are sold in as a receptacle for rocks. (Mesh
bags tend to be strong but lightweight, which makes them ideal for this par-
ticular task.)
You can reverse the center pole of many tripods so that it extends down
between the legs of the tripod, letting you shoot at an angle down on your
subject. That’s often the only way to get the viewpoint that you want with-
out interference from the tripod’s legs.
Lights, please
Use your lighting equipment or the existing light to illuminate your subject.
In the studio, position two or more lights so that they light up the subject
evenly. In the studio or on location, work with reflectors to fill in dark shad-
ows, darken spots that are too bright, and even out your illumination.
The light that falls on the background can be just as important as the light
that you use to illuminate your subject. The background light can separate
your subject from the surroundings and provide a more attractive photo.
See Book I, Chapter 9 for more information on lighting backgrounds.
Remember, the more light that you are able to use, the smaller the lens
opening needs to be and the better the depth of field (the more of your sub-
ject that is in focus). If you want a really sharp picture with lots in focus,
pump up the light as much as possible (although if you’re an using elec-
tronic flash, having enough light is rarely a problem). I explain more about
depth of field in the next section, “Ready . . . aim . . .”
The quality of the light is as important as the quantity. If you’re using elec-
tronic flash, you should avoid the harsh illumination that flash typically
provides. I often drape a handkerchief over my camera’s flash. This reduces
the flash illumination to a more reasonable level while softening the light.
If the electronic flash is still too strong, move back a step or two and zoom
in closer. (But remember that not all digital camera lenses can focus closely
at all zoom settings.) Because of the perverse-square law (er, I mean inverse
square law), a light that is 12 inches from a subject generates only one-
quarter as much illumination as it does from a distance of 6 inches.
Ready . . . aim . . .
You’re all set to frame your photo and press the shutter release. But first, a
few words from your sponsor. Keep the following final advisories in mind as
you take your best shot:
✦Remember that when shooting up close, for any particular magnifica-
tion, the closer you get, the more emphasis is placed on the objects that
are very close to the lens. Photograph a figure of a clown’s head from 2
inches away, and his nose will be very large in proportion to the rest of
his face. Move back a few inches and zoom in to produce the same size
image, and the proportions are much more realistic.
✦Don’t forget focus and depth-of-field considerations. When shooting up
close, only a small portion of your image may be in focus. Make sure
119

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
that’s the most important part of your subject! If your camera lets you
lock in a focus setting by pressing the shutter release button part way,
make sure that you’ve focused on the right area before locking. Depth of
field is a range, extending one-third in front of the plane of sharpest focus
and two-thirds behind it, as you can see in Figure 8-6. In this figure, very
little in front of the blossom is in focus, but the blossom itself is fairly
sharp. The background, of course, is too far away to be in focus, which is
how the picture was conceived.
✦Crop out extraneous material, and center your subject in the frame
(most of the time). Good composition, as described in Book I, Chapter 7,
usually calls for an off-center subject, but that rule may not apply when
shooting close-ups. It may be best to feature your main point of interest
right in the center of the frame.
✦Use your camera’s close-up features effectively. That includes double-
checking to make sure that the camera is in macro mode and keeping
close tabs on the in-focus indicator (usually an LED) that may appear in
your viewfinder.
✦Make sure that you’ve framed the subject correctly, without accidentally
chopping anything off. You often have to use the camera’s LCD to exam-
ine your composition because the built-in optical viewfinder doesn’t
show the image 100 percent accurately. (Flip to Book I, Chapter 2 for a
basic discussion of viewfinder parallax error.) You don’t want to chop off
the top or sides of your image.

Photography
Shooting Tips for Macro Photography
If your digital camera has a connector for linking the camera to a monitor or
TV, you can often use that capability to frame your photo.
Fire!
When you press the shutter-release button, a lot of things happen. One likely
(and none-too-happy) event is that you press the button too hard and pro-
duce a blurry picture. Another possibility is that you see something wrong
with your composition in the last ohnosecond. (An ohnosecond is that inter-
val between the time when you press the shutter release and the instant
when you realize that you’ve made some sort of serious error. An ohnosec-
ond also occurs as you’re slamming your locked car door closed and notice
your keys in the ignition.) But it’s not too late!
Avoiding blur
First, avoid human-caused blur by using your camera’s self-timer to trip the
shutter after a few seconds, rather than using your big fat finger. In self-
timer mode, you set up your composition, make sure that everything is
okay, press the shutter button, and then step back and take a few deep
breaths until the camera actually takes the photo (blur-free).
An alternative is to use an electronic or mechanical remote shutter-release
control to trip your camera’s shutter without touching it. A remote release
may be a cable that attaches to your camera or an infrared remote control
like the one that operates your television, VCR, and virtually everything
else in your household. Unlike a self-timer, a remote release lets you take
the photo at the instant you want — say, when the tree frog has a cute
expression on his face.
Making sure the camera is done
For heavens sake, don’t do anything after you press the shutter button until
you’re positive that the camera has finished taking the picture. If your camera
has an optional shutter-release sound, turn it on so that you know when the
picture is being taken. (Learn to differentiate between the sound that the
camera makes when the shutter opens and the sound that’s made when it
closes again.)
If your camera has a flashing LED that shows a photo is being saved to your
digital film, look for it to begin flashing as an indication that the photo has
been taken. The automatic-exposure mechanism of your camera may need
to use a long exposure (several seconds or more) to take the picture, and
you certainly don’t want any sudden movements or grabs at the camera to
ruin your shot. Wait a few seconds after you hear the camera’s shutter click
before doing anything, until you are sure that your camera is not making a
lengthy exposure or time exposure. That click may have only been an indi-
cation that the shutter was opening, and the camera may still be capturing
the picture.
121

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Reviewing your shot
After the photo has been taken, take the time to review your picture on the
LCD for defects. Look for the following common problems:
✦Poor focus: Correct and reshoot.
✦Bad exposure: Make adjustments using your camera’s available 
exposure-compensation modes. (Check your camera manual.)
✦Bad reflections that you didn’t notice before: Move your lights or
move your camera until the reflections go away.
✦Tree frog that has departed the scene: You know, quite realistic-looking
plastic tree frogs are available these days. (Doggone those unpre-
dictable models.)

A
lthough the first successful photograph, a scene taken from a Paris
rooftop by Nicéphore Niépce in 1827, was a scenic photo unpopulated by
humans (largely because the exposure took eight hours!), the most memo-
rable pictures since then have included people. Indeed, the desire to photo-
graph family, friends, and colleagues is the reason that many people own a
camera.
When you think of the daguerreotype, Civil War–era portraits probably
come to mind. When you imagine a prize-winning photograph, images such
as Dorothea Lange’s Migrant Mother leap into your thoughts more quickly
than, say, Ansel Adams’s “portraits” of the U.S. national parks. And when
you photographed an architectural treasure such as the Eiffel Tower, didn’t
you include a family member in the picture?
We’re fascinated by photographs of people, so we take lots of them. However,
people are the most difficult of all subjects to photograph because of the
complexity of human ego, awareness, and opinion. When was the last time
the Eiffel Tower complained that your picture made it look too fat? Has
anyone ever told you that your photo of the Grand Canyon “didn’t really look
like the Grand Canyon?” Has anyone worried that the presidents on Mount
Rushmore would blink during an exposure?
This chapter is an introduction to the many facets of people photography.
You find out how to take great portraits, capture vivid candid photos, and
manage unruly group pictures. If you can handle those, all other forms of
digital photography are a snap.
123

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Capturing Satisfying Portraits
There are two basic categories of people photography: portraits and can-
dids. Portraits are posed photos that are taken in a controlled environment;
candids are unplanned pictures that are taken of people in the act of being
themselves. Portraits show people as they would like to be seen; candids
portray them as they really are.
Each category can produce images that range from the mundane to the sub-
lime. To make the step up from mundane isn’t hard. In fact, the average
novice can achieve significant improvement just through better composi-
tion and lighting alone.
You don’t need a lot of training to shoot candid photos after you’ve mastered
the features of your digital camera and the rules of composition. Just go out
and take pictures. Portraits, on the other hand, demand some special skills
if you want the images to “look” like portraits. The techniques that you need
to capture satisfying portraits are the emphasis in this chapter. The good
news is that these capabilities are within the range of the average photogra-
pher; he or she just needs someone to outline the tools and techniques that
work. That’s what this chapter is for.
But first, a few ground rules. Take care of the following simple aspects, and
you can’t go wrong:
✦Make it possible for your subjects to look their best. Suggest that they
wear suitable clothes. Encourage them to use a friend or family member
to help them prepare. Provide access to a good-sized mirror so that
they can check their appearance. A portrait subject that knows he or
she looks good will photograph well!
✦Get to know your subject’s personality. Be careful about trying to make
a somber, serious type individual look cheerful and gay; the picture can
look forced and fake. Getting a happy type to look serious is easier, but
why do that? Unless you’re taking an executive portrait (where serious
is good), go for the smile. Use what you know about the subject to
create a portrait that reflects his or her personality.
✦Provide comfortable surroundings to help people stay relaxed. A
clean, organized shooting area puts your subjects at ease, as can some
soft mood music. If your subject doesn’t feel that he or she is standing
in front of a firing squad, your photos turn out much better.
Successful portraiture begins with getting your subjects in the right frame
of mind. Relaxed, confident people pose better than nervous, tense ones, so
make every effort to start things off right. If you are successful, you get a
portrait like the one shown in Figure 9-1.

Shooting on Location or in the Studio
Shooting on Location or in the Studio
Because portrait “sittings” are generally carefully arranged, these kinds of
shoots offer the photographer the advantage of being able to exercise a
great deal of control over creation of the image, both in location and light-
ing. You can choose to shoot in the studio (which can be any indoor room,
including your living room or garage) or on location (which can range from
your backyard to a park or other site).

125

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
You don’t need to have a “real” studio to shoot studio portraits. Indeed,
most of you don’t have dedicated studio. At best, you may have a place that
serves double duty as a studio as well as some other function. I took some
of my favorite portraits in an attic “studio” that was little more than a large
space hung with multiple rolls of seamless backdrop paper, a few painted
backgrounds, and lots of room to arrange lights. At worst, your studio may
be an area that can be temporarily reconfigured to serve as a photographic
environment. Back the car out of the garage and hang a backdrop, and you
have a studio.
So, in this chapter, when I refer to a studio, I mean any indoor location that
can be used to take posed photographs. I don’t mean to imply that you have
to build a home studio to use any of the techniques that I describe here.
Deciding whether to shoot in your studio or on location must be based on the
kind of photos that you want to take. Shooting in the studio offers the utmost
in control for a photographer, particularly when you’re working in a studio
that you’ve set up and become comfortable in. Your studio can become a
warm, comfortable cocoon that nurtures your creativity and talent.
Of course, sometimes, we all have to leave our comfortable surroundings and
brave the outside world. Location photography may pull us out of our com-
fort zone, but it also gives us something hard to find in the studio — scenery.
Such honest-to-goodness great outdoors beauty is shown in Figure 9-2.
Think of location shooting as your outdoor studio. Most of the techniques
that I describe later in this chapter apply to location photography although
you may have to use reflectors instead of external flash units, and you have
less control over your backgrounds. The chief requirements for location
shooting are as follows:
✦Portability: If you plan to regularly shoot on location, you need to
assemble a versatile kit of equipment that you can set up and break
down quickly.
✦Flexibility: Because no two location shoots are identical, try for a
portable location kit that provides the greatest flexibility for lighting
both your subject and, if need be, elements of the location that appear
in the shot.
✦Creativity: Put together a portable studio system that lets you create
different shots and moods. Consider props that are portable and versa-
tile. Make sure that your kit includes a good set of posing blocks (struc-
tures, often of wood or plastic, that can be sat or stood on) so that you
can adjust the height of various posers.
Location shoots give you the chance to provide your clients with something
different from the typical portrait sitting. Every area has a special site of
some sort that can serve as a backdrop for memorable images — for exam-
ple, a gorgeous hotel lobby, a public park, a forest, or a lake.

Setting Up an Informal Portrait Studio
Many photographers who pursue their art as a hobby or sideline like a
simple, informal home studio that can be set up easily and broken down
when the shoot is done. Such a studio fills their needs without taking over
part of their house.

127

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Others want to have the option of taking their show on the road. A simple
portrait studio can also be a transportable portrait studio. Even if you’re
working on a tight budget, you can come up with a lighting system that
improves your photography.
Depending on your needs, a pair of accessory flash units can help give you
the balanced lighting that you need to capture that natural-lighting look. If
your budget permits a better system, you can build to a more powerful,
semiprofessional system.
Choosing Backgrounds
Sometimes, you want to pose people in their natural environment, even for
“formal” portraits. A family can be posed in their living room seated on a
couch. An attorney can be pictured in front of a wall of law books. (This is
almost a tradition. Don’t forget to include a flag!) If you apply the same rules
of posing and lighting to such a portrait as for more traditional studio por-
traits, the results will be quite good.
However, most formal portraits call for a “real” portrait background. For an
indoor studio, you need to have something more attractive than just a bare
wall for a background; fortunately, a wide variety of choices are available
for every budget. Samples of these choices are as follows:
✦The simplest choice is a roll of seamless background paper, like that
shown in Figure 9-3. These rolls are available in a wide variety of colors
and are easy to use (and yes, you’re allowed to laugh if you’re reminded
of a roll of Christmas wrapping paper). You usually just hang up a roll
on some kind of support and unroll as much as you need for a shoot.
(Bring enough down to cover a couple of feet of the floor, and have your
subject stand on it.) As a section of the backdrop paper becomes dirty
or wrinkled, just roll down some more. Cut off the damaged part, and
throw it away. You can keep a selection of three to five different rolls
and switch among them as needed.
Figure 9-3:

128

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Choosing Backgrounds
✦More complicated choices include painted linen backdrops, which pro-
vide a more interesting texture and color gradient. These backgrounds
are more expensive and weigh more than the seamless paper, so they
may not be a great choice for a portable setup or for the home enthusiast,
who may need the studio for family use when not doing photography.
✦For those making their living doing portraits, a higher-end system offers a
multiple-background setup that can be used for either a permanent studio
or a traveling one. Such a rig has multiple rollers with different backdrops
on it. The portrait photographer creates one set of portraits with one
background and then another set with a second or even third back-
ground. Often, the backgrounds and poses complement each other — say,
an athletic field for a sports-type portrait, with props such as a football in
the child’s arm. This way, you can create a combination of both formal
and informal images, making multiple sales more likely.
Nothing is more distracting than a cluttered wall as a background. Even a
simple roll of seamless paper as a backdrop can do a lot to make your por-
traits look more professional.
Selecting supports for lights, camera, and subjects
Good portraits require lighting beyond the flash that’s built in to your digi-
tal camera. In most cases, you need two or more external lights. And
because lights, cameras, and subjects all need to be moved from time to
time, how you support the lights is important. Supports need to be light
enough to move around easily and collapse small enough to be portable,
and yet they must be sturdy and solid enough to safely hold your gear.
You need different supports for lights, backgrounds, camera, and people. As
usual, the choices span all budgets and setups. Try to build a system that
allows future upgrades or studio expansions.
When planning your support system, such as the one shown in Figure 9-4,
aim for versatility and portability. Consider the following items:
✦Lighting support: Your lighting supports should be strong enough to
support an external lighting unit, up to and including a relatively heavy
flash with soft box or umbrella reflectors (more on these later). The
supports should be capable of raising the lights high enough to be effec-
tive. Look for light stands that are capable of extending 6 to 7 feet high.
✦Camera support: A good, solid tripod that’s sturdy enough to support
your camera represents the starting point. If your setup is likely to call
for a lot of back-and-forth movement as you shift from individual to
group portraits, you may want to consider a camera dolly device — a
kind of wagon on wheels — that lets you slide your camera/tripod rig
back and forth as needed.
✦Subject support: Posing your subject is easier if you can have her sitting
rather than standing. (This is why portrait sessions are usually known
as sittings.) The tool of choice for this sort of thing is the pneumatic
posing stool. These stools are much easier to operate than older-style
corkscrew-type chairs, which have to be spun to raise or lower them to
129

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
the right height for portraiture. With a pneumatic stool, you simply
press a lever to control an air-driven piston that raises or lowers the
chair. At under $100 each, these stools are reasonably affordable. A
posing table is also a useful option, particularly if you need to take a
shot of a baby in his or her carrier. However, you don’t always need to
buy these devices. You can find stools and tables around the home that
can serve your purpose.

Choosing Backgrounds
If you want to use photo gear, you can find lots of options at most camera
stores or in many camera magazines. A good basic setup includes at least
one posing chair (preferably two), three light stands (two capable of reach-
ing 6 or 7 feet high and a third, shorter one), a mobile tripod, a posing table,
and posing blocks. Posing blocks are nesting wooden blocks made in varying
heights that are big enough for people to stand on. Using these blocks helps
you make people taller as needed to get the proper posing relationships.
Basic lighting equipment
Properly lighting your subject is one of the most challenging aspects of por-
trait photography. Many different approaches to lighting and many different
types of lighting resources are available.
Choosing a lighting system and approach is a function both of the type of
people photography that you want to do and the budget that you have to
spend. Even a beginning photographer can create a basic, inexpensive light-
ing system that’s capable of delivering high-quality results.
Putting together a lighting kit depends on how big your budget is, what kinds
of portraiture you hope to do, and how big a percentage of your photography
this kind of shooting represents. Obviously, the photographer who needs to
shoot only the occasional portrait can get by with a less sophisticated setup
than someone who plans to focus mainly on portraiture. Lighting choices fall
into several different categories, as discussed in the following sections.
Existing light
Also known as available darkness, existing light is whatever lets you see
your way around. It can be sunlight, room lights, or a combination of differ-
ent light sources. Sometimes, though, you can give Mother Nature some
help with the following tools:
✦Reflectors: Reflectors enable you to bounce light into areas of the scene
that need it. Any material that can bounce light into areas of heavy
shadow can help make existing light work more in your favor. Whether
it is an assistant holding a piece of foam board or a reflective disk held
in place by a clamp and stand, this can be an inexpensive and portable
way of making your lighting better. Although some pretty fancy (read
expensive) reflectors are on the market, spending a lot isn’t necessary.
A simple piece of white foam board can do the job beautifully. Use your
main light source (the sun) to light a three-quarter section of your sub-
ject, and then position the reflector to bounce sunlight onto the remain-
ing quarter. This lightens the shadows and gives a greater sense of
dimension to your photo.
✦Room lights: Sometimes, your goal is to give the most natural possible
setting and feel to an image. If this means working without accessory
lights, managing the room’s lights properly can be a big help. If you can
position a lamp to throw a little more light to a shadow area, you can
clean up a heavy shadow, or depending on the mood that you’re aiming
for, you can bring your lights all to one side and have your subject
emerging from the shadows.
131

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Working with available darkness is one of photography’s greatest challenges.
Yet if you can use it successfully, you can produce exceptionally natural-
looking images. Look for ways to control the impact of the building’s lights,
and remember, you don’t have to accept what’s there. It’s okay to shift a
lamp closer to or farther from your subject. You can also unscrew some light
bulbs while leaving others on or even mask lighting fixtures with cardboard
or gaffer’s tape (a special kind of tape that doesn’t leave a residue when
pulled off the lights). Yep, that’s the same “gaffer” that you’ve noticed in film
credits — they specialize in movie lighting.
Electronic flash
Accessory flash units are your first tool in the battle to correct undesirable
lighting conditions. These small, portable light sources provide you with a lot
of options and can be used to produce some amazing results. Photographers
who use a multiple flash setup can produce lighting results that are similar to
those found in the studio. You can put together a small, three-flash lighting kit
that can fit in a small suitcase or carrying case. If you’re planning to put
together such a flash kit, consider the following things:
✦Supports (again): You definitely need some sort of system for holding
your flash units in position. Lightweight minitripods that can be set on
tabletops or other elevated surfaces and positioned as needed work
well. The marketplace has also produced a wide variety of clamps with
standard 3⁄8-inch tripod threads that can also hold a flash and be used
to position it high enough to work effectively. Some tripods also come
with feet or stands for mounting so that they can be stand erect on a flat
surface.
✦Light modifiers: After you’ve positioned your flash units, it’s time to make
the quality of your light as pleasing as possible. When used head on,
direct flash is harsh, showing every flaw and imperfection. Experienced
photographers have a number of different ways of solving this problem.
One solution is called bounce flash. Here, the flash units are pointed
toward the ceiling, and the light is reflected down to the subject, spread-
ing and softening the light and making it more pleasing. Other tools that
improve the quality of light are as follows:
• Devices that attach to the flash head and reflect light (such as white
cards)
• Devices that cover the flash head and soften the light as it comes
through the device (such as the Sto-Fen Omni Bounce)
• A small soft box, which is essentially a piece of white cloth or other
material that’s stretched over a frame, as shown in Figure 9-5
✦Power: Keeping your flashes firing during a long shoot can be a daunt-
ing task if you’re just relying on AA batteries. Devices such as Quantum
rechargeable batteries can provide enough juice for your flash units to
keep pace with even your most frenetic shooting. Many of these units
can provide power to a pair of flashes simultaneously.

Two or three good flash units with some form of supporting gear and the
appropriate light modifiers can give you a very effective portable lighting
setup. Such a kit can give significantly better results than just a single flash
unit and is versatile enough to be useful in a variety of situations.
Photographic slaves — electronic units that trigger multiple flashes that are
not connected physically to the camera — are needed to fire the flashes
with either a photoelectric trigger or a wireless radio transmitter.

Incandescent lights
Incandescent lighting is the same lighting that most of us use to light our
homes. Enterprising manufacturers have created inexpensive photo lighting
kits that use regular light bulbs instead of the more expensive tungsten
lighting setups.
Professional studio lighting
If you’re serious about portraiture, you may want to consider professional
studio lighting, which isn’t too expensive for a photo hobbyist who spent a
thousand dollars or so on a camera alone. Many digital cameras are capable
of firing expensive and high-quality studio lighting kits. These kits, which
use very powerful flash heads, provide a predictable, steady light source.
Several differences exist between these flash heads and the more common
accessory flash units that I discuss earlier. For a start, the power output of
these flash heads is measured in watt-seconds (ws), whereas the output of
on-camera flashes is usually measured in guide numbers (gn).
Another difference is that these professional units draw too much power to
get by on either batteries or portable power packs. Instead, an electric outlet
feeds them either directly or via a separate power supply (which can usually
feed two or more lights at a time).
The advantages to using such a high-power system are as follows:
✦The nearly unlimited power supply means that you can get greater light
output. This enables the photographer to shoot at smaller apertures
(larger-numbered f-stops). The resulting greater depth of field that’s pro-
vided by smaller apertures means that you can shoot larger groups of
people and have them all in focus, plus it allows sharper overall images.
✦You don’t have to wait for your lights to recycle. This means that you
can blaze away, taking shot after shot without having to wait for the
flash heads to recharge.
✦You can take advantage of modeling lights, the incandescent lamps that
are built in to the studio flash that show exactly how the light from the
flash will look. Many of the higher-quality studio lights have built-in
modeling lights that stay on the whole time you’re working. These lights
aren’t as powerful as the main flash heads, but they show you where
shadows will fall on your subject and can help you check for hot spots
on eyeglasses.
✦You have more control over lighting. This means that you can set one
light for full power and another for a lower percentage of power output.
In this way, the full-power light acts as a “main” light while the second,
less powerful light simply fills in the shadows.
Studio lighting kits can range in price from a few hundred dollars for a set of
lights, stands, and reflectors to thousands of dollars for a high-end lighting
system that includes all the necessary accessories. The good news is that
you don’t need a top-of-the-line system to produce top-of-the-line results.

Lighting gadgets
A huge assortment of lighting gadgets is on the market, and all of them
promise to be easy to use and to produce a higher quality of light. The good
news is that for the most part, these claims are reasonably true. In the fol-
lowing sections, I give you a quick summary of what’s out there, ranging
from useful and just about free up to high-tech and pricey.
Inexpensive (or free!) gadgets
No such thing as a free lunch . . . or, perhaps more appropriately, free equip-
ment? Guess again — here’s a list of accessories that you can make for pen-
nies that deliver professional results!
✦The all-time classic is something called The White Card Trick. Set your
flash to bounce mode (point it at the ceiling!) and take a 3-x-5-inch index
card and attach it to the flash with a rubber band, as shown in Figure 9-6.
Have the card extend 3 or more inches up the flash head. When you fire
the flash, some of the light bounces off the ceiling, while more light kicks
off the white card to throw some light into your subject’s face, as shown
in Figure 9-7.
✦If your supply of index cards has been depleted, you can always try using
The Spoon Trick. Similar to the preceding method, this trick involves
having the photographer use a cheap plastic spoon in much the same
way as the card. Some photographers maintain that the curvature of the
spoon throws the light out in a curve to provide a more pleasing effect.
I’ve used both methods, and they both work pretty well. It’s also pretty
easy to carry some rubber bands, plastic spoons, and index cards in your
camera bag, or you can find the stuff at most shooting locations.
✦For those with a hint of mechanical ability, a third version is to take a
piece of aircraft aluminum (white or copper-colored) and cut it in a
square or 3-x-5 shape. Use hook and loop tape on the square and the
back of your flash head. Store the card by attaching it upside down
when not in use and then just pull it off, flip it, and reattach it for use.
Although white is pretty standard, using a copper-colored piece can
slightly warm the color of your light.
✦Just so it doesn’t look like all I know is different versions of the White
Card Trick, here’s one that’s a little different. Get one of those white
frosted plastic bottles of rubbing alcohol (one whose waist is about the
same diameter as your flash head). Remove the alcohol (this is impor-
tant), and then cut the bottom of the bottle about 2 inches down the
waist. Then snug the waist (the end with the bottom) over the flash
head. You can now shoot with the flash head angled almost vertically
and get a much softer light. (The Alcohol Bottle Trick creates an inex-
pensive alternative to a product known as the Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce,
which I describe in the next section.) You can also use a spoon as a
reflector, as shown in Figure 9-8. Funny how those utensils come in so
handy, isn’t it?

✦If you have only a small, fixed flash — fixed as in it can’t pivot or tilt, not
fixed as in repaired (but this doesn’t work if the flash is broken either) —
there’s another way to soften and spread the light from it. Take an old,
clear 35mm film canister (see if one of your less technologically advanced
friends has one or visit a camera store) and tape it over the flash head.
Variations of this trick involve placing a sheet of tissue inside the film can-
ister to diffuse (soften) the light a bit or using colored tissue papers to
change the color of the light that the flash produces. This isn’t as big a
deal these days, when you can produce all sorts of similar effects in an
image-editing program. Still, if you’re not real comfortable trying effects
on the computer, this method lets you experiment while taking the shot.
✦Many department stores carry cheap, L-shaped flash brackets. Your
camera mounts onto the flash bracket, while your flash fits into a flash
mount at the top of the L. To use a setup like this, you must have some
way of triggering your flash when it is not attached to the camera. You
can do this in several ways. If your camera has a PC connection (and I
don’t mean the way to connect it to your computer or being politically
correct; I’m talking about a small circular electrical linkage), you con-
nect your flash via a PC cable. A second method is to use a photoelec-
tric slave to trigger your accessory flash unit. To do this, you use your
camera’s built-in flash unit, perhaps blocking most of its light output
with gaffer’s tape or masking tape.
You have many inexpensive ways of improving the quality of your artificial
light. Even the simple White Card Trick combined with bounced flash gives
you much better results than bombing away with direct flash. Keep this
method in mind even when your available light is enough for a good expo-
sure. The light that’s kicked forward from the white card is a great way to
fill in shadows from ball caps and other similarly billed haberdashery items.

Moderately priced gadgets
For just a few pennies (well, maybe dollars) more, you can add the following
items to your lighting toolbox:
✦Omni-Bounce: Sto-Fen (www.stofen.com) makes several inexpensive
light-modifier devices. Best known is the Omni-Bounce, a frosted plastic
attachment that fits over the flash head and softens the light consider-
ably. The device is used by setting the flash head to a 45-degree angle. If
your subject is more than 15 feet away, set the flash to fire straight on.
Figure 9-8:

a plastic
spoon. No,
I’m not
kidding.
It works.
138

Book I
Chapter 9

Choosing Backgrounds
The price is about $20. The company also makes colored versions of the
Omni-Bounce, which cost a few dollars more.
✦Two-Way: Sto-Fen also makes a product called a Two-Way. This is a stur-
dier approach to the White Card Trick, and it works in a similar manner.
Its price is also about $20.
✦Lumiquest attachments: Another company, Lumiquest, (www.lumiquest.
com) makes a whole range of flash attachments that offer a bunch of differ-
ent capabilities. These range from simple bounce hoods that kick the
flash’s output forward and spread it out to ones that perform very spe-
cialized functions. Variations of the basic bouncer include attachments to
allow some light to bounce off the ceiling while the rest is kicked forward.
Another version sends the light through a frosted panel to soften it even
more. A third variation permits the insertion of colored panels to change
the color of the light that the flash produces while bouncing it.
✦Soft boxes: A soft box is an attachment that mounts on the head of the
flash and extends out 6 to 8 inches, with a frosted white panel at the
end. This attachment lets the light from the flash spread out a bit inside
the soft box, softening the light as it passes through the frosted end.
(Pro portrait studios often sport a similar but much larger version on
their studio flashes.) Lumiquest, as well as several other companies,
also make soft box attachments for portable flash units.
✦Snoots: Lumiquest also makes a snoot. Please restrain your mirth: A
snoot is a tube-like device that focuses the flash’s light to a very small
area. For example, a snoot can be used to create a highlight on some-
one’s hair.
✦Barn doors: Lumiquest’s barn doors attachment fits several of its bounce
flash attachments. Barn doors are flat panels that can be swung open and
closed to more finely tune light output.
✦Flash brackets: Moderately priced flash brackets tend to be sturdier
than their inexpensive counterparts, plus they usually tend to lift the
flash higher above the camera. Otherwise, these brackets work the
same way as the inexpensive ones.
A decent light modifier can be a pleasure to work with, can significantly
improve your photos, and doesn’t have to cost you an arm and a leg. Many
are available for less than $50. You have a wide variety of choices, depend-
ing on your needs. For photographers who work mainly out of a camera
bag, a small, collapsible light modifier is a better choice than one of the
bigger, more cumbersome units. Those who work from a home studio are
better off with one of the bigger soft boxes that give a nice-quality light.
Higher-priced gadgets
I’m not talking thousands of dollars here, but costs for the following items
may still add up a bit. The quality, however, rises with the price.
✦Soft boxes: Some companies make a fancier soft box attachment that
mounts on the flash head via spring-loaded clips. These devices are
bigger and feature a deeper well for the light to spread out before hit-
ting the frosted panel. These units also tend to be sturdier than the less
expensive versions.
139

✦Umbrella units: Another option is to mount your flash on a combination
flash stand with a photographic umbrella. This kind of rig lets you set up
a multiple-flash lighting system that produces very pleasing lighting with-
out the expense of buying portrait studio flash heads. These devices are
usually triggered via some form of slave. The price is about $100.
✦Flash brackets: Examples in this category tend to be very sturdy and
may extend the flash as much as 1 foot or more above the camera. Some
offer expanded capabilities — such as the ability to accept a flash
umbrella, making for a heavy, but versatile, rig. Many of the more expen-
sive units, such as several made by Stroboframe (www.saundersphoto.
com/html/body_strobo.htm has information about these products), offer
the ability to rotate the camera and/or flash for vertical orientation.
If you’re serious about using your digital camera for portrait photography,
the equipment that I mention here adds a lot of bang for your buck. The
umbrella rigs tend to be better for studio setups, whereas the soft boxes
and heavy-duty flash brackets stay manageable for photographers who do
most of their work on the road.
Choosing power sources
Keeping your portrait flash units supplied with power is a key to effective
flash photography. You have several ways to get juice to your flash heads,
and they vary in both price and effectiveness. Don’t skimp here if you
expect to rely on your flashes. The wrong choice will cost you images and
make you miserable. Some flash unit power sources are as follows:
✦AA batteries: These are the standard power source for your average
accessory flash unit. The advantage is that they’re inexpensive and can
be found almost anywhere. There’s a choice among alkaline, lithium, and
standard types. Alkaline and lithium are better choices because they recy-
cle faster than the standard type. Rechargeable types are also available in
several different versions, including nickel-cadmium (NiCad), alkaline,
and nickel metal hydride (NiMH). The big disadvantage to all of these is
that they drain fairly quickly, leaving you to frantically change batteries
while hoping that you don’t miss a shot.
✦Portable battery packs: Several different manufacturers make high-
capacity portable battery packs that can provide power for a wide vari-
ety of flash units. The best-known manufacturer is Quantum Instruments
(www.qtm.com), which makes several different styles, along with adapters
for most current flash units. While these rigs are much more expensive
than AA batteries (plan to spend from $150 to $200 for a new battery
pack and flash module), they can power tons of flash cycles before run-
ning out of juice. They also keep your flash firing longer during motor-
drive bursts (although not indefinitely).
A good portable power pack can provide enough juice to power a couple
of flash units through a wedding, prom, or public affairs event. Having
one available can really make your life easier.

Lighting Basics
Lighting Basics
The idea behind using artificial light is to provide enough illumination to
adequately light your subject in a pleasing manner. The simplest, most
basic method is to use a single flash — preferably with some form of light
modification or by bouncing — with the flash unit raised higher than the
camera.
You can maximize the effectiveness of a one-light photographic system in
several ways. First and foremost is to get the flash up off the camera. The
closer the flash is to the lens, the greater the likelihood of red-eye — that
nasty red glare that appears in the eyes when light bounces off the subject’s
retina. Extending your flash unit’s height helps your photography quite a
bit. You can do this in several ways:
✦The old “Statue of Liberty” play: Use an off-camera shoe cord (an intelli-
gent cord that communicates between the camera and dedicated flash
unit to retain the camera’s ability to meter light through the lens) or a
PC cord to lift the flash high above the camera, and either point the
light directly at your subject or bounce it off the ceiling.
✦L-Brackets: Use an L-bracket — or something based on an L-bracket
design, such as a Stroboframe grip — to raise the flash above the
camera.
✦A flash stand with an umbrella reflector: This either requires a long PC
cord or a wireless transmitter to trigger the flash unit.
One advantage of getting the flash up off the camera is that it re-creates the
single high light source that you’re used to seeing naturally — the sun. A
second advantage is that by getting the flash off the camera and at a higher
angle, you reduce the likelihood of red-eye.
Using multiple light sources
A more advanced, but still basic, lighting system calls for multiple lights
that are arranged in one of several ways. Although a multiple-light system
doesn’t re-create the natural light of the sun, it allows you to create a very
pleasing and effective lighting package.
Advantages of a multiple-light system include the following:
✦Precise control over how much illumination you provide for a scene:
Even if your lights are more powerful than you want, you can add
screens to reduce output or shift your lights farther back.
✦More control over the mood of the image: You can control the location
and intensity of shadows and highlights.
✦An adaptable lighting kit: You can adapt your lighting kit to a wide vari-
ety of shoots and to any number of subjects. Some lighting kits are even
versatile enough to be brought on location.
141

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Multiple lighting setups, like the equipment shown in Figure 9-9, can mean
the difference between an adequate portrait photo and a good one. While a
multilight setup doesn’t guarantee better quality, getting the hang of such
an arrangement can do a lot to improve your portrait photography.
Arranging a multiple-light setup
After you decide that you want to use a multiple-light setup, you need to
know where to put it. Setting up a multiple-light system isn’t very hard; it’s
just a question of positioning your lights to illuminate your subject in an
attractive manner.
With a multiple-light setup, each light has a different role to play. Under-
standing the basic arrangement helps you get started down the road to
good portrait photography.
Main light
This is your primary light source. (Go figure.) The main light provides most
of the illumination for your subject. An effective two-light studio system can
be set up with a big main light firing straight on your subject through a big
soft box (not the kind that mounts on an accessory flash, but a big studio
model that’s about 18 inches tall and 36 inches wide), with a second back
light to separate your subject from the background (more on back lights in
a minute).
This principle also works with a smaller shoe-mount flash and soft box, but
the quality of the light doesn’t compare to that of the studio system. Gener-
ally, the difference is noticeable when you’re trying to shoot larger groups
or doing a lot of sittings. For an occasional small group and a limited
number of exposures, the small portable system does the job pretty well.
Figure 9-9:

142

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Lighting Basics
The following list gives you some ways to maximize the effectiveness of
your main light:
✦Get it up high. Your main light should be higher than your subject. You
don’t have to be ridiculous here; keeping the light about a foot or so
higher than your tallest subject does the trick.
✦Make an effort to improve the quality of your light, either via a soft box
or by using an umbrella system.
✦Provide enough power to shoot at a small aperture, thus giving you
greater depth of field. Because shooting through a soft box or off an
umbrella costs you some light, you need a lot of power to shoot a big
group at f/11 or f/16.
✦Recycle quickly. How quickly your main light recycles (recharges so that
it can be ready to fire again) is very important. You want your lights to
keep pace with your workflow, not the other way around. During a sit-
ting, it’s important to develop a rhythm with your clients while posing
and photographing them. A break in that rhythm, particularly one
caused by your lights not being ready, can make your life difficult.
Your main light should provide a soft, even illumination with enough power
to keep your subject in focus from front to back. Most often, the main light
is set up a couple of feet to the right or left of your subject’s centerline and
angled toward that center. Figure 9-10 shows a portrait subject illuminated
only by a main light.
Fill light
The fill light is the light that’s used to fill in the shadow areas that are cre-
ated by the main light. For the most versatile system, plan on using the
same model flash head for your fill light as you do for your main light. This
gives you the option of setting the same power ratios — the settings on
your flash that reduce or increase the amount of light emitted — for each
light. Such a lighting system, with two comparable lights about 6 feet apart
angled toward the center point of your sitting, enables you to build your
group size without having to reconfigure your lighting. This is a huge advan-
tage if you’re doing a large number of sittings during the course of a day.
Just because you can bomb both flash heads away at their highest power
settings and create an even light doesn’t mean that you have to. You can
always dial down the power setting on your second flash head and create a
more interesting lighting effect for your subject. Experiment with 2:1 and 3:1
power ratios, and see which you prefer.
If you have a fill light that doesn’t let you reduce or increase the power, try
moving the flash back a bit or try placing a diffuser such as a handkerchief
over the flash. Thanks to your digital camera’s review feature, you can
quickly see whether you’ve reduced the amount of light enough.
Some tips for setting up your fill light are as follows:
✦Your fill light should be roughly the same height as your main light,
although slightly lower is okay.
143

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦The fill light should receive some kind of modification, via an umbrella,
soft box, or diffusion screen (a thin screen-like material that diffuses or
softens the light).
The fill light helps balance your portrait lighting and creates a sense of
depth for your image. Used properly, it can also create a moody or romantic
image through the carefully controlled play of shadows. Figure 9-11 (the
same subject as Figure 9-10) shows the photo with a fill light added.

Lighting Basics
Hair light
The hair light is a small, carefully controlled light that’s used to put a high-
light on the subject’s hair. This type of lighting can also be referred to as rim
lighting.
Most often, the hair light is controlled via either a snoot or through a barn
doors attachment on a flash head. The light itself doesn’t need to be partic-
ularly powerful, because it’s responsible for lighting only a small area. Most
Figure 9-11:

details.
145

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
often, the hair light is positioned closely to the subject (just out of the
camera’s view) via a boom (a raised arm that’s attached to a lighting stand)
that allows the hair light to reach into the portrait area from up high.
To use a hair light, position it so that the light is directed almost straight
back into the camera, raking across the top of the subject’s head, to pro-
duce an effect like that shown in Figure 9-12.

146

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Lighting Basics
Background light
The background light, as its name suggests, is used to light up the back-
ground as well as to create some separation between the subject and 
background.
This light is generally mounted on a small lighting stand and is pointed
upward at the background; a small screen is usually mounted on the light
to help spread the light over the backdrop. Be careful to position the light
so that the lighting stand stays hidden behind your subject.
When using the background light, keep the following tips in mind:
✦Set the background light about 2 feet from the backdrop and 2 to 3 feet
off the ground.
✦Try to keep your background light on a separate power circuit than
your main and fill lights. Because the main, fill, and background lights
are usually the most powerful lights in your setup, having them on the
same power supply or circuit can place excessive stress on your power
source.
✦Angle the background light upward about 45 degrees so that the light
spreads upward and outward from below your subjects.
✦Mount a diffusion screen (which can be as simple as a handkerchief or
any other diffusing material) on the light head to soften the light as it
spreads up the backdrop. Using the screen helps prevent the light from
creating hot spots — those annoying bright areas that can crop up in a
background if the light isn’t spread evenly.
Adding a background light to your portrait setup makes for a cleaner, more
pleasing portrait — like the one shown in Figure 9-13 — because it helps
separate your subjects from the background. While the background light is
hardly the most important light in your setup, without this light, your sub-
jects can get lost in a dark background.
Additional light sources
The four lights that I discuss in the previous sections can take care of
the majority of lighting situations, but they’re certainly not the only way to
create interesting lighting. For some neat alternatives, try one (or more) of
the following:
✦Reflectors: Sometimes, rather than using a fill light, the photographer
bounces light from an angled main light into a reflector that’s positioned
near the model but still outside the picture area. This can be a good
solution if you don’t own a second electronic flash.
✦Window lighting: Another charming source of light can be the nearest
window. Window-lit portraits require a bright, sunny day with sunlight
pouring in through the window. Position your subject on a chair near
the window, and make sure that your digital camera takes its exposure
reading from the portion of his or her cheek that’s illuminated by the
sunlight. If done properly, your subject appears to emerge from the
shadows bathed in a golden glow. A variation of this lighting technique
147

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
is to use a reflector to kick some light back into the shadow area so that
some detail is returned to the side that doesn’t receive sunlight.
✦Sun and fill: A typical example of this form of lighting is the swimsuit
model at the beach. The model is positioned so that the early-morning
sunlight acts as the main light, and a reflector is positioned to direct
some light into the shadow areas. This is a very nice style of lighting;
unfortunately, it requires you to get up early!
The last two methods can produce some beautiful lighting but are hard to
use for groups or a large number of sittings. It can be hard to schedule a sit-
ting for this kind of lighting technique, too.

Basic Lighting Techniques
If you understand the basic lighting equipment and how it is used (which I
describe in the previous sections), you’re ready to become familiar with
common techniques that can be applied with main, fill, background, and hair
lights. In this section and the next, I describe several different lighting tech-
niques, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Although you can
set up a basic lighting style that produces an even, acceptable light that
works for a variety of situations, this doesn’t necessarily bring out the best
in your subject. Still, you may find yourself in a situation that calls for you to
photograph a large number of setups as efficiently as possible. Such jobs —
weddings, church directories, and proms, to name a few — come up quite
often and call for photographers to shoot lots of different setups (called sit-
tings) quickly.
Keep the following basic lighting setups in mind for those times when you
have to shoot a lot of sittings as efficiently as possible:
✦Set up your main light straight down the center, and use a big soft box
to spread and soften the quality of the light. Set up a second light as a
background light, and you’re good to go. Depending on the size of your
soft box, the power of your main flash head, the size of your backdrop,
and your posing resources, you can easily illuminate a 15- or 16-person
group. You don’t have much flexibility in this setup, though.
✦Use a three-light arrangement with a pair of identical flash heads firing
into umbrella reflectors as your main and fill lights. Set both flash heads
for the same power output so that you don’t have to worry about rear-
ranging your subjects according to shadows. Set your lights up about
6 feet apart (horizontally), with each pointed toward the center posing
spot, and 4 or 5 feet away from your subject.
These basic lighting setups can get you started. You can take a nice, profes-
sional-looking portrait with either of these lighting arrangements, but your
portraits won’t look much different from those of the photo studio at your
local department store.
Advanced Lighting Techniques
The technique that you choose depends on your subjects’ features. One
style of lighting can flatter a person’s face while showing another’s poorly.
Each technique can be created with a basic three-light lighting kit.
As you increase your photographic capabilities, learning to use more
advanced lighting techniques helps you stand apart from the Opti-Mart
down the block.
Two forms of advanced lighting techniques rely on turning your subject’s
head so that his or her face isn’t staring directly into the camera. These
techniques are called short lighting and broad lighting.
149

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Short lighting
Short lighting is a technique in which the main light source comes from the
side of the face that’s directed away from the camera, as shown in Figure 9-14.
Short lighting is a valuable lighting style because it tends to narrow overly
broad faces. It’s also sometimes referred to as narrow lighting.
Figure 9-14:
The effect is

150

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Advanced Lighting Techniques
To set up a short lighting arrangement, do the following:
✦Turn your subject’s face so that it is angled somewhat to the right or left
of the camera (not too much though; this isn’t supposed to be a profile
shot). When you do this, the side of the face that you can see more of is
called the broad side of the face, while the side that you see less of is
known as the short or narrow side of the face.
✦In short lighting, you set up your main light to illuminate the short side
of the subject’s face and then add a fill light or reflector to fill in some
light on the broad side of the face. Add a fill light to separate your sub-
ject from the background for a good three-light setup and a hair light for
a four-light configuration.
Short lighting is a particularly nice form of lighting for the female face,
because it accentuates the eyes, cheeks, nose, and mouth in an attractive
way. This style of lighting can also be used to make a broad male face look
thinner.
Broad lighting
Broad lighting, shown in Figure 9-15, is essentially the reverse of short light-
ing. It widens narrow or thin faces by emphasizing the side of the face that’s
turned toward the camera. Here the subject’s face receives the main light
on its broad side, with a fill or reflector used to lighten or eliminate the
shadows on the short side.
This is a useful lighting technique for thin faces, but it should be used care-
fully with women.
To set up a broad lighting arrangement, do the following:
✦Turn your model’s face so that the main light illuminates the broader
side of the face.
✦Use your reflector to bounce some light into the shadow areas of your
subject’s face. Be careful with this lighting technique, because it can
make a normal face seem very full.
Butterfly lighting
An even more glamorous style of lighting that works well for posing women
is called butterfly lighting, as shown in Figure 9-16. This type of lighting cre-
ates a subtle butterfly of light; the bridge of the nose is the axis for the
“wings” of light that spread over the eyes and cheeks.
This style of lighting does not work as well for men because it tends to
throw too much light on the ears.
151

To set up for this type of lighting, configure your lights as follows:
✦Position your main light straight on to your subject, high above his or
her eyes, with the light pointed directly on the nose. This is what
enables the light to spread out in the butterfly pattern.
✦Use a background light to separate your subject from the backdrop.
Butterfly lighting should always be considered for a female subject, although
that doesn’t mean that you always need to choose this style. If you use it
with a girl or woman who has short hair, the same problem of throwing too
much light on the ears can occur.

Backlighting
Backlighting, also known as rim lighting, can create an almost magical glow
or halo-like effect for your subject. (Think of the Elvish princess Arwen from
Lord of the Rings. Can you tell that this is a big hit with both clients and yours
truly?) An example of backlighting is shown in Figure 9-17.
This lighting style calls for your main light to be placed behind the subject
while a fill light prevents the face from falling into shadow. The result is a
rim of light that highlights your subject’s form.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
You can use this lighting style in the following ways:
✦Full backlighting: In this technique, the main light is positioned directly
behind the subject, about even with his head. Check your composition
carefully to make sure that the light is hidden from the camera’s view.
✦Side rim lighting: Here you’re trying for just a hint of backlighting to
add some glow to one side of the head. This is similar to hair lighting. In
this case, though, use a small light rather than your main light. Set up a
small light with a snoot (a conical light modifier that I discuss in the sec-
tion “Moderately priced gadgets,” earlier in this chapter) on a boom

Taking Your First Portraits
that’s pointed at the side of the head, away from the camera. If you
don’t have a boom arm, try placing a light stand as close to your model
as possible while keeping it out of the shot.
Practice this technique to get the hang of it. Rim lighting and backlighting
are valuable lighting techniques for many types of portraiture, such as
when photographing a bride or a mother and child. (Just be careful not to
overdo it.)
Taking Your First Portraits
Studio portraiture is about making your subjects look as they would like to
appear, not necessarily as they really are. So when you’re setting up your
poses, reflect on how to make people look their best.
A good portrait photographer inspires confidence, not only in himself but
also in a client. The better you can make a person who’s posing for you feel
about how she looks, the better her pose and the better her feeling about
the whole portrait experience. This works in your favor, because your sub-
ject will be more likely to buy your photographs.
People pose for portraits for different reasons and in different situations. If
you’re working on a tight schedule with a lot of sittings in a relatively brief
period of time (say a wedding or church directory shoot), you don’t have a
lot of time to get to know your subjects or establish a rapport. Instead, con-
sider a routine that works something like this:
✦Pose the family first, with Mom seated and Dad as one of the side ele-
ments in the diamond pose (see the sidebar “The diamond pose,” in this
chapter). Then build the rest of the pose with other family members.
Shoot the family portrait.
✦Pull the kids from the family pose. Keep Mom and Dad in place, and
photograph their portrait.
✦Pull Mom and Dad from the sitting and place the kids up in a new dia-
mond pose (depending on how many kids you’re photographing). It’s
usually best to pose a group of male children in a line from tallest to
shortest. If a sister or two is present, seat the oldest boy and pose the
oldest girl as the next diamond element, with her hands on his shoulder.
✦Ask the parents if they would like any special poses. (Don’t be afraid to
take special requests; they’re usually very likely to sell.)
✦With most families, Mom is usually the decision maker when it comes to
things such as family portraits. Make sure to keep her happy. Have
brushes and combs on hand, as well as lint brushes, so that everyone
can make sure to look his or her best. It also doesn’t hurt to have some
conservative ties and scarves on hand, just in case someone has an
accident on his way to the sitting.
When you’re doing large numbers of sittings, strive for the most efficient
posing setup and flow possible. People who are sitting around in their wed-
ding finery waiting to be photographed can get pretty grumpy, particularly
if more than one group is waiting. A typical pose, using the diamond config-
uration discussed in the upcoming sidebar, is shown in Figure 9-18.
155

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Try to be flexible enough for a special request because these can be very
profitable. I was once part of a team that was shooting portraits for a church
directory when a husband mentioned that he and his new wife had never
had a wedding portrait taken. We suggested that they come back after our
shooting schedule was done in their best suit and wedding gown, and we
would do a series of portraits for them. The couple loved the idea, and we
spent an hour creating different poses and portraits — and ended up with a
huge order! Most importantly, we accomplished this without inconvenienc-
ing other members of the church, and we gained a reputation for enthusiasm
and service among that particular church’s members.
If you’re working under a more generous time schedule and aiming for a
higher-end product, take the time to make your subjects comfortable and to
see what they’re looking for in a portrait sitting.
Although you may still be looking at the basic family portrait package
(family, couple, and children), each family member may need individual
portraits as well. This may be the time to bring out more specialized types
of lighting, such as the broad lighting and short lighting that I discuss ear-
lier in this chapter.
Be sure to offer your clients some extra poses for each family member, par-
ticularly for those kids who may go for a variety of sports images. Have
props on hand, such as soccer balls, baseball gear, footballs and helmets,
and so on.
Here are some standard combinations for portraits with multiple subjects
and/or props:

156

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Taking Your First Portraits
✦Husbands and wives: Offer husbands and wives the basic couples pose,
but also suggest a second pose that illustrates their love and commit-
ment to each other (standing close, gazing into each other’s eyes).
Depending on their age and demeanor, a more whimsical pose may also
be in order. If so, having the husband get down on one knee to re-create
his marriage proposal while the wife “thinks” about it can be cute.
✦Kids: A brother and sister can be posed in a diagonal, with the boy seated
and the girl angled behind him with her hands folded on his shoulder.
This is a basic couples pose, but the relationship issue isn’t important.
If you have two posing stools, you can seat both people diagonally, one
behind the other. A pose that works with two boys is to have them sit
back to back with their heads turned toward the camera.
✦Mothers and daughters: I would seat Mom and have her daughters
arranged in the appropriate number of elements for a diamond pose.
Another option — if you have the posing boxes to do so — is to seat Mom
on a posing stool and have a daughter or two seated at her knee. A third
daughter (the oldest) would be diagonally behind Mom with her hands
on Mom’s shoulder. If I had flowers, I would load the scene with them.
✦Fathers and sons: A simple pose would be to seat Dad and build a dia-
mond around him. A more adventurous pose would be to have Dad
standing slightly sideways, with his off-camera hand in his pocket, look-
ing at his son(s) posed about a foot away (one diagonally behind the
other). Have one son toss a ball in the air, let the sons watch the ball,
and have Dad watch the sons. A simpler variation would be to have the
sons remove their suit jackets (if this is a “dressy” portrait) and sling
them over their shoulders (the off-camera side), while Dad regards them
with arms folded across his chest (still properly attired).
✦Infants: For a fancy pose, look for an old-fashioned baby buggy or some
other such prop. A lot of choices are available, including seashells for
the baby to sit in or bearskin rugs for him to lie on. Generally, how you
pose an infant depends on his or her age and physical abilities (such as
whether the infant can sit up unsupported). Babies who are younger
than 6 weeks old usually can’t focus their eyes on a specific point, so
they present a special challenge. It’s usually best to leave someone in
this age group in her carrier and go for a reasonably tight shot.
157
The diamond pose
Diamonds are a photographer’s best friend.
Professional portrait photographers use a diamond
formation as their basic foundation for a group
photo. Establish your anchor person (usually the
mother in a family portrait), and seat that person.
Place the father (or second individual) behind the
anchor and halfway to the side. Elevate the seated
person so that the top of his head is level with the
nose of the standing person. Have the standing
person place his or her hands one on top of the
other slightly angled on the seated person’s shoul-
der. (By the way, this is the basic pose for a couple.)
Now do the same with the third person to balance
the trio. (This gives you a basic pose for three
people.) Place the fourth person directly behind the
first person and positioned so that the heads of
subjects two and three come up to the nose of the
fourth person. (Have sturdy wooden boxes or
blocks of varying sizes for people to stand on.) Have
subjects two through four lean slightly forward
from the waist so that their faces are as close as
possible to being on the same plane as the first
person. Then, everyone is on the same plane of
focus. You should not have gaps between bodies.
Now you have a basic posing system that’s
expandable to fit 20 people or more.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
As a general rule, pose multiple people closer together than they would nor-
mally stand if left to personal-space comfort levels. Your goal is to maximize
the use of space by filling the frame as effectively as possible with people,
not backdrop or props. This doesn’t that mean you’re doing nothing but
headshots, though. If you’re doing a wedding or prom shoot, people will
be in their finest clothes, and showing that clothing may be appropriate.
Certainly the bride in her wedding gown deserves at least one photo that
shows her entire wedding dress, including the train.
Shooting the Portrait
Your first family enters your studio, ready to have a portrait taken. After
you’ve exchanged pleasantries, be sure to point them in the direction of
the mirrors and touch-up hairbrushes for any last-second adjustments.
When everyone’s ready, it’s time to begin arranging the sitting. Start by
seating the mother, and build your diamond around her. Make sure that
each person is sitting or standing up straight. (Place your hand on the front
of a shoulder and two fingers at the base of the spine and apply gentle pres-
sure to straighten them up.)
Have your subjects focus their eyes slightly to one side of the lens. Have
them bring their chins up slightly so that they’re looking slightly up and
away from the camera.
Be aware of the following things while seating your subjects:
✦Make sure that your subjects are sitting up straight.
✦Check to make sure that clothing is as wrinkle-free as possible. If neces-
sary, tug suit jackets to straighten out wrinkles.
✦Use your modeling lights (if you have them) to make sure that you’ve
minimized the glare from eyeglasses.
✦It’s often a good idea to give the subjects a mirror so that they can
check themselves over just before you take the picture. Knowing that
they look good can help them relax — and that, my friend, is A Good
Thing indeed.
Use this time to get your subjects in position and into the right mood for
the portraiture. Remember to stay positive and encouraging. Be sure to
tell them that they look good. Crack a few tasteful jokes or discuss current
events while positioning people to keep them relaxed, too.
Posing your subjects
To properly pose your subjects, keep in mind that you are dealing with two
separate tasks: positioning them in such a way to make them look their best
and simultaneously creating a pose that’s not too unbearable to maintain
for several minutes.
158

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Shooting the Portrait
Start out by posing the lowest seated person, as follows:
1. Pose the bottom person in the diamond so that he or she is comfort-
ably seated on a posing stool; elevate the person’s legs so that they
are at a right angle to his body.
2. Allow the person to place her feet on a small posing box for comfort
while holding the pose.
3. Angle the person so that she is at about a 45-degree angle to the
camera lens.
Make sure that this person is comfortable in the basic pose because he or
she must hold the pose longer than anyone else. I usually put the mother in
this position for several reasons. First, she looks natural as the base of the
diamond; second, she’s usually trying to set a good example for the rest of
her family; and third, if she’s already in the pose, she can’t meddle with
your work with the rest of her family. (Don’t underestimate this reason,
whatever you do.)
With your first person in place, it’s time to move on to person number 2.
Follow these steps:
1. Place the second person on a posing stool, angled behind the first
person.
Normally, this would be the father, but no hard-and-fast rules apply
here. Position the individual so that his or her head is properly posi-
tioned in relation to the mother within the diamond pose.
2. Have your subject place his on-camera hand (the hand that faces the
camera) on his hip.
Be forewarned: Couples are always trying to put their arms around each
other’s waists. Don’t let them; it’s touching, but it doesn’t photograph
well. If you are dealing with spouses or a couple in a relationship, let
them put their off-camera hand on their partner’s hip, out of sight of the
camera.
3. Have the second subject lean slightly into the first person so that you
don’t have any gaps between their bodies.
Make sure that both persons are still sitting up straight. If a gap exists,
you can turn the stools slightly to bring the shoulders a bit more square
to the camera and close the gap. You may also have to slide the chairs a
little closer together.
Keep in mind that the pose you’re setting up with the husband and wife
(or whatever significant pair you’re posing) can also make an excellent pose
for when you do the couple’s portrait. So don’t let them get up when the
family/group shot is done, or you just have to re-create this pose all over
again.
Now that you’ve got Mom and Dad posed, start adding the kids. You can
start with child number 1 by following these steps:
1. Take the smallest child, and place her on the bottom person’s other
side, using a posing box to raise her to the right height.
159

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
2. Turn the third subject toward the bottom person (roughly at the same
angle as the second subject).
3. Move the third subject so that she is about halfway behind the bottom
sitter.
The second and third subjects should be close together, but their shoul-
ders don’t have to touch. Just make sure that no gap exists between
those two posers and the bottom subject.
You’ve now set the base for a diamond pose and created a good three-person
sitting that can work for posing a trio. Remember to keep the relationship
between the three heads consistent so that a line drawn across person
number 2’s face and person number 3’s face travels over their eyes. Their
mouths should be even with the first poser’s eyes.
Now add person number 4, as follows:
1. Place your fourth person behind person number 2 and number 3, and
raise him (if necessary) by using a posing box.
2. Person number 4 fills any gap between persons two and three, which
is why it wasn’t that important to squeeze them in tight.
Square person number 4’s shoulders toward the camera.
3. Adjust the height of person number 4 so that his mouth is on a line
with the eyes of person number 2 and 3. Have person number 4 lean
slightly into the others.
That last little part about leaning is important. Ideally, you want all the faces
in the same plane for the best possible focus. Even when shooting at f/11 or
f/16, it’s still better to have all faces on a line for best appearance. After you
have everyone lined up properly, check your modeling lights to make sure
that no one is casting shadows where they shouldn’t be.
If you have more than four individuals that you need to pose, take the fol-
lowing guidelines to heart:
✦Use the topmost person in your original diamond as the base person for
another diamond group.
This lets you add three more people in the same way that you added
posers two through four.
✦If you have more than seven sitters, start building diamonds outward by
using the leftmost or rightmost person in the lower diamond as the side
anchor of a new diamond.
✦As you build your additional diamonds, take care to make sure that
everyone’s faces are lining up properly in the same focal plane. Also,
make sure that everyone is on steady ground. As you have more people
standing on posing blocks, your group’s inherent stability suffers. You
don’t want to see them collapse into your backdrop and lights. (This
could affect future business with this family.)
Working with a large group is a challenge because the number of variables
increases significantly. Take a moment before setting up the pose to do a
little planning.
160

Book I
Chapter 9
Photographing People
Shooting the Portrait
Visualize the group pose before you start assembling it. This way, you waste
less time and effort once you get started. Take a moment to explain to the
group that you’re going to take a lot of shots of the group pose to maximize
your chances of getting an exposure with as many good expressions as 
possible.
Arranging your lighting
Create a triangle with your base posing stool as its apex. Set up your main
light and fill light about 6 feet apart and 6 feet from the posing stool.
Position your background light about 2 feet behind the posing stool, and
then position the background 1 to 2 feet from the background light.
If you’re using a hair light, position the light angled about 45 degrees behind
the subject’s head and pointed toward the camera. Take a moment to check
your viewfinder to make sure that no part of the hair light protrudes into
the photograph.
Taking the picture
Now that you’ve set up the lights and arranged your subjects, it’s time to
start thinking about taking the picture.
I recommend triggering the camera via a remote so that you can maintain
eye contact with your subjects. Many digital cameras, both professional
and point-and-shoot types, offer some method of triggering the shutter
without physically tripping the shutter button. If your camera doesn’t have
this feature, you can still fire the camera via the shutter-release button
while looking over the camera at your subjects.
Before tripping the shutter, go through this quick checklist:
✦Is everyone standing up straight?
✦Are their heads properly arranged so that their faces are directed
toward the camera?
✦Is everyone looking either directly toward the camera lens or in the
direction that you’ve designated? (Some poses may look better if you
have your subjects looking slightly past the lens.)
✦Is everyone smiling?
Be ready to work fast. Holding a pose is a tiring chore. People lose their
patience if you take too long to trip the shutter, so be ready to run through
the checklist quickly.
Don’t be afraid to stop and correct someone who has relaxed his pose. It
doesn’t do you any good to trip the shutter if someone doesn’t look good.
I usually hold the remote behind my back when tripping the shutter during
a portrait session to keep people from realizing that I’m about to take the
picture. This is important for the following reasons:
161

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦I don’t want to give people a reason to shift their eyes in the direction of
my hand as I’m taking the shot.
✦Many people anticipate the flash firing and blink their eyes as the lights
are firing.
Remember to keep watching your subjects as you trip the shutter. You can
usually catch the blinkers, if have any, and you know that you need to take
another shot.
Advantages of Digital Cameras
Digital cameras offer you many advantages in portrait photography. Most
important is the chance for the photographer to review the pose before the
clients leave. This way, you can spot problems and have a chance to correct
them while everyone is still there.
Another huge advantage of the digital camera is that it gives you a chance
to make sales while your customers are still excited from their sitting and
are still in high spirits after all that positive feedback you’ve been giving
them. (You have been giving them positive feedback, haven’t you?)
Film photographers have to factor the cost of film, processing, and making
proofs into their costs of doing business, driving up their margins. As a digi-
tal photographer, you can afford to take all the shots you want without dam-
aging your bottom line (provided that you have enough media to get you
through a long shooting session).
Learn to use your digital camera’s review feature to its best effect. You
should be analyzing the following things as you play back your shot:
✦Make sure that the photo is properly focused. Although you can’t be
sure while reading your camera’s LCD screen, you can at least eliminate
really poor shots. If you have a digital camera that can be hooked up to
a television to play back images, by all means do so! This can help you
get a better look at your images and, when the time comes, you can
show the images to your clients while at the same time taking their
order. (If they’re not satisfied, you can also offer to reshoot the sitting
while they’re still dressed for it.)
✦Check for obvious errors. These errors could be gaps that appear
between people, bad expressions, or wrinkled clothes. Straighten out
the clothing, as shown in Figure 9-19. Also make sure that everyone’s
hair looks good and that the image is properly exposed.
✦Check for lighting errors. These would include lights that shine where
you don’t want them to, unwanted shadows, and so on.
✦If your subjects are wearing glasses, check for hot spots that may be
too difficult to clean up in an image-editing program. It’s easier to
reposition someone’s glasses than it is to do heavy computer retouch-
ing, so make your job easier when you can.
✦Check for people who blinked. This can be pretty tough with small
LCD screens; a TV monitor makes this easier.
162

Advantages of Digital Cameras
I once worked for a portrait firm (before the digital revolution hit its stride)
that spent quite a bit of money to develop a portrait system that simultane-
ously exposed a piece of film and captured a low-resolution digital image.
The photographer would then hand the salesperson a floppy disk with the
images, and he or she would then show the images to clients while giving
the sales pitch.
Such a system made portrait sales much more effective because people
were seeing the results of their sitting while they were still excited and
upbeat about the process, and they were more likely to buy prints.
Many of today’s digital cameras offer a similar capability via an RCA- or
video-out port that allows you to connect to a TV monitor. Then, you (and
your clients) can view images on a larger screen.

F
or some readers of this book, becoming a published photographer may
be a lifelong goal. Many avid photographers hone their skills, trying to
reach professional levels in a quest for a published credit line.
However, it’s far more common for your average digital camera buff to
end up shooting for publication for more practical reasons. Perhaps your
parent–teacher association drafted you to publicize school events. Maybe
your small company doesn’t have a full-time photographer, and you, with
your digital camera wizardry, seem perfect to snap a portrait of the founder
for the organization’s newsletter. Or, you may be a recognized expert in
your hobby, customizing vintage Atari game consoles, and you would like to
have a few photographs published in one of the technical magazines that
are devoted to ’80s-era games.
Digital photography lends itself to all these situations because you can take
a picture on a moment’s notice, review your results on your camera’s LCD,
take another picture if you need to, and then produce a digital file or print
that’s ready for publication in a few minutes. Most professional photogra-
phers who shoot for newspapers, magazines, catalogs, and other publica-
tions now use digital cameras, and you can, too.
In all these cases, your digital pictures are going to end up in print, and you
need to know some things so that you can shine when shooting for publica-
tion. This chapter explains the differences in taking pictures for print — as
opposed to photography that’s destined for Web sites, desktop presenta-
tions, or a personal photo album. You can also find some tips on how to get
published and advice on preparing your work for publication.
Finding Outlets for Print Publication
Whether you simply want to get published to satisfy yourself or you need
to have your photos published to satisfy the expectations of your friends,
boss, or colleagues, many outlets are available for your digital work. I
describe the most common in the following list, and I look at each one in
more detail later in the chapter:
165

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Local newspapers: Although larger newspapers may rarely publish
photos from readers, smaller local papers may welcome submission of
photos on behalf of your school, club, or even business. Or, you can make
a habit of showing up at public meetings or fast-breaking news events.
Supply enough good shots in a variety of situations, and the paper may
take you on as a part-time stringer. Because digital pictures can be
snapped and transmitted to a newspaper over phone lines minutes after
an event takes place, electronic photos are especially appropriate.
✦Trade magazines: These are the unseen publications that nobody knows
about, except for the millions of people within a particular industry. You
may have never heard of Repro Report magazine, unless you’re a member
of the International Reprographics Association, but that publication 
and hundreds like it are constantly looking for photos that are taken at
member businesses, conventions, and other venues. These trade publi-
cations are good outlets for digital photography.
✦Company publications: Companies of any size can never have enough
photographers. If your organization is a small one, management may be
delighted to find a photographer who is outfitted with fast and flexible
digital gear and who is ready, willing, and able to snap photos for com-
pany newsletters, annual reports, and other official publications. Larger
organizations with a full-time photographic staff may still be receptive
to photos that you take at events that their pros are unable to cover.
✦Special-interest publications: Every hobby or special-interest group,
from collecting Seat Occupied signs from defunct airlines to protecting
your right to arm bears, probably has some type of publication. If you
share that interest, you can easily get your digital photos published.
✦External PR and advertising: Most organizations can use photos for
public relations or advertising purposes. If you’re good, your work can
accompany news releases or be incorporated into less formal advertis-
ing layouts. Digital cameras are good for these applications because you
can create a photo in a few minutes, ready for review and approval by
the big shots in an organization.
✦Self-publication: The fastest route to getting your digital photos printed
is to publish them yourself. Whether your interests stem from a favorite
hobby or from the most arcane conspiracy theories, if you have a com-
puter, you can create a newsletter, fanzine, or other publication and
spice it up with your own photos. The best part about self-publication is
that you have absolute control over which images are used, how they
are sized and cropped, and who gets to see them. And who knows? If
your work is good, you may get paying subscribers to cover part of your
costs. In my case, I knew that no publisher would possibly want to print
my illustrated guidebook to repairing vintage video games. So I took the
photos, laid out the manual, and published it myself (see Figure 10-1).
I’ve sold thousands of copies at eBay of something that I put together
just for fun.
✦Product photographs: Your company probably needs photos of its
products for use in advertising, PR, and so on. You can take these
photos with your digital camera.

Shooting for Publication
Local Newspapers
Shooting for publication isn’t as hard as many people think, provided you
remember that, just like an athlete, you don’t start out shooting for slick,
nationally distributed magazines any more than aspiring ball players begin
by playing shortstop for the New York Yankees. If National Grocer is your
target rather than National Geographic, you have a shot.
Local Newspapers
Your local paper is probably willing to consider your digital photos of a local
event, particularly if it’s a small paper. Larger newspapers prefer to use their
own photographers not because they don’t think your photos are good
enough but because of journalistic ethics reasons. Big papers frequently
face charges of journalistic bias and must be able to vouch that a given pho-
tograph hasn’t been manipulated in ways that would make it misleading.
Photographs that are supplied by businesses can’t be used unless they are
clearly labeled as a photograph that originated within that organization.
However, bear in mind that even big cities have small, special-interest papers
that can be a market for your pictures.
Also, remember that you don’t have to limit yourself to just one community
newspaper. More often than not, neighboring newspapers have circulation
areas that overlap. If you know your neighboring communities well, you can
also market your talents to their newspapers.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Newspaper photography is fun and challenging. This type of shooting isn’t
especially rewarding financially, but it provides valuable experience because
you learn to adapt your photographic ability to the environment. No other
type of photography offers the shooter as little control over the shooting
conditions as photojournalism. For some of us, that’s the best thing about it.
Understanding what newspapers need
The key to getting published in your local paper is understanding what the
paper does and doesn’t need from you. Newspapers have small photo staffs
and can’t be everywhere at once. They may send a photographer (shooter in
the lingo of photo editors) to a major event, fire, or accident, but if several
events happen at the same time, the shooters probably have to cover one
or two events and let the others slide. I regularly cover events at my kids’
school and submit them to the newspaper. Our paper even prints the arti-
cles that accompany the photos, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Smaller newspapers would love to receive the following types of photos:
✦Events: Your club or fraternity is having its annual barbecue, banquet,
or get-together. It’s not a big enough deal for the local paper to send
someone to cover. If you can produce some useable images, along with
enough information to caption them properly, you may get at least one
of them published. Newspapers are willing to run photos like these
because people like to see their pictures in the paper — that helps sell
newspapers.
✦Sports: The paper’s shooter(s) get the big ones, such as football, bas-
ketball, baseball, and so on. Your opportunity comes with the sports
that don’t quite get their due. For example, you can shoot track-and-
field events (not necessarily the big weekend meets with 50 schools and
a thousand athletes but perhaps the local dual meet). Sports such as
tennis, field hockey, or lacrosse seldom get as much coverage as the big
three (football, basketball, and baseball). Study your local paper to see
what sports it seems to favor, and then try submitting shots for the
sports that it doesn’t seem to cover. Good action photos are particu-
larly important. If you can regularly capture peak action well, your
photos will be used. See Book I, Chapter 11 on sports photography for
more information on how to take good sports photos with a digital
camera.
✦Spot news: Spot news includes things such as traffic accidents, fires,
and robberies. It can be tough to succeed at selling this kind of photo
unless it’s your main focus. If so, a police/fire scanner is a must. Remem-
ber though, that it doesn’t do you any good if you’re covering the same
news as the paper’s staffer. Small-town papers tend to need this kind of
material most and are sure to send out their own staffers at the first hint
of a big story, but you may have a shot at publication if you’re in the
right place at the right time to take a photo of something that no one
else managed to grab. (Some spot news opportunities don’t last very
long, which is why they’re called spot news.) And because your digital
camera film doesn’t need processing, your photos are timely.
168

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Local Newspapers
Although dramatic photos of spot news events can produce eye-
catching portfolio shots, don’t forget that human emotion creates the
most memorable images. This is perhaps the most difficult part of photo-
journalism — intruding upon the tragedy of others and recording it for
the world to see. Pros don’t really have a choice in this matter — it’s part
of the job. Freelancers, however, can choose either side of the deal.
You may run across organizations that claim that as part of their mem-
bership fee, you’ll receive a press pass that can get you across police
lines or into events. Be very skeptical of such claims. Usually, an organi-
zation, such as the state police (in some states) or event organizers,
issues the press pass. No universal press pass exists to get you into an
event. In fact, even working news photographers with state-issued press
passes don’t get into many events (for example, pro sports and rock
concerts) unless they’re specifically cleared for that event by the event
organizer as well.
✦Hard news: These are major news events: a speech by the mayor, a visit
by the governor, certain press conferences, demonstrations, and politi-
cal rallies. They’re frequently open to the general public, although “offi-
cial” photographers may be given a special area to shoot from.
✦Feature news photography: There’s a difference between a feature photo
and a news feature photo. The news feature image accompanies a legiti-
mate story with a feature edge — say, an article on family TV watching
habits or a story on Civil War re-enactors.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Feature photography: This part of the paper deals with its lighter side.
It may involve shooting a feature package on Elvis impersonators or pic-
tures of a local restaurant for a review. This is the one section of the
paper where you frequently see created images, or what are sometimes
called photo illustrations.
Working as a professional newspaper photographer
Whether you submit photographs to newspapers as a representative of
your organization, as a freelancer for pay, or as an official stringer for the
newspaper, you should conduct your business in a professional manner.
You should consider many points. For example, do you want to be a free-
lancer or a stringer?
Freelancing versus being a stringer
You find two different types of affiliations for a nonstaffer: being a freelancer
or being a stringer. The difference is in just how attached you and the news-
paper are to each other.
Being a stringer involves the following things:
✦Pseudostaffer status: Still considered an independent contractor,
stringers are generally issued a newspaper press pass, or the paper
gets a state credential for them (if the state issues them).
✦Free supplies: Stringers frequently receive free supplies (film in the old
days, notebooks, pens, and pencils). You may be able to get your news-
paper to chip in for some extra digital film (that is, another memory
card). That could be handy if you’re rushed to get a shot published and
you need to hand over your memory card.
✦Regular assignments: Stringers receive assignments from the paper that
they’re affiliated with, frequently with a guarantee of pay, even if a shot
isn’t used.
✦Remaining loyal: Both the stringer and the newspaper are expected to
show some level of loyalty to each other, although it may not be a lot.
Generally, a paper has a specific number of stringers and a rotation
policy to have some fair manner of distributing assignments. By the
same token, the stringer doesn’t shoot for the paper’s competition. (You
are expected not to shoot for a newspaper that is sold in your paper’s
distribution area.)
Stringers are generally considered independent contractors for tax purposes
and are occasionally a point of contention between newspapers and state
employment officials, who scrutinize such arrangements carefully to see
whether such relationships should be considered employer/employee
instead of contractor/client. You should be aware of tax responsibilities in
this situation, too.
Working as a freelancer has the following advantages and disadvantages:
✦Freelancers have no affiliation to a particular newspaper, so they
receive no support from any paper. However, they are free to work for
any newspaper and to sell pictures to the highest bidder if they stumble
on a potential Pulitzer Prize winner.
170

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Local Newspapers
✦Because freelancers are unaffiliated, they either don’t get assignments
or are at the very bottom of the list of those who do. This means that
freelancers have to develop their own opportunities, which can help
sharpen their news sense.
Freelancers don’t have to worry about employee/employer relationships
because they’re free agents as independent contractors, but the same tax
responsibilities apply. In the case of both a stringer and a freelancer, you
can deduct the cost of your equipment and expenses that are involved in
doing business. You may also have to make quarterly tax payments if this
is your primary source of income.
171
Special considerations for news photography
Consider the following things when photographing
news events:
 Be aware of emotions. Tempers can run high at
both spot and hard news events. Sometimes,
law enforcement personnel can overreact
when things go wrong. Cameras can be broken,
film can get confiscated, and photographers
can be threatened. More frequently, police
try to stop press photographers from working,
First Amendment considerations be damned
(although to be fair, this still doesn’t happen that
often). In such situations, newspaper photogra-
phers tend to have their newspaper’s resources
behind them, whereas a freelancer probably
doesn’t. It’s best to accept that you’re not on a
level playing field in such circumstances. I’ve
heard stories of photographers who have
played sleight of hand with their film and turned
over an unexposed roll of film when someone
demanded their images. I’ve been ready to do
so myself once or twice, but it’s a judgment call
for each photographer to decide the risk that he
or she is willing to take.
 Be different. Your best bet as a freelancer is to
deliver something different from what everyone
else is doing. One of the best news shots that
I’ve ever seen came from a presidential cam-
paign several decades ago. The photo is of a
president answering questions with a mountain
of photographers pressed together, shooting
away. One enterprising shooter had enough of
a sense of the moment to take a few steps back
and recorded the insanity of the situation. In
the process, he got a timeless photo that
far exceeded the images that his counterparts
created.
 Look for unusual angles. Shoot from up high
and down low. Try and get the shot with several
different focal lengths, too.
 Be careful not to get locked in on the main
event. Sometimes, the best shot comes
because you look beyond the setting and
uncover human nature at work. Young children
can offer interesting opportunities because
they don’t hide their reactions or feelings as
much as adults do. A sleeping child at a politi-
cal event or a wedding can show humor and
make a comment about how adults sometimes
take themselves too seriously.
 Look at the participants who aren’t center
stage. Is there a clandestine conversation
going on? Do they look bored? Are they looking
in the opposite direction of everyone else?
 Avoid the Grip ‘n’ Grin shot. One person is
giving an award, and one person is receiving it.
The two individuals stand there gripping the
award and each other, looking right at the
camera and grinning. Instead of the mundane,
provide a sense of what the event is about. If
it’s a barbecue, get behind the grills and take a
shot of somebody getting a hot dog through a
haze of smoke with a big smile on his or her
face (hopefully wearing a cap or t-shirt with the
name of the organization on it). You can men-
tion the award that was presented at the event
in the cutline (caption), but you really don’t
need to show it.
News photography strives for impact. Eye contact
and emotions are key ingredients. Don’t be afraid
to compose your shot tightly. The image should
have a single focal point, not multiple ones.
Whether you’re shooting for a newspaper or the
World Wide Web, space is valuable, and images
should be tightly cropped and easily understood.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Newspaper Web sites have created a new concern for freelance photogra-
phers. Many papers now require freelancers to sign over more rights or all
rights to any images that are used in the paper as a result of some recent
court decisions. These rulings have indicated that freelancers still retain
the other rights to their images, even if a photo appeared in the paper.
Because many newspapers were making their entire issue available online,
the decisions meant that the papers were violating the freelancer’s copy-
rights. Most of the time, the loss of the additional copyright doesn’t get you
additional compensation. Only you can decide whether giving up all rights
to a particular image is worth the chance of getting your work published.
Getting your foot in the door
How do you become a stringer or freelancer? It’s usually best to make initial
contact by mail. A simple introductory letter that identifies you as a photog-
rapher who is interested in working as a stringer or freelancer, plus some
samples of your work, should be enough. Don’t overdo it on the number of
samples that you send. Two or three shots that demonstrate your ability
should suffice.
Then, follow up. In your letter, say that you’re going to call in a day or two to
discuss how you may be able to help the paper. At this point, all that you’re
aiming for is a chance to meet the editor, show him or her your portfolio, and
sell the idea of your contributing. The smaller the newspaper, the better your
chances (although the smaller the pay, too).
Be thorough in your examination of the potential marketplace. Many areas
have more than one newspaper and thus more than one opportunity for
freelancing.
Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
Breaking into magazine, book, or stock photography presents a different set
of challenges and opportunities. Magazines offer the most opportunities.
You can find many different types of magazines that target a variety of audi-
ences. These magazines include the following:
✦Trade journals: These are specialized publications that although per-
haps not glamorous, are potential sources of sales for enterprising digi-
tal photographers. A trade journal is a magazine that covers a specific
industry or profession. These magazines are seldom found on news-
stands and are instead distributed mainly via subscriptions. Although
they may not pay very well, if at all, they tend to be the easiest maga-
zine market for novices to break into. If you know of a trade journal for
your particular profession or trade, you probably have a good place to
start because you already have knowledge and experience in the indus-
try. Your chances of acceptance improve even more if you can package
a story with your photos. This is also a good market for event photos
within your industry, particularly if you can produce interesting images.
✦Special-interest magazines: These are mass-market publications that
are geared toward a specific interest. These include magazines such as
Tennis, Popular Photography, Cat Fancy, and so on. This market is harder
to break into than the trade journal market because these magazines
172

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
tend to pay better than trade journals and because more writers and
photographers want to be published in them. Read the guidelines, study
the magazine thoroughly, and query the editor before submitting any-
thing. In many cases, these magazines are more receptive to photo-only
queries. Regional travel magazines may be a good bet. If you get a good
photo of an unusual or out-of-the-way travel destination, like the one
shown in Figure 10-3, you may have a sure sale.
✦Mass-market major magazines: Examples of these magazines are Time,
People, and Cosmopolitan. These are the heavy hitters of the magazine
world. They’re also incredibly difficult publications for beginners to sell
to. Many times, these magazines don’t consider unsolicited submissions
and probably won’t take your query letter seriously, either — unless
you have some kind of established track record as a professional pho-
tographer. An amateur photographer generally needs a remarkably
newsworthy image to have a chance to sell to one of these magazines.
Other markets include the following:
✦Books, textbooks, and photo books: The good news is that this market
can be a reasonably easy one to break into. The bad news is that book
editors are notoriously cheap, grumpy, and hard to deal with. (Just kid-
ding! They’re actually kind, supportive, and generous; plus they edit
books such as this one.) Unfortunately, the book-publishing industry is
extremely competitive, and the sad truth is that many books don’t turn
a profit. (Please buy an extra copy of this one! It can make a great gift.)
So, although there is a need for good photography, you seldom find a lot
of money in it. Find a publisher whose line of books appeals to you and
query about its photographic needs and policies, or check the appropri-
ate market guide book. A coffee table or photo book is a tough sell, even
for established pros, and requires the highest-quality photographic
images to support the higher resolution that these books demand.

173

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Stock photography: The concept sounds great: Sell the same image over
and over, and make lots of money. No, it’s not a telemarketing scam or
multilevel marketing scheme; it’s the world of stock photography. You
deal with stock photo agencies, which keep carefully categorized images
in a database that they can access to provide virtually any sort of picture
(including yours) at the request of a client. To break into this business,
you need lots of photos (thousands) to make taking you on worth the
agency’s time. Figure 10-4 shows an example of a generic photo that may
be useful as a stock picture.
✦Web stock agencies: A number of small stock outlets have sprung up on
the Internet thanks to its worldwide reach, easy accessibility, and rela-
tively low cost compared to the prime zip-code real estate that’s used
to house the big agencies. The problem facing the small Web outlets is
that they seldom have enough images to make photo buyers happy. The
advantage to them is that they can provide a starting point for photog-
raphers whose portfolios are too small to interest the big agencies. Of
course, if your stock of images is that small, the odds are against your
having much success. Still, most agencies operate on a 50/50 split
arrangement, with no charge for displaying your images, so it’s an
opportunity for you to get a lot of images online without the need to
have your own Web site or server.
Shooting stock pictures is one area in which having a spouse and kids may
pay off. Photos of family interaction, pensive teens, and children at play are
all marketable stock images. How about a boy and his dog? A girl and her
cat? Study advertisements and brochures. Although teams of professional
artists, designers, and photographers sometimes create images specifically
for an ad or brochure, more often than not, these pictures have been assem-
bled from stock images. Advertisers sell products by showing normal, every-
day people whose lives are enriched by their products. Theoretically, your
family qualifies as normal. (Heaven knows, I wish mine did!)
Remember the basic tenets of photography: The picture must be in focus
and properly exposed. I find it amazing just how often these basics don’t get
met when people are submitting photos to their local newspaper. I know —
at one newspaper I worked for a few years ago, I was the one who had to
weed through all those pictures trying to find something that we could use.
Start by sending your best work. Publishable photographs are different from
fine art. The purpose of publishable photos is to communicate as simply and
effectively as possible. Because you can do that, follow these guidelines to
take the next step toward seeing your work in print:
✦Plan to be organized. Have a filing system that enables you to identify
and locate a particular image.
✦Be ready to do some research. Your local library is sure to carry refer-
ences, such as the Photographer’s Market, but it may pay to invest in
your own copy because Photographer’s Market provides information on
a wide range of possible markets.
✦Consider ordering your own business cards and stationery to best
present a professional appearance. If your budget allows, consider a
promotional piece, such as a four-color postcard or a print that shows
some samples of your best work.
174

Shooting for Publication
Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
Making the leap to published photographer is within the reach of many tal-
ented amateurs. It’s just a question of understanding what markets are out
there, how to make contact, and what the markets need.
Making contact
The magazine industry does not respond well to unsolicited photographs
and manuscripts. Although you have a better chance of getting published
with a trade journal than with most others, you improve your chances by
sending the publication’s editor a carefully worded missive indicating what
he or she can expect.
Sometimes, a publication accepts unsolicited photos or manuscripts. (This
is usually noted in the magazine’s masthead.) If so, be selective. Don’t 
bombard an editor with a submission or more per week. (Editors can get
restraining orders, too.) Instead, send only your best. Either include an
SASE (self-addressed, stamped envelope) with enough postage for the
editor to return the photos to you, or attach a note saying that they don’t
have to come back. (In the days of typewritten manuscripts or hand-printed
photos, this whole issue used to be a much bigger deal than it is now.)
Write a query letter to introduce yourself. Talk about your experience in the
industry, plus your experience as a writer and photographer if you think it
will help. Let the editors know what your photo or story idea is and how
you plan on approaching it. Indicate that you’re familiar with the publica-
tion’s guidelines for writers.

maker.
175

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Writer’s and photographer’s guidelines are frequently available on the Web
or by mail and are sometimes even noted in the publication itself. Books
such as the Writer’s Market and Photographer’s Market appear yearly, provid-
ing useful information on many publications. Generally, this information
tells you how publications want materials to be submitted. (Do they accept
digital photos? Should you submit prints with them? How should prints be
packaged? Do the publications accept work from freelancers?) Publications
such as trade journals are more forgiving if you violate their writer’s guide-
lines than other magazines are, but it’s still best not to do so. (Remember,
you’re trying to convince them that you’re a professional.)
Regardless of the individual guidelines that a publication may have, you
would be wise to keep the following points in mind:
✦Be enthusiastic! You can’t expect editors to get fired up about your idea
if it sounds like you find it dull. Tell them why you think their readers
will want to read your story.
✦Submit on spec. It’s important to mention that if the editor is interested
in your work, you would be willing to submit it on speculation. This
means that you prepare the work at your own risk, with no guarantee that
the publication will use it. This kind of thing lets the editor know that he
can encourage your submission without having to worry about what will
happen if you’re rejected. (Editors have nightmares about beginning con-
tributors threatening lawsuits because they expected to be published,
even though the editor only agreed to look at a submission.)
✦Send in your tear sheets. If you have samples of published work (usually
referred to as tear sheets), submit the best one or two (three at the most)
pieces that you’ve done. Quality is much more important than quantity
here. If you don’t have something good to submit, don’t submit anything
unless the editor or guidelines ask for it. Frequently, editors take on
mediocre writing with good photography simply because they can
improve poor writing but may have trouble finding good photography.
Trade journals are the best place to start if you’re interested in expanding
beyond newspaper work. They tend to be receptive to freelancers, and they
provide the opportunity to contribute both photos and text. If writing isn’t
your thing, consider teaming up with a newspaper staffer or stringer who is
also looking to expand his or her reach.
Editors hate submissions and query letters that make it obvious that the
person who is contacting them hasn’t even looked at their magazine. Most
publications offer copies at a reasonable rate for would-be contributors, or
your local library may have back issues available. Get to know the magazine
before you propose a story idea. Studying back issues tells you if you’ve
been beaten to the punch by another contributor, or you may find out that
a publication is the wrong market for your submission.
Submitting photos
Quite a few publications remain cautious about accepting digital submis-
sions for final publication (perhaps accepting CD submissions for portfolio
samples) and may not even be willing to consider them. If the fact that your
images are digital is the only thing preventing them from acceptance, con-
sider converting them to analog artwork. A few publications accept prints,
176

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Magazines and Magazine-Like Markets
but these are in the minority. Generally, the hands-on favorite for submis-
sion, even now, is transparencies, or slides. The good news is that you have
a couple of ways to get 35mm slides made from digital files, as follows:
✦Online photo labs frequently offer this service. One such lab is www.
slides.com, which charges about $4 per slide.
✦Get a 5-x-7 or 8-x-10 print made from your digital file and load up your
film camera with a good-quality slide film. Then, either set up a copy
stand (the camera is placed parallel to print with two lights placed at
45-degree angles to the print) or your tripod, and photograph the print.
As time goes by, more publications are accepting digital images. Odds are
that your local newspaper will. It’s a nice feeling to discuss an image with an
editor, e-mail him or her the image, and find out that it’s been accepted, all
in a single afternoon! (This is particularly true when you’re selling a shot for
the second or third or fourth time.)
Getting model releases
A model release is a written permission to use a person’s likeness. These
documents are popular with publishers because they help protect the pub-
lisher from nuisance lawsuits. The need for model releases depends on how
the images are to be used. Newspaper photographers, for instance, seldom
bother. “Editorial” use is generally recognized by the courts to support the
public good and provides some protections to such publications that are
expected to meet that need. Newspapers, news magazines, and books are
usually considered to meet the editorial-use standard although most book
publishers desire model releases anyway. Advertising photography, on the
other hand, receives no such help. If your photo is going to help sell a prod-
uct, have a model release for every recognizable individual in the shot.
Even as a newspaper photographer, I still tried to be careful when it came to
photographing children. I would usually look for the adult caretakers first,
introduce myself to them, explain my purpose in taking pictures of the kids,
and give them one of my business cards before asking their permission to
shoot. It was perhaps more than I needed to do, but parents rarely objected
after they knew who I was and why I was taking pictures of their kids. Skip
this approach, and you may end up explaining yourself to a state trooper
instead. Also, a parent or guardian must sign model releases for minors if
you want those releases to count.
A model release doesn’t give you carte blanche to play with a person’s
image, which is something that’s very easy to do with a digital photograph.
Taking someone’s image under innocuous circumstances and then placing
the image into what could be considered an embarrassing photo composite
could leave you open to a lawsuit. When in doubt, be careful and consult
with a lawyer or discuss the potential use with your subject (making sure
that your model release reflects the potential use and the subject’s aware-
ness of it). Model releases are particularly important for stock photography,
where the image could end up being used for just about anything.
In some cases, public figures receive less privacy protection than private cit-
izens when it comes to editorial photography. (Think of how the paparazzi
chase celebrities. If you followed your private-citizen neighbor around that
177

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
way, your future cellmate would no doubt be amused to hear how you ended
up in jail.) No such leeway exists for advertising-related uses, particularly
because celebrities can argue that their likeness has a monetary value and
that your image is lowering its value.
Taking Photos for Publication
This section details the special needs of each of the most common types of
photography for publication, such as group and PR photos. In each section,
you can find suggestions for taking great photos in a variety of situations.
These photos can fit in with many different types of publications, from
newspapers to trade magazines or company in-house newsletters or maga-
zines. The tips in this section can be applied to many different types of
print destinations.
Understanding group photography basics
Photographing groups can be an interesting challenge, one that calls for
more skill as the number of people in the shot grows. As you add more
people to the frame, it becomes more difficult to catch a moment where
everyone has a pleasant expression. As the numbers increase, faces get
smaller, making it increasingly difficult just to make sure that everyone is
visible in the shot.
Group shots are popular and, for the photographer who can do a good job,
rewarding. As souvenirs of large events, they’re a well-accepted and com-
paratively easy way to commemorate a gathering. People have also become
so trained to expect a group shot that trying to get through an event with-
out taking one is almost a sacrilege. Thankfully, taking good group photos
isn’t impossible; you just need some planning and the right tools. These
photos are perfect for trade publications that are looking to publicize
member groups, or for your local newspaper.
Pose your group to conform to your camera’s image area. For virtually all
digital cameras, this means a horizontal rectangle that conforms to roughly
a 2:3 aspect ratio.
How you pose a group depends on how many people you’re working with.
For more about the diamond formation for groups — and more information
about composing group shots — refer to Book I, Chapter 9.
Managing the group
People tend to get impatient in such situations, especially if they’re among
the first to get posed. Staying enthusiastic and cheerful buys you time and
patience from your subjects. Some of the following ideas have proven to
work in the past:
✦Don’t worry, Mon. It helps to explain to your subjects not to worry
about posing until everyone is in place. Keep them relaxed as long as
you can, because posing is tiring and stressful for most people.
178

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Taking Photos for Publication
✦Please, stay put. I usually stress to people that I’m going to take more
than one photo and ask them not to flee like startled deer the first time
my flash goes off. (Every time they laugh at one of your jokes, you’ve
gained a couple more minutes of patience from them.)
✦Flashers. If your digital camera uses a preflash or red-eye reduction of
any sort, either turn it off (if possible) or alert your subjects to ignore
the preflash. Otherwise, they will release their poses just as the main
flash fires. When you’re ready to shoot, tell everyone to look directly
into the camera lens. Look carefully through your viewfinder and
quickly check each person to make sure that you can see everyone’s
face. If you can’t, stop and correct poses. If you can, start shooting!
Keep your sense of humor, no matter how challenging the group shot may
get. If you can keep everyone smiling and relaxed, you’ll get a good shot
sooner or later.
Having people say “Cheese” is a no-no. Every portrait photographer has a
bag of phrases to get his or her subjects to smile.
PR photography
Public relations photography frequently looks like photojournalism, but
there’s an important difference. Newspaper photography tries very hard to
be balanced, objective, and unbiased; PR photography doesn’t.
179
Lighting groups
Follow these general tips when lighting photos that
you hope will be publishable (see Book I, Chapter 9
for more information on lighting):
 The pro way: To light this setup, use a pair of
studio lights that are firing into umbrellas or soft
boxes about 6 feet apart and angled toward the
center of the group. A third light is positioned
behind the group and pointed at the backdrop
to provide some separation from the backdrop.
Set your light’s power output to maximize your
depth of field. If you’re doing multiple sittings,
use masking tape or gaffer’s tape to restrain
your cables so that people don’t trip over them.
 The serious amateur way: A less professional
setup that can still deliver good results is to use
multiple slaved portable flashes (see Book I,
Chapter 6 for an explanation of photographic
slaves) without the backdrop. You find three
problems with this approach: The flashes
don’t recycle as quickly as the studio light-
ing setup, the flashes don’t put out as much
light — meaning that you have to go with a
shallower depth of field — and the lack of a
backdrop means that the photo’s background
may detract from the overall image quality. Few
publications will use a photo that has a dis-
tracting background.
 The not-so-serious amateur way: One flash,
straight ahead. It’s not elegant, the light’s kind
of harsh, and you risk getting red-eye, espe-
cially with kids. Getting your flash up higher
helps prevent red-eye and gives you a nicer
light, but even one flash can do you some good
because it helps clean up shadows on your
subjects’ faces.
 The “Oh My God, What Were You Thinking?”
way: The camera’s built-in flash. You’ve got to
be kidding. Most built-in flash units have a
range of about 8 feet. This flash may do some
good with a small group, but it’s useless with a
big one. Publications will reject large group
photos that are poorly lit with a puny flash unit.

The goal in PR photography is to present your client in the best possible
light. This kind of photography calls for a good sense of diplomacy and the
ability to work as a member of the team with the company’s public relations
personnel. Generally, the PR department has some specific ideas of the
message that they want like the image to convey.
PR photography can take many forms. It may range from creating executive
portraits for senior company personnel to special-event photography to
taking photos for the company newsletter or a sales brochure. The next sec-
tions cover these particular varieties of PR photography in greater detail.
Executive portraits
Executive portraits can vary and include basic head-and-shoulders portraits,
commanding-executive-in-charge-at-the-helm/desk photos, and leader-with-
his (her)-troops pictures. You can find more on shooting portraits in Book I,
Chapter 9, but for now the following points outline the basic kinds of execu-
tive portraits that you may be asked to shoot:
✦Head-and-shoulders: This is a basic portrait. Use a portable studio
lighting setup, and take a variety of shots and poses, including smiling,
visionary, and serious. Don’t be surprised if an executive has some very
clear ideas about how he or she wants to look. You and the PR staffer
should look the execs over carefully to make sure that they look their
best. If they don’t, offer them a mirror and a comb (if their hair is out of
place) or a lint brush (if their clothes need it). Use an appropriate back-
drop. The PR types in your organization can suggest the best backdrop
for a particular executive.
✦Desk: This portrait shows the captain of industry hard at work at his
or her desk. Skip the backdrop, but check the background thoroughly
through your viewfinder. Some honors and photographs are fine, but if
the backdrop is too cluttered, consider changing camera angles a bit to
clean things up. Because you’re shooting the exec at his or her desk,
you photo should indicate that it’s a working space. A neatly arranged
pen set and a single document on the gleaming mahogany desk is
plenty. In any case, don’t show a messy, cluttered desk.
✦Confab: This shot is a bit trickier. The idea is to show the exec as an 
“in-charge” leader. This is usually done with the standing exec giving
instructions to a pair of underlings. The exec is turned toward the
camera (slightly angled), with the underlings posed mostly away from
the camera. Underlings should be carefully selected (this is the PR
department’s job) because it’s an opportunity for the company to
show that it is an equal opportunity employer, or minority employer,
for example.
✦Setting: The setting is usually taken in a nicer section of the company
headquarters, but it could also be in a location that showcases some-
thing about the firm. Location could be anything, including a shipyard,
an oil field, a factory assembly line, or a restaurant.
✦One of the gang: This shot is for the charismatic executive whose rap-
port with the troops is legendary. Forget the suits, mahogany desk, and
rich carpeting. Instead, he or she is dressed casually. In fact, it should
be hard to tell the executive from the employees, except for the fact
that everyone in the photo is hanging on his or her every word.
180

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Taking Photos for Publication
✦Really one of the gang: From time to time, you need to take a head-and-
shoulders shot of someone who really is one of the gang: a nonexecu-
tive, nonmanager, ordinary star-of-the-warehouse type. Maybe he or 
she had a great bowling score on behalf of the company team or perfect
attendance for ten years. In such cases, a formal portrait would be inap-
propriate. You need to be prepared to grab a simple, flattering head-and-
shoulders shot, like the one shown in Figure 10-5.
Being able to produce a wide range of executive photos is a good skill for a
PR photographer because a place always exists for these images, whether
in the company newsletter or the latest annual report.
Company events
Shooting company events usually revolves around documenting activity for
outside company publications and for distribution among employees. This
usually means that the photographer is expected to take a lot of pictures,
and the biggest challenge is in being thorough enough.
You may be called on to capture the following company events:
✦Dinners: A company can hold a dinner for a lot of reasons. Plan on getting
photos of the speakers, award recipients (if any), company executives,
and as many attendees as possible. Special-event dinners (fund-drive
events, seasonal parties, and recognitions of company accomplishments)
should also include photos that show why the event is being held.
✦Outings: An organization may hold a retreat or conference. These gath-
erings feature a variety of events, some meant for fun and some for
training. Plan on taking lots of shots of the individuals who are partici-
pating in these events. Start by making sure that you get the bigwigs.
While you’re looking for good photographs, also make sure that your
shots are positive and present the employees in a good light.
✦Company-sponsored sporting events: Book I, Chapter 11 — the one
on sports photography — applies here, with the added reminder that
you’re still shooting a corporate event first and an athletics meet
second. Document elements that show the company relationship to
the sports event (banner or logo, for example), and get good souvenir
photos for the amateur athletes (particularly if they are company
employees). Posed shots and camaraderie photos are good, too.
✦Family events: A company may hold an open house for employee fami-
lies so that they can see what their family members do and where they
work. Get plenty of shots of employees demonstrating their jobs for
their families.
✦Community relations events: Many companies work hard to be good
corporate neighbors. Employees are encouraged to volunteer as mentors
or to give time to public service efforts, such as Habitat for Humanity. If
you’re asked to shoot a community relations event, plan on getting news-
paper-type photos for use in the company newspaper or newsletter (and
remember, accentuate the positive results of the event). You should also
take pictures for the company to hand out to its workers. (Companies
motivate and reward employees for doing things like this in many ways.
T-shirts, coffee mugs, and souvenir photos are the top three.)
181

Arranging a PR event that’s worth photographing
If you’re shooting for your own company and your company is a small one,
as you take more photos for company purposes, you may find yourself as
the in-house PR “expert” and be asked to help put together events that are
covered by photographers other than yourself. You really understand the
needs of other photographers, too! That’s great because putting together a
photo-worthy event calls for an understanding of the needs of the photogra-
phers that you’re inviting and for optimizing your own chances to get good
photos alongside them. Press photographers are paid to create strong,
exciting visuals.
You can do the following things to make an event more successful:
✦Choose a location that provides a strong backdrop for the speaker or
ceremony.
✦Include elements that reinforce the purpose of the event. For example, if
it’s a groundbreaking or building dedication, try to get some construc-
tion equipment in place to frame the podium or platform. Hang banners
off the buckets of front-end loaders that identify your company and
project.
✦Give the other photographers handouts that make it easier to identify
each person who is participating in the event. This should include a
photo of each person, with his or her name and title securely attached
to the picture. (It can also be a printed sheet with a bio. It doesn’t have
to be an actual print.)
✦If you are holding an outdoor event, be prepared for bad weather by
having an awning available on-site. Try to set up things so that photo-
graphers can still get a good backdrop for their photos.

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Taking Photos for Publication
On the day of the event, check on all the small details that can come back to
haunt you, such as confirming the presence of equipment, banners, hand-
outs, and so on. Next, check the weather forecast. Have some people avail-
able to help answer questions from the photographers or provide extra
handouts.
Refreshments for the press and guests are a good idea, but you don’t have
to go to extremes. You should probably worry more about having the
appropriate refreshments for the company bigwigs than for the media.
Other photo-worthy events
Your company may welcome members of the community inside its doors.
This can be a good opportunity for creating images that you can place in
your local papers.
Consider these proven winners for enhancing the image of a company
through . . . well . . . images:
✦School tours: Does your company do something that may make a good
tour for the local school? If so, bringing a group of school kids in can
provide tons of photo ops. Some typical images include an employee
demonstrating a piece of equipment to the kids or one of the kids learn-
ing to use a piece of gear (keeping safety in mind at all times). Be sure to
have your company’s name or logo on the equipment so that it shows
up in the photo.
✦Mentors: Does your company have a mentor program? If so, the interac-
tion between your employees and their protégés can also make a good
image. In this case, you’re shooting at the school instead of your facility,
so you don’t have as many opportunities to get your company’s name in
the shot. At least make sure that the name is in the photo’s caption.
Producing placeable PR photos
Successfully placing images that were taken specifically for PR purposes
with your local media is both an art and a science. Remember that you’re
trying to meet your needs (placing your company’s photos) as well as those
of the newspaper (strong images).
Newspapers know what you’re trying to do: That is, get your company
some free publicity and credibility. They also know that they have an adver-
tising department that exists to help pay the bills. They’re not giving away
free space, but if you supply a good image, it may be used.
Understanding your markets is important. Many local newspapers are will-
ing to consider photo submissions, but each paper has its own criteria for
acceptance. Newspapers use PR photos for a variety of reasons. Some of
these reasons are as follows:
✦The images are of high quality and show members of the community
doing something newsworthy (like building homes for Habitat for
Humanity, running a dunk tank to raise money for charity, and so on).
183

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦The images fill a need that the newspaper couldn’t fill on its own because
it was understaffed, or the event occurred over a weekend and the news-
paper staff couldn’t cover it.
✦The newspaper is willing to “sacrifice” a couple of pages to run photos
from groups and organizations that want publicity. You can easily deter-
mine whether your newspaper does this: Look for the section near the
back that has a couple of solid pages of Grip ’n’ Grins (those trite
photos of two people shaking hands and grinning at the camera).
Many newspapers also run a Neighborhood or Region section. (Lots of
names are used for this part of the paper.) Such a section is geared toward
the local community. In fact, when a newspaper hits a certain size, it will
probably print a different section for local communities as a special insert.
This means that you have even more opportunities to place photos! Even if
your company isn’t located in a community that the paper covers, some
employees who work for your company probably live there.
Printing your PR photos
After you’ve created your publishable PR images, give yourself the best
chance you can to get them used. While Book I, Chapter 20 covers printing
digital images in more detail, I discuss some general observations in the fol-
lowing paragraphs.
As a bureau chief for one publication that I worked for, I was frequently
amazed at the number of low-resolution ink-jet prints that I used to receive
from PR and marketing people. To make matters worse, these images were
frequently printed on cheap typing paper. Needless to say, they weren’t
used. (I’m not referring to “proof” images that accompany a digital file here;
those are okay.)
Instead, you should use one of the newer high-resolution ink-jet printers
(1400-dpi or higher) that can produce photos that are as good as those you
get from conventional film finishers and photofinishers. If you don’t have
such a printer, your local pharmacy or department store may have a stand-
alone kiosk or an in-house digital minilab that can produce high-quality
photos from your digital files.
Writing cutlines
Cutlines, or captions, are vital to getting your photos used. Newspaper edi-
tors know that nothing infuriates a reader more than seeing his or her name
misspelled or being misidentified in a newspaper photo. As a result, most
papers set very strict policies for their own staff on this kind of thing. (Three
strikes and you’re usually out of a job.)
Good cutlines provide the basic information and get it right. Include the fol-
lowing information in your cutlines:
✦Make sure that you have the correct spelling for the names of everyone
who is appearing in the picture, and triple-check to be sure that no
typos sneak through.
✦Make sure that each name is identified with the proper person — usually
by designating “from left to right” or “l to r.”
184

Book I
Chapter 10
Shooting for Publication
Taking Photos for Publication
✦Now that you’ve made it clear who the people in the photo are, describe
what they’re doing and why it’s important. Make sure that you also iden-
tify your company or client.
✦Provide your photo credit (“Photo by John Doe”). Include your contact
information.
Cutlines need to be accurate, concise, and informative. Plus, the cutline is
your chance to mention your organization’s name in the publication.
Preparing the cutline for submission
After you’ve written your cutline, it’s time to affix it to the print. You must
do this so that the print and cutline can’t be separated by accident.
The standard method of preparing a cutline is as follows:
1. Set your margins so that they’re narrower than the print’s horizontal
dimension, and give your cutline a top margin of about 11⁄2 inches.
2. Print the caption, and trim the sides and bottom to about 1⁄4 inch from
the text, while leaving the top margin alone.
3. Turn the print face down, and position the facedown cutline on top
of it.
Line up the cutline so that the top line of text is slightly below the
bottom of the print, and use a small piece of tape to affix the cutline to
the back of the print.
4. Turn the print and cutline back face-up, and fold the cutline sheet up
and over so that it covers the photograph.
Now your picture and cutline, as shown in Figure 10-6, should fit neatly
into an envelope, with the cutline sheet offering some protection for the
face of your print.
5. Before placing your print in the envelope, though, sandwich it
between two pieces of corrugated cardboard, and rubber-band the
sandwich together to keep it from being damaged in transit.
Professional packaging and presentation can help you put your best foot
forward and improve your chances of getting your photos accepted.
Submitting the photo
You have a nice, professional package now, but you’re not done yet. Now
you have to prepare a cover letter that tells the editor why you’re sending
her these photos. Follow these guidelines when writing your cover letter:
✦Be brief. You need only a few paragraphs to explain what the event was
about, when it was held, and where.
✦Make sure that the appropriate contact information is provided in your
letter.
✦Check the newspaper’s masthead, and address the envelope to the
photo editor (if the paper is big enough to have one), the Neighborhood
section editor if the paper has a Neighborhood section, or just the
editor if it’s a really small paper.
185

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Keep a log that identifies the image (something like 20020821.03 to indi-
cate 2002, August 21, third photo release of the month), the newspaper(s)
that you’ve sent the photo to, and the date you mailed it. Make sure that
your cutline includes this release number. Also identify whether the
photo is for immediate release or for use on a future date.
Follow up
A few days after mailing your photo submission, call the newspaper and ask
to speak with the appropriate editor. Say that you’re calling to follow up on
a photo submission. When you’re connected, identify yourself and say that
you’re checking to see whether the editor needs any additional information.
Be sure to check the appropriate papers to see whether they’ve run your
image. If so, buy a couple of copies for tear sheets for your files. Note the
log number on your file copy so that you can match it with the appropriate
photo. Get in the habit of comparing your successful and unsuccessful
images so that you can see what kinds of images your local paper favors.
Product Photography
Product photography is a specialized type of photography, but it is one that
offers good opportunities for the enterprising photographer. This type of
photography is all about making your clients’ products look as good as pos-
sible. You can do this in several ways, and you can find more information on
photographing objects close-up in Book I, Chapter 8.

Product Photography
If you think that this type of photography is the exclusive preserve of the
big-name advertising photographers, agencies, and art departments, you’ll
be happy to know that the reality is far different. Opportunities for this type
of work are very open to talented, freelance photographers.
Product shot opportunities
Lots of manufacturers make product lines that are sold through catalogs.
These manufacturers constantly need fresh images, because these catalogs
are issued as frequently as once a month. Success in this type of photogra-
phy calls for the following skills:
✦Speed: Be prepared to work quickly and efficiently. Set up a standard
lighting package that provides clean, even lighting. This generally means
setting up a tabletop station with a pair of lights that rake across the
product at 45-degree angles and that are positioned at a right angle to
the camera.
✦Simplicity: Your tabletop setup should be as simple as possible. Plan on
using seamless paper that you can advance on a roller. Then, when one
section gets dirty, just advance the paper to another stretch where it
is clean. Your close-up photography skills should be well honed, too,
because many product shots are close-ups of components, like those
shown in Figure 10-7.
✦Flexibility: Your digital camera and tripod rig should be versatile enough
so that you can change its position quickly and easily. Some tripod manu-
facturers offer dollies (a small platform with rollers) that the tripod can
be mounted on so that you can reposition it easily.
✦Recordkeeping: Be sure to have a workable recordkeeping and indexing
system in place so that you can keep track of what you’ve shot and
when, because clients frequently need this info.
Product demo shots
These photos are designed to either show what the product can do or how
it is correctly used. The idea is to create an image that shows a typical person
successfully using the product for its designed purpose. Some examples of
product demo photos are as follows:

✦An attractive person reclining on a pool float, looking relaxed and
happy (selling the pool float). Shoot this scene from a variety of angles,
including getting up on a ladder to shoot down on her. Use an image-
editing program to tweak the pool water’s color to be a nice, rich blue.
Be careful in your choice of lenses here. Longer focal lengths are more
flattering. You probably need flash here to clean up any shadows, too.
✦Cyclists standing with their bikes, happily discussing their planned
ride (selling the bicycle). Use a long telephoto lens for this image. The
couple and the bikes should be in focus, not the background. Use late-
afternoon light to add a rich glow to the scene.
✦A woman stroking her pet cat while it laps up a saucer of milk that’s not
just any milk, but a specially formulated milk just for cats (the product
box can be in the photo or be composited in later). Use your portable
studio lighting setup here and a short telephoto or modest wide-angle
lens, depending on how much space you have to set up your photo.
✦A businessperson working on a portable computer (selling the com-
puter). If the shot is outside, use fill flash and a medium telephoto lens.
If it’s inside, use your portable studio lighting kit and the medium tele-
photo lens. Set your aperture based on your background. For the out-
side shot, a wide-open lens that throws the background out of focus
generally works fine. Inside, if you have a particularly good background
(say, a nice study), take advantage of it and reduce your f-stop to
increase your depth of field.
✦The product placed as it is set up for use. Figure 10-8 shows a shot
that’s arranged to show how a product is used. All the extraneous infor-
mation has been excised, making the final photo abundantly clear.
The idea is to sell viewers on the idea that buying this particular product
can enrich their lives in one way or another.
Of course, sometimes you don’t want to show the product being used.
When that happens, the photographer must invoke a mood that the product
manufacturer finds desirable. For instance, I would never show a sample of
kitty litter being used. Instead, I would create an image of a cat bathing itself
in the foreground, with a dinner party in the background. The text for the
ad could then read “Brand X Kitty Litter: You’ll never know it’s being used.”

D
igital cameras offer at least one advantage and one disadvantage when
used for sports and action photography. The big advantage lies in the
ability to shoot an almost unlimited number of pictures in your quest to cap-
ture the peak moment of action, but without burning up dozens of rolls of
film. In times past, professional photographers had an edge in this depart-
ment because they could justify using tons of film at a single event. Today,
you can “erase” mistakes and bad shots from reusable digital film, so your
errant photos aren’t necessarily captured for eternity.
The chief disadvantage to digital cameras is that many models don’t respond
as quickly as you like when the shutter release button is pressed. Even a
pause of half a second is too long when the decisive moment in a contest is
framed within your viewfinder or LCD screen for an instant.
Fortunately, the advent of affordable digital cameras allows photographers
who don’t have a newspaper or magazine paying for film to shoot enough
to create high-quality sports images. And, you can work around the digital
camera’s main drawback lots of ways. This chapter focuses on ways to use
the strengths of digital photography to get great sports and action photos
and offers tips for minimizing the technology’s weaknesses. Read on and
see what pros and amateurs alike can do to get the picture.
Choosing Your Weapons
Sports photography calls for a range of tools that can help put you in the
best possible position to get the shots you need. This doesn’t mean you
need to break the bank to get good images, though. Many of the current
crop of digital cameras — from digital SLRs to point-and-shoot versions —
offer powerful capabilities of their own.
Sports photography does have specific requirements, and you should con-
sider a number of things when assembling your sports photography arse-
nal. I explain these key needs in more detail later in this chapter, but this
summary will get you in the proper equipment frame of mind:
189

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Go long with telephotos. To get the best sports photos, you want to get
as close to the action as possible. That’s enough of a challenge for pros
equipped with press passes and access to areas set aside for their use.
Imagine how tough it is for someone who has to get shots from the
stands. If you can’t get close, your digital camera’s telephoto zoom setting
or add-on telephoto attachment is your best friend. For sports photos, a
camera with a 3:1 or 4:1 zoom lens is almost essential. You can find pro-
sumer digital cameras that take you even closer with 10:1 zoom ratios.
✦Go wide. Wide-angle capability also comes in handy for sports photog-
raphy. Certain sports, such as skateboarding and rollerblading for
instance, photograph quite well from a low position using an extreme
wide-angle view. A wide-angle capability is also great for getting an over-
all view of a sports venue or crowd, as shown in Figure 11-1.
✦Light up your sports life. If you want to shoot sports at night, an acces-
sory flash unit can greatly improve the quality of your photography
because that brief flash of light can freeze action. External flash units
can even be a big advantage during the day if you’re photographing out-
door sports such as baseball — the flash lights up those inky shadows
on the upper face caused by the caps many athletes wear to shield their
eyes. Of course, you have to be close enough for the flash to be useful.
✦Take along lots of digital film. Sports photography can fill your digital
storage media faster than most other photographic enterprises. At an
exciting game or match, you may find yourself shooting more photos in
two hours than you took during your entire vacation. Yet, other than
timeouts or halftime, you have very little time to review your photos
and erase the duds to free up storage space. The solution is to take a lot
of digital film with you and use it freely.

Digital camera features and action photography
This section reviews how some specific camera features can be best applied
to action photography.
Viewfinder
Most digital cameras have an optical viewfinder and a color LCD panel. You
need to know when to use each of them when taking sports photos. Some
general rules to keep in mind:
✦Use the optical viewfinder to follow action prior to squeezing off a shot.
You can view the subjects continually through the viewfinder under just
about any lighting conditions. Although optical viewfinders can be diffi-
cult to use under very low light levels (when you need to use a flash
instead of existing light to take the picture anyway), optical viewfinders
are still a better choice than the LCD panel for following fast-moving
events.
✦Sometimes, it helps to keep your other eye open while looking through
the optical viewfinder, giving you some peripheral vision that will alert
you when the action is about to enter the frame.
✦The LCD screen is invaluable for reviewing your images immediately
after creating them. Most cameras can be set to display an image on the
LCD for a few seconds while the image is being saved to your digital
film. Take the opportunity to review the image. Even if it’s great, you
may learn something that will enable you to do better on the next shot!
191
Using your camera’s LCD review feature
Here are some things to look for when reviewing
your action shots:
 Composition: One of the most valuable things
your LCD screen can do for you is to confirm
that your composition is what you want it to be.
Considering that, with sports photography,
you’re dealing with athletes moving quickly and
sometimes (seemingly, to the lay person) at
random, being sure they’re where you want
them to be in the frame is a good thing.
 Sharpness: LCD screens aren’t necessarily an
accurate way to judge image sharpness.
However, some cameras offer the ability to
magnify a portion of your image, which can
help you see whether your camera’s autofocus
or your manual focusing is close. If not, you can
switch autofocus modes (some cameras let
you choose which area of the frame to focus
on, or whether or not the camera locks the
focus when you press lightly on the shutter
release) or switch to manual focus.
 Exposure: Your camera’s LCD screen can help
you determine whether your exposure is on
target. Some cameras let you call up a his-
togram, which is a kind of scale that shows the
distribution of brightness values throughout the
image. The histogram can help you judge your
exposure. If your exposure is not spot on, you
can make changes immediately so that subse-
quent action shots are better.
It can be hard to use your LCD screen effectively
when you’re shooting outside in bright sun. A com-
pany by the name of Hoodman (www.hoodman
usa.com) makes a variety of hoods that offer some
shade for the LCD screen and make it easier to read
in the sun.

Electronic flash
An electronic flash unit can be a big help to your action photography whether
it’s day or night. You can use flash for good photos in a number of ways. Here
are a few:
✦Let there be light. An accessory flash unit can provide enough light for
you to shoot by when it gets too dark for even your highest ISO setting
to be usable.
✦Freeze your frame. Accessory flash units produce an incredibly brief
burst of light (somewhere on the order of up to 1⁄10,000 of a second in dura-
tion), and because the flash unit provides the main source of light, it has
the ability to stop action. You should be careful, however: When using
flash at a slow shutter speed setting, the ambient light (the available
light other than the flash itself) can register a ghost image trailing the
image captured by the flash. This can sometimes be a cool effect, but
only if it’s intentional.
✦Cleaning up the shadows. Even when you have more than enough light
for good sports photography, many times even the brightest conditions
can’t change the fact that athletes wear ball caps or tree limbs cast
shadows. An accessory flash unit can help get rid of those shadows.

Sports photography usually calls for such high shutter speeds to stop
action that no photographer would use a tripod to prevent blurry photos
from camera shake unless you’re using a high-end digital camera with a
huge telephoto lens (which isn’t something the average digital photogra-
pher needs to worry about). Instead, sports photographers use a tripod to
simply help support the camera. Here are some “tripodic” considerations
specific to sports photography for you to ponder:
✦Great support: A good sturdy tripod can be invaluable for holding and
steadying your camera, particularly at telephoto lens settings. Some
sports, such as football, call for too much movement on the photogra-
pher’s part for tripods to be useful (you’ll constantly be running up and
down the sidelines). When photographing sports, such as track and
field, baseball, and softball, however, you benefit greatly from having a
tripod to support your camera.
✦A second camera rig: When shooting baseball and softball games, I fre-
quently set up a second camera that’s prefocused on a key spot, such as
first base, second base, or home plate. A tripod enables you to switch
back and forth between two cameras easily and quickly.
✦Panning: This technique involves following the action as it moves across
your image frame. I discuss panning in greater detail later in this chapter,
but a tripod with a panning head can greatly improve your efforts at this
technique because it allows free horizontal movement while keeping the
camera steady vertically.
✦Monopods: For sports that call for photographers to be active, a mono-
pod (which looks like a walking stick) frequently works better than a
tripod because it’s easier to pick up and carry around (while still pro-
viding a steady base). A good monopod is fairly thick and heavy, both to

Choosing Your Weapons
be strong enough to support the weight of a big telephoto and also so
that you can brace against it. A lot of inexpensive units on the market
promise all sorts of capabilities; make sure you hold out for a good solid
monopod and not one of the flimsy ones.
✦Shoulder stocks: These devices are modeled on rifle stocks and work on
the principle that, by bracing the lens into your shoulder, you can hold
it steady.
Lenses and attachments
Because sports photography calls for the ability to cover large swatches of
field and fast moving athletes, long lenses or attachments to extend the reach
of your point-and-shoot camera’s built-in zooms will really help improve your
results. Your choice of lens or zoom settings is in part dependent on what
sports you plan on shooting:
✦Wide-angle settings: Unless you’re very close to the action, wide-angle
settings won’t be a big part of your sports photography. For example,
wide-angle lenses are currently in vogue for skateboarding photography.
These lenses can give your sports shots a very different look, if you can
get close enough to your subject to fill the frame.
✦Short telephoto settings: Telephoto settings equivalent to a 35mm
camera’s 85mm to 135mm lengths (which is how digital camera manu-
facturers measure their optics’ magnifications) have a lot of uses in
sports photography. These are great for indoor sports, such as basket-
ball and volleyball, and can also be handy for nighttime sports under
the lights. If your digital camera has a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or
larger, you can take photos in lower light levels. Make sure your camera
doesn’t use a smaller lens opening, which would defeat your ability to
take indoor shots.
✦Medium telephoto settings: These are usually in the 180mm to 200mm
range. This is a very versatile setting that can come in handy when
you’re shooting almost any type of sport.
✦Long telephoto settings: Some digital cameras have long telephoto set-
tings that are the equivalent of 300 to 400mm on a 35mm film camera.
These are the lenses of choice for both football and baseball photography
because they allow great reach and the ability to keep shooting even
when you’re outdoors under lights. Be careful that your long lens doesn’t
reduce your shutter speed beyond the ability to capture the action.
✦Super telephotos: You probably won’t have access to super telephotos
unless your digital camera has interchangeable lenses. I’m talking about
the really big guns here, the 500mm and 600mm telephotos. These
lenses are almost too big for sports photography and are almost the
exclusive reserve of nature and bird photographers. They can be useful
for times when you just can’t get very close to the action and have a
pretty small subject (gymnastics events come to mind).
✦Add-on lenses for point-and-shoot digital cameras: Many point-and-
shoot digital cameras can accept lens converters that attach to the
front of the camera’s built-in zoom lens. These converters may screw
into the lens filter mount, clip onto the lens barrel, or attach via an
ingenious adapter barrel and are frequently available in both wide-angle
193

and telephoto flavors. It’s generally best to go with the manufacturer’s
version, which is specifically designed for your camera, but if your
camera’s manufacturer doesn’t offer the accessory lens you need, look
at third-party options. Be very careful if someone tries to sell you an
add-on lens for a video camera. Video cameras get by with much lower
resolution than digital still cameras. A lens designed for a video camera
probably won’t produce very good results on a digital still camera.
Digital cameras and latency
Before you move into tips for taking great digital sports photos, you proba-
bly should spend a few minutes considering the deep, dark secret that digi-
tal camera manufacturers don’t want you to think about: When you press
that shutter release button, many cameras have a noticeable time lag before
the picture is actually taken. Although a minor inconvenience if you’re taking
a photo of the Eiffel Tower, that delay can be fatal when photographing
sports. Fortunately, you can do some things about the phenomena known
as latency and shutter lag.
Once upon a time, you pushed the shutter release button, and the camera
took the picture. As cameras have gotten more and more sophisticated,
more and more things have to happen before an image is created.
Dealing with latency
Latency is the time required to write the image you’ve just taken to your
storage media. When you take a picture with a film camera, the shutter
releases, and the image is immediately registered on the film at the speed of
light, so to speak. When you take a picture with a digital camera, the image
has to be captured and then recorded onto your memory card. The image
capture and storage process can take a second or two, or even longer. How
long the process takes and whether or not your camera will continue taking
additional photos while writing to the card are important questions.
Some digital cameras use buffers (built-in memory) to temporarily let you
keep shooting while the buffer contents write to removable memory. If you
keep shooting, eventually the buffer fills, and you have to stop until it’s
made enough room for you to resume shooting. Other cameras may not be
able to use their buffers for their highest resolution files but will let you
keep shooting if you chose a lower resolution setting. It’s a tough choice,
but sometimes, the ability to keep shooting overrides the desire for the
highest possible resolution. Here are some things that affect latency and
that you can control:
✦Media: Some forms of media accept data faster than others.
CompactFlash cards tend to write information faster than Microdrives
(which are tiny hard disk drives). Some CompactFlash cards write data
faster than others. Look for ones rated for faster write times (frequently
marked 4x, 8x, or 12x).
✦Resolution: The more data the camera has to write to the card, the
greater the latency period. If you know you can get by with a lower reso-
lution setting, you can speed up things considerably by going with the
lower resolution. This can be a tough decision because after you give up
194

Choosing Your Weapons
quality, you can’t get it back. On the other hand, missing a shot because
you’re waiting for your last few images to write to your memory card is
one of the more frustrating experiences a photographer can enjoy. Film
photographers miss shots while changing rolls of film, and digital pho-
tographers miss them due to latency. It’s not a perfect world, but it is a
great reason to get a second camera.
Understanding your equipment, its capabilities, and its limitations, is impor-
tant for the digital photographer interested in making winning sports photo-
graphs. If sports photography is your overriding concern, several cameras
on the market are geared toward the sports shooter. Both Canon’s and
Nikon’s top-of-the-line digital SLRs are highly capable photographic tools
well designed for this kind of work (but not cheap!). For those of us on a
tighter budget, Olympus makes a lower-resolution digital camera — the 
E-100RS — capable of 15-frame-per-second bursts (for a max of 10 frames).
It may be worth considering.
Dealing with shutter lag
Latency isn’t the only thing that can slow down your picture taking. A long
list of things happen as you press the shutter. That list includes such things
as activating light-sensing features and bringing autofocus up to speed. If
you have a Microdrive hard disk storage device, the time it takes for its
drive platters to start spinning is a factor as well. The result is something
known as shutter lag. What it means is there’s a delay between the moment
when you squeeze the shutter and when the camera actually fires. This
means you have to anticipate the decisive moment and trigger the shutter
early enough to cause the image to be created at the best possible moment.
Just like top baseball pitchers study the habits and preferences of the hitters
they face, sports photographers need to become familiar with the specifics
of the sport they’re shooting. Being ready to shoot and looking in the right
direction can give you enough of a head start to compensate for the delay
in firing time.
Timing your shot properly
Here are some ways to time your shot so that you can take a great picture
even when shutter lag delays capture of that decisive moment:
✦Anticipate. Many sports have a particular rhythm. If you can become
sensitive to that rhythm, you can anticipate that peak moment of action
and gauge how far in advance to trigger the shutter. If you’re shooting a
baseball or softball game, you can position yourself down the third base
line and wait for a play at first. It takes a certain amount of time for a
throw to make it across the field to the first baseman, so you can trip the
shutter in time for the ball to reach the mitt. Or, wait until just before the
soccer player kicks the ball to snap the shutter, as shown in Figure 11-2.
✦Go with the flow. Follow the action with your camera and gently squeeze
the shutter as you keep your eye on the ball (or athlete). In sports such
as basketball or soccer, you can track the person bringing the ball down
the field.
195

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Pick your spot. Many sports direct action to a particular location. For
instance, long jumpers are headed toward the landing pit, so you can
know within a couple of feet where the athlete will land. Be prepared to
trigger the shutter as the athletes launch themselves and stay with them
until landing. Some sports have goals, some bases, some baskets; sooner
or later, every sport has a spot that you just know will see action. 
✦Use manual focus. Some digital cameras allow more control over their
capabilities than others. If your camera lets you deactivate autofocus,
for instance, you can prefocus on the expected action spot and reduce
your camera’s shutter lag time. A similar technique works for cameras
that let you lock focus. Lock focus on the spot you’re keying on just
before the play starts, and you give yourself a head start on the action.
✦Lock in your focus. If your digital camera requires you to press the shut-
ter halfway to activate autofocus and start your Microdrive spinning, you
can do this in advance and have it fully up to speed at just the right time.
The problem with this technique is it can drain your camera’s batteries
in a hurry, so plan on having lots of extra juice if you want to do this.
✦Use autofocus selectively. Does your digital camera let you pick a dif-
ferent button to activate autofocus instead of the shutter button? If it
does, then you can combine this feature with the previous technique to
decrease battery drain (autofocus uses lots of power). Keep the shutter
pressed halfway while awaiting the next event and then, as soon as you
need to, press the second button to activate autofocus. (This takes a
little practice, but it does work.) It also works well for the prefocusing
suggestion made a couple of paragraphs ago. Some cameras have a con-
tinuous or single autofocus setting. Switching to the single setting can
save power because your camera doesn’t constantly refocus each time
you move it a little.
Taking Great Sports Photos
This section deals with tips for taking great digital action photos in a variety
of sports situations. That’s the great part about sports photography: There
are so many different sports that, when you think you’ve explored every-
thing that can be done for, say, soccer, then soccer season is over, and it’s
time to grab some basketball shots!

Elementary, middle school, and high school sports are great training grounds
for people who want to become good sports photographers for several 
reasons:
✦Speed: Because the players aren’t as fast and as skilled as those at the
college level (and up), the excitement generally unfolds at slower speeds,
making life easier for the novice sports photographer who’s trying to
follow the action.
✦Access: School athletic events are much more accessible than college or
the pros. Return the favor by offering the coach or the boosters a copy
of your shots from their awards dinner.
Don’t be afraid to experiment, either. There are always elements of an event
that provide dramatic imagery, even if it’s not the typical sports action shot.
Think about close-ups of equipment, low-angle shots of the playing field,
and portraits or studies of spent, exhausted athletes at the end of the game.
Look for shots that show the emotion and intensity the athletes bring to the
sport.
Choosing your sport and your spot
Knowing where to position yourself can be a real challenge for novice sports
photographers. It’s also vital to give yourself the best possible opportunities
to get great shots.
Most events are accessible at all but the highest levels of play. Even high
school and junior college sports cut serious amateurs some slack if they
want to get closer to the action (on the sidelines or behind the baseline).
Starting with NCAA play, that starts to change. Even minor league ball has
restrictions on what you can do and what equipment you can use. Pro-level
events are even more restrictive. Plus most professional organizations only
grant access based on your agreement to use your images only for editorial
purposes. Sports organizations like Major League Baseball, the National
Football League, and National Basketball Association, to name a few, guard
the marketing potential of their sport and athletes very closely.
Your goal is to be in position to capture peak action in the right direction
(getting that great catch with the athlete’s back to you doesn’t do you much
good). Generally, this means you want to be far enough in front of the action
to be effective, yet close enough to fill the frame.
Determining the right spot is largely dependent on the sport you’re shooting.
Your choice of available zoom settings can also play a role.
Football
If you’re photographing high school or peewee football, you can often get
right down on the sidelines to take your photos. At the lowest levels of the
sport, you can pretty much get whatever access you want. Even at the high
school level, you can probably get on the sidelines if you explain you’re
trying to build a sports portfolio. For most college and professional games,
197

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
you need some form of accreditation from the team itself. Still, sometimes
even a small, local newspaper can secure such access for its photographers,
so working for such a publication may get you in. Here are some tips for 
photographing football:
✦Keep your distance. Photographers generally stand about 8 to 15 yards
up field from the line of scrimmage. Don’t get much closer than this, or
the line officials will block your view. This puts you in place for a shot of
a running play or quarterback sack in the backfield, while still giving
you a chance to turn and lock on to a receiver in case of a pass play to
your side of the field. 
✦Use a second camera — if you have one. A second digital camera set to
its wide-angle setting can also be a good idea. You can quickly grab this
camera and bring it up to shooting position if a play comes right at you.
(Be careful to avoid being run over.)
✦Keep other spots in mind. As teams approach the goal line, you can
move to the area behind the end zone and shoot straight at the quarter-
back or running back attempting to leap over the defensive line. Because
the team’s players sit near the midfield, you can’t shoot around this area.
Also, plan on getting some shots of the coach yelling from the sidelines
and players on the bench. Cheerleaders are good for a couple of shots,
and if it’s a particularly cold day, some shots of the fans bundled up in
the stands are worth taking.
✦Be patient. Football demands patience and determination on the part
of the sports photographer simply because so much of the sport takes
place too far away from where you’re standing for you to be able to
shoot it effectively. Just stay with the game and be prepared for the
action when it finally does head toward you.
Football is one sport where the more you know about the game and the par-
ticular teams that are playing, the more effective you can be. Understanding
that one team favors short, quick passes while another favors a more con-
servative ground game helps you predict where the next bit of action will
take place.
Baseball and softball
A photographer can work from several likely places for shooting baseball
and softball games. One of my favorite spots is directly behind the back-
stop, shooting through the links to get a shot of the pitcher just as he or she
releases the ball (ideally framed between the batter and umpire). Here are
some other tips for shooting ballgames:
✦Get behind the plate. Many times, I start behind the plate to make sure I
get a usable image as quickly as possible before moving on down either
the first or third baselines. Usually, I head down until I’m about 5 or 10
feet below the base. From this spot, I can get good shots of the batter, a
side view of the pitcher, and a good angle for plays at second base.
✦Move down the baseline. After that, I continue on down the line until
I’m as much as 15 or 30 feet past the base. This position gives me a shot
at the runner racing to first or third.
198

Chapter 11

✦Watch that runner on first. If a runner is at first base, sometimes I pre-
focus my tripod-mounted camera on second base in case there’s a close
play there. Here’s where knowledge of the sport and the teams involved
can give you a big advantage. The stolen base is one of the more excit-
ing plays in baseball or softball. If you’re ready before the play begins,
you have a much better chance of getting a good shot of the action.
Much like football, baseball’s lowest levels of skill are wide open to any pho-
tographer who cares to shoot them. College and the pros are much harder
to gain access to, although once again, a newspaper job may give you a
chance. Softball tends to be easier to gain access to. Sometimes, a one-sided
game is easier to shoot than a close one. There tends to be lots of scoring,
including plenty of people stealing home.
Basketball
Hanging out behind the backboard is a great place for getting good shots. I
probably spend 80 percent of the game here. Rebounds, scoring, fights over
the ball — it all happens under the boards. Here are some other good loca-
tions for shooting hoops:
✦Take to the bleachers. I take some shots from up in the bleachers with
a telephoto prefocused on the rim. This is a good location for getting
the rebounder pulling the ball off the rim and a good look at the player’s
face. Try to find a spot a little higher than the rim. This generally calls
for a longer zoom lens setting, about 100mm to 135mm for a digital
camera.
✦Head for the sidelines. I also shoot along the sideline with a longer zoom
setting to get a shot of a ball handler bringing the ball up court. From
this position, I can also look for a shot of the coach yelling instructions
to the players and pivot to grab some crowd intensity shots. Sometimes
you can catch a tense moment as the ball is thrown back into play.
✦Don’t forget halftime. Now’s the time to look for shots of the coach and
players talking strategy. A wide-angle lens gets you in close when possi-
ble (easy for high school ball and younger, but you probably won’t be
able to get that close for college and the pros). 
Basketball is a great sport for a novice photographer who’s looking to build
a sports portfolio. It’s possible to get good photos without having to break
the bank on a camera with an ultralong telephoto lens zoom setting.
Soccer
Soccer is a little like football in terms of the field and sidelines action, but
this sport has lots of unique aspects, as well. Here are some tips:
✦Get behind the net. Behind the net and to one side of it are good loca-
tions to catch scoring attacks, but you spend long periods of time count-
ing blades of grass when the action moves to the other side of the field.
199

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Take to the sidelines. Positioning yourself on the sidelines puts you in
place for good ball-handling shots, and if you move down the sidelines
closer to the net, you’ll be in position to get the goalie in action. 
✦Reach out and grab someone. If you have a digital camera with a long
zoom lens, you can try to reach from one end of the field to the other to
get the goalie straight on. Or, you can even grab a shot from way up in
the stands!
✦Go for the wide look. For variety’s sake, try a shorter focal length while
lying on the ground. This will give you a second shot, but not a main
photo.
Soccer can be a difficult sport for the point-and-shoot digital camera simply
because of the size of the field. The best place to work from is the spot
behind the net and to one side. An occasional shot through the net works
too, but becomes a cliché if this is the only image you ever capture.
Other sports
You may be interested in other sports, too. All of them have their own spe-
cial challenges and opportunities. Here’s a brief rundown on some other
popular action opportunities:
✦Hockey: Stand behind the goalie or on the sidelines just above the goal.
Players tend to make a lot of contact behind the net trying to control
the puck, so there’s some good action there. Another place where big
hits happen is the area between the blue lines, the neutral zone. If your
lens is long enough, get some shots of the face-offs. Don’t forget about
reaction shots either. Hockey is tough simply because your movement
can be so restricted.
✦Tennis: You can stand behind the court shooting the player on the far
side of the net straight on. Don’t worry about the fence; if you’re using a
telephoto setting, you can shoot through the links. On the sidelines, I
favor shooting when the player is running from side to side after a ball,
but only when the player is moving toward me. Either a monopod or
tripod will work for tennis.
✦Golf: Shoot from the side when the player is teeing up (but not during
his or her swing), or straight on if the course conditions permit. You can
also shoot straight on from a safe distance when a player is putting.
✦Track: So many events, so little time. Whenever possible, I try to shoot
track events from as close to straight on as possible, generally as run-
ners are coming around the turn or at the start of a race when the line
of runners is beginning its break. For shuttle hurdles (teams of hurdlers
shuttling in each direction), I try to position myself at the midpoint of
the track so that I can zoom from longest to shortest focal length as I
move from runner to runner.
✦Field events: So many events, so many different ways to shoot them.
Unlike track, which tends to use the same quarter-mile track surface for
its events, the field competition presents more challenges. Fortunately,
the shot put, javelin, and discus can all use the same basic philosophy:
Namely, get in front of the athlete with a little offset to the side (and far
enough away to be out of range) so that you can shoot straight on as
the athlete releases whatever it is he or she is throwing. Setting yourself
200

Book I

up behind the landing area is a good strategy for both the long jump
and pole vault, while positioning yourself to the side and slightly behind
the bar works well for high jumping (the hard part is racing from side to
side because jumpers will come from both the left and right).
✦Gymnastics: Any position that lets you shoot the athletes coming directly
toward you is a good location. If circumstances allow you to get close to
the action, wide-angle lenses can give your images a different look.
✦Adventure water sports: I’m talking white-water rafting, kayaking, and
canoeing here. Generally, you have a choice of two good locations. The
first is downstream, just below a rapid, so that you can get the boaters
in action. The second is from a bridge, looking down on the river, which
gives you a nice alternate shot. Don’t be afraid to get in tight and com-
pose from the top of the boater’s head down to his or her paddle in the
water. It’s not necessary to show the entire boat.
✦Rock, alpine, and speed climbing: If possible, get on top of the rock
and shoot down on the climbers, or get on a ledge that’s level with a
point the climbers will reach during their ascent. If you’re on the ground
when they begin the climb, a wide-angle shot from the side and below
gives a usable image, and you can play with silhouettes if you want to
try something different. Also from ground level, you can try a telephoto
shot of the climber against the wall. For a speed climbing competition, a
longer telephoto setting gets you in tight and compresses the competi-
tors more closely together. I prefer to shoot speed climbing from the
side because it emphasizes the extreme body contortions the climbers
go through.
✦Extreme sports: Both straight on and profile shots provide good images
for many of these sports. For skateboarding, inline skating, and BMX
bike events, shorter focal lengths work well, depending on how close to
the event you can get. Wakeboarding calls for very long lenses, a mono-
pod, and a position on the riverbank that gives a good view of as many
jump points as possible.
✦Motor sports: These sports are among the fastest growing events from a
fan’s standpoint. Auto racing is one of the toughest photographic chal-
lenges, even with modern professional camera equipment. Those cars
are fast! Try to catch them on the curve when they’re moving a little bit
slower. This may also give you a three-quarter’s view of the car. Or, pick
a spot where you can get the cars coming at you. This type of action is
easier to capture. Fast moving race cars can also present a good oppor-
tunity for creative blur shots (more on this topic later). Use a modest
shutter speed (say 125th of a second) to keep the starter sharp as he or
she waves the flag to begin the race. If you do it right, the starter stays
sharp while the cars and flags are blurred. Other good opportunities
include shots at the starting line or in the pits. For motocross events,
where the motorcyclists are catching big air, you want to be located
some distance away from their take-off point. Side shots of the athletes
and bikes as they come even with your position are also good.
✦Horse racing/dressage: For horse racing, station yourself at the spot
where the track curves so that you can shoot the animals coming straight
toward you; then get three-quarter and profile shots as they round the
curve. For dressage, study a book on the desired movements and looks
that each animal should present. Be ready to shoot the horses head on
and in profile and three-quarter pose. 
201

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Swimming: Shots from head on and from the side are pretty much your
only choices here. Start by shooting head on and time your shot to catch
the swimmer rising up from the water. You might need an accessory
flash unit and a butane powered hair dryer for battling lens fogging.
Don’t underestimate just how difficult it is to keep your equipment in
working condition because of all the moisture and humidity in the air.
Keep extra packets of desiccant in your camera bag and a microfiber
cloth within easy reach. Try to get to the swim meet site at least a half
hour early so that your equipment has a chance to come up to room
temperature and humidity. Package your camera and lenses in sealable
plastic bags during this warm-up period so that condensation forms on
the bag, not the lenses.
Winter sports: a special case
Winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding present a special challenge
for the digital photographer because of the amount of contrast inherent in
snowy conditions. Such lighting conditions often fool your camera’s expo-
sure system. If your digital camera lets you shoot in RAW mode and capture
images as linear TIFF files (check your camera’s instruction manual to see
how), use that option. It gives you the maximum amount of information
when you’re editing the image later. You’ll be glad you did.
Generally, a good image occurs when the skier or snowboarder turns about
15 or 20 feet from your position (try to avoid the snow spray). Another
good shot is when the athlete becomes airborne. Be careful that you aren’t
so busy looking through the viewfinder that you lose track of the skier or
boarder coming right at you. (Don’t laugh; it happens.)
202
Increasing dynamic range
High-contrast situations, such as ski slopes, present
a special challenge for digital cameras. Because
sports photography frequently revolves around
frame-filling action with just one or two athletes, the
easiest way to deal with high-contrast lighting is to
use flash to balance the light between your subject
and the background.
 Metering: Take a meter reading off a midtone
(something equivalent to medium gray) and find
the correct exposure for the overall scene.
Then set your flash to output enough light so
that your subjects’ illumination matches the
background. (This tip probably applies only to
those with higher-end cameras and very pow-
erful flash units.)
 Filtration: Special low-contrast filters have
appeared on the market in the past few years.
Although sticking another piece of glass in
front of your high-quality lens risks degrading
image quality, a well-made filter can be worth
the investment. Photographs made with low-
contrast filters generally require a little extra
tweaking in an image-editing program (nothing
extreme), but the results can be well worth it.
 Linear TIFFs: If your camera offers a RAW
mode capable of producing what are called 
16-bit linear TIFF files, and if your image-editing
program can work in layers, then you have
another method of dealing with high-contrast
lighting. Just capture the image twice — once
as a linear TIFF (which will appear underex-
posed) and once as a regular TIFF. Copy the reg-
ular TIFF directly over the linear TIFF (Shift+drag
with the Move tool if you’re using Photoshop)
and then create a layer mask. Activate the layer
mask and then drag the gradient tool from top
to bottom.

Taking Your First Action Photo
I usually rely on the medium to longer zoom lenses plus an accessory flash.
Because these sports take place on snow-covered mountains, I try to travel
light and with my equipment balanced in waist pouches or equipment belts
rather than a camera bag. A camera backpack works well too, but makes it
harder to get at your equipment in a hurry. Having a flash available is very
important, because otherwise, you have to choose between overexposed
snow or an underexposed subject.
Taking Your First Action Photo
You’ve got all the background you need. Now, it’s time to put what you’ve
learned to work and take your first action photos. This section leads you
through the preparation and steps you’ll want to take.
Be prepared
As a would-be sports photographer, one of the most important things you
can do is become knowledgeable about the sports you want to shoot. The
most successful sports photographers are the ones who can anticipate the
next play or event and put themselves in position to trip the shutter in time
to record the moment.
Many times, you have decisions to make long before the action starts. Is
this a situation where you’re going to use the zoom on the camera and try
to react to what happens? Or are you picking a spot, prefocusing, and wait-
ing for action to reach that location? Both are valid methods, and most pho-
tographers alternate between them as the game goes on.
Whenever possible, sports shooters try to analyze the situation to see if
they can understand what will happen next. Third and long yardage or first
and 10 in football are good examples. In the former, a pass is likely, and in
the latter, a running play. You can follow the receiver on your side of the
field if you think a pass play is likely or key in on the quarterback to get a
shot of the pass or the pass rush. For the running play, you can key in on
the backfield and be ready to catch the hand-off and ensuing running play.
Setting your ISO speed
Being able to change the “film speed” or ISO (International Standards
Organization) rating of your camera on the fly is one of the great benefits
of owning a digital camera. Be sure to check your camera’s instructions to
see how to change the ISO setting.
When conditions permit, I always try to work at 100 or 200 ISO to get the
highest quality images. Most digital cameras are optimized to provide their
best quality at those settings. If I’m shooting outdoors under most daylight
conditions, a setting at 100 to 200 usually allows me an action-stopping
shutter speed of 1⁄500 of a second or higher, which is good for the majority of
sports. If I have to move indoors or if the sun is getting lower in the sky, I
ratchet the speed up to 400 ISO and use a flash unit if circumstances permit.
Being able to change ISOs whenever you want is a great help during uneven
lighting situations.
203

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Although my digital camera allows me to use ISO settings as high as 800 and
1600, I try to avoid these settings unless it’s the only way to keep shooting.
Images made at these ISOs tend to need a little more tweaking in an image
editor than lower ISO shots and also offer less margin for error when it
comes to exposure. Cameras vary and so do photographic tastes. Test
out your camera before taking your first action shots so that you can deter-
mine whether your camera’s ISO choices produce results that meet your
standards.
High ISO settings let you use faster shutter speeds, which means sharper
images, but higher ISO settings also produce noisier images. Noise is the
digital film version of conventional film’s grain. Still, a sharp, noisy image is
preferable to a noise-free, fuzzy one.
Understanding how to stop action
Today’s athletes are well trained, well conditioned, and well prepared. As a
result, they’re faster than ever. This means that, to freeze their movements,
you need to use either a fast shutter speed or an accessory flash unit.
Another consideration is the relationship between the direction in which
your subject is moving and your camera’s orientation. Here are some tips
to keep in mind:
✦If your subject is moving toward you, you can get by with a slower shut-
ter speed than if your subject is moving across your field of view. It’s
hard to say generally what a good minimum shutter speed is — because
the shutter speed needed to stop action varies from sport to sport — but
faster is always better.
✦As light levels drop, an accessory flash’s quick burst of light can freeze
action that a slow shutter speed might not. Whether or not you can use
flash tends to depend on the particular sport you’re shooting. I’ve never
had any problems shooting football or basketball with a flash unit.
Athletes such as tennis players tend to be more sensitive to flash pho-
tography, so I plan accordingly. When in doubt, check with the event
organizer to see whether a specific policy is in place or watch what other
photographers are doing. Many times, if you’re setting your flash for fill
lighting rather than as your main light source, the burst of light is brief
enough and low enough in intensity that the light won’t be a problem.
Keep in mind that you have to be within the effective range of your flash’s
output capability for it to do any good.
Short-duration shutter speeds can often be the key to stopping action.
The brief time that the shutter is open registers only an instant of motion.
Longer shutter speeds give your subject time to move farther or make
more movements while the image is being recorded, which results in
blurred photographs.
Generally, your choice is to use the fastest shutter speed possible. For many
prosumer digital cameras, this frequently means 1⁄1000 of a second. This speed
is fast enough to stop any human motion and will freeze many other ele-
ments of most sports.

Stopping action with slow shutter speeds
You can often stop action using a slower shutter speed, too. Indeed, the
effects may be more realistic than the “frozen statue” look you get when
sports participants are stopped dead in their tracks. Here are some tips for
stopping action at slower shutter speeds:
✦Look for momentary pauses. Many times, a sport has a moment of peak
action where the action hesitates before movement returns. Think of
jumpers on the ascent. At the top of their leap, there’s a moment of
stasis where they hang in space before dropping back down, as shown
in Figure 11-3. If you’re forced to shoot at too low a shutter speed, try to
time your shot for that moment. Another example is a tennis player just
after tossing the ball to serve. If the server uses a high toss, he or she
has to wait for the ball to drop before hitting it. The tennis player up at
the net is another example. Although the racket and ball may be moving
very quickly, the athlete’s body usually isn’t traveling very far or fast.
✦Try to shoot the action moving directly toward the camera. Athletes
and machines moving toward the camera require a slower shutter speed
and faster autofocus to freeze motion than those moving laterally across
the camera’s field of view.
✦Concentrate. Sometimes, the most dramatic image is in the concentra-
tion of the athlete the moment before he or she begins play. Think of the
pitcher looking to the catcher for a sign, or a tennis player just before
serving the ball. Another example is the linebacker poised for the snap
of the ball before rushing the quarterback. There’s also the free-throw
shooter pausing a moment before shooting.
✦Find action in nonaction moments. Another shot to look for is one that
shows the price the athlete pays for his or her sport. This can be foot-
ball players on the bench with steam rising off their heads, or a spent
distance runner leaning on a teammate at the end of a race. A shot of a
distraught athlete being consoled by a fellow athlete is a classic sports
photograph. Also watch for the emotions of the fans or cheerleaders.
205
Controlling shutter speed
How do you get your camera to use a short shutter
speed to stop action? You may have to check your
camera’s instruction manual to find the exact con-
trols, but here are the options you should look for:
 Shutter priority mode: In shutter priority mode,
you can choose the exact shutter speed you
want to use (such as 1⁄500 or 1⁄1000 second), and the
camera’s automatic exposure control will
choose the f-stop lens setting appropriate for
that shutter speed. Keep in mind that, depend-
ing on the lighting conditions, you may not be
able to use the very shortest shutter speeds at
all. In dim light, for example, your camera may
not be able to take a photo at any shutter speed
shorter than 1⁄250 or 1⁄125 second because there
simply isn’t enough light.
 Manual shutter speed/exposure settings: Your
camera may let you set both shutter speed and
f-stop manually. If you do that, it’s up to you to
interpret your camera’s light meter to provide
the correct combination of shutter speed and
f-stop for a proper exposure.

Panning
Panning (moving the camera horizontally in the same direction of motion as
your subject) is a valuable technique that should be part of every serious
sports photographer’s repertoire. This procedure gives you the best of both
worlds: freezing the important part of the scene while blurring the back-
ground to show the furious motion of the moment.
The idea behind the technique is to use a slower shutter speed while follow-
ing a runner or vehicle laterally with the camera. The result is a subject
that’s in relatively sharp focus while the background is blurred. 
Here’s how to put panning to use:
1. Select a moderately slow shutter speed to give yourself a long enough
stretch of time for the lateral movement of the camera to register, but
not so long as to create overall blurriness from camera shake. 
Don’t you just love precise directions like this? But seriously, if I could
give you exact numbers, your camera would already be programmed to
Figure 11-3:

the action at
its peak.
206

Book I

Photography
Taking Your First Action Photo
do it for you. There’s no exact recommendation; you have to experiment
to see what works best for you. The speed will vary from sport to sport
as well. Start out by trying something in the 1⁄45 of a second to 1⁄60 of a
second for running humans. Work your way to around 1⁄350 of a second for
motor sports and see how this works. 
2. Begin following your subject with the camera before tripping the
shutter.
You want a smooth lateral motion here, so beginning the move first and
then shooting helps you do that. Your panning movement is steadier if
you limit your movement to your waist and hips while keeping your feet
planted and your knees together. This also helps reduce camera shake.
Also make sure to keep your elbows braced against your body to help
turn yourself into a human monopod. Most people find that using an
actual monopod generally doesn’t work very well, but for a few, it works.
If circumstances permit, a tripod with a tripod panning head (one that
allows the tilt and yaw controls to be locked while the panning direction
swings free) can make for a smoother pan. Certainly a photographer
who’s just starting to experiment with the panning technique may find
that a tripod makes things easier.
3. Trip the shutter as gently as possible.
You’re trying to avoid a downward snap in your movement. The old
cliché is to squeeze the shutter, not press it.
4. Continue your lateral panning movement for a second or so after the
shutter has closed.
This is a case where proper follow-through is just as important for the
photographer as it is for the athlete.
5. Repeat this process at least a half dozen times or more.
It seldom works perfectly the first time. (It’s okay; you’re not paying for
film here.) Good panning is something you have to work at. Don’t give
up on the technique if your first few attempts don’t pan out. (Sorry, just
couldn’t resist the pun!)
This technique gives you dramatic images that accurately convey the sense
of motion the sport involves. Sometimes, the photograph of the athlete flying
through the air or running down the track with the background blurred does
a better job of conveying the speed of the event than a moment of frozen
action.
Action approaching the camera
Action approaching the camera is also more dramatic because the camera
can maintain eye contact with the athlete or create a sense of power from
the approaching machine coming right at the viewer.
Because these images produce such drama, it’s important to work on cap-
turing them well. Mastering this aspect of sports shooting will do much to
improve your sports photography. Help your camera’s autofocus system
work its best by prefocusing on a spot a few feet ahead of where you hope to
take the picture. Lock on to the approaching athlete and give your camera a
207

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
chance to acquire the athlete and bring its autofocus up to speed. If you’re
working with a digital SLR with a zoom lens, you can give yourself more time
and distance for the shot by acquiring your subject at the extreme telephoto
end of its range and continuing to shoot while racking the zoom through its
full range to its widest setting.
Circumstances don’t always permit you to get this shot. Still, photography
is about putting yourself in a position to give yourself the best possible
chance to catch the action. If you couple that with shooting a large number
of images, you can increase the likelihood of success.
Using blur creatively
In some circumstances, you just don’t have enough light or a fast enough
lens to set the shutter speed as high as you would like. Stopping action
can be a good photographic technique when you’re covering sports, but it’s
certainly not the only one. When circumstances don’t allow you to freeze
motion or when you want to create something that looks different from
what everyone else is doing, deliberately trying to blur your image can
create something special. Figure 11-4 shows a picture in which the blurring
(especially of the ball) creates a photo that says “action!” more clearly than
any frozen-in-time photo.

Photography
Taking the Picture
To create a successful photograph, it’s important for the key elements of the
image to be in focus, not necessarily every single part of it. Your subjects’
eyes and face need to be in focus. If their body or hands or feet are blurred,
then that shows just how fast they’re actually moving. Some sports, such as
tennis, are easy. There’s a pretty forgiving difference between the shutter
speed you need to freeze the athlete’s body and the speed necessary to
freeze the moving tennis racket or ball. The same goes for hockey because
the player’s stick and the puck blur quite easily at shutter speeds that com-
fortably freeze the player. 
When successful, this kind of image can actually be more dramatic than
freezing action. Here’s how to try this technique.
1. The first step is figuring out what shutter speed is slow enough to blur
the faster moving parts of the body, while also being fast enough to
freeze the face. 
This varies from sport to sport, so be prepared to experiment. 
2. The second part of the process is timing your shot to coincide with a
moment of peak action, such as the athlete at the top of his or her leap. 
Many sports call for the athlete’s head to stay still while the rest of the
body explodes in action (think of a golf swing where the player’s head
stays down through the entire stroke). Other sports require the head to
travel through a range of movement as the athlete strokes through the
ball (“keep your eye on the ball”). For these sports, the head eventually
stops as the athlete follows through to complete the stroke. It’s at the
end of this follow-through where the athlete’s body movement is frozen,
although the ball or puck and stick or racket may still be moving.
Once you get the hang of using blur creatively, you’ve added a powerful tool
to your photographic arsenal. The essence of many sports is the athlete’s
ability to move as fast as possible. Blurred hands, feet, limbs, and wheels
convey the speed of modern athletes and machines in a way that frozen 
figures can’t. Try to experiment with creative uses of blur each time you’re
on a shoot. Just manage it the way most of us do: Start out working for an
image you know gets the job done. After you’ve succeeded in getting your
“money” shot, start working for something a little more creative. This is the
time to try for the panning or creative blur photos.
Taking the Picture
After you’ve chosen your shutter speed, taken a strategic position, and
know what kinds of opportunities may be coming your way (literally!), it’s
time to take the picture. Watch the action closely, frame the image in your
viewfinder, and snap away.
Capturing great sports moments
As you shoot, keep some simple concepts in mind. For example, here are
some things to look for in a great sports image:
209

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Full extension: The athlete at the top of a leap or in full stride represents
one example of the decisive moment in sports photography. 
✦The coiled spring: The moment before release when muscles are tense
and the body is coiled represents another key moment in sports. This
image shows the athlete just before he or she explodes into action.
Think of the shot put thrower just before release, the shot still pressed
into the chin, or the baseball pitcher, arm reared back ready to reverse
direction and fire the ball at the batter.
✦Emotion: It doesn’t even need to be a good action shot. Catch the ath-
lete or fan in a moment of extreme emotion, and you’ve gotten a memo-
rable image. Watch the fans, watch the coaches, and watch the athletes
watching the other athletes. There’s more to sports than just sports.
Most sporting events are carnivals of colors, patterns, and personalities.
They provide a wealth of photographic opportunities not limited to just the
playing field. Enthusiastic photographers, curious about the world around
them and with an eye to more than just the game, can produce great sports
photos no matter what camera they’re using.
Setting up for predictable action
Having an understanding of the sport you’re photographing can put you in a
position to take advantage of your ability to predict impending action. Here
are a couple of ways to use that ability:
✦Prefocusing: Sometimes an athlete needs to reach a specific location as
part of a play. If I’m photographing a baseball or softball game, and a
runner makes it to third, I swing my tripod-mounted camera to cover
home and prefocus on home plate. I still follow the action with my hand-
held camera, but I also position myself so that I can quickly fire the
second camera for a shot of a runner sliding home. Prefocusing on the
forward end of the basketball rim is another example. You’re now ready
to get a shot of the center leaping for a rebound.
✦Zone focusing: This technique takes advantage of the depth of field that
comes with using a smaller lens opening. (In simple terms, the smaller
the lens opening, the greater the range of sharp focus from one point to
another on a line from the lens.) The idea here is to choose a lens open-
ing that’s small enough to create a zone of sharp focus. The zone should
be deep enough to give you about a 5-foot range where everything is in
focus. Then instead of worrying about focusing, you can just concen-
trate on what happens in that zone and shoot as appropriate. Zone
focusing works well on a sport such as basketball, where you know you
can expect action to take place in a location about 5 to 10 feet from the
basket. Using an external flash unit (which many point-and-shoot digital
cameras can do) should enable you to shoot at f/5.6 or f/8, which gives
you that 5-foot range or greater. In Figure 11-5, the focus was set ahead
of time for the ramp, so when the athlete spun around, the camera was
already set for the picture.
Shooting action sequences
Sometimes, you need to do more than just capture one good shot of sports
action. You need to get the entire sequence of movements that make up an
entire run or the execution of a particular move or trick.
210

Book I
Chapter 11
Sports and Action
Photography
Taking the Picture
Pros get these sequences by using high-speed motor drive cameras that
may capture as many as eight or ten pictures per second (usually expressed
in frames per second, or fps). Although one or two prosumer-level digital
cameras are capable of high-speed motor driven photography, most are
only good for about three frames per second at best. Even the Canon D30
that I use most of the time is good only for this same slow speed, and that’s
only if I use a fast enough shutter speed. (A slow shutter speed means the
camera has to wait longer before taking the next shot. So a shutter speed of
say, 1⁄1000 of a second, lets the motor drive function more efficiently than, say,
a shutter speed of 1⁄60 of a second.)
Even with a limited motor drive capability, a photographer can still create
effective photo sequences. Once again, a little planning and foresight can
help you get the best possible results. If you can predict the path the ath-
lete is going to take, then you can better follow that path with your camera.
Another thing you can do is back out your composition a little to give you
some margin for error. You don’t want to have a great sequence of shots
with your subject ruining it by drifting in and out of the frame.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Here are some tips for getting good action sequences:
✦Visualize the path you expect your subject to travel.
✦Prefocus on the point where you expect to start shooting.
✦Set the fastest shutter speed you can to give your motor drive the best
possible chance of advancing at its best speed.
✦Compose your shot to give your subject some room to move within the
frame.
✦Shoot several sequences to make sure you get at least one usable
sequence. Remember that you’re trying to get four or five good shots
in a row, not just one, so it becomes that much harder to be sure that
they’re all in focus and well composed. Take lots of shots.
Don’t expect to get a good sequence on your first attempt. This is another
one of those techniques that you need to practice beforehand. You’re trying
to understand how your camera works in this kind of situation and deter-
mine whether you can tweak your gear to perform better. Some cameras
may require you to drop down to a lower resolution in order to shoot fast
enough to get a good sequence of images. Because you’re trying to get mul-
tiple images, the loss of resolution may not be as bad as you think. After all,
you’ll have the group of images to take the place of one shot.
Some digital cameras don’t offer a continuous shooting capability. Others
may offer it only at a lower resolution setting than you’re really comfortable
using. Just because you can’t blaze away like the pros, doesn’t mean you
can’t tell a multiple-picture story of a sports event.
A good sequence of photographs tells a story. If you’re shooting an event
where an athlete makes more than one run or attempt (long jumpers get six
tries for instance), work on getting the sequence you want by shooting a dif-
ferent aspect of each attempt. Be careful how you identify the finished result
though. There’s nothing wrong with showing how each element of the jump
works through a sequence of images, but representing it as the individual
elements of one jump is the kind of thing that gets photographers in trouble.
Capturing the fans
When I feel I have a good set of strong action images, I like to concentrate
on getting reaction shots from the fans. Athletes achieve at least some
release through their physical exertion, but fans have no such outlet. Find
someone who seems to be particularly expressive and shoot that person
through the course of a particularly tense phase of the competition. Use a
longer focal length to isolate the fan and to avoid attracting attention to
your photography.

aking pictures while traveling can be the most rewarding long-term bene-
fit of a trip. While memories of a particular location may fade as the years
go by, the images that you created will still be there to remind you of a spe-
cial time in your life. Plus, let’s face it: Photography is fun! Knowing that
you’ve taken a good picture of that special location gives you a particularly
satisfying feeling. Sometimes, lasting friendships can be made during a trip,
and being able to send your new friends pictures of the time you shared
together can help cement your friendship.
If you’ve traveled with a film camera in the past, you’ll find that vacationing
with a digital camera offers some terrific advantages over using traditional
picture-taking tools. Digital cameras can be smaller and lighter than their
film counterparts, so they take up a lot less space in your luggage. They have
no film that airport security X-ray cameras can damage. As you take photos,
you can check them using your digital camera’s built-in LCD screen.
This chapter offers advice to aspiring photographers who are intimidated
by the idea of trying to take good pictures in unfamiliar surroundings.
Choosing Equipment
A photographer on the road needs a selection of gear that’s versatile enough
to handle the unexpected but doesn’t need to be burdened like a Sherpa on
an Everest expedition. Carefully considering which key pieces of equipment
to take — and which to leave behind — can make the trip less stressful and
more productive.
Selecting a camera for your needs
Choosing a camera to use while traveling is an important decision, one 
that you may have already made long before your trip. After all, most of us
are unable to buy a camera specifically for a vacation. You should keep a
camera’s travel photography capabilities in mind whenever you purchase a
digital model. A huge variety of digital choices are out there today, offering
a tremendous range of capabilities. Pros may use digital camera backs for
medium-format cameras or digital SLRs with interchangeable lenses,
whereas serious amateurs have tons of less expensive options. Key deci-
sions involve lens versatility (for more options while taking pictures), file
size (more megapixels equal bigger pictures), and the amount of control the
camera gives you over shooting decisions.
213

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Although the average consumer may never see one, the high-end digital
camera is interesting nonetheless. Medium-format cameras (the ones that
take the 21⁄4-inch rolls of paper-backed film) often have interchangeable
backs that hold the film. You can sometimes replace the back with a compo-
nent that has a digital-imaging sensor instead of film, bringing digital pho-
tography capabilities to roll-film cameras that weren’t originally designed
for digital output. Digital SLRs (single-lens reflexes) are cameras that usually
allow you to view through an optical viewfinder using the same lens that
takes the picture.
When purchasing a camera, most of your decisions involve what kind of
photographer you are and what kind of travel pictures you expect to take,
as the following sections make clear. No matter which category you fall into,
your digital camera should have the basic features that you need to make a
broad range of travel photography easy and carefree.
Professional photographers
Pros like to be ready for anything, even when they’re not on the clock. You
never know when a quick shot that’s taken while on vacation can turn into a
salable image. If you’re a professional photographer, look for the following
items:
✦Compatibility of a digital system with your current film camera’s inter-
changeable lens system, if possible. (Right now this means Canon,
Nikon, Fuji in Nikon mount, or maybe Contax.)
✦A choice of camera bodies offering 4- to 8-megapixel sensors, rapid-
sequence shooting ability, and other features, depending on your shoot-
ing needs. Travel photography can sometimes be as fast-paced as sports
shooting and can require high-resolution images for reproduction.
✦A choice of flash units and accessories, such as those shown in Figure
12-1, to meet your shooting needs. A professional system needs to be
flexible enough to accommodate all the gadgets that you need for top-
of-the-line travel photography.
Serious amateurs
The best serious amateur photographers are often professionals in every
aspect except monetary reward. They frequently spend a lot on their hobby
and may even be looking at the same systems that are desired by pros.
Their needs include the following:
✦A higher-resolution (3- to 6-megapixel) camera with a large-capacity
memory (with the ability to accept interchangeable memory cards).
These features enable you to grab travel photos that are suitable for
printing at large sizes, which you can then display on the wall.
✦Extreme-zoom lens capabilities, preferably with a 10x range. This range is
ideal for reaching out and grabbing a small detail from a panoramic scene.
✦Add-on accessory lenses to extend a zoom’s capability even further.
✦Rapid-shooting capability to allow taking pictures quickly at festivals or
other fast-moving travel experiences. (The running of the bulls at
Pamplona comes to mind!)

Enthusiastic amateurs
Amateur photo enthusiasts love photography but also have other interests —
such as travel! With more limitations on their budgets, they need top-quality
prosumer cameras. These cameras are aimed at consumers but have features
that please advanced photographers. These include features are as follows:
✦A medium- to high-resolution (2- to 4-megapixel) camera with decent
capacity memory (with the ability to accept interchangeable memory
cards). These cameras enable you to print vacation snapshots in sizes
as large as 8 x 10 inches.
✦A versatile-zoom lens (between 3x and 10x) for taking close-up shots of
distant scenic features or for capturing locals being themselves.
✦Add-on accessory lenses to extend range even further or to widen the
view to take in monuments, castles, or cathedrals that are penned in by
their surroundings.

Vacationers who simply want to take good photos
You know who you are: You want pictures that are sharp and clear, colorful,
and good enough to make a batch of 4-x-6-inch prints of your best shots. You
like digital photography and want to capture some travel memories, but you
can’t spend a huge amount for your equipment. These photographers need
the following:
✦Low- to medium-resolution (1- to 3-megapixel) cameras with the ability
to accept interchangeable memory cards
✦A versatile-zoom lens, with at least a 3x zoom capability
Choosing key camera features
Regardless of what kind of travel photographer you are, look for the follow-
ing key features in a camera:
✦Optical zoom range: A powerful zoom enables you to compose your
image carefully and cover a lot of photographic territory on your travel
treks.
✦Interchangeable memory cards: Some cameras try to get by with just
built-in memory. When the memory is full, you either stop shooting or
delete images, and neither is a good option during a once-in-a-lifetime
vacation. The ability to change cards enables you to just keep shooting.
✦Sufficient megapixels: The more megapixels, the better the shot. This is
true for the following reasons:
• Higher resolution (more megapixels) allows larger prints of your
prized vacation shots.
• Higher resolution lets you crop down to a smaller view of that monu-
ment that you just couldn’t get close enough to and still get a good-
quality print.
✦Interchangeable lenses: These days, most affordable digital cameras
don’t use interchangeable lenses. The few that do give a photographer a
wide range of choices for high-quality travel photography. Being able to
select from a range of different focal lengths, plus being able to control
depth of field (the range of image sharpness as it appears throughout
the photograph), gives the photographer tremendous power over the
photographic image. Sometimes, manufacturers also offer add-on lenses
for noninterchangeable-lens cameras.
Think about taking a second camera along with you, particularly if this is
more than just a run-of-the-mill vacation. A small, inexpensive digital camera
may not cost much, but if the primary camera fails, your backup camera
may be worth its weight in gold, photographically. Shop for or borrow one
that uses the same type of batteries and storage media as your primary
camera, if possible. The extra camera can also entice a spouse or child into
sharing your love of photography. Encourage other family members to
shoot their own photos on the trip.

Choosing lenses for travel
Look at your camera’s built-in capabilities, including the range of magnifica-
tions that are available from your zoom, as well as the ability to add supple-
mentary telephoto, wide-angle, or close-up lenses. Travel photographers
need the following basic lens capabilities:
✦Wide-angle: Being able to fit more into a picture comes in handy when
you’re shooting scenics and architecture, like the image that’s shown in
Figure 12-2.
✦Telephoto: Capturing native wildlife or sports shots without getting
dangerously close is an invaluable capability.
✦Macro: Getting close-ups of native insects, signs, or documents can be
rewarding.
With at least some capabilities in each of these ranges, you can shoot a
broad selection of travel photos without having to physically move closer
to or farther away from your subject.
Considering a tripod
A tripod is a three-legged stand that’s designed to hold your camera steady.
Although a tripod may be a little cumbersome to carry along on a trip, this
camera support can do several things for you. A tripod is great for holding
the camera steady if you are using slower shutter speeds in dim light or
using a telephoto lens. If your camera has a timer feature, you can use a
tripod to get yourself in the picture.

A tripod definitely leads to better pictures, but only if you use it. If you find
the idea of lugging one around too much of a bother during your vacation,
plan on using a different tool, such as a beanbag, which I discuss in Chapter 6
of Book I. It’s okay — you’re on vacation!
Choosing an electronic flash
Although most digital cameras have some sort of built-in flash capability,
these flashes are usually good only for a range of about 8 feet, which isn’t
always enough. Because available light (more commonly known as available
darkness) is undependable, the traveling photographer should consider car-
rying an accessory flash unit.
Accessory flash units do more than just provide extra light when it’s too
dark to shoot without it. The following are reasons why an extra flash can
be particularly helpful for travel photography:
✦Using fill flash: If you’re planning to shoot a companion in partial shade
or wearing a ball cap, an accessory flash can help you clean up the
shadows. Because the supplemental light isn’t trying to illuminate the
whole scene, filling can be accomplished by smaller, less powerful flash
units (such as the camera’s built-in flash) or even by a reflective sur-
face. A 3-x-3-inch piece of white foam board or a silver-coated auto sun-
shield, which is held by someone to reflect the sunlight into the area
where the sunlight can’t reach, provides a nicely lit photo, as shown in
Figure 12-3.
✦Painting with light: If part of your trip takes you into a dark place, such
as a 13th-century church that doesn’t have spotlights inside, an acces-
sory flash can help. You can use the photo technique called painting with
light. I discuss this technique, oddly enough, in the section “Painting with
light,” later in this chapter.
✦Shooting macro/close-up pictures: To take close-up shots of typical
local jewelry, markers, or insects, you need to provide a lot of light to
get enough image sharpness to create a good-looking image.
Many higher-end digital cameras offer some method of triggering an acces-
sory flash unit, either by a cable connection or via a hot shoe (the connec-
tion that’s found on the top of many digital cameras that holds the flash
and provides electrical contact with the camera). Many consumer-priced
digital cameras, however, offer no such provision. If you have a camera
without the means for adding an additional flash, a slaved flash that is
specifically designed for digital cameras may be your answer. (A slaved
flash has a built-in light sensor that triggers the slaved flash when your
camera’s flash fires.)
Accessory lighting is covered more thoroughly in Chapter 6 of Book I.

Choosing Equipment
Selecting a camera bag
Depending on the size of a digital camera and the accessories that accom-
pany it, a camera bag or pouch may be a necessity. For just the basics — a
small camera, extra batteries and memory cards, and a lens cleaning cloth —
a simple fanny pack can do the job and leave room for hotel keys, money, and
identification. If you’re a more serious photographer who is carrying a larger
Figure 12-3:

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR, you need more space.
Although a larger camera bag may be the answer, the active traveler should
consider the following factors:
✦Size: Your camera bag should be roomy enough to hold your basic
camera setup and leave some room for an extra piece of gear or two
that you’ll be glad you have when you’re hundreds or thousands of
miles from home.
✦Flexibility: An ideal bag includes multiple compartments that can be
reconfigured (via hook-and-loop tape) so that you can adapt the bag to
the different configurations of the camera outfit that you may need. Your
equipment needs often vary from place to place on vacation. At one des-
tination, you may need easy access to your extra flash unit. At another,
you’ll want to be able to grab your add-on wide-angle lens quickly.
✦Sturdy strap: Much travel is done on the run. A travel-friendly bag has
a main strap that runs around the sides and bottom of bag and that’s
securely stitched, not grommetted into the fabric. (Don’t underestimate
the importance of this one, folks!)
✦Toughness: To stand up to the rigors of travel, a bag should be made of
rip-stop nylon or canvas. If you’re really into leather though, you don’t
have to rule this material out — if the bag is well constructed.
✦Security and convenience: The bag should offer multiple methods of
closing. A good bag usually offers a fast method of closing (frequently
via hook-and-loop tape or clasps) and a more secure method of closure
(zippers or clips) that takes more effort to open and close but makes
accidental opening less likely.
✦Protection from the elements: The bag needs a top flap that closes
over the main compartment in such a way that, if the bag is hit by rain,
the water is channeled down the bag’s sides. Water shouldn’t be able to
seep through a zipper channel or closure point, as can be the case with
the bag that’s shown in Figure 12-4. Although the zippered closure on
this leather bag looks secure, it does little to protect the sensitive digital
camera equipment inside from rain.

Choosing Equipment
At some point, you can cross over the line that divides vacation photogra-
pher from pack mule. Do a dry run with all your gear before leaving. Now
ask yourself whether you’re comfortable with the idea of lugging that stuff
around with you on vacation. The only right answer to that question is the
one that satisfies you.
Keeping your camera powered
Modern cameras use batteries like there’s no tomorrow, particularly digital
cameras with their power-draining LCD screens and built-in flashes. That’s
not much of a burden when you’re shooting close to home. But if you’re
traveling — far from AC power or a ready source for batteries — power is a
prime consideration. If you plan to shoot pictures for more than a couple of
hours, it’s a good idea to take along spare batteries.
Predicting battery life is a bigger challenge than taking good pictures, simply
because the figure varies depending on your particular camera, how often
you review your shots on the LCD screen, how many pictures you take, what
kind of media you’re using, how much you use your internal flash, what type
of batteries you’re using, and what the temperature is (batteries drain faster
in the cold). If you’re careful with the LCD screen and flash and keep the
camera warm, four AA batteries could last from 30 to 80 shots, depending on
the camera.
Use the following tips to maximize your battery life when on vacation:
✦Make short reviews: Most digital cameras let you set how long the LCD
stays on for review after a shot is taken. Choose the shortest setting. You
can always review an individual shot for a longer period if necessary.
✦Flash with care: Built-in flash units reduce battery life by half. Use an
accessory flash if possible.
✦Choose batteries wisely: AA lithium batteries tend to last longer than
other battery types, so if you use these, you can extend the life of your
shooting session before replacements are necessary. Lithium batteries
also handle cold weather better. You should always carry at least one
set of extra AA batteries (more if you shoot a lot).
If you’re traveling in your home country, you probably already know how
easy or difficult it is to feed your camera, but even here in the United States,
not every type of battery can be found in the “boonies.” If your camera
requires one of the less common types, your digital camera can become a
paperweight before your trip is half over.
If your camera uses AA or AAA batteries, rechargeable batteries are the
best answer (with an extra set of backups) for each device that you bring
that needs them. Choose nickel metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batter-
ies if you can because they have more power, are safer for the environment,
and have several technical advantages over other types. If your camera
doesn’t use a common battery type, bring lots more batteries than you
think you’ll need. Remember, if you have to buy batteries at a popular
tourist destination, expect to pay a lot more than you would at home.
221

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
Of course, rechargeable batteries need to be recharged. If you’re going over-
seas, make sure that you have the proper adapters for the country that
you’re visiting. Don’t automatically assume that you will find plenty of out-
lets, either. I recently went on a Bahamas cruise and found that our state-
room had only one outlet. Because I had come prepared with a power strip,
we could still plug in my laptop, battery chargers, and fan as well as my
wife’s hair dryer and curling iron. Without such foresight . . . well, my wife
and I would surely have ended up fighting over a single outlet.
Another option, especially for those who are headed for a week or two
in the backcountry, is a solar-powered battery charger from ICP Solar
Technologies (www.icpsolar.com). This unit can charge four AA batteries
in 4 hours or so, depending on how bright the day is. (Good luck if you’re
hiking in the Pacific Northwest.) The hard part may be finding a way to keep
the device pointed toward the sun while you’re backpacking through the
forest. You may also want to consider whether carrying the unit’s weight
(1.3 pounds) in extra batteries would be more efficient.
Other useful devices
Gizmos and gadgets. Many of these items don’t fall into any particular type
of category, except that they do something useful. Some of the most popu-
lar photo widgets are as follows:
✦Cleaning kit: A cleaning kit includes the following items:
• Microfiber cleaning cloth: Useful for keeping lenses and bodies
clean.
• Blower brush: Use this first, and blow off any dust or small particles.
• Silica packets: These soak up moisture that gets into your camera
bag. Keep the packets in a plastic freezer bag that can double as a
camera raincoat in bad weather.
✦Rain poncho: I always keep a cheap plastic rain poncho in my camera
bag, along with a better rain poncho in my car. Add to that a supply of
plastic bags of various sizes and some artist’s tape that’s easy to apply
and remove from the camera.
Make a raincoat for your camera from a plastic freezer bag. Draw the
end of the bag over the camera’s lens barrel, and cut a hole that’s large
enough for the barrel to shoot through. Wrap the artist’s tape around 
the end of the barrel and bag to hold the bag in place, and you’ve got a
low-cost rain poncho for the camera. Thread the camera strap through
the end of the bag that opens, and press as much of the seal together as
possible. If it’s hard to see through the viewfinder, turn the LCD on and
use that to compose the photo. Figure 12-5 shows what this camera rain-
coat looks like — sure, it’s funny-looking, but I’ve shot some of my best
images from the Alaskan rainforest in humid downpours with this setup.
✦Towel: It’s a good idea to carry some paper towels so that you can
towel off any moisture that gets inside the freezer bag. Toss a silica
packet or two in with the camera before closing the bag to help keep the
inside dry. You should also have something to dry your hands with so
that you’re not touching the camera with wet hands. A good choice here
is a Pack Towel, which is a lightweight towel that dries quickly and
that’s sold in many department stores’ camping sections.
222

Book I

Choosing Equipment
✦A pencil eraser: Sometimes a thin film of corrosion builds up on the
battery and terminal contacts. The cure for this one is to take a pencil
and gently rub both the battery and terminal contacts with the eraser.
Then reinsert the batteries, making sure that they’re right side up.
✦Polypro gloves: Several outdoor clothing companies make lightweight
gloves out of polypropylene or some brand-name material, such as
Capilene or Thermax. Outdoors enthusiasts prize these synthetic mate-
rials because they “wick” (transfer) moisture away from the skin to the
outside of the material, making your hands seem warmer because the
skin stays dry. Wearing a pair of these gloves in damp conditions can
help keep your hands dry. When you need to touch the camera, pull a
glove off, and you have a dry hand to work with.
✦Artist’s or masking tape: If the conditions are both dusty and windy,
protecting the camera can be vital and difficult. Fine-grit sand or dust
can blow inside the camera’s seals and foul the internal mechanisms.
The same plastic bag technique that I described in a preceding bullet is
good, but consider taping as much of the bag end as possible shut to
get the best seal.
If you’re traveling abroad and want to be sure that you aren’t hassled on your
return, visit a U.S. customs office and ask for a Certificate of Registration
(Form CF4457). You have to bring your gear to the customs office, where they
can confirm your gear and stamp the form. Having this form guarantees that
you won’t be asked to pay a duty on your gear. Find the location of your near-
est customs office at www.customs.ustreas.gov. Most travelers skip this step
and do just fine, but if you have new gear and are going somewhere known for
electronics, filling out the form can be a good idea.

Getting Ready to Go on the Road
You won’t like surprises after you leave home and begin taking pictures.
One key to successful travel photography is making as many preparations
as you can ahead of time so that you can be organized and confident when
you begin capturing memories. Use the following checklist of things to do
before you leave home:
✦Create a packing list: As you prepare for the trip, put together a pack-
ing list for the photographic gear. Plan a dry run to make sure that
everything fits in the camera bag or case that you’re using.
✦Carry your camera onboard: All but the cheapest camera equipment
should be included with your carry-on luggage. If you’re taking more
than just a basic digital camera and memory cards, make sure that the
camera bag is small enough to meet carry-on space limits. Record serial
numbers for pieces of equipment that have them, and have a packing
list in a separate bag in case the camera bag gets lost or stolen. Check
with your insurance company to see whether camera equipment is cov-
ered under your policy. If it isn’t, determine whether you can add a rider
for the trip.
✦Have some in-flight reading: How familiar are you with your camera
and accessories? It’s a good idea to dig out the instruction manuals and
pack them in your carry-on bag so that you can reacquaint yourself with
some of your camera’s more esoteric features.
Meeting Your Storage Requirements
Just like a film camera, your digital camera needs a steady supply of (digital)
film, like that shown in Figure 12-6. Due to the newness of the technology
(particularly overseas and in Third World countries), photographers need
to make specific plans to ensure that they have enough memory capacity
for the trip.

Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
Consider the following items when bulking up your storage for a trip:
✦Have enough memory: Can you get an entire vacation’s worth of pic-
tures with your current supply of memory? Remember, you tend to shoot
a lot more while traveling. If you don’t think you’re going to have enough
capacity, consider whether you need to buy more. Alternatively, you 
can carry a laptop computer (if you have one) so that you can transfer
images and free memory each night. (Test this process before you go to
make sure that you have what you need to transfer images.)
✦Try a portable hard drive: In between a pocketful of memory cards and
a notebook computer are portable hard drives. These drives can accept
CompactFlash cards and other types of removable storage with the
proper adapter (floppy disk users are out of luck). For about $200, far
less than a laptop, you can get a portable drive with several gigabytes of
storage space for fewer dollars per byte than a CompactFlash card. If
you go this route, try to acquire the device a couple of weeks before the
trip so that you have time to make sure that you can operate it properly.
Even with all the extra memory cards or a portable hard drive, you’re still
carrying less than the equivalent in number of shots’ worth of film.
Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
If you’ve prepared well, you’ll be ready to take great pictures when you reach
your destination. This section tells you about some of the most popular
types of travel photography and provides tips on getting the best shots.
Shooting scenics
Scenic photos are high on the list of pictures that people try to bring back
from their travels. After all, you have to prove that you went someplace
nice, don’t you? Follow these tips to shoot great scenics:
✦Don’t hurry. The effort to record a site’s beauty all too often results in
quick snapshots that are hurriedly snatched while with a tour group or
during a sightseeing drive. Some places are spectacular enough that this
approach works; most of the time, it’s hit or miss.
✦Understand that not all light is created equal. The best light of the day
occurs when the sun is low in the sky. Early-morning and late-evening
sunlight produce dramatic shadows and rich warm colors, as the sun’s
light is more red/orange than at any other time of the day. If a site on your
trip is particularly important, plan on being there during the “golden”
hours, as photographers call them. Try to do a reconnaissance of the
location a day or two beforehand so that you can see whether the sun
rises or sets behind what you’re shooting.
When the sun is rising or setting behind the scene, it creates the oppor-
tunity for a dramatic backlight silhouette. This is a difficult exposure sit-
uation because the camera is pointing directly into the sun. Beware of
the additional risk for the photographer, who must be careful not to
stare directly into the sun.
✦Try taking silhouettes. For a good, solid black silhouette of a building,
structure, landscape feature, or person, the camera should be set about
225

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
two f-stops smaller than what the light meter indicates for the main
scene. Your goal here is a bright, orange-red sun (the most dramatic
kind). Depending on your camera, you can either change aperture set-
tings directly or use the exposure-compensation dial to get the exposure
that you need. Take several shots at one f-stop increment to make sure
that you have a good exposure, like the one that’s shown in Figure 12-7.
✦Keep the camera steady. It’s best to have the camera mounted on a
tripod while doing scenics. The added stability reduces the effects of
camera shake and allows a slower shutter speed. Reducing the shutter
speed enables you to use a smaller aperture (larger f-stop number),
which creates greater overall depth of field for the sharpest possible
picture. If a tripod isn’t available, try to find something sturdy to brace
the camera on or against. Walls, car roofs, wooden chairs, and counter-
tops can all make excellent emergency tripods. Bracing the camera ver-
tically against a post or column can also help keep it steady enough to
compensate for a shutter speed that’s too slow for hand holding.

Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
✦Take advantage of cloudy skies. They provide more visual interest than
a plain, washed-out blue sky, as you can see in Figure 12-8. When the
clouds are in hiding, compose the image so that it has minimal empty
sky at the top of the frame.
Capturing monuments and architecture
The Arc de Triomphe, the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge.
Monuments, architecture, and engineering marvels can provide stunning
images and a record of your journey. You can take your photography to a
whole new level by following some simple techniques.
Many of the techniques that I described earlier for scenics also apply to
photographing these man-made wonders. Some special techniques, how-
ever, apply only to man-made objects.
Taking a shot in the dark
Don’t put your camera away when the sun sets. Buildings, monuments, and
bridges take on an entirely different look at night when they’re lit up. Keep
the following things in mind when taking pictures of monuments after dusk:
✦Support your camera. Here’s another situation where you need to get
out your tripod or some other camera support. Many camera manuals
suggest using a flash at this point; don’t do it. Some cameras automati-
cally set the flash under such conditions; override it if you can. You
don’t want to overpower the existing illumination with a flat, bright,
electronic flash. Most of the time, flash that is used in nighttime scenes
spoils the mood or ambiance that exists.
✦Go long. The idea here is to get a long enough exposure to turn the
headlights from cars and trucks into long ribbons of color that wrap
around the base of the structure, while the structure’s own lights help
give a sense of its form.

to this shot.

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Use a boat for sea shots. Finally, if you’re photographing in a river or
ocean town, a boat can make a fine shooting platform. Just keep in mind
that motor vessels’ powerful engines cause the decks to vibrate, and a
tripod isn’t much help in such circumstances.
When the sun goes down, check out the nearest amusement park. Set your
camera on a tripod or something solid, and take a long exposure of the
Ferris wheel or roller coaster — or any of the other rides that feature bright
lights and fast motion.
Painting with light
Sometimes, a building is too big and too dark for normal photographic
measures to do the trick. For these situations, the pros paint with light. This
technique calls for using a long exposure and firing off multiple flash bursts
to illuminate the object in sections. Follow these steps to paint with light:
1. Set your camera on a steady surface.
A tripod is good, but so is a short wall or the ground, for that matter.
Keep your camera steady — if the camera moves, the illuminated areas
move, too, putting them out of alignment.
2. Adjust the camera for a time exposure.
Check your camera manual for the details on setting your camera for a
time exposure.
3. Decide what areas of your subjects need to be painted.
4. Trigger a time exposure (or have a helper do it) by using your digital
camera’s time-exposure controls.
Experiment with different times, from 10 seconds to a minute or longer.
5. Paint by triggering your external flash multiple times.
Move the flash around to illuminate the subject in sections. As you
move, keep your body between your light source and camera if you
don’t want the light source to appear in the photo.
Photographers use another technique called writing with light, which can be
lots of fun. This is another trick that takes advantage of a long exposure and
a solid shooting platform, such as a tripod, a wall, or the ground. The idea is
to take a pencil torch (a penlight) and point it toward the camera lens while
the shutter is open. You can either swirl the penlight around or try to write
a specific message. Follow these steps to write with light:
1. Plan what you want to do. I recommend rehearsing a couple of times,
with someone else watching through the viewfinder.
This way, you know whether the camera is positioned properly to get
everything you want. Besides, you have to write backward — don’t you
think that takes some practice?
2. Set the camera to shutter-priority, and give it a long exposure time
( long enough for you to do what you want — probably several sec-
onds or more).
228

Book I
Chapter 12
Travel Photography
Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
3. Write with light by pointing the light at the camera lens from your
subject position.
4. Review the image with the camera’s LCD screen.
5. If necessary, make some adjustments to your shutter speed based on
what you see in the LCD.
6. To get really fancy, have a friend or spouse fire off a small flash after
you’re done writing but before the shutter closes.
This helps illuminate you while still allowing your writing to show.
Don’t forget that fireworks, like those shown in Figure 12-9, are a kind of
“writing with light.” You can use the same techniques that I just described,
except you let the aerial display create your image for you.

Shooting panoramas
One of the most frustrating moments of travel photography comes when
you find yourself literally surrounded by the beauty of nature, and you have
no way to capture all that surrounds you in a single photo. A digital camera,
tripod, and the right image-editing software, however, make capturing a 360-
degree panorama possible. Basically, you take a series of shots for your
panorama and then stitch the shots together (that is, line up the images
into one image) on your computer. Although you can stitch images together
in any image editor, specialized stitching applications are easy to use.
Follow these steps to take a panoramic shot:
1. Mount your camera on a tripod, and adjust the camera’s appropriate
zoom setting.
You don’t have to adjust the zoom lens to its widest setting. Zooming in
a little closer means that you capture more detail per photo. If your
main subject is distant, zooming in lets you capture more of the impor-
tant part of the scene without wasting space on unnecessary foreground
details.
The more shots you take, the more you’ll have to stitch together and
the greater the chance the software may have trouble creating a seam-
less panorama. Three to six images are generally the most manageable.
2. Level the camera.
The closer you can come to a perfectly level camera, the better job your
software can do with the final image. Buying an inexpensive level (as
small a unit as possible) at the local hardware store is highly recom-
mended. Set the level on top of the camera, and adjust the tripod until
the camera is level.
3. When you take the first picture, waste a shot by photographing your
fingers in front of the lens (don’t worry about focusing or exposure).
This makes it easy to see where you began the sequence. (Do the same
when you’ve completed each sequence.)
4. Make your first shot of the scene at either the left or right end of the
panoramic swing that you intend to make.
230
Keystoning
Keystoning, also known as perspective distortion,
happens when the photographer tries to fit an
entire building in a photo by tilting the camera up.
The problem with this approach is that when the
camera is no longer perfectly parallel with the
building, any straight lines on the long axis of the
image converge until they meet at the top. The pho-
tographer ends up with a photo of a building with a
wide base and a pinpoint top that appears to be
falling away.
How do you avoid keystoning? Because the prob-
lem comes from the lens and the building not being
perfectly parallel, the easiest way to correct that
problem is to align the two. You may be able to do
this by gaining some elevation. Sometimes, a
nearby hill can provide a distant vantage point, and
sometimes another building with an accessible roof
is available. Unfortunately, all too often, neither
solution is available, and the only option is to point
the camera up and take the picture.

Book I
Chapter 12
Travel Photography
Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
If your camera is capable of manual exposure, take several readings
throughout the scene and try to come up with an average setting for the
entire range.
5. Take subsequent pictures.
Make sure that each shot overlaps the previous one by 20 to 30 percent.
6. If possible, do a second sequence of images, particularly if the light-
ing was erratic.
7. Stitch all the images together at home, using an image editor or stitch-
ing software.
Packages such as PhotoStitch for the Macintosh (shown in Figure 12-10)
are easy to use and a lot of fun.
Shooting adventure sports
Adventure sports, such as white-water rafting, rock climbing, scuba diving,
and similar activities, entail different risks and require different precautions
to protect your precious equipment. If you’re the adventurous kind, I rec-
ommend the following items:
✦Dry boxes: Climbers and hikers need to keep their gear dry using water-
proof camera bags or other equipment. Sports such as white water raft-
ing and kayaking call for even greater protection. Usually, these boaters
protect their gear in a dry box setup. The best known manufacturer of
these is Pelikan, which makes cases with foam insides that can be cut to
fit specific camera gear. If using one of these, take very good care of the
O-rings that provide the watertight seal for the box. Veteran river run-
ners sometimes rely on Army surplus ammo or rocket boxes, which also
provide a watertight container for gear, but without the form-fitting foam.
If using one of these, make sure the camera is properly cushioned from
the bumps and jolts white water entails. If you protect your camera from
water, you can easily take photos like the one shown in Figure 12-11.
Figure 12-10:

✦Carabineers: These are the oval clips that climbers use to secure them-
selves to safety ropes; you can use them to clip the dry box to your off-
road vehicle. If you’re immersed in a water activity, the clips can also
secure your dry box to the raft or to the inside of the kayak. The boaters
will run the rapid, and at the end of the run they’ll unpack the camera
and start shooting. Once again, placing a silica packet or two in one of
these cases can help keep dampness from damaging your equipment.
✦Underwater digital cameras: Another option for those who want to
shoot a lot in wet conditions is to buy an underwater digital camera.
I’ve used underwater cameras even when I wasn’t planning to go in
the water. (You never can tell where a hike will end up.) The SeaLife
Reefmaster Underwater Digital camera comes in a waterproof housing
and works both on land and underwater. The camera, which retails for
under $400, only produces a 1.3-megapixel file but saves you the trouble
of trying to find a housing to fit an existing digital camera. The camera
also has an LCD that works underwater and a fast-delete function, both
of which make it easier to operate underwater. Check out the manufac-
turer’s Web site at www.sealife-cameras.com for more information.
✦Waterproof casings: More extreme conditions call for better protection.
Waterproof casings that still allow photography are available from sev-
eral companies, including Ewa Marine (www.ewa-marine.de). These cas-
ings are useful for both underwater photography (careful on the depth
though) and above-the-water shots if you are sailing or boating.
Keep in mind that salt spray is possibly the worst threat to camera elec-
tronics. A camera housing provides good protection against wind and
salt spray.
✦Deep-diving housings: For serious underwater enthusiasts, heavy-duty
Plexiglas camera housings now exist for small digital cameras. These
housings are available for a wide range of digital cameras and may be
found for as little as $200.

Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
Photographing people
You have lots of reasons to photograph people while traveling — and some
reasons not to. For example, photographing law-enforcement or military
personnel without getting their permission first can be a bad idea.
With today’s heightened concerns about terrorism, many security forces,
including our own, have become much more sensitive about people photo-
graphing and videotaping government facilities and employees. While trav-
eling in Israel and South America, it wasn’t unusual for me to see armed
military personnel walking the streets. Even a decade ago, it wasn’t a good
idea to grab a snapshot of them, and I wouldn’t even consider it these days
unless I got their permission first.
When photographing people in other areas of the country or in foreign
lands, remember that effective travel photography needs to create a sense
of place. Any time the photographer can use lifestyle, surroundings, work,
or clothing to show the region or culture involved, he or she has achieved
at least one measure of success. The following elements can help your
photos convey your location:
✦Clothing: Different cultures have different tastes in clothing and jewelry.
✦Design: Advertisements, homes, and buildings often look different,
depending on whether you’re overseas or in the United States.
✦Products: Soda cans, candy bars, and other packaging is different in
other countries — and sometimes even in the United States.
✦The natural world: Plants and wildlife may be noticeably different in
other locations.
In addition to creating a sense of place, the following tips can help you
effectively photograph people while traveling:
✦Be aware of cultural sensitivities. Some cultures frown upon photo-
graphic images of other human beings (that includes some cultures in
the United States, as well). In many Middle Eastern and Third World
countries, women wear clothing that’s designed to hide their appear-
ance. In some of these countries, photographing these people can be a
serious taboo (as can a man speaking to one of them to even ask per-
mission to take a photo).
✦Check out the local customs. Although taboos that have their origins in
religious beliefs can stay constant for millennia, official taboos may shift
frequently. Check with the U.S. consular office for the country that you’re
visiting to find out what’s okay and what isn’t. The following Web site
contains information on individual countries and policies:
travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html
✦Ask first. As a newspaper reporter and photographer, my philosophy
was to shoot first and ask questions later. (You can always talk to
people after an event is over; you can’t re-create photos, though.)
Photojournalists who are working in a newsgathering capacity, though,
are afforded some liberties that are considered out of line for tourists.
(And that’s in this country; the rules vary from country to country.) In
233

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
the case of a traveler photographing others without their permission,
it’s behavior that many would at least consider rude.
✦“Pretend I’m not here.” One of the reasons that pros prefer to shoot
first and ask later is that people appear more natural when they don’t
know that they’re being photographed. A common way of dealing with
this problem is to ask permission and then explain that you would like
the picture to look “natural.” Ask the person to go back to what he was
doing and to forget that you’re there.
✦Be forgettable. Although your subjects likely start out being self-
conscious, after a few minutes, they tend to become involved in 
their activity and, in fact, forget that you’re there.
✦Give your subjects feedback. Be aware of human psychology. People
who are posing tend to wait for some feedback at first, namely the click
of the camera that tells them you’re satisfied. If a person doesn’t hear
that click because you’re waiting for her to forget that you’re there, she
can become concerned that you’re not happy with what she is doing.
Take advantage of the digital advantage (being able to delete bad shots),
and take a photo or two at the start. Your subject will relax and begin to
forget that you’re there.
Another technique works well if you have a camera with a fairly wide-angle
lens. Adjust the zoom to the widest possible setting, and hold the camera
waist level and as perpendicular to the ground as you can. I usually try to
do this one-handed, with the camera strap helping me keep the camera
under control. Most people relax even more at this point because they don’t
expect you to shoot now. At this point, when I see the shot I want, I trip the
shutter. This technique works better if you’re familiar enough with your
camera to have a good idea of what its wide-angle lens covers from a certain
distance.
This “shooting from the hip” technique can be a tricky proposition ethically.
At least one journalism professor I know feels that it’s a violation of trust
between a photographer and the subject.
As a photographer, I believe that it’s important to be sensitive to your sub-
ject’s feelings on the matter. Because I’m shooting digitally, I take the shot
and then show it to the person who I’ve photographed. I then let him or her
decide whether the photo should be deleted. Most people aren’t concerned
with the shot, but I’ve slept better at night by immediately deleting the shot
if the person is unhappy with it. This process gets a lot harder if you and
your subject don’t speak the same language. Sometimes, the combination of
pantomime and the preview capability of the digital camera can be enough
for you to get by.
Capturing people and their places
Once the issue of getting permission from your subjects is out of the way, it’s
time to consider how to photograph them. Being able to capture people in
their own environment is where you can really feel the advantages of your
digital camera. It’s lightweight and versatile and can take plenty of photos.
Use the following tips to make the most of your camera’s advantages:
234

Book I
Chapter 12
Travel Photography
Tried-and-True Travel Photography Techniques
✦Shoot as much as it takes. If your objective can be achieved in just one
shot, so much the better. Still, there’s nothing wrong with taking multi-
ple shots to achieve the same thing, provided that the images build on
one another.
✦Capture the environment. At least one shot should show the individual
within his or her cultural environment. After that image is out of the
way, focus on the smaller details. Look for things that would be unusual
in your own home.
✦Move in close. Close-ups, like the one shown in Figure 12-12, provide
greater intimacy than full-body or head-and-shoulder shots. A well-
focused, tight composition of a person’s face (cropped in to just the
eyes, nose, and mouth, and not much more) packs a lot of intimacy. If
your subject wears glasses, try a profile shot (also tightly composed).
✦Hands can speak volumes. Sometimes, a person’s hands can reveal his
or her work history. Work-roughened, they can speak of years of manual
labor and toil. Or, a close-up of hands holding small tools or repairing a
watch, for example, can show great dexterity.
✦Capture the essentials. Who is this person? What shows your subject’s
identity? A new mom cradling her baby, a farmer on his tractor, and a
cyclist on her bike are just a few possibilities.
✦Think about lighting. Don’t forget to consider lighting. Unless your sub-
ject is in direct sunlight, some sort of fill flash is necessary. (The term
fill flash comes from its use not as a main light source but as an addi-
tional light to fill in areas that are hidden from the main light.)
✦Go for variety. Make sure to take a mix of horizontal and vertical photos.
For people shots, take lots of verticals (the human body breaks down
into a series of elements that are taller than they are wide).
Figure 12-12:

235

Part II: Snap To! Shooting Great Pictures
✦Show people working, playing, and relaxing. Even on a mountain
climb, like the one shown in Figure 12-13, quiet moments can reveal
another side of your subjects. Social gatherings and religious meetings
are also prime opportunities for good photographs. Look for community
festivals, too, where you can shoot lots of people, costumes, and events.
In such freewheeling settings, people are less concerned about being
photographed, and you can probably get away with taking wider shots
without having to check with every individual for his or her permission.
Performers, in particular, are quite used to being photographed.
Documenting Your Trip
Now, you can pull together everything from the earlier sections and create
memorable photos of your trip. Documenting a vacation is more than grab-
bing some pretty pictures of your travels; it’s creating a visual narrative that
re-creates the magic of your trip. This section wraps up travel photography
with some final tips for getting great vacation pictures.
Varying your shots
Try for a mix of shots and camera angles. Shoot some close-ups, and shoot
from far away. You can do a lot of things to avoid having all your photos
look alike. Consider the following tips:
✦Place the camera on the ground for a worm’s-eye view. Make that
church look even more imposing.
✦Get a bird’s-eye view. Renting helicopters gets expensive, but you have
other ways of getting up high and shooting down. You were going to
climb that monument anyway, right? Take advantage of the elevation.
Even simpler, climb a staircase and shoot straight down. Take advan-
tage of cable cars. Use a hot-air balloon ride to get some once-in-a-
lifetime scenic photos, like the one shown in Figure 12-14.

Chapter 12
Travel Photography
Documenting Your Trip
✦Turn the camera vertically when appropriate. Many scenes lend them-
selves to vertical images, yet most people still grip the camera horizon-
tally. Monuments, people, and buildings are all taller than they are wide.
Turn the camera on its side for these shots.
✦Shoot from more than one vantage point. Do like the pros do: Shoot it
high, shoot it low, shoot it horizontally, shoot it vertically, get closer,
move back, and walk around it. While doing this, remember to consider
what’s in the background.
Composing your shots
How you arrange the elements within your photo has a lot to do with how
much impact they convey. While I cover this topic in more detail in Chap-
ter 7 of Book I, the following things can help improve your photographic
composition:
✦Leading Lines: Strong linear elements can be used to pull the eye into
an image, as shown in Figure 12-15. Straight lines, diagonal lines, and 
S-curves all show movement and can depict strength, direction, or
grace. For example, the curves of a U.S. flag rippling in the wind com-
bine S-curves with the strong lines of the stripes.
✦Framing: Use existing and natural elements, such as window frames or
tree branches, to form a natural border along a corner or around the
image. Figure 12-15 is an example of this concept.
✦Rule of Thirds: Divide the frame into thirds horizontally and vertically.
Where the thirds intersect is a good place to place your subject. You
can also use this rule to show a course of movement. For example, put-
ting an airplane coming into the frame into the upper-right third con-
veys a sense of moving downward through the frame.
✦Balance: Did you ever see a picture of someone sitting on a park bench
with one end of the bench missing? Because of the missing support, it
seems like the person is going to drop like a rock. Again, you can find
examples of photos using balance and these other prime rules of com-
position in Book I, Chapter 7.

Getting organized
Close focusing (or macro capability) is another of the digital camera’s best
features. By introducing details of the location that you’re visiting, you can
trigger memories of your experience years after the trip has ended.
On that cruise that I mentioned earlier in this chapter, my wife and I were
fortunate to stay in an owner’s suite, one of the nicest cabins on the ship.
Each afternoon, we received a treat of some sort from one of the ship’s staff,
Figure 12-15:

238

Book I
Chapter 12
Travel Photography
Documenting Your Trip
along with a card announcing who it was from. Before enjoying our delica-
cies, we made sure to photograph the dish and card together (shown in
Figure 12-16), and we made sure to keep the card for a scrapbook as well.
The photo album from this trip includes many such details and provides a
much fuller and richer representation of our trip.
This section has already talked about a couple of documentary techniques,
such as photographing the chocolates and card we received aboard ship
and getting close-ups of local items or packaging that gives a sense of place.
Now take this technique a step further. Think of your photographic cover-
age as a series of still images that tell a story, rather than a group of individ-
ual pictures that stand on their own (even though they should).

Opportunities for documenting your trip include:
✦Signs, signs, everywhere there’s a sign: Use street and highway signs —
or even the one and only South Pole (shown in Figure 12-17) — to show
where you are or where you’re going. Photograph maps and brochures,
too. Don’t just settle for snapshots of these images; try to use lighting
and depth of field to turn them into interesting images in their own right.
✦Cultural and language differences: Signs differ from country to country.
In the United States, a sign can say “End of construction.” Years ago, on a
trip through New Zealand, I photographed a sign, shown in Figure 12-18,
that proclaimed “Works End,” with a cemetery in the background.

240

Book I
Chapter 12
Travel Photography
Documenting Your Trip
✦More signs: Street and road-crew signs are only one type of photographic
target, though. Distinctive shop, restaurant, and tavern signs also pro-
vide reminders of where you’ve been.
✦Newspapers/newsstands: Check the local newsstands. In at least some
countries, newsstands say something about where you’re visiting. For
that matter, a close-up of the day’s headline during your visit may make
a good introductory graphic if you’re giving a presentation.
✦Trailheads: If this a wilderness trip, most trailheads are well marked.
Photograph the signs. Shoot the trail maps, too. Your packs, supplies,
and other gear should also be documented. Follow the same approach if
you’re on a white-water rafting, skydiving, or ski trip.
✦White water: For white water, shoot as many rapids as possible. (Only
my fellow paddlers will get that pun.) It’s better to photograph the rapids
from the side because that field of view gives a better sense of scale
than a head-on shot does. If you can, get a raft or kayak in the photo
because that can help show the rapid’s size.
✦River scenes: Wilderness rafting trips include many other photo oppor-
tunities as well. Photos of swimmers (the white-water euphemism for
someone who has inadvertently become one with the river) and their
rescue can provide dramatic images. The lunch buffet (if on a commer-
cial trip) provides an opportunity for humor if you get shots of some of
the sandwiches that the guides make. (Guides traditionally eat after the
paying guests have gone through the buffet. As a result, some of the
sandwich ingredients get pretty creative. My guide usually included
cold cuts, veggies, chunky peanut butter, and thick slices of onion.)
✦River scenes ( Part II ): Don’t forget, white-water rivers generally
offer spectacular scenery, too. Plus, you can take shots of all the 
preliminaries — inflating the rafts, getting gear together, and putting
on wet suits and life jackets.
✦Rock climbing: Scenery, gear, climbers. Oh yeah, don’t forget the rocks.
Seriously though, mix close-ups, wide-angle shots, and action images of
the climbers. Take advantage of the bright colors and patterns of the
clothing that rock climbers wear, and the chocks, friends, and nuts (for
all you nonclimbers, this is the protective equipment that climbers use
to anchor into the rock) are great subjects for close-up shots. So are
chalk-covered fingers. Also, get lots of angles: Shoot from below, above,
and alongside the climbers.
✦Papers, please: Don’t forget close-ups of your travel documents. They’re
also part of the story that you’re telling.
You’ll soon discover that good photography is all in the details. Visiting for-
eign cultures provides a wealth of these details that can help show how dif-
ferent or similar we are. Close-ups of jewelry, magazines, and candy and
food packaging help emphasize that you’ve gone somewhere different.

W
hat’s the right image editor for you? That’s not an easy question, at 
least, not on the order of something simple, such as choosing a photo
lab to work on film from your old-fashioned film camera.
When you take a picture with a traditional film camera, you send the exposed
film to a photographic lab for processing and printing. You can change your
mind about which lab to use on a whim. In addition to performing the physi-
cal and chemical processes required to generate prints from the exposed
film, the lab technicians routinely adjust exposure, color balance, and other
details to improve the quality of your photographic prints. 
With digital pictures, you can use an image editor to perform all the functions
of a traditional photo lab, but you can’t change editors with each roll of film.
When you sign up for an image editor, you’re making a long-term commitment
(unless you have the resources to buy and use multiple image editors). This
chapter compares the features of some leading image editors and helps you
decide which is best for you.
Looking at Popular Image Editors: The Basics
There is no one image editor that is right for every digital photographer.
Different image-editing programs offer different feature sets and take differ-
ent approaches to the task of manipulating digital images. The trick is to find
the program (or programs) that has the features and approach that most
closely matches your needs and working style. Image-editing programs
range in capabilities from extremely limited to impressively powerful. And
you probably won’t be surprised to find a similar range in price, from free
or low cost for programs with limited capabilities to several hundred dol-
lars for high-end programs.
A simple image editor was probably included on the disc that came with
your digital camera. Dozens of others are available on the shelves of local
computer stores or as free downloads from the Internet. Because you’re
taking the time to read this book to improve your skills, I think it’s safe to
assume that your interests go well beyond the simplest snapshots and
243

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
prints made with the default settings and that your search for an image-
editing program will extend beyond the simple, view-and-print utilities. But
just because you want more capabilities than the low-end programs offer,
that doesn’t necessarily mean that you should go all the way to the other
end of the spectrum. An assortment of midrange programs might fit your
needs very nicely.
You might also find that one image editor doesn’t perform all editing tasks
equally well. A specific editing task may be easier to perform in one editor
and more cumbersome in another. If your main editor is a little awkward to
use for some tasks that you perform frequently, I recommend keeping
another editor around that can handle those tasks with aplomb.
The available image-editing programs can be roughly grouped into four tiers:
✦Adobe Photoshop CS stands alone at the top as the de facto standard for
professional image editing. If you’re working with images professionally,
you need to own and use Photoshop CS. You may also find one of the
other editors helpful for specialized tasks, but Photoshop CS is your
meal ticket.
✦The second tier is composed of highly capable image editors that,
although they may not match Photoshop’s every feature, have the power
and versatility to meet the needs of many digital photographers —
Photoshop Elements falls squarely into this category. The image editors
in this tier often provide wizards and dialog boxes to automate common
tasks, but the main focus is on direct access to the image with a variety
of manual selection, retouching, and painting tools. 
✦The third tier of image editors sacrifices some of the raw power and 
versatility of the first and second-tier programs in favor of dramatically
improved ease of use. Most common image-editing tasks are automated
or made more accessible through the use of wizards and dialog boxes
that walk you through the steps required to complete the tasks. The pro-
grams in this group may also have the ability to access your image for
direct manipulation with retouching and painting tools, but the manual
editing features are somewhat limited. The main emphasis is on the pro-
gram’s automated editing tasks.
✦The fourth tier is composed primarily of the simple, view-and-print 
utilities, although some of the programs also have some limited image-
editing capabilities. These programs often feature simple and attractive
user interfaces with big graphical buttons for each task. They are easy
to use, but offer only a very limited assortment of simple image-editing
options, such as cropping and overall color balance. Generally, these
programs don’t enable you to select and edit a portion of an image with
manual retouching tools.
The purpose of this chapter is to give you a brief overview of some popular
image editors and assist you in identifying the program that might be right
for you. (Unless I specify otherwise, these programs are available for use on
both Macs and Windows PCs.) I skip the bottom tier because these programs
come and go and don’t usually have the level of support needed for serious
image editing. The focus in this chapter is on the other three levels.

Adobe Photoshop CS — Alone at the Top
Adobe Photoshop CS — Alone at the Top
Adobe Photoshop CS is the big kahuna of image-editing programs. It is the
de facto industry standard, by which all the other image-editing programs
are measured.
Over the years, Photoshop has earned a place in nearly every digital-imaging
professional’s toolbox. In fact, for many graphics professionals, Photoshop CS
is their primary tool for everything from resampling image files and changing
file formats, through photographic retouching and image enhancement, to
creating original illustrations and artwork.
Photoshop is a professional-level tool, but you don’t have to work at a major
advertising agency, photography studio, or printing plant to use it. Even
though buying a copy of Photoshop CS requires a significant investment of
money and the time spent learning to use it, it’s not beyond the reach of small
businesses, serious digital photography hobbyists, artists, and others who
need access to its powerful tools and advanced features. You’ll need a com-
puter powerful enough to run it, of course. You can find attractive upgrade
offers from time to time that let you purchase a full copy of Photoshop CS for
a fraction of its regular list price. And when Adobe releases new versions,
upgrading is relatively economical.
What’s good about it
Photoshop CS didn’t attain its stature as the leading high-end image-editing
program by accident. It has a well-deserved reputation for delivering a very
complete feature set. In short, this is one powerful program. No matter what
you want to do with an image, the odds are that Photoshop CS contains the
tools that enable you to do it.
Photoshop CS can read, write, and manipulate all the industry-standard file
formats (and many not-so-standard formats as well). You can resample
images to change the image size, resolution, and color depth. Photoshop CS
excels at providing images that are optimized for specialized uses, such 
as commercial printing and Web graphics, and the application also enjoys
close ties with several leading page-layout programs and Web-development
programs (especially other Adobe products like PageMaker and InDesign).
Photoshop CS provides a rich set of tools for everything from simple image
manipulation (cropping and color balance adjustments, to name two) to
selecting complex shapes from an image and applying sophisticated filters
and effects to the selected area. Photoshop CS also includes a full set of
painting tools that you can use to retouch your images or to create original
artwork.
As if this list of built-in features weren’t complete enough, Adobe designed
Photoshop CS to accept filters and plug-in program extensions provided by
third-party suppliers. As a result, a robust aftermarket has evolved to supply
a wide assortment of plug-ins that make it quick and easy to apply all manner
of textures, edge treatments, special effects, and other image manipulations
to the images you edit in Photoshop CS.
245

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
What’s not so good
Photoshop is undeniably a powerful program, but you pay a price for all that
power. Photoshop CS is also an expensive program. The price of admission
for accessing Photoshop’s power is a significant investment in money and
learning time.
At a little over $600, Photoshop CS is expensive to purchase initially (later
upgrades won’t cost you as much). But the cost of the program doesn’t stop
there. If you’re a serious Photoshop CS user, you probably want to add one
or more plug-in packages, which each cost as much as a typical midlevel
image editor. And then there’s the inevitable upgrade costs when Adobe
releases the next version of Photoshop CS with all its cool new features. The
upgrade price for a new version of Photoshop CS is more than the full pur-
chase price of most other image editors, but it’s still reasonable when you
consider what you’re getting.
In addition to its monetary cost, Photoshop CS is also expensive in terms of
the time you need to invest in order to use it. The demands of learning to
use this program are probably the most significant barrier for the casual
user. Photoshop’s power and versatility make it a complex program, and
that complexity creates a steep learning curve. It can be challenging to get
started working with the program right out of the box, and even after you
learn the ropes, performing simple tasks can sometimes be cumbersome in
Photoshop CS. The program’s breadth and depth make it difficult to master.
Often, even the graphics pros who use Photoshop CS on a daily basis
haven’t explored all its many capabilities.
Photoshop CS is an ongoing commitment, too. It’s not the sort of program
you can use once a month and pick up where you left off. It works best when
used on an everyday basis so that the commands and shortcuts become
second nature. Attempt to use a special feature after not working with
Photoshop for a month, and you’ll probably find yourself diving into the
(excellent) built-in Help system.
Oh, and don’t forget the hardware requirements. Photoshop CS is one of the
most demanding applications for both PCs and Macs, and you’ll need the
fastest processor and the largest amount of RAM you can afford to maximize
the performance of your system.
What you can do with it
What can you do with Photoshop CS? The short answer is, “Almost anything!
(Within reason!)”
In fact, it’s difficult to come up with anything that you’d want to do to a digital
image that can’t be done in Photoshop CS, unless it’s outright impossible in
the first place (such as transforming a total train wreck of a photo into a work
of art). Oh sure, a few tasks are faster or easier to perform in some other pro-
grams. However, it’s hard to find a visual effect that can’t be duplicated in
Photoshop CS if you’re willing to invest the time and effort to get acquainted
with the program’s tools and to use those tools in innovative ways.

Adobe Photoshop CS — Alone at the Top
Here’s just one simple example of an image enhancement you can create with
Photoshop. Suppose you’ve taken a beautiful picture of a sailboat on a lake,
but you don’t like the flat, uninteresting sky in the background. No problem,
you can quickly add some clouds by following these steps:
1. Click the Magic Wand tool and then adjust its settings.
The Magic Wand tool is the second button in the right column of the
toolbox (which is on the left side of the Photoshop window). You adjust
the settings for the Magic Wand tool in the Options bar across the top of
the Photoshop window. In this case, I used a tolerance setting of 50 and
checked the Anti-Aliased and Contiguous options. Those settings tell
the Magic Wand to select only the pixels in the sky.
2. Click the sky with the Magic Wand tool.
Photoshop selects the sky for editing and marks the selection by sur-
rounding it with a “marching ants” marquee. 
3. Choose Filter➪Render➪Clouds from the main menu.
Photoshop fills the selection with a cloud pattern. The new sky looks
better than the old dull sky, but it’s a little too dark to look natural.
4. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Variations.
The Variations dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-1. Ensure that
Midtones is selected and that the Fine/Course slider is in the middle
position.
5. Double-click the Lighter thumbnail and then click the More Green
thumbnail.
With each click, Photoshop adjusts the color and brightness of the
Current Pick thumbnail to preview how the adjustments will look when
applied to your image.
6. Click OK to close the Variations dialog box and apply the adjustments
to the selected portion of your image.
7. Choose Select➪Deselect from the main menu to remove the selection
marquee.
Enjoy your sunny sky.

The second-tier image editors are a diverse lot. They all have the ability to
edit and manipulate digital images, and they emphasize direct access to the
image over wizards and other automation for editing tasks. They are all less
expensive than Photoshop CS. But that’s where the uniformity ends. 
Some of the programs in this tier are niche products that excel at dealing
with particular kinds of images, whereas others are general-purpose image
editors with nearly as much versatility as Photoshop. Each of the programs
in this tier has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Depending on your
specific needs, the program that is a perfect fit for you might be unsuitable
for another digital image maker.
Adobe Photoshop Elements
Photoshop Elements is the little brother to the full Photoshop CS program.
Adobe created Photoshop Elements (often shortened to just Elements) as a
more accessible version of Photoshop CS for the numerous people who want
to use Photoshop but don’t need some of its more advanced features.
Photoshop Elements, shown in Figure 13-2, shares much of the same user
interface with its big brother, Photoshop CS. Compared to the full version of
Photoshop, Elements has an abbreviated feature set, but it includes most of
the basic image-editing tools that the typical digital photographer needs on
a regular basis. That includes image-selection tools, retouching tools, paint-
ing tools, a generous assortment of filters, and the ability to expand those
filters by accepting the same Photoshop CS plug-ins as its sibling program.
What’s good about it
Photoshop Elements is competitively priced at about $100. Elements is con-
siderably less powerful than its big brother, Photoshop CS, but by sacrificing
some of the immense power of Photoshop, Adobe created a program that is
significantly less complex and is therefore simpler and easier to use than
Photoshop CS.
In general, Adobe did a pretty good job of selecting which Photoshop CS fea-
tures to leave out of Elements. The program’s feature set is a reasonably good
match for the needs of the typical digital photographer. Most of Photoshop’s
standard selection, retouching, and painting tools are available in Elements.
If your image-editing needs revolve around retouching and manipulating
individual pictures one at a time, you’ll probably never notice the more
advanced Photoshop CS features that are missing from Elements.
Elements isn’t just a cut down version of Photoshop CS. The program includes
a few interesting features that Photoshop lacks. Elements features a set of
248

Editors
Second-Tier Image Editors
tabs in the toolbar at the top of the main window to provide quick access to
many of the program’s most-used features, and the automated commands on
the Enhance menu make quick work of common image-editing tasks, such as
adjusting backlighting or color cast. As a result, an occasional user working
with Elements can complete those tasks faster and more accurately than a
seasoned graphics pro working with Photoshop CS.
Elements also is a good set of training wheels for Photoshop CS. After you
master this program, you can use Photoshop CS much more easily than if
you started from scratch.
What’s not so good
The similarity of the Elements user interface (the arrangement of menus
and floating palettes superimposed on the workspace containing multiple
document windows) is a boon to Photoshop CS users and wannabes who
might need to switch back and forth between the two programs. However,
the Photoshop interface isn’t known for its ease of use. Many newcomers to
the program don’t find the menu arrangements and other details to be very
intuitive.
What you can do with it
One very nice feature of Elements is the Fill Flash command. This command
enables you to bring out the detail in an underexposed foreground without
wiping out the sky the way a simple brightness adjustment would. The effect
is similar to using a fill flash when taking the original image. In fact, the Fill
Flash command can salvage a picture where the flash failed to fire or the
subject was too far away for the on-camera flash to be effective.

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Follow these steps to apply the Fill Flash command to an image you’re edit-
ing in Photoshop Elements:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Fill Flash from the menu bar.
The Fill Flash dialog box appears. Make sure the Preview box is checked
and that the dialog box is positioned so that you can see the effect of
the adjustment on your image.
2. Drag the Lighter slider to the right and observe the effect on your
image. 
As you drag the slider, Elements adjusts the image to preview the effect.
Adjust the slider as needed to achieve the desired effect. 
3. Drag the Saturation slider to the right and observe the effect on your
image. 
Again, adjust the slider as needed to achieve the desired effect. 
4. Click OK to close the Fill Flash dialog box and apply the adjustment to
your image.
The Fill Flash command is one of the features that is available in Elements
but not in the full version of Photoshop. You can obtain essentially the same
results in Photoshop by using other tools, but the Elements Fill Flash com-
mand is much faster and easier to use.
If your image looks muddy and unnatural after applying the Fill Flash com-
mand, try applying the Enhance➪Auto Levels command to restore a more
natural tonal range.
Where to get it
Photoshop Elements costs about $100 and is available from most computer
stores, catalogs, and online software outlets. For more details or to purchase
directly from the manufacturer, go to www.adobe.com.
Corel PHOTO-PAINT
Corel PHOTO-PAINT is the image-editing program that is included in the
popular CorelDRAW Graphics Suite.
PHOTO-PAINT, shown in Figure 13-3, is a reasonably full-featured photo
retouching and image-editing program. Although its feature set can’t match
the full version of Photoshop CS, PHOTO-PAINT stands solidly among a
second tier of products that deliver a large portion of Photoshop’s func-
tionality for a relatively small portion of that program’s price. PHOTO-
PAINT is far more powerful and versatile than other programs that stress
ease of use.
PHOTO-PAINT offers a full set of selection, retouching, and painting tools
for manual image manipulations and also includes convenient automated
commands for a few common tasks, such as red-eye removal. PHOTO-PAINT
accepts Photoshop plug-ins to expand its assortment of filters and special
effects. 
250

Book I
Chapter 13
Comparing Photoshop

Editors
Second-Tier Image Editors
What’s good about it
Corel PHOTO-PAINT is a respectable product as a standalone image editor.
However, it’s greatest strength is its integration with CorelDRAW and the rest
of the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. If you use CorelDRAW to create and edit
graphics, then you’ve probably got PHOTO-PAINT installed on your com-
puter, and you’ll feel right at home using the product. All the menus, dialog
boxes, and palettes behave just as you’ve come to expect from your experi-
ence with DRAW. 
What’s not so good
Perhaps the worst thing about PHOTO-PAINT is that it’s available only as
part of the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. At a $400 street price, the CorelDRAW
Graphics Suite is a good value, provided you need the main CorelDRAW pro-
gram and any other components of the suite. However, $400 is a lot to pay
for PHOTO-PAINT alone, especially when other image editors in this tier are
available for around $100. 
What you can do with it
You can do many of the things possible with Photoshop CS, except for com-
plex color separation tasks. It’s an all-around good editor for the average
user and the equal of Photoshop Elements.
Where to get it
To get PHOTO-PAINT, you need to purchase the CorelDRAW 12 Graphics
Suite, which costs about $400. The suite includes the CorelDRAW graphics
program, PHOTO-PAINT, R.A.V.E. (a Web animation program), CorelTRACE
(a bitmap-to-vector conversion utility), CAPTURE (a screen-capture utility),
Figure 13-3:

and a large assortment of fonts and clip art. The CorelDRAW Graphics Suite
is available from the usual list of computer software suppliers. For more
details, or to purchase directly from the manufacturer, go to www.corel.com.
Jasc Paint Shop Pro
Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8, shown in Figure 13-4, is one of the leading second-tier
image editors. It’s a general-purpose image editor that has gained a reputa-
tion as the “poor man’s Photoshop” for providing a substantial portion of
Photoshop’s capabilities at a fraction of the cost. The program, which runs
only under Windows, lists for about $100, but you can often find it for sale
at a substantial discount. Paint Shop Pro has been a favorite of mine since
the days that I offered it as a shareware download on my dialup BBS!
Paint Shop Pro features a fairly complete tool kit that includes selection,
painting, and retouching tools for direct manipulation of your images. It 
also has a sizable collection of wizardlike commands that automate common
tasks, such as removing red-eye and scratches. Paint Shop Pro includes a
nice assortment of filters and effects, and you can expand that assortment
by adding most any of the Photoshop plug-ins.
What’s good about it
Paint Shop Pro has been around for a while, so the program has had time 
to evolve and mature. Over that time, it has developed a reasonably robust
feature set and a refined user interface. Many people rate Paint Shop Pro as
the easiest to use of the general-purpose image editors, and it’s among the
lowest priced programs in its class.

Second-Tier Image Editors
Paint Shop Pro supports layers, which enable you to achieve some fairly
sophisticated editing effects. This is a surprising capability in a low-cost
image editor.
What’s not so good
The breadth and depth of the Paint Shop Pro feature set is a little uneven.
The program shows surprising depth in some areas, such as the availability
of layers, and shallowness in others, such as the limited choice of selection
and paint tools. Also, some tools (such as the Histogram Adjustment com-
mand) require more knowledge and experience to use effectively than do
the corresponding tools in some of the other editors.
You need to evaluate the program carefully to determine whether its partic-
ular strengths and weaknesses are a good match for the mix of work you need
to do. Fortunately, you can download a free trial version of Paint Shop Pro
so that you can try the program before you buy it. Check out www.jasc.com
for the trial copy.
What you can do with it
Paint Shop Pro includes a large number of special effects filters. It also
includes a useful little command that helps you select the filter you want 
to use. Here’s how it works:
1. Choose Effects➪Effect Browser from the menu bar.
The Effect Browser dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-5. The
dialog box contains a list of effect filters on the left and thumbnail pre-
views on the right.
2. Click an item in the Effect Name list to preview the effect.
When you click an item in the list, a short description of the effect
appears at the bottom of the dialog box, and the Sample Preview thumb-
nail shows an approximation of how the effect will look on your image.
Continue trying different effects until you find one you like.
Figure 13-5:

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
3. Click Apply.
The Effect Browser dialog box disappears. This is the equivalent of
choosing the corresponding effect from the Effects menu. If no settings
are available for the selected effect, the effect is applied immediately.
Otherwise, the effect’s dialog box appears.
4. Adjust the settings in the effect-specific dialog box as needed.
Depending on the specific effect you selected, you may need to set
options to control the intensity of the effect and other attributes.
5. Click OK.
The dialog box disappears, and Paint Shop Pro applies the effect to your
image. 
Where to get it
Paint Shop Pro started life as a shareware program, but it has since expanded
its market presence and gone mainstream. As a result, it now sports the slick
packaging and complete documentation that most people expect from a com-
mercial software product. You can buy the boxed version of Paint Shop Pro at
all the usual computer software outlets. Or you can order the product from
the Jasc Web site at www.jasc.com. A time-limited free trial version is available
for download at the site.
Ulead PhotoImpact
Ulead PhotoImpact, shown in Figure 13-6, is a general-purpose photo-editing
program with a robust feature set. PhotoImpact features a rich assortment
of brushes for painting, retouching, and cloning in addition to the usual selec-
tion, cropping, and fill tools. It also has tools for text and vector shapes, as
well as tools for creating slices and image maps for use on the Web. Photo-
Impact supports layers and includes a generous collection of effects filters,
which you can expand with Photoshop plug-ins. Auto-process commands
are available to automate many of the most common image-correction and
enhancement tasks.
What’s good about it
PhotoImpact is one of the most powerful and versatile of the second-tier
image editors, and it’s modestly priced at less than $100. This combination
of high capability and low price makes PhotoImpact an excellent value.
If you frequently perform the same image manipulations on a number of
files, you’ll appreciate PhotoImpact’s batch operations. Using this feature,
you can select multiple image files and then apply any one of a long list of
filters, enhancements, or auto-process commands to all the selected files.
What a timesaver!
PhotoImpact also includes some specialized features for creating Web graph-
ics. The program includes wizards to help you create Web backgrounds, ban-
ners, and buttons, and its image optimization features are especially strong.
254

Second-Tier Image Editors
What’s not so good
PhotoImpact’s user interface can be a bit quirky and inconsistent in places.
Some of PhotoImpact’s features, though effective and very useful, feel like
they are the result of grafting separate modules onto the program instead 
of seamlessly integrating the features into the program. Overall, the Photo-
Impact user interface is not as polished as Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, or
PHOTO-PAINT. To be fair, however, after you get past the program’s quirks
and idiosyncrasies, you’ll find that PhotoImpact is a very capable Windows-
only image editor.
What you can do with it
PhotoImpact is a versatile image editor, capable of most any image manipu-
lation you might want to do. It’s hard to pick just one example to show here.
PhotoImpact comes with a generous assortment of effect filters. It’s fun to
play around with the filters. Here’s an example of a filter that gives an image
the look of an oil painting:
1. Choose Effect➪Natural Painting➪Oil Paint from the menu bar.
The Oil Paint dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-7. The Dual View
tab shows two thumbnails: your original image on the left and a preview
of the effect on the right.
2. Drag the sliders to adjust the Stroke Detail and Level.
Adjust the sliders as needed to achieve the desired effect. You can also
use the spin boxes to the right of each slider if you want to make more
precise adjustments.

255

3. Click OK.
The Oil Paint dialog box disappears as PhotoImpact applies the effect to
your image.
PhotoImpact’s EasyPalette gives you quick access to many of the effects with-
out having to go through the menus and dialog boxes. To apply this same
effect from the EasyPalette, simply select Effect Gallery from the Gallery list
on the left side of the EasyPalette window. Then scroll down through the
thumbnails on the right side and double-click the Oil Paint 3 thumbnail.
PhotoImpact applies the effect immediately.
Where to get it
PhotoImpact is available from many of the same software dealers that carry
most of the other programs in this chapter. The suggested retail price is
about $90. Or you can order PhotoImpact direct from the Ulead Web site at
www.ulead.com. The site also offers a time-limited free trial version that you
can download.
Third-Tier Image Editors
The third tier of image-editing programs specializes in making the most
common image-editing tasks fast and easy to do. Typically, it takes just a
few mouse clicks to open an image, make a simple adjustment or two, and
then print or save the picture. These are the programs to choose when fast
and easy is more important to you than powerful and versatile.
If your image-editing needs are very basic, you might use one of these pro-
grams as your main image editor. However, you’re more likely to use these
programs to complement a more powerful editor. They can make quick work
of routine stuff that doesn’t require the power of your other editor. 
Microsoft Picture It!
Microsoft Picture It! doesn’t get the attention that the big-name Microsoft pro-
grams get. Despite the Microsoft name, this Windows-only program isn’t the
dominant program in its class. However, it is a respected player in the field. 
Figure 13-7:

Editors
Third-Tier Image Editors
Picture It!, shown in Figure 13-8, is a simple program that makes it easy to
access your images (whether they are in your camera or scanner, or stored
on your hard drive) and then edit and print those images with a minimum of
fuss. The image-editing capabilities are limited when compared to first-tier
and second-tier editors, but they cover the basics. You can do things such as
cropping, rotating, adjusting brightness or color balance, and fixing red-eye
and scratches. Picture It! also includes a modest collection of effect filters
and edge treatments that you can apply to your images. And the program
even includes some basic painting tools as well as tools for adding text and
shapes to your images.
Picture It! comes in a number of different versions, starting with the Standard
Edition at around $50. The Digital Image Pro version adds more filters and
retouching tools, including flash and backlight corrections; dodge and burn
tools; and the ability to adjust shadow, midtone, and highlight levels inde-
pendently. Digital Image Pro also accepts Photoshop plug-ins for even more
filter effects — it sells for about $100.
What’s good about it
Like most Microsoft products, Picture It! has a slick-looking user interface
that is well thought out and easy to use. Microsoft can afford to invest time
and money in focus groups and usability testing — and it shows. 
Picture It! also gives you the ability to select several image files and apply the
same adjustment to all the selected files at once. This ability isn’t unique to
Picture It!, but it’s unusual in image editors at this level.
What’s not so good
The added features of the Digital Image Pro version of Picture It! are an obvi-
ous attempt to give the program capabilities comparable to some of the
second-tier image editors. In my opinion, the attempt falls short. However,
you may find that Digital Image Pro gives you just enough capability to handle
your occasional image-editing tasks without needing a more advanced editor.

257

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
What you can do with it
Programs in this tier excel at quick fixes. Here’s an example of how to make
a couple of quick adjustments in Picture It! to an image that is slightly off in
color:
1. Click the Levels AutoFix button in the left toolbar.
Picture It! automatically adjusts brightness and contrast to achieve a full
tonal range of blacks, whites, and all the tones in-between.
2. Click the Adjust Tint button in the left toolbar.
Picture It! displays the Adjust Tint panel on the left side of the program
window. Make sure the Whole Picture tab is selected.
3. Click the Eyedropper icon and then click an area of the picture that
should be white.
Picture It! automatically adjusts the color settings as needed to render
the selected area as white. If the image still doesn’t look right, you can
try clicking another white spot or adjusting the Color and Amount sliders
manually.
4. Click the Done button at the bottom of the Adjust Tint panel.
The Adjust Tint panel disappears, and Picture It! returns to the normal
display with the changes applied to your image.
Where to get it
Microsoft Picture It! is available in many retail software stores and online
outlets. You can also order the program direct from Microsoft. For more
information, go to pictureitproducts.msn.com.
Roxio PhotoSuite
Roxio PhotoSuite 7 Platinum, another Windows-only program, is perhaps the
best known of the third-tier image editors. (Note: Roxio PhotoSuite was for-
merly known as MGI PhotoSuite.) It’s inexpensive (less than $50) and easy to
use. The program’s opening screen (shown in Figure 13-9) is uncluttered and
features big, graphical icons with lots of interactive feedback. This approach
is a stark contrast to the multiple toolbars and floating panels that fight for
the user’s attention in most of the first-tier and second-tier image editors.
Despite PhotoSuite’s apparent simplicity, it offers a reasonably good assort-
ment of image-editing tools for this level of image editor. It has basic versions
of the standard selection, paint, clone, erase, and fill tools, plus an effect
brush and tools for drawing simple shapes (but not text). And, of course,
you can crop and rotate the image, remove scratches and red-eye, and
touch up the brightness and color balance, among other things.
PhotoSuite also includes tools to help you organize and distribute your pic-
tures. You can gather a set of pictures together into an album and then share
an individual picture or an entire album on the Web, show pictures as a slide
show, or send pictures via e-mail. You can even install your pictures as wall-
paper on your Windows desktop or display an album of pictures as a screen
saver.
258

Book I
Chapter 13
Comparing Photoshop
Elements to Other Image
Editors
Third-Tier Image Editors
What’s good about it
PhotoSuite’s strength is its ease of use. The uncluttered user interface keeps
the screen simple and clean. A permanent panel on the left side of the screen
contains either buttons that enable you to select a procedure or detailed
instructions that walk you through the procedure step by step.
The built-in projects make it easy to create greeting cards, calendars, report
covers, and many other items that incorporate your pictures into the design.
This nice bonus enables you to use your pictures in fun and interesting
ways without needing another program to do so.
What’s not so good
The almost stark simplicity of the user interface means that most of the
available tools and options are hidden from view at any given time. You often
have to drill down through several layers of options to reach a specific tool
or apply an effect. The program’s constant hand-holding is helpful for new-
comers, but after you learn the ropes, you may find yourself getting impa-
tient and wishing you could jump straight to the desired effect with fewer
intermediate prompts and clicks. 
What you can do with it
Using one of PhotoSuite’s project templates, you can create a pretend maga-
zine cover containing a digital image from your collection. Just follow these
steps:

Chapter 14: Making Selections
In This Chapter
 Making rectangular and elliptical selections
 Creating freeform selections
 Making polygonal selections
 Selecting image content based on colors in the image
C
reating selections of the parts of the image that you intend to modify
is the key to successful image manipulation. Indeed, the first step in
many editing procedures is to focus the software’s attention on the stuff
you want to edit — an area that needs to be lighter, darker, or a different
color, or removed altogether. For this purpose, Photoshop Elements offers
a series of specialized tools that allow you to select geometric shapes, rows
and columns of pixels, freeform shapes, and polygons. You can also find
tools for making selections based on colors and pixel comparisons.
Because each selection method has advantages and disadvantages, the
selection tool you choose is based on the kind of area you want to select and
the nature of the image itself. I can give you no hard and fast rules for when
to use a particular tool over another, but I can show you the basics of the
selection tools, which I do in this chapter. I encourage you to experiment
with these tools to find out which ones work best for you and in which situ-
ations to employ each.
Making Simple Selections with the Marquee Tools
Photoshop Elements has two tools that go by the moniker Marquee: the
Rectangular Marquee tool (for rectangles and squares) and the Elliptical
Marquee tool (for ovals and circles). Both are simple to use. For example,
you can drag the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool to select a rectangle
or oval. Hold down the Shift key to select perfect squares and circles. You
can select the Marquee tools by clicking them in the Tool palette, or by
pressing Shift+M and repeating until the Marquee tool you want is high-
lighted in the Tool palette.
Figure 14-1 shows a rectangular selection in progress, using Photoshop
Elements.
Selecting geometric shapes
When you’re ready to make your geometric selection, the procedure is quite
simple — it requires only that you’ve identified the layer that contains the
area you want to edit and that you select that layer first. Then you’re ready
to make the selection, following these steps:
261

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
1. Click the Marquee selection tool in the Tool palette and choose the
shape (Rectangular or Oval) that you want to use.
2. Move your mouse onto the image and click where you want the selec-
tion to begin.
3. Drag away from the starting point, and set the size and proportions of
your selection by controlling the distance and angle at which you drag
the mouse.
4. If you want a perfect square or circle, press and hold the Shift key as
you drag; release the mouse and then the key when the selection is
complete.
When using the Shift key to make a perfectly square or circular selection
(equal in width and height), be sure to release the mouse before releasing
the Shift key when your selection is complete. If you release the key first,
the selection snaps to the size and shape it would have been had you not
used the Shift key at all.
Both the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee tools allow you to choose from
different Style settings. Your choices are Normal, Fixed Aspect Ratio (Con-
strained Aspect Ratio on the Mac), and Fixed Size. If you choose either of
the latter two, additional options appear on the tool’s options bar, through
which you can enter the ratio or dimensions, respectively. If you’re using
Normal, these options are dimmed.
Adding to, reducing, and combining selections
The Marquee tools’ Options bars offer four tools for customizing your selec-
tions. You can find these same tools, with the same power, in the Options
bars for the Lasso and Magic Wand tools, as well. The buttons are descrip-
tively named; here’s a brief description of what each does:
✦New Selection: Creates an entirely new selection
✦Add to Selection: Adds more area to an existing selection
✦Subtract from Selection: Removes part of a selection
✦Intersect with Selection: Creates a selection from only the overlapping
area of two selections

Book I
Chapter 14
Making Selections
Making Simple Selections with the Marquee Tools
Each button represents a selection mode and controls whether or not you
can add to, take away from, or create a new selection based on the overlap-
ping areas within two concurrent selections. If you’re in New Selection
mode, each time you click and drag the mouse, a new Marquee selection is
created, replacing any other selections currently in place. If you switch to
Add to Selection mode, you can select noncontiguous areas on the image,
or you can make your current selection larger. The left image in Figure 14-2
shows both a pair of noncontiguous selections (lower right) and a selection
that was created by selecting two overlapping rectangles (upper left).
The Subtract from Selection mode enables you to cut away from an existing
selection or to deselect noncontiguous parts of an initial selection. The right
image in Figure 14-2 shows a circular frame created by subtracting a smaller
oval selection from within a larger one. 
Using the Intersect with Selection mode allows you to create new selection
shapes, such as the semicircular selection shown on the left in Figure 14-3.
This semicircle selection was formed from the overlapping areas of a circle
and a rectangle. You can also move from one mode to another as you build
or tear down selections. For example, you can use Subtract from Selection
to build a cross-shaped selection (see the right image in Figure 14-3, where a
single square selection was cut away on its corners to create the cross shape)
and then use the Add to Selection mode to add circular selections to the ends
of the cross. This also requires switching to the Elliptical Marquee tool.

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Snagging Irregular Shapes with the Lasso Tools
The Lasso is a freehand selection tool. You can use the regular Lasso to draw
freeform shapes that become selections, or use the Polygonal Lasso to
select polygons by dragging around an object with straight lines. You can
also select by drawing with the Magnetic Lasso tool: You guide the cursor
around an object, and the software selects pixels by comparing them to
adjoining pixels and chooses the ones that are different on the basis of
color and light. In all its incarnations, the Lasso is a pretty powerful selec-
tion tool and probably the one I use most when retouching photos. A Lasso
tool selection is shown in Figure 14-4.
Selecting freeform shapes
The main Lasso tool is extremely easy to use. Just click and drag, drawing a
shape around the section of the image you want to select. It’s just a matter
of drawing a loop around the area to be selected, as shown in Figure 14-5.
The other important thing to remember is to close your selection by coming
back to the starting point. This prevents the software from guessing how
you’d like the shape to finish, which usually results in some of the intended
selection being omitted. If you don’t close the shape, Photoshop Elements
does it for you by connecting the start and end points with a straight line.

Chapter 14
Making Selections
Snagging Irregular Shapes with the Lasso Tools
The Lasso Options bar offers a Feather setting, which allows you to add a
number of fuzzy pixels to the selection’s edges. This gives a softer edge to
any fills you’ve applied to the selection. The higher the Feather setting, the
softer the edge. A higher Feather setting also extends your fill or other
edits, such as filter effects, far beyond the actual selection.
A polygon is a multisided shape, such as a hexagon, an octagon, and any
other three-or-more-sided shape. Triangles are polygons, as are squares and
rectangles. The Marquee tool selects rectangles and squares, but what if
you want to select a triangular shape or a shape that looks like a big sun-
burst? You use the Polygonal Lasso. From simple shapes to complex, many-
sided stars, the Polygonal Lasso tool gives you freeform selections with the
precision of straight sides and sharp corners.
The tool works easily enough, and you can make it select just about any size
or shape on your image by following these steps:
1. Click the Polygonal Lasso tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
2. Make sure the layer you want to edit is the active layer; use the
Layers palette to make your choice.
3. Click the point in your image where you want to begin making the
selection.
4. Click the point where you want to create the first corner.
This creates the first side, and you can now draw the next side. Don’t
drag the mouse; just click where you want the corners to appear. 
5. Continue clicking until you’ve drawn all the sides that your selection
needs.
6. Come back to the starting point, and click (double-click if you’re using
the Mac) to close the shape and create the selection.
It’s important to note that you can make your sides as small as you want
(just a few pixels in length) or as long as you want. You can select the edges
of complex shapes by drawing many short sides. You may find this handy
when there isn’t enough color difference between pixels to use the Magnetic
Lasso tool effectively.
Selecting magnetically
If you’d like to select a particular object and if that object is a different color
or shade than the objects touching it, you can use the Magnetic Lasso to
select it. The Magnetic Lasso works by following the edges of content in
your image, comparing pixels as you drag your mouse, and automatically
snapping to the edges where pixel values vary enough, based on your set-
tings for the tool’s options. The controls on the Magnetic Lasso Options bar
allow you to configure the Magnetic Lasso’s sensitivity, detail, and the
number of pixels it’s comparing as you move along your desired path. The
Pen Pressure option may be dimmed unless you’re using an accessory
drawing device.
265

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Before using the Magnetic Lasso, try adjusting the following settings:
✦Width: Sets how far from the mouse path (as you drag) the pixel com-
parisons will be made.
✦Edge Contrast: Sets the sensitivity anywhere from 1% to 100%. The higher
the percentage, the higher the contrast must be between compared pixels
before the Magnetic Lasso snaps to pixels to build the selection.
✦Frequency: Changes the number of fastening points, or nodes, you see
along the line, as shown in Figure 14-6. Fastening points help to direct
the line along the edge of the object.
To use the Magnetic Lasso tool, you follow a procedure that’s similar to the
one you use for the Lasso and Polygonal Lasso, with minor variations:
1. Make sure you have the correct layer selected so that changes you
make after creating the selection apply to the right content.
2. Click the Magnetic Lasso tool in the Tool palette to select it.
3. Make any necessary changes to the tool’s settings so that it will work
to the best of its ability within the photo at hand.
You can adjust the width of the Magnetic Lasso’s attraction, how many
points it lays down, and the amount of contrast that must be present
for the attraction to take hold. The default values work best in most
situations.
4. Click the image to begin your selection.
5. Move the cursor and click along the edge of the desired object.
A click redirects the line whenever it begins to veer off the path you’d
like it to follow.
6. When your moving and clicking take you back to the starting point,
click the starting point to finish the selection.
Clicking to redirect the Magnetic Lasso’s path is especially helpful if you get
to a section of the photo where there isn’t very much difference between
the color and brightness of the pixels and the object you’re trying to select.
Sometimes, the Edge Contrast setting won’t help you, and you have to redi-
rect the selection yourself, or use the other Lasso tools to augment or reduce
the selection after using the Magnetic Lasso to make the main selection.
Has your Magnetic Lasso gone crazy, and you can’t bring it back into line by
clicking and moving? Press the Esc (Escape) key to abandon the current
selection and start over.

Chapter 14
Making Selections
Using the Selection Brush Tool
Abracadabra! The Magic Wand Tool
The Magic Wand tool selects based on color. If you want to select all the
flesh tones on a face or all the green leaves on a tree, just turn on this tool
and click somewhere on the face or on a particular leaf, and the rest of the
face or tree that matches the original pixel’s brightness level and color is
selected. You can make adjustments to the way the tool works, increasing
or decreasing the Tolerance level required for a match, which will increase
or decrease the number of pixels that are selected when you click the
mouse on the image. The higher the Tolerance level you set, the wider the
range of pixels included in the selection.
Making and adjusting selections based on color
You can augment your selection (without changing selection modes) by
pressing and holding the Shift key as you click the image.
To reduce the amount of the image that’s selected, press the Alt key (Option
if you’re on a Mac) and click an area that’s selected. The pixels in that area
are removed from the selection, and you can continue adding to the selec-
tion elsewhere, or simply perform whatever edit you’d planned for the
color-based selection.
Controlling the magic
To increase or decrease the threshold for the tool’s selections, adjust the
Tolerance setting on the Options bar. The higher the Tolerance you set, the
more pixels that Photoshop Elements sees as a close match for the original
pixel that you clicked. If you set the Tolerance to a very low number (15 or
less is considered low), you’ll find that very few pixels meet the selection
criteria.
Another setting that’s useful for controlling the selection made by the Magic
Wand is the Contiguous option. This option, when checked, limits the selec-
tion to those pixels touching the original pixel you clicked, and to the pixels
touching those pixels, and so on. If you want to select pixels that aren’t
touching the original and the first batch selected, uncheck this option, or
use the Shift key and click elsewhere in the image.
Using the Selection Brush Tool
Ah, but you’re not done yet: Photoshop Elements offers tools that go beyond
the normal selection tools that you’d find in just about any image-editing
application. By giving you the ability to paint your selections with a familiar
tool — the Brush — you can make very fine or very large selections quickly
and easily.
In addition, both applications offer a Select menu, which you can use to
control the existing selection, no matter which selection tool you used to
make it.
267

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Photoshop Elements offers the Selection Brush tool (see Figure 14-7, which
shows the tool active, with its Options bar along the top). You can use this
tool to select a snaking, freeform line by dragging your mouse in any design
you desire.
You can set the size and style of the brush, and you can also set the brush
to Selection or Mask mode:
✦Selection mode simply creates a freeform, snaking selection that fol-
lows that path of your mouse as you drag. You can paint over and over
in an area to select a shape rather than a snaking line, or you can use a
very big brush to select a large area with a single stroke.
✦Mask mode places a light red wash over the whole image, except for the
places where you dragged the Selection Brush tool. If you made no
selection prior to entering Mask mode, your strokes with the Selection
Brush create the masked areas. Masked areas are excluded from your
selection, and if you revert to Selection mode, your masked areas won’t
be affected by any subsequent editing in the form of painting, filling,
deletion, or the use of the commands Edit, Copy and Edit, Cut.
Using the Select Menu
You use the Select menu to control and manipulate your existing selections,
to create selections, and to deselect areas that are currently selected. Many
of the menu commands also have keyboard shortcuts.
One of the most convenient commands on the Select menu is the Inverse
command, which you can use to turn a mask into a selection, or a selection
into a mask. If you selected an area with one of the selection tools, you can
invert that selection so that everything but that area is selected and editable.
Conversely, if you use the Brush Selector in Mask mode to make a mask,
you can invert that mask so that the previously masked and uneditable area
is now the selected, editable area.

Digital Images’ Imperfections
In This Chapter
 Mastering the use of brushes and pencils
 Customizing the Brush and Pencil tools for specific jobs
 Finding third-party brush sets online
T
he painting tools in Photoshop Elements have many uses when it comes
to creating original artwork. You can paint pictures from scratch, starting
with a white or transparent background, and paint or draw anything from the
realistic to the abstract. These original works of art can end up in print, on
the Web, or both. But this is a minibook about working with digital images, so
in this chapter, I focus on their use for retouching and editing photographs.
Elements contains four major painting and drawing tools: the Brush tool,
the Impressionist Brush, the Pencil, and the Airbrush (which is actually a
specialized option for the standard Brush tool). This chapter concentrates
on the Brush and Pencil tools — you can find more on the Impressionist
Brush (which paints using artsy brush strokes) in Photoshop Elements 2 For
Dummies, by Deke McClelland and Galen Fott (published by Wiley).
Working with Brushes and Pencils
Elements’ brushes and pencils are easy to use and customize and can apply
a wide variety of colors, textures, and special effects. Painting and drawing
with Photoshop Elements mostly requires a steady hand and the proper
view — you want to be zoomed in close enough to see what you’re doing if
you’re retouching a small spot or rebuilding some details lost to damage or
fading. Figure 15-1 shows an extremely magnified view of a portion of an
image, and the Brush at work filling in a scratch.
Figure 15-1:

a scratch,
one pixel at
a time.
269

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
You can also paint larger areas, filling in space lost to a tear or to add a col-
ored frame around an image. To create new content where none existed
before, paint lines or shapes or simply apply a wash of color to a black-and-
white or faded color photo for an interesting effect. Whatever your painting
or drawing goal, these two applications offer the right tools for the job.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool can paint tiny dots, short strokes, or longer lines as small as
a single pixel in width or as large as several hundred pixels. Using the tool is
easy. Just click it on the Tool palette (or press B) to activate it, and drag or
click (or both) on the image. You want to make sure that you’re painting on
the appropriate layer first, of course. 
If you want to control the way the Brush tool applies paint, you can change
the following settings before you start painting:
✦Color: The color or tone painted by the brush
✦Size: The size of the brush
✦Mode: How the pixels painted by the brush blend with existing pixels
✦Opacity: The transparency of the pixels
✦Airbrush: Changes any Brush tool to a fuzzy airbrush effect
With the exception of color, you can adjust all these settings from the tool’s
Options bar. The settings listed here are those that you’d want to adjust
whenever you’re painting. More elaborate changes would be needed in
fewer and more specific cases.
Color is the one setting that you can’t set from the Options bar, but you can
set it through the Color Picker. You can open the Color Picker by clicking the
Tool palette’s Set Foreground Color button, shown in Figure 15-2. From within
the Color Picker (shown in Figure 15-3), you can choose a color by eye, by
setting color levels (RGB, CMYK, HSB, LAB, depending on which application
you’re using), or by entering a hexadecimal number if it’s a Web-safe color
from that prescribed palette.
If you want to paint with a color currently in use elsewhere in the image or in
another open image, click the toolbar’s Eye Dropper tool and sample (click)
the color you want to use. That color becomes the new foreground color.
Working with the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool works much like the Brush. The only real difference is the
nature of the line drawn. Just like you’d expect a paintbrush to apply a rela-
tively soft line, you’d expect a pencil to draw a sharper line, depending on
the hardness of the lead. The Pencil tool works just as you’d expect and
also offers its own set of adjustments through the Options bar — you can
control the Pencil’s size and opacity so that you can make whatever large or
small edits are required.

Working with Brushes and Pencils
Use the Pencil’s settings to control the size, mode, and opacity of the line
you draw, and choose from a smaller set of styles — most of them solid, fine
lines. The Options bar has an Auto Erase option, which allows you to draw
the background color over any pixels currently colored in the foreground
color and to apply the foreground color only where no color is currently
applied. The name Auto Erase is sort of confusing because no real erasing
occurs, but you get the idea. Figure 15-4 shows the Pencil in use, applying a
sketchy fill to a frame around a photo. The frame was created with two rec-
tangular selections, one inside the other.

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Customizing Your Brushes and Pencils
Beyond the basic adjustments that you can make with the Brush and Pencil
tools’ Options bars, you can work with an additional set of options in
Photoshop Elements (see Figure 15-5).
The success of your brush and the direct effect of setting the right size and
shape for it are the same. Photoshop Elements offers a list of Brush Presets
in the form of a drop-down list, accompanied by a separate Size setting, and
the More Options button.
To change the shape of your brush in Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
1. Click the Brush tool on the Tool palette to activate it.
2. Using the Options bar, set the style and size of the brush, using the
drop-down list and slider, respectively.
3. Click the brush next to More Options on the Options bar.

4. In the resulting dialog box, shown in Figure 15-6, adjust the angle by
entering a number or by dragging the arrow in a clockwise or coun-
terclockwise direction.
You may find that a specific angle is more desirable for painting the kind
of strokes you want, and you can use this setting to set that angle.
5. Adjust the Roundness setting the same way — by entering a number
or by dragging the big black dots closer to or farther away from the
center of the sample brush shape (see Figure 15-7).

Obtaining third-party brush sets
The brush sets that come with Photoshop Elements
are fairly extensive, but you may pine for more of
them. A quick online search will net you several sites
where third-party brush sets are available, usually
for a small charge. Some sites probably offer
brushes for free, but these are not in abundance.
Here’s a site that I recommend you check out:
www.sapphire-innovations.com/
products/prd_ps_brushes.htm
This site is chock-full of interesting new brushes. In
fact, you can buy the entire collection on a single
CD for $30. (And when I say that the CD collection
contains almost 9,000 royalty-free mixed-design
brushes, you get an idea of just how much fun you
can have customizing the Brush tool in Elements!)

Dragging inward makes for a horizontally flatter brush while dragging
outward makes the brush vertically flatter.

Hardness), whose names are self-explanatory.
7. Click your image to begin painting or click somewhere on the work-
space to close the More Options box.

 Healing wounded photos
A
dobe’s image-editing applications do a great job of fixing problem
images. Some of the most common problems you’ll encounter with
your photos, both old and new, relate to lighting, clarity, detail, and damage
caused by poor storage methods. Even a vintage photo, if it was properly
stored, won’t show unacceptable signs of age. However, any photo that was
stored in a drawer or put in a frame and exposed to direct sunlight for years
will start to look a little old, a bit shabby, and probably lose much of its
detail and depth. The photo may also have scratches and scuffs, as shown
in Figure 16-1, which displays a photo with several problems that require
the restorative tools of Photoshop Elements.
This chapter focuses on some of the tools available to you for repairing
your digital images.

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Adding Light and Shadows
Whether due to fading over time or poor original photographic technique,
many of your photos may need more light or more shadows — or more of
both — in different areas of the same photo. What to do? The Photoshop
Elements Dodge and Burn tools to the rescue!
Using the Dodge tool to lighten tones
The Dodge tool lightens your image. The process is simple:
1. Click the Dodge tool in the Tool palette to activate it. 
2. Observe the Options bar and decide whether you need to make
changes to the range of tones that will be affected or the exposure
(degree of intensity) that the tool will apply.
The Range drop-down menu determines which tones the Dodge tool
affects: Shadows (the dark areas), Highlights (the light areas), or
Midtones (everything in between). Most of the time, you want to stick to
Midtones, but if you want to open up some inky shadows or darken
areas that are a little washed out, you can do that, too.
The Exposure menu determines how rapidly the lightening occurs. You
may lighten too much, too quickly, if you use a high value. A value between
15 and 35 percent enables you to lighten slowly. You can always return to
an area and lighten it some more if you haven’t applied enough dodging.
3. Using the Options bar, set the size of the brush you’ll use to apply the
light. 
You can choose the kind of brush you use just as you would the ordi-
nary Brush tool (which I describe in Chapter 15 of Book I). Both use the
same Brush palette.
4. Drag over the area to be lightened, or click a single spot, such as a
face or some other distinct area that’s suffering from too much
shadow.
If your image isn’t very crisp and detailed and you have no desire to make 
it that way, use one of the textured brush settings for the Dodge tool. This
can apply light in a dappled or mottled way, matching the image’s overall
look — perhaps a desirable one, in the case of vintage photos.
Burning your image to darken areas
The opposite of the Dodge tool, the Burn tool darkens areas. This can bring
out facial features lost to a sunny day, faded details in clothing or a garden,
or add depth lost to a photo that’s faded with time or exposure to sunlight.
To use the Burn tool in either Photoshop or Elements, follow these simple
steps:
1. Click the Burn tool in the Tool palette to activate it. 
2. Check the Options bar for any adjustments you’d like to make. 
276

Book I
Chapter 16
Restoring Images
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
You can adjust the range and exposure, which respectively control which
elements of the image (Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights) are affected by
the Burning process and how quickly the darkening process takes place.
3. Choose a brush size from the Brush palette used for all Photoshop
brushlike tools.
4. Begin darkening your image by dragging over the areas to be made
more shadowy or by clicking a single spot. 
Figure 16-2 shows a face being darkened by a single click with a brush
that’s set to the same diameter as the face.
Don’t go too far with the Burn tool. If your image is color, excessive use of
the tool creates a brownish, singed look that literally looks as though the
image was burned. If your image is in black and white or grayscale, this
won’t happen; the worst that can occur is that your burned areas look so
dark that their details may be obliterated.
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
When it comes to retouching photos with Photoshop Elements, you’ll prob-
ably use the Sharpen and Blur tools frequently. These tools are good for
heightening or diffusing details in some or all of an image or along the edges
of content that’s been pasted into the picture from elsewhere. The Smudge
tool is also a powerful ally, but you may find that good mouse skills are
required before you can successfully use it. Figure 16-3 shows these three
tools — each of which has its own spot on the toolbox.
Although the Sharpen tool’s name clearly indicates what it does, the Blur
and Smudge tool names might lead you to believe that the tools essentially
do the same thing. In reality, the Blur tool is a more finely grained tool than
the Smudge tool is in terms of its results. Whether applied to a small area or
painted over a large field, the Blur tool’s effects are uniform. The Smudge
tool’s effects are entirely dependent on the length and direction of your
mouse or pen strokes. Figure 16-4 shows side-by-side Blur and Smudge
effects. The Blur tool was used on the left eye and cheek; the Smudge tool
was used on the right eye and bridge of the nose.

a specific

277

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
What the three tools have in common is how highly dependent they are upon
their Options bar settings or, rather, how dependent you are on the settings.
Without controlling how drastic or subtle an effect these tools have, you
may end up with very little blurring or too much sharpening — or perhaps
some smudging that makes you look like you were drunk when you tried to
retouch the photo. Figure 16-5 shows an image where the Sharpen tool was
taken a bit too far. Instead of adding contrast between pixels (to make them
all stand out just a bit), the result is a very unpleasant effect — definitely not
what you’d want.

Chapter 16
Restoring Images
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
Finger-painting to blend colors and textures
The Smudge tool is used to drag color from one spot to another spot right
next to it. Think of it as working the way your fingertips work if you’re
blending pastels or chalk on paper. The smudging process can smooth an
edge or blend two adjoining colors. You can also turn on a Finger Painting
option and bring the current foreground color into the mix, smearing it into
the image at whatever point you’re dragging the mouse.
To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Smudge tool in the Tool palette to activate it. 
2. Using the Options bar, change the setting in the Strength drop-down
menu to make the smudging more dramatic (a high percentage) or
subtle (a low percentage).
3. If you’d also like the Smudge tool to adjust the lights, darks, tones,
and colors of the area that’s smudged, choose an appropriate setting
in the Mode drop-down menu. 
The Mode setting controls how the original pixels and smudged pixels
are blended together. Here are your options:
• Normal: This option doesn’t change to the quality of the colors or
tones where you smudge. They just get smudged.
• Darken: In addition to smudging, a Burn tool effect is applied.
• Lighten: In addition to smudging, a Dodge tool effect is applied.
• Hue: This option smudges only the hue of one area onto another,
dragging the shade from your starting point onto another adjoining
area of the image.
• Saturation: By smudging with this setting in place, you’re smudging
the color intensity rather than the image content.
• Color: Smudge color from one area to another without distorting the
physical content.
• Luminosity: This option smudges the brightness of your starting point
onto the adjoining areas through which you drag the Smudge tool.
4. Set the brush size using the Brush palette.
5. Click and drag to smudge the image. 
You pull color from the starting point onto the ending point.
The last four Mode options allow you to adjust the color and quality of the
color as you smudge. I recommend that you tinker with the area using other
color- and hue-adjustment tools first, and then smudge in Normal mode.
Don’t use the Smudge tool to smudge large areas of your image. Although
you can use a large brush size and make a big smudge, you’ll regret it,
because you’ll end up distorting the image instead of blending areas within
it. For the best results, use a small brush and use it in small areas.
279

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Using the Sharpen tool to add detail
The Sharpen tool heightens the contrast between adjacent pixels so that
each pixel stands out more. This can help you take a blurry or faded photo
and improve the apparent detail in the image. You can bring out small fea-
tures, textures, and the like by making the pixels in and around them more
diverse. The Sharpen tool lives all by itself on its own button on the Tool
palette in Photoshop Elements.
To sharpen some or all of your image, follow these steps:
1. To control the area in which the sharpening will take place, use a
selection tool — Marquee, Lasso, or Wand — from the Tool palette to
select an area within the photo.
2. Click the Sharpen tool to activate it.
3. Use the Brush palette to adjust the brush size and whether you want a
hard-edged or soft-edged brush.
A smaller brush enables you to sharpen a very specific area, whereas a
larger brush heightens pixel diversity in a wider area, with more gener-
alized results.
4. Reduce or increase the intensity of the sharpening effect by adjusting
the Strength setting from its default of 50%.
Be careful not to sharpen too much, or you’ll end up with pixels that are
so bright and diverse that detail can actually be lost.
5. From the Mode drop-down menu, choose the Mode setting you want
for the Sharpen tool.
The Mode setting controls how the pixels are blended. The modes are the
same as those for the Smudge tool — described in the preceding section’s
steps list — and include Color, Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity. Normal
mode is good for most jobs.
6. Click and/or drag over the area to be sharpened.
You can go over the same spot more than once, but again, don’t go too
far. Subtle effects are usually preferable to the overly dramatic.
Sharpen and Blur filters are available through the Filter menu in Photoshop
Elements. You can achieve more uniform results with them than with the
brush-applied Sharpen and Blur tools because the mouse is removed from
the equation. The filter is applied evenly over the selected area or the entire
active layer of the image.
Blurring some or all of your image
The Blur tool is the Sharpen tool’s opposite. Instead of increasing the diver-
sity between adjoining pixels, the pixels are made more similar, with their
color and light levels adjusted so that no individual pixels stand out too
much. Obviously, you can blur a lot or blur a little, and the degree to which
the tool is applied determines how much diversity is removed from the
pixels you brush over with the Blur tool. Figure 16-6 shows an image with
280

Book I
Chapter 16
Restoring Images
Using Smudging, Sharpening, and Blurring Tools
varying degrees of blurring applied. Subtle blurring smoothed blotches on
the boy’s face and hands; more drastic blurring made surrounding content
fade into the background.
To use the Blur tool, follow these steps:
1. If you want to restrict the blurring to a particular area of the image,
use the appropriate selection tool (Marquee, Lasso, Magic Wand) on
the Tool palette to select that area.
2. Click the Blur tool to activate it.
3. Observe the tool’s options when they appear on the Options bar.
4. Adjust the setting in the Strength drop-down menu (it’s set to 50% by
default) to increase or decrease the amount of blurring that each
click or stroke applies to the image.
Obviously, a low setting results in very subtle effects.
5. Set the brush size and type (such as hard- or soft-edged) for the area
you’ll be blurring using the Brush palette.
Use the smallest brush you can if you need to blur a very small or
detailed area. If you want to blur a large area, use a large brush so that
you can avoid the obvious signs of retracing your steps with the tool.
6. Click or drag over the area to be blurred.
You may find that some scrubbing with the mouse is required if you
want to get rid of a very sharp edge between two parts of the image.
Figure 16-7 shows the edge of content that was pasted into a photo, and
the Blur tool is making the edge disappear so that the pasted content
looks like it was always there.
Sometimes, you can use the Blur tool to make another part of the image seem
sharper in comparison. For example, if the Sharpen tool is having undesirable
effects on your image, use the Blur tool to soften or remove the details sur-
rounding the parts of the image to which you want to draw attention.

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
Photoshop Elements has a number of tools that are considered purely
restorative tools. They’re intended for removing the signs of age, wear and
tear, and outright damage in the form of tears, rips, scratches, and missing
content.
The Red Eye Brush tool gets rid of that demonic pupil caused by the flash
bouncing off the subject’s retina.
You can also find a Clone Stamp tool, which copies undamaged content and
allows you to paint it over damaged areas. You can do this to replace miss-
ing content, cover up damaged content, or simply edit the content of the
image by painting over things you don’t want. The Clone Stamp obscures
any detail being copied over.
The Clone Stamp isn’t purely a restorative tool. It has many uses in the cre-
ation of original artwork and in images that aren’t photographic in nature.
Its restorative uses are extensive, however, so I’ve grouped it here with the
healing tools.
Cloning content to cover damage 
and unwanted content
The Clone Stamp duplicates content from one place and allows you to click
and place it one or more times in the image, covering existing content (thus
the term stamp in the tool’s name). Figure 16-8 shows the Clone Stamp used
in a very obvious way — if only to show its effect. Unlike the Patch tool, the
stamped content is not matched to the surrounding pixels in the target
area. If you stamp green grass on a blue couch, you get green grass on a
blue couch — you don’t get a blue, grassy texture on a blue couch.

Finding Relief with the Healing Tools
To use the Clone Stamp, follow these steps:
1. Verify the layer you’re in, making sure that the layer containing the
content you want to clone is highlighted in the Layer palette.
You can switch to another layer later when you stamp the content onto
the image.
2. Click the Clone Stamp tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
The Options bar appears, offering several settings that you can tweak to
control how the tool is applied, including
• Brush: This pop-up palette at the left side of the Options bar contains
the brush styles you set for painting, erasing, or using any brush-
applied tool. Pick a brush from the palette based on your target area,
going for a size that’s just a bit smaller than the area you want to
stamp over — so that you don’t leave an obvious edge to a single
stamping of content. With two or more stamps in the area, you can
avoid a clumsily pasted look.
• Mode: When the cloned content is pasted, you can choose a mode to
control how the pixels are merged. The Mode controls are discussed
in the section “Finger-painting to blend colors and textures,” earlier
in this chapter. Normal works for most jobs, but you may want to
experiment.
• Opacity: If you want to see through your stamped content, reduce
the opacity from the default 100%.
• Aligned: This keeps the same distance/offset between the sampled
spot (where you clicked the Alt key, or Option key on the Mac) and
the stamped area. If you leave this check box unchecked (off), by
default the cloned location keeps changing as you move your mouse
and continue stamping.
• Use All Layers: If you want your cloning and stamping to use and
affect your image as it appears when all the layers are visible, check
this option. It’s unchecked (off) by default, just so you don’t make
more of an impact on your entire image than you may have intended.

3. Customize the tool as needed.
Now you’re ready to clone and stamp.
4. To clone the spot that will be used to cover unwanted content, hold
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while you click the spot
that you want to clone.
The mouse pointer changes when you’re in clone mode, and a crosshair
appears in the center of your brush point.
5. Release the Alt key (Option key on the Mac), and apply the cloned
content by clicking to cover the unwanted content. Feel free to apply
multiple copies of the cloned content over a larger area.
Removing red-eye
Another tool that Photoshop Elements users can call their own is the Red
Eye Brush tool. This tool literally allows you to click or paint away those
glowing pupils that affect pets, children, or anyone else wide-eyed and close
enough to the camera and its overzealous flash. Figure 16-9 shows a poor
feline in dire need of red-eye treatment.
Using the Red Eye Brush requires use of the Options bar, if only so that you
can tell Elements which color you’d like to use in place of the demonic glow.
You can allow Elements to pick for you, or you can select the color manually.
To use the Red Eye Brush, follow these steps to customize the tool’s effects
and apply them to the glowing eyes in question:
1. Check to see that the layer with the demonic eyes is in fact the active
layer in the Layers palette. 
2. Click the Red Eye Brush tool in the Tool palette to activate it, and con-
sider the following options:
• Brush presets: Choose the brush style you want to use from the first
drop-down menu on the left. A solid brush is preferable. If your image
is slightly blurry, you might want to choose one with soft edges.
• Brush size: Pick a brush size that matches the diameter of the pupil
you’ll be fixing.

• Sampling method: The default is First Click, and the alternative is
Current Color, meaning that whatever color is currently showing in
the Current Color box is used as the bad pupil color, and any pupil in
that shade is replaced with the Replacement color.
• Tolerance: This sets the threshold for spotting the sampled color
within the pupil when you click to apply the Red Eye Brush tool. A
higher number raises the bar and applies the Replacement color less
liberally. A lower number lowers the threshold, and more of the pupil
is recolored, even the parts that aren’t actually glowing.
Note that the other options (Current, Replacement, and the Default
Colors option button) come into play later as you use the brush.
3. Set your Current color, which is the color of the glowing portion of
the pupil.
I prefer to set this myself, using the First Click sampling option. With this
Sampling mode in place, click the portion of the pupil that’s glowing.
4. Set the Replacement color.
If you click the displayed color, you open the Color Picker, from which
you can choose the color that the pupil should be.
If you click the Default Colors button, the Current color becomes red,
and the Replacement color is set to black.
5. Click the pupil to apply the Replacement color. 
The glow is removed in favor of the color you selected. If the pupil is
larger than your brush or not shaped like your brush tip, you may have
to drag to apply the Replacement color to the entire glowing area.
6. If both eyes are glowing (they usually are), you can repeat this
process for the second eye. 
Figure 16-10 shows both eyes exorcised, with no eerie glow remaining.
Be careful not to apply the same exact pupil color to both eyes. Usually, the
lighting on the individual eyes is slightly different, which affects both the
glow you’re trying to get rid of and the desired pupil color. If you apply too
dark or too large a pupil, the results look fake.

Funny, and Funky Colors
In This Chapter
 Mastering the color balancing act
 Controlling the intensity of color
 Improving color quality overall
P
hotos displayed on a sunny wall or desk can fade from the exposure to 
sunshine, even if you live in a rainy climate. You’d be surprised how
sunlight can fade a photo if it’s exposed for long enough. Time can fade
photos, especially those that were shot long ago, with old negatives, printed
on old photo paper. You can also have photos that looked a bit odd from
the start — perhaps they contained too much red or green, or the colors
looked washed out from the minute you had the photo developed or cap-
tured it with your digital camera.
Regardless of the cause, color photos present a whole host of color bal-
ance, level, and quality issues, and Photoshop Elements is well prepared to 
deal with them. Photoshop Elements delivers an entire toolbox of photo-
retouching features, including a number of ways to manually and automati-
cally adjust color levels and quality.
Adjusting Color Balance
Say a photo has too much red or yellow, or the whole picture is too dark or
too light. These problems — problems you might think would require multi-
ple tools and several steps to solve — might be just a couple of clicks away
from their solutions. Between automatic color- and lighting-adjustment tools
(as well as commands that address specific color levels) you have the power
to make sweeping changes to your photos or sections thereof, significantly
shortening the amount of time you spend editing and improving your photos.
Adjusting color levels
In Elements, the Levels command is squirreled away under the Enhance➪
Adjust Brightness/Contrast submenu.
The Levels command allows you to set the highlights and shadows in an
image by dragging three Input Levels sliders (in this case a set of three
black, gray, and white triangles along the slider axis) to adjust the Levels
histogram. A histogram is a visual representation of quantities — in this
case, levels of tones. The sliders shown in Figure 17-1 allow you to adjust
levels of shadows, midtones, and highlights.
287

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
As you drag the Input Levels sliders (note that only the Midtones slider can
be moved on its own), you see the levels of light and dark changing in the
photo. You can control the effects by using the Set Black Point, Set Gray
Point, and Set White Point eyedroppers to click pixels in your image. As you
do this, you see the image change accordingly.
While in the Levels dialog box, double-click each eyedropper in turn to open
the Color Picker so that you can choose new colors for these three levels
(Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights). Alternatively, you can choose new
color levels by clicking existing shades within the image. As you make your
selections (using the Color Picker or the image itself) and OK them, you see
the results in your image.
Using the Color Variations dialog box
The Color Variations command enables you to view a series of thumbnails,
each showing a different color or contrast effect. To access the Color Vari-
ations dialog box (shown in Figure 17-2), choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Color Variations. Clicking the Darken thumbnail in this dialog box, for exam-
ple, shows you how adding more black to the image will affect it. If color
adjustment is your goal, you can see what will happen if you bump up the
Blue component by clicking Increase Blue.
You can view the effects of multiple changes, such as making the image
lighter, adding more of one or more colors, or switching between the Mid-
tones, Shadows, Highlights, and Saturation option buttons. No matter what
variations you’re considering, Elements shows an after version of the image.
To return the image to its original tones and colors, click Reset Image.
Equalizing colors
The Equalize command has been christened with a name that clearly tells
you what it does. Found on the Image➪Adjustments submenu, the command
evenly distributes color over the range of brightness levels throughout your
image (or in a selected area) from 0 to 255. When you issue the Equalize
command, Elements locates the brightest and darkest pixels and then
adjusts the rest of the colors, making white the brightest value and black
the darkest. All the colored pixels that fall between these two extremes are
equalized, or made to fall between the two extreme shades.

Adjusting Color Balance
If you don’t select part of your image before choosing Image➪Adjustments➪
Equalize, no dialog box appears, and the changes just take place automati-
cally over the entire image. If you make a selection first, the Equalize dialog
box appears, as shown in Figure 17-3.
Use this dialog box to indicate whether you want to equalize the selected
area only or equalize the entire image based on the selected area. In Figure
17-4, only part of the image is equalized, and it’s easy to spot it. Therefore,
be careful that you don’t make the rest of your image look shabby by
improving just a small amount so drastically.
Remember that the Equalize command affects each image differently. The
effect depends on how damaged, faded, and light or dark the image was to
begin with. Don’t assume that, if equalization was a big problem solver in
one photo, it will be as successful with another.

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Fixing a color cast
A color cast is a tinge — a shade of red or maybe yellow — that discolors
your image in whole or in part. Casts occur for a variety of reasons, includ-
ing the age of the photo, the quality of your scanner (if you scanned a
printed original), the print from which you scanned the image, or the film
used to take the picture. If a cast appears in an image captured with a digi-
tal camera, you need to reset something on the digital camera (what you
change and how you change it varies by camera). A digital camera is rarely
the culprit, however. Your cast probably came from a print, film, or age
problem instead.
So now that you know what a cast is, how do you get rid of it? Use the Color
Cast command in Elements to rid an image of any unpleasant preponder-
ance of a single color. To get rid of a color cast, follow these steps:
1. Open the image with the unwanted color cast.
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Cast from the menu bar. 
The Color Cast Correction dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-5,
offering instructions.
3. Use the dialog box’s Eyedropper tool (already activated within the
dialog box) to click the gray, then white, and then black points in the
image.
As you click in the image (about three times — one for gray, one for
white, one for black), the color cast in the photo changes. 
Continue clicking different spots until you like the results, or bail out
entirely by clicking Cancel.

Working with Color Intensity and Quality
Make sure you leave the Preview check box selected in the Color Cast
Correction dialog box. Most applications offer a Preview capability in dialog
boxes that adjust visual elements. Leaving this feature on means you don’t
have to apply the changes just to see them in your image. If you do apply
them by clicking OK and then decide you don’t like the change, choose
Edit➪Undo.
Working with Color Intensity and Quality
Automatic tools that ask nothing or just a few questions and then make
global corrections to color and light may fail you. In these situations, Photo-
shop Elements can help. It provides targeted tools that you can apply 
manually to adjust color, lighting, brightness, and contrast. Whatever your
photo’s color difficulty is, chances are that these tools offer a quick and
easy solution:
✦The Sponge tool for saturating and desaturating color
✦The Brightness/Contrast dialog box
✦The Curve dialog box, for adjusting individual colors
Increasing and decreasing color intensity
The Sponge tool adds color (in Saturate mode) or removes color (in Desatu-
rate mode), depending on how you set up the tool.
The Sponge tool can come in handy if you added too much color in a previ-
ous editing session, and the edit can’t be undone. Or perhaps you simply
want a more subtle, faded look to some or all of an image. New photos are
often faded to look more vintage or in preparation for the use of an artistic
filter that will make the photo look like a drawing or painting.
Regardless of your motivation, the Sponge tool is simple to use. 
Figure 17-5:

291

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
To saturate or desaturate color, follow these steps:
1. Click the Sponge tool in the Tool palette to activate it.
2. Choose Saturate or Desaturate mode by using the tool’s Options bar.
3. Adjust the flow — how much saturation or desaturation occurs — by
using the Flow drop-down menu. In some Mac versions of Photoshop
Elements, Pressure does the same thing.
4. From the Brush drop-down menu, choose the right brush size for the
area to be sponged.
A small brush may give you undesirable results when used in a large
area, and a big brush may go too far. Choose a brush size that enables
you to fix the problem area with the least amount of clicks or brush
strokes.
5. Apply the Sponge to the image by clicking and/or dragging to add or
remove color where desired.
Passing over the same spot more than once intensifies the Sponge effect.
You wash out or add more color on each successive pass.
Tinkering with brightness and contrast
Although automatic tools can correct brightness and contrast, you may
want to control these levels manually. To do so, choose Enhance➪Adjust
Brightness/Contrast➪Brightness/Contrast in Photoshop Elements. This
command opens the Brightness/Contrast dialog box, shown in Figure 17-6,
which offers two sliders. One adjusts the brightness, and the other adjusts
the contrast.

F
ilters allow you to apply groups of effects and formats to your images,
whether to a selected area or to the entire image on one or more of its
layers. You can use filters to change the color and texture of your images 
or to add patterns. Each filter that you find in Photoshop Elements enables
you to control the way the filter affects your image, and most filters give you
a preview so that you don’t have to apply the filter to your image until you
see how it will look.
It’s beyond the scope of this book to tell you everything you need to know
about using filters; however, this chapter certainly gets you started using
these fascinating tools.
Working with Filters
For the purposes of a minibook on digital-photo editing, the filters I discuss
fall into three categories: corrective, artistic, and special effects. As it just
so happens, these are the kinds of filters you’re likely to use to retouch
photos for personal or professional use. As for the filters that fall outside
these categories, you can take your newly found knowledge of the filters
covered in this chapter and apply it when you experiment with other filters.
Just think of the fun you’ll have with the trial and error process!
Understanding how filters work
When you open the Filter menu, you see all the filter categories, each fol-
lowed by a right-pointing triangle that opens a submenu. Most of the cate-
gories have at least four filters in their submenus, and most of them have
several filters to choose from.
Just about all the Filter commands work through dialog boxes, enabling you
to both preview and customize the filters’ effects. Figure 18-1 shows the
Smart Blur filter dialog box.
293

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
Before I discuss individual filters, consider these important filtering tips:
✦You can apply filters only to the active layer and only if that layer is visi-
ble. If your photo has only one layer, this is a moot point.
✦You can limit the filter’s effects to a selection by using the various selec-
tion tools before applying a filter.
✦If you don’t make a selection before you apply a filter, the filter is applied
to the entire active layer.
✦Certain filters work only with certain file types. If your file type doesn’t
support a certain filter, the filter command is dimmed in the submenu.
Not all filters have a dialog box. Elements applies these single-step filters
the instant you click the command in the Filter menu, within a particular
category’s submenu. The downside is that you have no control over the
effects, although you can select a section of your image beforehand. If you
don’t like the results, you can easily use the Undo command or the History
palette to get rid of the effect.
Fixing flaws with corrective filters
Corrective filters improve the quality of the image without distorting it,
changing the content significantly, or applying any stylized effect. The three
most appropriate corrective filters for a discussion of digital photos fall into
three Filter menu categories: Blur, Sharpen, and Noise.
These three categories contain several filters, each performing a relatively
subtle effect, depending on the settings you employ in the available dialog
boxes.
Blur filters
Use the Blur filters (Blur, Blur More, Gaussian Blur, Motion Blur, Radial Blur,
and Smart Blur) to soften the content of your image. The Motion and Radial
blurs do a bit more than soften. They actually give the appearance of circular
Figure 18-1:

settings.
294

Book I
Chapter 18

Special Effects
Working with Filters
movement (Radial) or movement through space (Motion). The Blur and Blur
More filters don’t have dialog boxes; the commands automatically apply a
modicum of blurring to your image in its entirety or to a selection made
before issuing the command.
Use the Blur and Blur More filters instead of the Blur tool when you want
uniform results, as shown in Figure 18-2. When you use the Blur tool, your
mouse has the greatest effect on the results. You may be able to see the
strokes that you used to apply the blur, or you may miss some spots or
apply the effect unevenly. If you use the filter, the same amount of blurring
is applied everywhere, with no strokes or places that are blurred more or
less than somewhere else. 
In Photoshop Elements, the last filter used is repeated at the top of the Filter
menu so that you can access the filter quickly if you want to use it again in
the current session. In both applications, the keyboard shortcut to reapply
the most recently used filter is Ctrl+F (Ô+F on the Mac). 
The specialized Blur filters — Gaussian, Motion, Radial, and Smart — have
their own dialog boxes where you can choose the degree of blurring to
apply. For the Motion blur, you can also choose the direction in which the
object is supposed to be moving. Figure 18-3 shows the Motion Blur dialog
box as well as a preview of its effect on an image.

295

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
The Radial blur completely distorts everything to which it’s applied. If you
want to create a background that appears to be spinning around or behind
parts of the image, select the content that will remain static and copy it to a
new layer. Then apply the Radial Blur to the original layer, which should be
placed behind the static content layer. Voilà! Your objects are in the center
of a hurricane, but they’re not moved a bit.
Sharpen filters
Just as the Blur and Sharpen tools are opposites, so are the Blur and Sharpen
filters. They’re the same in one respect, though — the filters apply the effect
in a uniform way, whereas the tools are entirely dependent on your brush
size, mouse movements, and selection to control them. Here are the four
Sharpen filters:
✦Sharpen: This filter has no dialog box. Just choose the command, and
Elements automatically applies a uniform, subtle sharpening effect. You
may want to repeat it two or more times if you need more sharpening
than it applies in one pass.
✦Sharpen More: This filter is Sharpen on steroids. It applies more sharp-
ening in one fell swoop than the Sharpen filter.
✦Sharpen Edges: This filter makes the edges — determined by a group
of pixels varying in color and light levels from an adjoining group —
stand out by sharpening the connecting pixels. If you have content in
your image that just fades into its surroundings, this might be the filter
for you.
✦Unsharp Mask: Despite its confusing name, this filter actually sharpens
images. Very similar to Sharpen Edges, this filter adjusts the contrast of
edges. This filter is the only Sharpen filter with a dialog box.
Noise filters
Among the Noise filters, the Despeckle and Dust & Scratches filters are the
ones you use to retouch photos. You use them to deal with artifacts, such
as dust spots or scratches that are distracting or obscure parts of an image. 
The Despeckle filter finds the edges in an image and blurs everything but
those edges. Although this filter sounds overly destructive, it can have an
interesting effect that blends together parts of an image despite differences
in color and texture that existed in the original. Figure 18-4 shows the
Despeckle filter applied.
The Dust & Scratches filter eliminates much of the noise (dust, scratches,
and small spots) by changing pixels that are very different from their sur-
roundings, making them more similar. You can use the dialog box to adjust
the Radius and Threshold settings, which determine the scope and degree
of the effects, respectively.
296

Book I
Chapter 18

Working with Filters
The steps in using the Dust & Scratches filter are pretty simple:
1. Choose Filter➪Noise➪Dust & Scratches from the menu bar. 
The filter’s dialog box opens.
2. Zoom in on the area with the greatest degree of dust and scratch
damage by using the Hand tool and the + sign button to get closer.
(The Hand tool appears when you mouse over the preview.) 
Zooming in helps you determine if your settings are doing the trick.
3. Adjust the Threshold setting by dragging the slider.
Watch the preview for the desired result to appear.
4. Adjust the Radius, again by dragging the slider.
Don’t go too far with your Radius adjustment. The image can become so
blurry that any details in the photo are indistinguishable.
5. Click the OK button to apply the filter.
Turning photos into paintings with artistic filters
The filters in three of the Filter menu’s categories — Artistic, Sketch, and
Brush Strokes — are not truly restorative or retouching filters, at least not
traditionally. However, as more people are either capturing images digitally
or scanning prints, their needs and desires with regard to those pictures
have become more sophisticated and complex. It’s not good enough to just
scan a wedding photo and enlarge it for a framed copy on the piano. Now,
you may want to make the photo look like a drawing done with pastels or a
painting created with oils. For gifts, cards, Web graphics, and interesting
marketing materials, you can turn any photo into an apparent work of hand-
done art, as shown in Figure 18-5. Here, a photo has been filtered to look
like a watercolor painting, with soft shapes and a slight texture that mirrors
the weave of watercolor paper.
Using artistic filters also performs another important role. If your image is
simply beyond repair or beyond your skills or interest level to repair it, you
can hide a multitude of sins with the right filter. If your image is scuffed and
Figure 18-4:
The
Despeckle
filter is

favorite.
297

Part III: Editing with Photoshop Elements
scratched and you don’t feel like dealing with each individual injury, just
clean up the most offensive or extreme of the marks and then apply a filter
such as Colored Pencil or Dry Brush. This way, you create something entirely
new, while preserving the content and history of the original image by hiding
the damage that would have normally relegated the image to a drawer rather
than a frame.
When you use these filters, you always get a dialog box, such as the one
shown in Figure 18-6. Through the dialog boxes, you can customize how the
artistic effect is applied — the thickness of the brush or pencil strokes, the
frequency of them, how detailed the effect is, and the intensity of the effect.
You can select an area before using the filter to restrict the amount of the
photo that’s affected, or you can apply the filter to the whole image.
Going a little crazy with special-effects filters
The Distort and Stylize filters are the least conservative effects. These
unusual effects change the appearance of some (or all) of your image by
stretching, pulling, or pinching or by mimicking textures and overlays, such
as rippled water, glass, or the appearance of the image being ripped apart
by a strong wind.

Working with Filters
You might be wondering how on earth you’d use these filters to restore or
retouch a photo. Well, you wouldn’t. But you might use them to create an
interesting piece of digital art, utilizing one or more of your photos, or to
achieve a symbolic look that’s suggested, but not artistically realized, in a
photograph you’ve restored traditionally. For example, if you have a photo
of someone’s boat, it might be interesting to apply the Ocean Ripple filter to
the water in the image and the Wind filter to the boat’s sails. That’s a bit lit-
eral, but you get the idea.
As you work with these filters, their dialog boxes help you control the way
the filters work their special-effects magic. You can change the size of the
tiles or cracks in an image, choose which texture to apply, and adjust the
degree of pinching or twirling to use.
For a brief description of the more creative filters, check out the following list:
✦Texture filters: These filters apply artificial textures to your image.
Figure 18-7 shows Stained Glass (top), Craquelure (middle), and Grain
(bottom) applied to different sections of a single image, purely for
demonstrative purposes. 
Use the Texturizer filter (found in the Texture category) to apply textures,
such as Canvas, Sandstone, and Burlap to your photo. These textures
make a photo look like it’s printed on textured paper or some sort of
fabric.
✦Distorting filters: These filters manipulate the apparent shape of your
image content, as shown in Figure 18-8, where the Ocean Ripple (left),
Pinch (middle), and Twirl (right) filters have been applied to three sec-
tions of the photo. By creating an apparent shape to the surface of the
image, the content looks as though it’s being viewed through some sort

of distorting lens, or as though the photo exists within a substance and
not simply on paper or a computer screen. The dialog boxes for the
Distort filters allow you to control the degree of distortion achieved.
✦Stylize filters: This category is sort of a hodgepodge of filters that don’t
really fit anywhere else. With names like Emboss, Glowing Edges, Solarize,
and Wind, you’d be hard pressed to find a more descriptive yet nonde-
script name for them. When the Emboss, Glowing Edges, or Wind filters
are applied, the results are extreme and may go beyond your intentions
for dealing with digital photos. On the other hand, these examples may
inspire you to create something unique.
Don’t hesitate to mix and match filters. Apply one, then another, and then
another after that. Stacking their effects can give you unexpected and 
often quite beautiful results. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different
combinations!
Getting Your Hands on Third-Party Filters
Finding third-party filters for Photoshop Elements is easy; just do a Google
search for “filters for Photoshop Elements”. Be sure to use the quotation
marks to restrict your search to sites that contain that exact phrase. Other-
wise, you’ll find sites pertaining to filters (for coffee, oil, and air) and sites
pertaining to Photoshop but not to filters. Of course the first few will pertain
to both, but you’ll have to wade through some losers, which is good to avoid.
In addition to searching the Web, you may find interesting filters and other
stuff by poking around these sites:

Special Effects
Using the Effects Tab Palette
✦Alien Skin Software (www.alienskin.com) is the maker of Eye Candy
4000, Xenofex, and Splat! plug-ins.
✦Auto FX Software’s DreamSuite (www.autofx.com) has two Series prod-
ucts. Series One provides special effects for graphics, text, and photos,
and these effects are all easy to use. Series Two has features that enable
you to turn your photos into puzzles (a great gift idea for family photos,
or as a promotional item for clients), plus several other special effects.
✦Andromeda Software (www.andromeda.com) offers several filter sets,
including light-scattering filters, lens filters, screen and mezzotint filters,
outlining and woodcut filters, and special focus filters. Andromeda also
makes Velociraptor, a filter that puts trails on image contents, which
gives the objects the appearance of movement that’s like a Photoshop
fireworks display. As you can tell, the variety of filters is quite wide,
from conservative yet cool effects to real psychedelic experiences.
Using the Effects Tab Palette
Photoshop Elements has a list of effects that you can apply to some or all 
of your image. You can view the effects as a series of thumbnails (on the left
Figure 18-9) or in a list (on the right Figure 18-9). You can apply the effects
to a selection within your image or to the entire active layer.
To switch between List and Thumbnails views of the Effects palette, click
the More button at the bottom of the list and make a choice from the menu
that appears.
If you view the effects as a list, you see additional effects that apply only to
text (the word Type appears next to them). These effects allow you to
create type that looks like wood, chrome, glass, pipe, or just about anything
you can imagine. Figure 18-10 shows the List view of the Effects palette, and
a Type effect selected.

Click the buttons in the lower-right corner of the Effects palette (whether
docked or floating as an independent palette) to switch between List and
Thumbnails view.
The Effects palette is normally docked at the top-right side of the Photoshop
Elements window; if you click the tab, you can display the palette with its top
still docked. If you want to move the palette, simply drag it away from the
docking well by grabbing the tab with your mouse. You can then move the
free-floating palette anywhere on the workspace. If you want to minimize the
palette in place, click the Minimize (-) button to shrink it to just a title bar.
When you want to use it again, click the Maximize (X) button.

Applying an Effect
After you know how to manipulate the Effects
palette, you can easily apply these cool effects to
your photo and text by following these steps:
1.
Select the portion of your image to which
you want the effect to apply.
If it’s text, make sure the Type layer in
question is active and double-click the
Type icon on the layer to select all the text
on that layer.
2.
Display the Effects palette.
3.
Apply the effect to your image or text:

Image: If you want to apply an effect to
your image (not to text), drag the desired
thumbnail onto your image. After a delay —
how long a delay depends on your avail-
able system resources — the effect is
applied to the image.
If you have part of your image selected,
drag the thumbnail into that selected area.
You can also click the Apply button to
apply a selected effect to your entire
image or a selection inside it.

Text: If you want to apply a Type Effect,
remember that you have to be in List view
to see those effects. When you have the
effect in view, drag it from the list onto
your Type layer, or click the Apply button
while your type is selected.
Click the drop-down list in the upper-
left corner of the Effects palette to
choose from different effect groups —
Textures, Frames, Text Effects, and
Image Effects — to be displayed alone.
The default setting for this drop-down
list is All, which shows all the available
effects. Choosing one of the groups in
the drop-down list distills the displayed
set down to just that group.

Chapter 19: Storing and Organizing
Your Digital Photos
In This Chapter
 Understanding your organizational options
 Choosing the right tools to organize and store your photos
 Keeping your treasured photos safe
W
e all have at least one box or drawer that’s full of photos that we’ve
never had the time to put in an album — vacation photos, pictures of
the family at holiday dinners for the last ten years, and even collections of
vintage photos, all waiting for someone to take them out of their envelopes
and put them in a book so that people can actually look at them. What about
your digital photos? They may not be languishing in a drawer, but if they’re
in different folders scattered all over your hard drive, they may as well be in
a shoebox under the bed. 
The most important things you can do with your digital images is to organize
them and then to store them in a way that keeps them safe from accidental
erasure; unwanted changes; or loss due to fire, flood, or a computer melt-
down. You can easily achieve the proper organization and reliable storage of
your digital images, and plenty of tools are at your disposal to make it all
happen. The key, however, is to do it — so don’t put it off any longer!
Organizing Your Photos
When it comes to taking control of the organization of your photos, you
have a few different approaches to choose from. Your personality, your
computer, and your access to the Web all dictate your choice. Here are
some approaches to consider:
✦Setting up a file structure on your computer
✦Working with software that makes it easy to organize and store your
images and view them through a special interface
✦Organizing and storing your images in an online gallery
What do I mean about your personality influencing your choice of organiza-
tional tools? If you’re a very organized person who enjoys tidying up closets
and dresser drawers, always knows where the remotes are, and always puts
things away after using them, then using the file management tools already
on your computer might appeal to you.
303

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
If, on the other hand, you don’t tend to be tidy and often forget where you
left your glasses or your keys, then you might prefer using software that
organizes things for you or posting your images to an online gallery. The
tidy person might like these latter approaches as well.
Using your computer’s file-management tools
You already have some great tools for organizing your images, and the tools
have been on your computer all along. If you’re running Windows, you have
My Computer and Windows Explorer right there at your fingertips. If you’re
using a Mac, you can use the Finder’s file-management tools that you’ve
already been using to create folders on your desktop or hard drive.
Using these tools requires devising some sort of filing system — one or more
folders that will help you categorize your images. You might start with one
called Photos and create subfolders such as Family Photos, Vacation Pictures,
and Scanned Vintage Photos. You can create folders on your computer for
whatever groupings fit the pool of images you have. After you create the fold-
ers, all you have to do is move your images into the appropriate folders and
remember the folder names when you store new images in the future. 
Using Windows Explorer to store and organize your photos
Working with folders under Windows XP is pretty basic, but deserves a
review in the context of organizing your digital image files. To create folders
to store your images by using Windows Explorer, follow these simple steps:
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Explore from the context menu. 
2. When Windows Explorer opens, click the C: drive icon in the folder
list (see Figure 19-1).
If a plus sign is next to the icon, click that plus sign to display the fold-
ers currently on the drive. If a minus sign is next to the icon, that means
you can already see all the folders.
The Windows Explorer window is divided into two panes: the Folder
pane on the left and then Content pane on the right. When you click a
drive or folder in the Folder pane, that drive or folder’s content is dis-
played in the Content pane. This two-sided display makes it possible to
drag items from one folder to another simply by displaying the source
(where the content is now) and target (where you want the content to
be) folders in the separate panes.
3. If you want to use the My Pictures folder or another folder as the basis
for your image organization, double-click it. If you want to start a new
folder for your photos, choose File➪New➪Folder from the menu bar. 
If you go the new folder route, a new folder appears in the Content pane,
with its temporary name highlighted.
4. If you go the new folder route, give your new folder a name and press
Enter to confirm it. 
304

Book I
Chapter 19
Storing and Organizing
Your Digital Photos
Organizing Your Photos
With a folder created to house some or all of your photos, you can begin to
place them in a single location. You can also make subfolders in that main
folder to categorize your photos. For example, if you have a Photos folder,
you can create a Vacation Photos subfolder and a Baby Pictures subfolder
to keep those two, distinct photo subjects separate.
To create subfolders of the main folder, simply click the main folder to select
it (on the left side of the screen, in the Folders pane) and then repeat Steps
3 and 4 from the preceding steps list. You use the File➪New➪Folder com-
mand to create a new folder, but because you’re in an existing folder when
you do it, the new folder appears inside the active folder.
The process is like taking one of those green hanging Pendaflex folders and
putting one or more manila folders in it. The green folder represents the
main Photos folder, and each of the manila folders is the same as the sub-
folders you create to categorize your photos. You can create as many sub-
folders as you want, and even create subfolders within subfolders. The folder
hierarchy can become as complex as you want or need it to be, but be care-
ful not to make managing files so cumbersome that the process becomes
confusing when you need to place an image in the right folder.
If you don’t need to categorize your photos by subject, consider creating
folders that separate your photos by date. You can have a separate folder
for individual years, months, or weeks, depending on how prolific a photog-
rapher you are.

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
Within Windows Explorer, choose View➪Thumbnails to display a rather
snazzy thumbnail view of all pictures in the current folder.
Organizing your photo images on a Mac
Whether you’re using Mac OS 9 or the latest version of Mac OS X, you can
easily create folders to store your photos and other digital images. You can
choose to store them on your hard drive or make them quickly accessible
from your ever-visible desktop. 
To create a new folder in OS 9 and previous OS versions, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Folder from the menu bar.
A folder titled Untitled Folder appears on the desktop. You can also press
Ô+N or Ctrl+click the desktop and choose New Folder from the context
menu that appears.
2. Give your folder a short, yet relevant name that will make it easy to
find the folder in the future.
3. You can leave the folder on the desktop or open your hard disk and
drag the folder there. 
4. If you want folders within the folder you just created, open the folder
and then repeat Steps 1 through 3 to create the subfolders.
If you’re using OS X, the procedure is nearly identical, except for the key-
board shortcut. Instead of Ô+N, you press Shift+Ô+N to create a new folder.
You can duplicate an existing folder with the File➪Duplicate command.
Alternatively, drag the existing folder to a new location while holding down
the Option button; this approach makes a copy of the original folder and
leaves the original folder where it was.
From any Mac OS X Finder window, choose View➪As Icons to display pre-
views of pictures in the current folder.
Using photo album software
Setting up a series of folders to store and categorize your images is easy
enough. To view them after they’re stored, however, you either have to open
them with the software you used to edit/retouch them or the generic soft-
ware (such as Preview in Mac OS X) that came with your computer. If you
find that inconvenient (and you probably will, especially if you like to look
at and work with your images frequently or to view them side by side), you’ll
probably be glad to know that several great photo-album applications are
on the market. These applications enable you to view one, two, or several of
your images at the same time, all in one easily navigated workspace. Figure
19-2 shows a group of photos viewed through Paint Shop Photo Album from
Jasc Software (www.jasc.com), which I use under Windows. At $50, this mul-
timedia organizer, which also takes care of video and sound files, is a steal.

Other photo album products to consider include
✦iPhoto: This is another favorite organizer of mine, this time for Mac OS
X. It’s bundled free with every new Macintosh, or you can pick it up as
part of the iLife suite. iPhoto includes a number of simple retouching
and manipulation features.
✦Adobe Photoshop Album: As you might expect, this relatively new
entry from image powerhouse Adobe (www.adobe.com) has a number of
image-editing features built-in. Album runs under Windows and sets you
back only about $40.
✦LEAD Photo Album: This Windows album program from LEAD
Technologies (www.leadtools.com) supports over 100 image formats
and enables you to create a slide show or wallpaper for your Windows
desktop in a snap. It retails for about $100.
Want more? Do a search at your favorite search site for “Photo Album
Software” (use the quotation marks to make sure the search engine uses
the full phrase). You can also check Web sites, such as www.buy.com and
www.amazon.com, where you can do similar searches for the photo album
software that each site has to offer.
Your criteria for selecting photo album software is a personal thing. You may
prefer ease of use and not care if you don’t get a lot of fancy functionality. If
you want lots of bells and whistles, you may not mind if the product is a
little more complicated to use. Some photo album software serves as both

an organizational tool and a vehicle for creative display of your photos, and
some just do the latter job. If you already have a system for organizing your
images, you may not need software that does double duty.
Before you spend that hard-earned cash, make sure you shop around. Here’s
a list of features offered by the best album applications:
✦Ability to categorize and classify each photo using built-in or custom-
designed categories
✦Provision for adding your own captions and other annotations
✦Search capabilities so that you can locate all the images classified as
vacation pictures, using keywords such as beach or 2004
✦Sorting abilities so that you can permanently or temporarily arrange
your photos by filename or other criteria (these features go hand-in-
hand with search capabilities)
✦Features for uploading from your local album to your own Web space or
sharing services
✦Viewing capabilities that include looking at single photos and arranging
them into slide shows
✦Simple image-editing features, such as cropping, resizing, and rotating,
so that you can make small changes to your pictures without firing up
your image editor
Using online galleries
You probably already e-mail photos to friends, sending the images as mes-
sage attachments that the recipients must open and view. Then your recipi-
ents can save any images they want to keep on their hard drives. A better
way to share your images, assuming you don’t mind having your images
posted on the Internet, may be to use online galleries to display your photos.
The online approach to image distribution has some great advantages and
some drawbacks. First, the advantages are that you can
✦Avoid the hassle of having to e-mail photos to lots of individuals.
Because you’re placing all your photos on one Web site, all you have to
do is let people know to check the site for your images. This makes it
possible to share images that are larger than some e-mail services can
handle (2MB for many services).
✦Share more images with more people. Anyone with an Internet connec-
tion can view the images without owning any special software — other
than a browser, which people need to surf the Web anyway.
✦Enjoy yet another relatively protected repository for your images. 
If you lose the original files, you can download them from the online
gallery.
Two possible disadvantages (and only you can decide if they are real disad-
vantages) are that
308

Book I
Chapter 19
Storing and Organizing
Your Digital Photos
Archiving and Backing Up Photos
✦Your photos are on the Web, and anyone can view them. This can
expose you and your family to people with whom you would not normally
share your vacation, holiday, and otherwise personal photos. You have
to be careful about posting photos that show your house number, last
name, or any other identifying information.
✦Most online galleries charge a fee for providing space on their site for
your photos. The fees are usually reasonable, but compared to e-mailing
photos, which is free (you’re already paying to have e-mail anyway), the
cost may be more than you’re willing to pay. 
I recommend avoiding image hosting services that require you to log in
simply to view images. Your friends and family members may decide not to
view your photo album rather than provide an e-mail address (and other
information).
To find an online gallery to post your photos, you can do a search online for
“Online Galleries”. You’ll see quite a few sites that are devoted to actual
artists (and this may be of interest if you are an artist) and some that are
for the general public to use. If you add “+free” to the search criteria, you’ll
ferret out those sites that offer the space for free or that will let you test their
services for free or for a limited time. Here are some sites to consider:
✦Web-a-photo (www.web-a-photo.com)
✦PBase (www.pbase.com)
✦Club Photo (www.clubphoto.com)
Obviously, the cost for an average person’s online images is quite reasonable,
and two out of the three sites in the preceding list are free. So you have no
reason, therefore, not to try posting your images in an online gallery. If you’re
fearful of the exposure that posting your images on the Internet creates, then
post only those images that are completely anonymous.
I’ll be honest with you (as always) — there’s always the chance that visitors
to your site will redistribute your images elsewhere on the Internet. That’s
the chance you take by posting your photographs for the public to see.
Archiving and Backing Up Photos
Not all your photos will require instant, easy access. Vacation photos from
the past, certainly if you visited a not-too-exciting place, may be a waste of
valuable hard-drive real estate. But what if you don’t want to delete these
infrequently viewed images? You don’t have to make rash decisions — you
can simply archive the images you don’t need to access quickly or frequently.
If a photo is valuable to you on some level in the long run but you don’t
imagine wanting to look at or print it in the foreseeable future, just save it to
disc — a CD or DVD is the best choice because Zip disks and floppy disks
have a considerably shorter storage life. You have several archiving options,
many of which may be on your computer right now. If they’re not, you can
easily acquire them.
309

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
Backing up your best shots
First, because you’ve already organized your photos (assuming you’ve read
the beginning of this chapter), you should already have your photos catego-
rized and know which ones are so dear to you that, if anything happened to
them, your family would have to take your shoelaces lest you “do anything
foolish.” You need to back up these cherished shots, store them in some way
to protect them from anything that can happen to your computer or your
photo albums (printed or electronic).
Your backup options are simple:
✦Store the photos on disk. I generally shy away from floppy disks because
they offer very little storage space and are notoriously unreliable. Zip
disks have a higher capacity and are more reliable, but they’re consider-
ably more expensive than CD or DVD media.
✦Write them to a disc by using a CD or DVD burner. This method enables
you to store up to 700MB on a single CD or several gigabytes on a DVD.
If your computer already has a burner in it or attached to it, all you need
is a package of writable CDs, which you can use with your burner. 
✦Store them online. The Web sharing sites listed earlier also can provide
you with a sort of backup for your images. It’s best to use these sites as
a secondary backup (sort of as a backup to your backup) because you
have no way to guarantee how long these services will be around!
Using CD-R and CD-R/W
Until just a few years ago, most computers came with a CD-ROM drive, and
all you could do was read or install software from the content of a CD-ROM
(ROM stands for Read Only Memory). Then CD burners hit the market, and
now an increasing number of new computers come with one as standard
equipment. If your computer has only CD-ROM capability, you can easily
add a CD burner for $50 (or less).
With the ability to write to a CD, you now can save up to 700MB of data on 
a very reliable medium. Unlike floppy and Zip disks that can be ruined by
exposure to magnets, heat, cold, sunlight, water, and rough handling, CDs
are quite stable if handled correctly. Other than breaking or scratching
them, you can’t really hurt them. 
Now, before you run out and buy a CD burner and CDs to burn, consider
these writable-CD facts:
✦Writable CDs come in two types: CD-R and CD-RW. CD-Rs can be written
to (the R stands for Recordable), but only once. CD-RWs can be written
to and erased, and written to again.
✦You can use a CD-R or a CD-RW like a floppy or Zip disk by using a mode
called Packet Writing (also called UDF). In that mode, you can copy files
or groups thereof to the CD.
✦CDs are virtually indestructible (unless you crack, break, or severely
scratch them). Even so, you shouldn’t expose CD-Rs and CD-RWs to
direct sunlight or extreme heat.

Storing and Organizing
Your Digital Photos
Archiving and Backing Up Photos
For a comprehensive guide to recording your photographs on CD and DVD
discs, head to Book IV. The chapters there lead you through organizing and
recording your photo discs (as well as burning audio and video discs) and
include information on packet writing and backing up data to disc. You’ll be
a digital burning wizard in no time!
Looking ahead to DVD storage
As commonplace as DVD (digital versatile disc) players have become in many
households and on many computers, are they a reasonable tool for saving
data? You bet! DVD recorders have dropped to under $100, and the blank
discs are dropping in price by the minute. DVDs hold more data than a CD-R
or CD-RW can — almost 5GB (gigabytes) or more.
Like CD burners, DVD burners also come in more than one type:
✦DVD-Video discs (the prerecorded kind) come with stuff prewritten to
them. You can view what’s on them, but you can’t erase and then rewrite
to them.
✦DVD+R and DVD-R discs can be written to only once.
✦DVD+RW and DVD-RW discs can be written to, erased, and written to
again.
If your computer already has a DVD-ROM (read-only) drive in it, that doesn’t
mean you can write to DVD discs. It simply means you can play them. To
write to a DVD disc, you need
✦A DVD+RW or DVD-RW drive that both plays and records DVDs
✦DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW or DVD+RW discs
Off-site storage for maximum safety
If your photos are so precious that you’d just die if anything happened to
them, or if they’re important for legal, financial, or other compelling reasons,
don’t risk losing them to a fire or burglary. You can store your archives off-
site in one of three ways:
✦Use a bank safe deposit box.
✦Use a safe located in a secure storage facility.
✦Arrange to keep one of two archive copies with a friend or family
member. 
If you save your precious images to CD or DVD, you can make two sets and
store one set off-site, selecting one of the aforementioned places based on
the level of security you need. The bank could burn down, but the safe
deposit boxes are usually in or near the vault and are protected from very
high temperatures, even in the event of a fire. If you keep a safe in a paid off-
site storage space, the place is likely to be fireproof or well-protected by
sprinklers and video cameras, so it’s probably more secure than your home.
If neither of these is an option, find a friend or relative you trust and give
the extra set to that person.

igitally captured and retouched photos live on your computer. That’s
where they came to life, whether you captured them with a digital
camera or scanned a printed original. It’s also where you may have doc-
tored them for any number of purposes — to make them smaller to e-mail
them to friends and family, to make them safe for use on a Web page, or to
make them picture-perfect for printing.
However, unless you deal only in Web images or on-screen presentations,
you probably need lots of prints of your photos. In this chapter, you dis-
cover when and how to print your photos, which printers do what kind of
job, and how to create the best-quality print of your digital images. You can
find more information about choosing printers in Chapter 5 of Book I.
Why Do You Need Prints?
The reasons that you may need to print your photos are as numerous as the
photos themselves. Look for your own reasons among those in the follow-
ing list:
✦You need to create a suitable-for-framing version of a photo that was too
small or too damaged to be framed before you edited it. You can trans-
form that wallet-sized photo into a framed picture that’s suitable for the
top of your grand piano. Or, perhaps a picture has wrinkles or tears that
you can fix with your image editor before making a pristine, new print.
See Book I, Chapter 16 for tips on restoring damaged photos.
✦You want to create a backup print of a very precious photo in case some-
thing happens to the original. Better yet, display the duplicate and keep
the precious original in a safer place, such as a safety deposit box. Put a
CD or DVD that contains the digital version of the original in the box, too,
so you don’t have to duplicate your editing efforts.
✦You’re building a portfolio of your digital artwork, and you need a printed
copy to show to prospective employers or clients. Make as many prints
as you want economically, and distribute them far and wide.
313

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
✦You need a proof, or printed evaluation image, that you submit to some-
one who can’t view the image online for his or her approval. You can
fiddle with the proof print to make sure that it’s an accurate representa-
tion. This way, the person who is reviewing it can have the best possible
copy to approve.
✦You require an evaluation proof for comparing the digital image with 
the hard-copy original and just viewing the file electronically doesn’t
provide the necessary information about print quality. In this case, the
proof of the pudding is in the viewing.
✦Your photo is for printed marketing materials, such as ads, brochures,
or fliers, and you need to create camera-ready art that a professional
printer can use to create the finished materials. Although many profes-
sional printers today can work with digital files, some cannot. You’ll
need a print for the print shop’s use.
✦When I prepare publicity pictures for my local newspaper, I always pro-
vide the original photo on a CD. But I also include a print so that the
editor can decide whether the photo is worth using without having to
pop the CD in a drive and take the trouble of viewing it.
Although this chapter’s title is “Printing Your Final Result,” you may also
want to print versions of your image as you go along in the editing process.
Because computer monitors aren’t capable of displaying colors exactly as
they will print, you may want to print at least one “in-progress” version of
your image so that you can check for color, clarity, and other qualities before
you commit the final version to that sheet of expensive photo paper. You
can purchase lower-priced photo paper for your test prints (because print-
ing on plain old ink-jet paper may be misleading) and then use the good
stuff for your final printout.
Why does the same photo look different if you print it on plain ink-jet paper
than it does on photographic paper? The porous nature of regular ink-jet
paper absorbs more of the ink, and this affects the reflective quality of the
colors. Images look darker, contrast is lost, and overall quality is diminished
if you print on porous paper. If you print on glossy or matte photographic
paper, where a coating on the paper prevents absorption, your photo’s
color and content stand on their own, unaffected by the paper. No details,
color, or contrast is lost.
Evaluating Your Printing Options
After you know that you need to print your photo, it’s time to decide how to
print it. If you have only one printer and no money for or access to another
printer, the decision is really made — you use your one and only printer. If
you have the cash for the perfect printer for your particular photo, that’s
great. If you don’t have the cash but have access to a variety of printers,
that’s great, too. With the assumption that you have some choices available
to you, consider the printing possibilities that are listed in Table 20-1. You
can find more information on choosing printers in Book I, Chapter 5.

Ink-jet printers
The name ink-jet gives you an idea of how the ink-jet printer works —
assuming that the word jet makes you think of the water jets in a whirlpool
bath or spa. The way that these printers work is rather simple. Piezoelectric
crystals make the ink cartridges vibrate. (The crystals are sandwiched
between two electrodes, which make the crystals dance.) Different levels of
voltage cause the crystals to vibrate differently; this adjusts the colors and
the amount of color that is sprayed through a nozzle onto the paper.
Color ink-jet printers can create near-photo-quality images, assuming that
you use good-quality photo paper for the output. Price isn’t necessarily an
indication of print quality, and you should print a test page before making a
purchase, or take the recommendation of someone who owns the same
model.
Laser printers
Laser printers work much like photocopiers. A laser beam is aimed at a
photoelectric belt or drum, building up an electrical charge. In the case of a
color laser printer, this happens four times, once for each of the four colors
that are used to make up your image. The four colors are cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black. The electric charge makes the colored toner stick to the
belt, and then the belt transfers the toner to the drum. The paper rolls along
the drum as it moves through the printer, which transfers the toner from
the drum to the paper. Then, either pressure or heat (or both) is used to
make the toner stick to the paper.
Color laser printers are more expensive than ink-jets and black-and-white
laser printers. If you’re creating camera-ready art for very important, detailed
publications, you probably want a color laser (assuming that the images are
in color) rather than an ink-jet, but the image quality from a color laser is not
as good as what you would get with a dye-sublimation printer.
Dye-sublimation printers
Here, the name of the printer doesn’t tell you much about the way the printer
works. Despite their cryptic name, dye-sublimation printers work in a rela-
tively straightforward way. A strip of plastic film, called a transfer ribbon, is
coated with cyan, magenta, and yellow dye. When a print job is sent to the
printer, a thermal printhead heats up the page-sized (81⁄2-x-11-inch) panel of
plastic transfer ribbon. Variations in temperature control what colors and
how much color are applied to the paper. Because the paper has a special
coating on it, the dye sticks.
315

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
Dye-sublimation printers provide an excellent image, especially for color
photos. The subtle results are great for professional designers, artists, and
photographers. The expense may be prohibitive for small businesses and
home users, but the lower-priced models may be within reach. Unfortu-
nately, dye-sublimation printers do not print text well — they’re suited only
for photographs.
Touring the Print Process
Regardless of the photo-editing and retouching software that you’re using
to process your photographs, some aspects of the image-printing process
are the same. With most image editors, the print process consists of the fol-
lowing options:
✦You get to choose which printer to output to. If you have a black-and-
white laser and a color ink-jet, for example, you can choose to output to
the color ink-jet.
✦You can choose how many copies to print.
✦You can choose to print only part of the image, by choosing the Selection
option. This assumes that you made a selection before issuing the print
command.
✦You can adjust your printer’s properties to print at different levels of
quality, based on the version of the printout.
✦You can choose to print crop marks, which can help you or a profes-
sional printer cut along the edges of the printout. If you want to frame a
5-x-7-inch photo, for example, and you’re printing it on 81⁄2-x-11-inch paper
(letter size), the crop marks can help you cut the paper to fit inside the
frame and within any mat that you’re using.
Preventing surprises with Print Preview
Before you commit your image to paper, you may want to see a smaller view
of the image in the context of a sheet of the currently set paper size, just to
make sure that everything is okay. This prevents nasty surprises, such as
printing your favorite portrait in horizontal format, cutting your subject in
half. In virtually all software programs, you can choose File➪Print Preview to
see how the printout will look. Figure 20-1 shows the Print Preview window in
Photoshop Elements. If you’re happy with what you see, go ahead and issue
the Print command (choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P).

Touring the Print Process
Higher-end photo-editing packages (such as Photoshop) let you choose to
print color separations, which means printing each of the image’s colors on
a separate sheet. This can be helpful to a professional printing firm that
may be using your printout to create the films that generate your prints.
Understanding your output options
In the Print Preview dialog box, you can print the image by clicking the Print
button. You can also change the scale (size) and location of the image on
the paper. With some image editors, selecting a Show More Options check
box opens an extension of the original dialog box (see Figure 20-2). Options
here may include applying a caption to your image or turning on crop marks.
You may even be able to apply a background color and a border, which can
be helpful if you’re printing an image for framing and don’t have a mat for
the frame.
The Page Setup dialog box, which you open by clicking the Page Setup button
in the Print Preview dialog box, is shown in Figure 20-3. The Page Setup
dialog box allows you to change the printer that you’re sending the job to
and to view your printer’s properties. This dialog box is another place where
you can choose the Background, Border, and Corner Crop Marks options. In
many software packages, the Page Setup dialog box also allows you to
change the paper size and orientation.

Printing your photos
When you’re ready to print your work, choose File➪Print and use the Print
dialog box to select your printing options — which printer to use, how many
copies to print, and so on. Figure 20-4 shows Photoshop Elements’ Print
dialog box.
If the software that you’re using offers a drastically different set of options
through its Print dialog box, you can press F1 to open the software’s help
files. If that doesn’t work (though it usually does), use the Help menu to
look for articles that pertain to printing. The software may have also come
with a Read Me file — a file that came with the software if you downloaded
it from the Web — or a printed manual that you can refer to.
Of course, before you click the Print or OK button to begin the print job,
make sure that the right paper is in the printer and know how to load the
paper in your printer — good side down, the proper end in first, and so on.
The printer should come with instructions. You find more thorough instruc-
tions in a printed manual, but paper-loading hints, for example, are repre-
sented by icons that are on the paper tray. Most photographic paper has a
“good” side, which has the image-enhancing coating on it, and most paper
has a repeated brand name on the back, making it easier to tell which side
to print on. If you’re not sure, though, do a test print first. In the worst case,
you’ll print on the wrong side and have to do it again — and waste a single
sheet of paper. If you’re planning to print several copies of the image, it’s
better to waste a single sheet than to print all ten copies on the wrong side
of the paper!
Using Professional Printing Services
Also known as a service bureau, a professional printing firm offers services
to graphic artists, photographers, fine artists, businesses (for business cards,
brochures, and so on), and the general public. Chains (such as Kinko’s,
AlphaGraphics, and Kwik Kopy stores) offer such services, and some office-
supply stores can print your graphic files for a fee. You can also find small,
privately owned printing services, which may charge more than the chains

Using Professional Printing Services
do. But there, you get very personalized service, and you may find the staff
more willing to help you if you don’t know exactly what they need to com-
plete your order.
I used service bureaus for many years, back in the days when laser printers
could output text at no more than 300 dpi. Service bureaus were an economi-
cal way to produce black-and-white camera-ready pages (those that can be
photographed by the printer to make printing plates) without having to pur-
chase a costly high-resolution printer or image setter (a high-resolution
printer that’s especially suited for images). Today, most laser printers have
600-dpi or better resolution, so the need for service bureaus for text output is
reduced. These bureaus are still helpful for making full-color prints from your
digital photos if you don’t own a color printer that provides sufficient quality.
Choosing a service bureau
Not sure who to call when you’re ready to choose a service bureau/printing
service? You can always check the yellow pages online or in print, or you can
ask friends and business associates for referrals. The best people to ask are
graphic artists or people who work for an ad agency. They are likely to use
service bureaus extensively, and their recommendations would be valuable.
Before you hire a service bureau to print your photos, you want to ask the
folks there the following questions:
✦What do you charge, and how do you determine your prices? Do you
have minimum fees?
✦When can you finish the job? Note that most service bureaus will want
to fit your job into their normal queue of projects. They may have an
extra charge for “rush” jobs. Find out what constitutes a rush job. Is
that overnight service, or is anything less than a week considered a
rush job?
✦What file formats do you support? With this information, you know the
format in which you should save your photo after editing it. At one time,
service bureaus could handle only Macintosh files and common Macin-
tosh formats such as TIFF or PICT. Today, most service bureaus support
all platforms and all image-file formats. It doesn’t hurt to check, though.
✦Can I view a sample of the printout before paying for the final copies?
It can be helpful to view a proof or evaluation copy.
✦Is the kind of output that I’m looking for something that you have
done before and done frequently?
With answers to these questions in hand, you can choose the right service
bureau for your needs. If the company that you’re working with isn’t open
and cooperative, run — don’t walk — to another company. I’ve worked with
both kinds of service bureaus: the kind where the staff assumes that you
should know everything and don’t want to be bothered explaining things,
and the kind where folks are more than willing to help and answer any of
your questions. Obviously, the latter type of company is the best.
319

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
Tell them what you want — 
what you really, really want
After choosing a service bureau to work with, discuss your exact printing
needs. When you tell the person who is helping you how you plan to use the
printout, he or she should do the following:
✦Suggest the type of paper for the printout
✦Tell you what file format you need to use (a .psd file created in Photo-
shop, a .tif file, and so on) and whether you need to provide printed,
camera-ready art
If you need to provide camera-ready art, ask whether you need to provide
color separations (each color in your image, printed on a separate sheet of
paper) and determine what kind of paper the bureau prefers that you print
to. If you only have an ink-jet printer, the serviceperson may balk at your
using it to create camera-ready art. In general, though, any good service
bureau prefers to get the image as an electronic file. This way, the staff can
work with the image as needed to give you the printout that you require.
Knowing when you need a service bureau
In the end, the choice of whether you work with a service bureau comes
down to money. Time is money, and money buys quality if you shop care-
fully for printing services and/or your own printer. If you need a perfect,
absolutely beautiful printout of your photo and can’t afford a high-end
printer (or don’t know anyone who has one that you can use), spend the
money to have a service bureau create the printout for you. If you need a
high-quality printout and have a quality dye-sublimation or color laser
printer at your disposal, you may be able to do the printing on your own.
If I sound as though I’m disregarding the role of ink-jet printers in the printing
process, I’m not. I’ve printed many photos with an ink-jet printer and given
them as gifts, used them as camera-ready art for brochures and business
cards, and so on. Some of my original artwork has also been printed on an
ink-jet, and the items look just fine in a portfolio. The printer that you use
depends on the quality of the printout that you need. Determine whether the
printer that you have is capable of providing this quality. You may love the
output that your ink-jet generates, and if so, that’s great. You’ve just saved
some money, and you have a quick and easy way of creating your prints!

Chapter 21: Sharing 
Pictures on the Web
In This Chapter
 Sharing your digital photo masterpieces with friends and family
 Showing off your business online
 Using commercial sites to share your pictures
 Creating your own Web page for displaying pictures
O
f course you can e-mail your photos to personal and business contacts,
but most people are pretty tired of getting images that are attached to
e-mail messages. They have to download the images to open and view them,
and if they’re on a dialup connection to the Internet, that can be a pain. And
after the download is (finally) complete, what do they do with the pictures?
If they don’t need the image themselves, or if the subject of the photo isn’t
near and dear to them, they either throw it out (into the Trash or Recycle
Bin) or they squirrel the images away in a folder that they’ll never open
again. I have a folder on my Windows desktop that’s called Other People’s
Images. This is where I drag all the pictures that I would feel bad tossing
out, but have no use for.
So if e-mail isn’t the best way to share pictures with people who need or want
to see them, what is? You have several options, including posting the pictures
on your own Web site or using one of many image-sharing services. In this
chapter, you discover what Web-sharing tools are available, how to pick the
one that’s right for you, and how to get busy sharing photos on the Web.
Appreciating the Advantages of Web Sharing
By using the Web to share images, you eliminate the other person’s need to
save or throw out the images that you’ve sent. He or she can view the images,
say “Aw, isn’t that cute!” or “Wow! Cool car!” and that’s it. She doesn’t need
to download, save, throw out, or do anything with the image, other than
just look at it. If people want to save or print the image after they view it,
that’s up to them, but it’s not required or even firmly suggested. Figure 21-1
shows a page of images that was posted to a Web site. All that people 
have to do to see the pictures is type the Web address (in this case, www.
laurieulrich.com/webpix) into their browsers, and voilà! The photos are
available for viewing.
By using the Web to share pictures, you’re saving your image recipients’
time, hard drive space, and aggravation by creating a single repository for
all the images that you want to share. You’re also making it much easier for
yourself to keep an up-to-date selection of images available to all who want
to see them, so the Web option is a win-win proposition.
321

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
Before you share a batch of photos with the world (remember, the Internet is
international!), check the photos for anything that you would regret sharing
with the rest of the population. You probably want to avoid sharing identify-
ing features, such as addresses and people’s last names, that enable strangers
to make undesired contact with you. Another thing to check for is embarrass-
ing content. Going over the images with a very discriminating eye before you
share them pays off in the long run.
Sharing your personal photos
The benefits of using the Web to share personal photos are obvious. You can
share vacation photos, school pictures, and shots of your new house, pool,
car, and bathroom tile. Through your online pictures, you can share all the
stuff that you would tell people about in a holiday newsletter. Think of the
savings in postage alone! Instead of enclosing that extra sheet (or sheets) of
paper, just write the Web address inside your holiday card where your photos
can be found, and your work is done. If most of your friends and family have
e-mail, you can alert them that way, and save your wrist the strain of writing a
Web address 50 times. Figure 21-2 shows an e-mail with a Web address in it,
set up as a link. Recipients need only click the link in the e-mail, and they’re
taken directly to your photos.
Many e-mail programs create such a hot link for you. For example, if you type
anything that begins with http:// into recent versions of Outlook, Outlook
Express, or America Online’s mail system, the e-mail software automatically
converts the address into a hot link, colors it, and supplies an underline that
lets the recipient know that it is a link. With some e-mail software, you may
have to make sure that the Rich Text (HTML) option is turned on. If your soft-
ware is set to create messages only in Plain Text, the hot links may not be cre-
ated automatically.

Book I
Chapter 21
Sharing Pictures 
on the Web
Appreciating the Advantages of Web Sharing
The recipient must also have the HTML option active for your link to be hot
when the message is received. If not, the recipient can still jump to your Web
page by highlighting the link, copying it (usually by pressing Ctrl+C, or Ô+C
on a Mac), and then pasting the link into a browser’s address bar (by press-
ing Ctrl+V, or Ô+V on a Mac). Although many folks who send and receive
mail already know how to copy and paste links, you may want to include
instructions on how to do this in your e-mail message.
Of course, some sharing is very targeted. You want only your friends from col-
lege to see one batch and your family to see another, and you don’t necessar-
ily want the two camps to see each other’s photos. How can you control this?
By placing different sets of photos on different Web sites and then telling only
certain people about certain images (or, more specifically, by giving them
only a certain Web site address). Other than someone deliberately searching
for your photos online, people will go and look at only those photos that
you’re directing them to, and by controlling whom you tell, you control who
sees your images. Of course, if you want everyone and anyone to see all your
photos, you can store them all in the same place and use your name to iden-
tify them, making it possible for anyone to find them by searching the Web.
So where are these Web sites where your pictures can be found? They’re
everywhere — from the You’ve Got Pictures feature at America Online to
sites that are hosted by the big names in cameras, such as Kodak. These
sites are easy to use and easy to access, and they make sharing your photos
with whomever you want very simple. I talk about different sites and the
pros and cons of each a little later in this chapter in the “Using commercial
sharing sites and services” section.
Sharing images with business associates
So you’ve opened a new warehouse or have a new product to offer. Don’t
spend the extra cash printing thousands of brochures or product information
sheets, and certainly don’t skimp and print black-and-white fliers because
printing in color is so expensive. Color is cheap online, and the cost (if any) of
sharing your images online is just a tiny fraction of the cost of printing.

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
If you don’t have access to your company’s Web site, you can usually get
some free Web space from the people that you’re already paying to provide
your e-mail and Internet connection — your ISP (Internet service provider).
Whether your ISP is an online community, such as AOL or MSN, or another
firm, such as Earthlink or AT&T, you can take advantage of the free Web space
that’s allocated to each customer. Although you probably won’t be given a lot
of space, you may have enough to share a bunch of photos because photos
that are saved for the Web (in GIF or JPG format) have a much smaller file size
than photos shared in other formats. Even if your ISP gives you only 10MB of
space, you can get a lot of photos in that space.
To find out whether your ISP offers free Web space, call its support phone
number or visit its Web site. AOL makes it easy. By choosing Create a Home
Page from AOL’s People menu, you can create a personal or business Web
site.
Just as AOL offers a lot of help in setting up your home page, most ISPs offer
either online or phone support to coach you through the process. The folks
at most ISPs assume that if you’re using their free space rather than register-
ing a domain of your own, you’re probably not a full-fledged Web designer.
Using Earthlink as an example, browsing to www.earthlink.net/home/
benefits/webspace takes you to a page where you can click the Click-n-Build
link and quickly put together a 6MB Web site. In fact, as its first suggestion,
Earthlink recommends using its Free Webspace page to create a photo album.
Choosing a Web-Based Photo Sharing System
There are really too many free Web-page hosting sites to list, and deciding
which ones will remain active during the life of this book is too difficult. You
can find an up-to-date guide to free or nearly free hosting services at www.
clickherefree.com. Of course, I’m hoping that service doesn’t become
defunct soon, too! Your best bet is to use your ISP or other big operations like
AOL, MSN, and Kodak, which are likely to be with us over the long haul. Of
course, longevity may not be important to you. After all, when one service
pulls up stakes and packs up its tent, you can always switch to another,
newer free service. As a bonus, you don’t have to worry about erasing all
your outdated photos from the old service. The service does it for you when
it closes up the shop.
You have a lot of choices for displaying your images. Some of these are as
follows:
✦You can use an online sharing system to display your images. Most of
these systems offer the space for free.
✦You can build your own Web site using the free space that your ISP offers,
or you can register your own domain and set up your own space on a
host’s Web server. In this case, a host offers space on its computer for
you to store your pages, usually for a monthly or annual fee.
✦You can set up your own Web server (a computer that “serves up” Web
pages to people on the Internet), but I wouldn’t recommend this option
solely to store your images.
324

Book I
Chapter 21
Sharing Pictures 
on the Web
Choosing a Web-Based Photo Sharing System
With all of these options, choosing a sharing system is easy. The best option
for you just depends on what you want, how much you’re willing to pay, and
how much time you want to devote to setting up your images online. From
simple and set up in no time to slightly complex and completely customized,
the choices run the entire spectrum.
Using commercial sharing sites and services
Commercial normally means “for a fee,” right? Well, not necessarily. Many 
of your sharing options are free, or they use something that you’re already
paying for. In the case of an online community, such as America Online, if
you’re a member, you’re already paying for that membership. This enables
you to send and receive e-mail, chat, surf the Web, and so on. For AOL’s
monthly fee, you get access to the Internet and to AOL’s community features.
One of those features is You’ve Got Pictures, which enables you to view
your images online — and allows others to view them, too. You also get free
Web space with your membership, which you can use for storing and display-
ing your photos. Doing business with an organization that sees you as a
member is easy. The organization wants to provide services that you’ll come
to depend on, and that’s all a part of keeping you as a customer. Therefore,
you’ll find both the You’ve Got Pictures and the Hometown features easy to
use and simple to maintain, and you can get technical support when you
need it. AOL doesn’t want you to go away mad (or go away at all!).
Other commercial sharing services — Web sites known as online galleries —
allow you to post your images for free, in exchange for making you look at
ads around the periphery of the Web page that displays your images. The
thinking is that by exposing you (and those you send to the site to see your
photos) to the ads, the gallery’s advertising partners gain exposure to a
considerable customer base. Other sharing services provide free space
simply because they want to be nice or to perpetuate an interest in photog-
raphy. Some services sell software, which they offer you throughout their
site, enticing you to buy their image-editing and/or photo album application.
You don’t have to buy, but the companies figure that many people will do so.
Quite a few different services are available. Your best bet for finding them 
is to type “Online Galleries” (include the quotation marks) or similar key
words into the Google search engine (www.google.com) to find services like
Club Photo’s Photodrop. Most services offer similar features, and as an
example in the next section, I describe the biggest and bestest, America
Online’s You’ve Got Pictures/Picture Center.
Using America Online’s You’ve Got 
Pictures and Picture Center
If you’re a member of AOL or find its monthly fee to be low enough to join just
so that you can take advantage of its picture-display features, you’ll find that
the AOL system is very easy to use. Before sharing pictures online using the
You’ve Got Pictures feature, make sure that your digital camera is attached to
your computer or that you have scanned photos that you’re ready to upload
from your hard drive.
325

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
AOL’s photo-sharing site is called the Picture Center on the opening screen,
and a large “Sponsored by Kodak” logo appears on the You’ve Got Pictures
welcome page. However, the capabilities remain much the same as with ear-
lier AOL versions. From the site where your pictures are stored (which you
can share with others, letting them know that they can see the pictures
online), you can save the images to your computer for editing and printing.
You can also order things, such as mugs and t-shirts with your images on
them, or you can order enlargements and high-quality reprints.
The following sections provide a list of things that you can do with AOL’s
You’ve Got Pictures/Picture Center.
Create an Online Album
Click the Online Album button and a dialog box pops up, showing you exactly
how to upload your photos to an album that you can display on the Web. An
Add Pictures Now button lets you browse your hard drive for photos and
then move them to an album layout page. You can select specific pictures for
display and rotate them.
Click the Add to My Album button, and a wizard leads you through the steps
to upload the photos to AOL. You can add or edit a title or create captions,
and you can choose an album style that suits your personality. AOL currently
offers three different layouts and hundreds of backgrounds — ranging from
patterns and textures to special occasions, colors, and animals.
AOL even includes an e-mail facility that you can use to notify people of your
new album. The boilerplate e-mail includes instructions for accessing the
album. You can send the mail to any or all the people in your AOL address
book.
Idea Center
This set of pages offers tips on creating a photo gallery, sharing ideas with
other users, getting information on digital cameras, and using special fea-
tures such as seasonal photography ideas.
Print Store
The Print Store has facilities for making prints from photos in your gallery
at reasonable prices, creating super-sized prints, producing photo greeting
cards, and ordering customized photo picture gifts, including ceramic pic-
ture mugs, mouse pads, jigsaw puzzles, sweatshirts, and t-shirts.
Why would you need to order prints if you can just print the online images?
Web-safe image formats (normally .jpg for photos) are often posted at a
less-than-optimum quality to save loading time when someone visits the
page where the images are displayed. Therefore, if you print the online ver-
sion of the image, you’re likely to get a grainy or less detailed version of the
image. If you have a high-resolution version of the image on your own com-
puter, you can print from that, or you can order the prints (for a fee) from
Kodak, through the same AOL site where you posted your Picture Center
images for sharing.

AOL Photo Galleries
This section of the Picture Center offers a variety of photos to view. You can
see galleries that were submitted by other AOL users as well as view special
exhibitions. In recent months, the AOL Photo Galleries have included dis-
plays by Associated Press Pulitzer Prize winners, a Fall Folio of autumn
leaves, nature photographs, and home renovation pictures taken from the
This Old House PBS television series.
Digital Camera Center
This section offers lots of tutorials that can help you find out more about
your digital camera, including a Digital Question of the Week, a Digital
Cameras 101 basic course, a review of the latest digital cameras, and a
beginner’s My First Digital Camera section. Of course, these sections may
change by the time you visit the Digital Camera Center, but discovering the
new goodies is half the fun!
My Pictures
This section is reserved for viewing and maintaining any albums that you
have created in the Picture Center. The page includes three “departments,”
as follows:
✦Pictures on My Computer: Photos on your hard drive that you haven’t
uploaded to AOL yet.
✦My Albums Saved on AOL: Multiple albums that you’ve created from
pictures that you’ve uploaded.
✦Albums I’ve Received: Your friends can send you their albums, which
you can keep on AOL and view whenever you want. You can also edit
any of the albums using the AOL tools.
You can purchase a dock for your digital camera (a Kodak digital camera, 
of course) that links your camera directly to your computer and to Kodak’s
EasyShare software to facilitate posting your images online and sharing
them with others. To get to the site and find out about what Kodak offers,
visit www.kodak.com. From the resulting Web page, you can click the
EasyShare listing in the Site Index and find out more about the system.
Using your own Web space
Regardless of whether your ISP provides the space for free or you enlisted a
paid host to provide space for your own domain, you can use your Web space
to store and display photos that you want to share with friends, family, cus-
tomers, and business associates. Placing the images online requires you to
take the following simple steps:
1. Prepare your photos for use on the Web by opening them in a photo-
editing package, such as Photoshop Elements, and saving them in a
Web-safe format.

Part IV: Organizing, Printing, and Sharing Your Pictures
The two formats that all Web browsers (notably Internet Explorer and
Netscape Navigator) can deal with are .gif and .jpg. The .jpg format is
best for photos because it supports the multitude of colors and shading
within the images. Figure 21-3 shows the Save for Web dialog box in
Photoshop Elements and a photo that is being prepared for Web use.
2. Set up the Web page where the images are to be displayed.
You can use a variety of graphical tools to design the page (for example,
Microsoft FrontPage, Macromedia Dreamweaver, or Adobe GoLive), or
you can create a page by writing HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
code. Figure 21-4 shows a simple page that is being created using Dream-
weaver. If you’re using an ISP’s free Web space, the ISP should give you
step-by-step procedures for creating a Web page, and the software does
most of the work for you.

3. Upload the Web page and the images.
This is typically done with FTP (File Transfer Protocol) software. Or, if
you’re using AOL or your ISP, the service may provide an Upload page
that loads both the Web page that you set up and the images that you
want to display.
You can find free FTP software online from sites such as www.tucows.com
and www.cnet.com. You can also do a search for free software by typing
“Free FTP Software” at Google (www.google.com). When doing a search
with a phrase like that, remember to use the quotation marks, which
help refine the search to the exact phrase that you’ve typed. Venerable
“oldies” like WSFTP LE, shown in Figure 21-5, are very popular. Folks who
are new to the Internet may prefer a program like FTP Explorer, which
has a Windows Explorer–like interface. You can upload files simply by
dragging them from a Windows Explorer pane to the FTP Explorer
window, as shown in Figure 21-6.

4. Visit the page online to see how it looks.
You should always check your page online to see whether it’s okay before
you send people to your site to see your images.
If you want to make changes, open the Web page file on your own com-
puter, make the changes, and upload the file again.
If you check your page online and you see red Xs (in Internet Explorer) or
gray icons with a question mark (in Netscape Navigator) where the images
should be, this means that the browser can’t locate the image that’s sup-
posed to be there. Check your Web page settings to make sure that you have
the right pictures in the right places, and check to see that you’ve uploaded
all the images to your host’s Web server. If this happens to you just once,
you’ll understand the importance of testing your Web pages after uploading
them. Nothing is more embarrassing than sending someone to your site and
having them report that the images are missing!
As time goes by, you can always expand and improve on your Web pages. You
can try using the following tips:
✦Refreshing content: Edit your Web pages, and add new pictures. Or, take
down the old pictures and replace them with your latest shots. As you
become more proficient in setting up images and designing Web pages,
your site can grow with you.
✦Organizing pictures: Set up multiple Web pages, and use them to catego-
rize your images. For example, set up a Vacations page, a Baby Pictures
page, or a Graduation Ceremony page. Any category or special topic can
have its own page.
✦Adding links: Create links on your Web pages that take visitors to other
people’s sites or to online galleries where you have other pictures stored.
If you’re a real photography bug, you may have some of your more artis-
tic shots stored on a gallery site. Through a link on your own page, you
can direct people to your works of art.
✦Letting others join in: Set up a family Web site, and have each branch 
of your extended family post his or her own images to individual pages.
This can help distant family members stay in touch (add e-mail links to
the pages so that people can view the images and then immediately
write an e-mail to talk about them), and it lets everyone in the family
know about new arrivals and special events, like family reunions.
✦Advertising your business: If you’re in business, use the space to show
pictures of your products, services, staff, and locations — anything that
can enhance your customer’s interest in you and your business. Like a
family site with individual pages for different branches of the family or
types of pictures, businesses can also categorize their images and set
up individual pages to hold each group.
If you thought that your only goal for that box of old photos was to go
through and put them in an album, you can now see that you can do so many
more things with your images. The Internet enables you to share pictures
with anyone, anywhere, and it doesn’t cost much money or take up much of
your time. Have fun!

I
n 1996, I read a technical paper on a new technology from Apple
Computer called FireWire. This new technology promised the ability to
transfer data at speeds of up to 400 megabits per second. “Yeah, right!” I
quietly scoffed to myself, “Why on Earth would anyone need to transfer that
much data that quickly?”
Thankfully I was wrong, and I soon learned about a new phenomenon called
digital video that could take advantage of this new FireWire technology.
Digital video files are big, too big in fact for computers of just a few years
ago to handle. But FireWire allows high-quality video to be shared easily
and efficiently between digital camcorders and computers.
Of course, more than just FireWire was needed for this digital video thing
to catch on. Personal computers still had to become fast enough to handle
digital video, and prices for digital camcorders fell to within reach of mere
mortals only a couple of years ago. Digital video is here now, and anyone
with a reasonably modern computer and a $500 digital camcorder can make
movies like a pro. With the recent advent of DVD players and recordable
DVD drives, sharing your high-quality movies with others has never been
easier.
This chapter introduces you to digital video, showing you how easy it is
to edit and share your movies with others. I end the chapter with a brief
explanation of key videography terms that you’ll find useful as you delve
into digital video.
What Is Digital Video?
Human beings experience the world as an analog environment. When we
take in the serene beauty of a rose garden, the mournful song of a cello, or
the graceful motion of an eagle in flight, we are receiving a steady stream of
infinitely variable data through our various senses. Of course, we don’t think
of all these things as “data” but rather as light, sound, smell, and touch.
Computers are pretty dumb compared to the human brain. They can’t
comprehend the analog data of the world; all computers understand are
yes (1) and no (0). In spite of this limitation, we force our computers to show
pictures, play music, and display moving video. Infinitely variable sounds,
333

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
334
colors, and shapes must be converted into the language of computers — 1s
and 0s. This conversion process is called digitizing. Digital video — often
abbreviated as DV — is video that has been digitized.
To fully understand the difference between analog data and digital data,
suppose you want to draw the profile of a hill. An analog representation of
the profile (shown in Figure 1-1) would follow the contour of the hill per-
fectly, because analog values are infinitely variable. However, a digital con-
tour of that same hill would not be able to follow every single detail of the
hill because, as shown in Figure 1-2, digital values are made up of specifi-
cally defined, individual bits of data.
Comparing analog and digital video
Digital recordings are theoretically inferior to analog recordings because
analog recordings can contain more information. But the truth is that major
advances in digital technology mean that this really doesn’t matter. Yes, a
digital recording must be made up of specific individual values, but modern
recordings have so many discrete values packed so closely together that
human eyes and ears can barely tell the difference. In fact, casual observa-
tion often reveals that digital recordings actually seem to be of a higher
quality than analog recordings. Why?

A major problem with analog recordings is that they are highly susceptible
to deterioration. Every time analog data is copied, some of the original, infi-
nitely variable data is lost. This phenomenon, called generational loss, can
be observed in that dark, grainy copy of a copy of a copy of a wedding video
that was first shot more than 10 years ago. However, digital data doesn’t
have this problem. A 1 is always a 1, no matter how many times it is copied,
and a 0 is always a 0. Likewise, analog recordings are more susceptible to
deterioration after every playback, which explains why your 1964-vintage
Meet the Beatles LP pops and hisses and has lost many of its highs and lows
over the years. Digital recordings are based on instructions that tell the
computer how to create the data. As long as it can read the instructions, it
creates the data the same way every time.
Whether you’re editing analog or digital material, always work from a copy of
the master and keep the master safe. When adding analog material to your
project, the fewer generations your recording is from the original, the better.
When you consider the implications of generational loss on video editing,
you begin to see what a blessing digital video really is. You’re constantly
copying, editing, and recopying content as you edit your movie projects —
and with digital video, you can edit to your heart’s content, confident that
the quality won’t diminish with each new copy that you make.
Why DV is a big deal
Editing video on a Macintosh (or a Microsoft Windows computer, for that
matter) has been possible for quite some time. As early as 1992, Apple was
introducing Macintosh models with special ports that were designed to turn
VHS-type analog video into digital computer files, along with special appli-
cations to edit, format, and display that video on a computer screen.
Likewise, professionals have been editing video using powerful personal
computers and very expensive add-ons and software for well over a decade.
But the advent of digital video has caused a huge fuss over desktop video.
In fact, some folks are calling desktop video a killer application, or killer
app — the type of application, such as desktop publishing or Web publish-
ing, that makes people willing to buy a computer for the sole (or primary)
purpose of performing that new, killer task.
Why all the hoopla? Editing digital video offers a number of advantages
over editing analog video, mostly because of one simple difference: A DV
camcorder creates a computer file as you record. How important can that
one little technicality be? The following points give you an explanation:
✦Ease of transfer: Because a DV camcorder stores its video as computer
data, all you really have to do is copy that data from the camera to a file
on your computer. In the past, analog editing required that the images
go through a digitizing process, in which the computer had to look at the
video as it was played back by the camcorder, analyzing each frame and
turning it into a series of digital images that were stored in a single com-
puter file. This was a time-consuming process that required reasonably
expensive hardware (usually in the form of internal expansion cards)
and a huge amount of computing power. With a DV camera connected

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
336
via a FireWire cable, you’re really just copying the DV data from the
camera to the computer, and it all happens pretty quickly.
✦Image quality: The moment you record video images to VHS tape (and,
to a lesser degree, Betamax tapes), those images lose some quality. VHS
is simply not a medium that thrills the Picassos of the video world. With
DV, on the other hand, the pictures that you get from a sub-$500 DV
camera are almost as good as the video that’s used for the evening
news. And the more expensive the camera, the better the quality, to the
point that a camera that costs only a few thousand dollars can rival the
quality of a professional analog camera costing tens of thousands of dol-
lars. In fact, feature films and television are being recorded on DV cam-
eras right now, and few people can tell the difference between DV and
pro-level analog cameras.
✦Copy quality: When you copy a DV file from one device to another,
signal loss, which results in lower quality, does not occur. With analog
connections, portions of the signal can be lost when the video signal
travels through the analog cabling. You know how a taped TV show gen-
erally looks worse than the original broadcast? Signal loss is partly to
blame. With DV, the taped video is a computer file, so copying the video
doesn’t affect the quality level.
✦Cost: Add everything up — the analog video hardware, a high-quality
analog camera, and a powerful Mac or PC — and shooting and editing
analog video at anything resembling high quality can be a very expen-
sive proposition. With DV, on the other hand, only a few thousand dol-
lars (including the camera, computer, and software) enables you to put
together videos that are good enough for home, educational, or corpo-
rate videos — and probably good enough for the film festival circuit.
(Certainly good enough if The Blair Witch Project — a favorite of mine —
was any indication.)
✦Distribution (or all the cool kids like it): A good number of professional
documentary, independent, and even Hollywood filmmakers are turning
to DV because it offers a revolution, not only in the way that video is made
but also in how it is distributed. That advantage trickles down to those
of us using iMovie, too. With digital video, we can put our movies on CDs,
computer desktops, and the Internet more quickly and cheaply than with
analog technologies. That makes it both easy and fun to get your per-
sonal video projects distributed as widely as your talent can take them.
So, DV makes analog look like the technology that relies on squirrels, eh?
Desktop video’s advantages are part of the reason why DV is seen as a killer
app. And the killer app is what Apple envisioned when it started offering
iMacs, Power Macs, iBooks, and PowerBook models, all sporting FireWire
ports and a little program called iMovie. A little later, Microsoft joined in on
the fun with Windows Movie Maker, and other Windows software companies
like Pinnacle Systems have produced video editing programs like Studio.
Warming up to FireWire
Why do I keep harping about FireWire? Well, it’s one of the hot new tech-
nologies that makes digital video so fun and easy to work with. FireWire —
also sometimes called IEEE 1394 or i.LINK — was originally developed by

What Is Digital Video?
Book II
Chapter 1
Introducing Digital Video
Apple Computer and is an interface format for computer peripherals.
Various peripherals, including scanners, CD/DVD burners, external hard
drives, and of course digital video cameras, use FireWire technology. Key
features of FireWire are as follows:
✦Speed: FireWire is really fast, way faster than USB or serial ports. First-
generation FireWire ports are capable of transfer rates of up to 400 Mbps
(megabits per second), while the latest second-generation FireWire ports
(nicknamed FireWire 800 by those crazy individualists at Apple) can
pump an astonishing 800 Mbps through a connection! Digital video con-
tains a lot of data that must be transferred quickly, making FireWire an
ideal format.
✦Mac and PC compatibility: (What a concept.) Although FireWire was
developed by Apple, it is widely implemented in the PC world as well.
This has helped make FireWire an industry standard.
✦Plug and Play connectivity: When you connect your digital camcorder
to a FireWire port on your computer (whether Mac or PC), the camera is
automatically detected. You don’t have to spend hours installing soft-
ware drivers or messing with obscure computer settings just to get
everything working.
✦Device control: Okay, this one isn’t actually a feature of FireWire; it’s
just one of the things that makes using FireWire really neat. If your digi-
tal camcorder is connected to your computer’s FireWire port, most
video-editing programs can control the camcorder’s playback features.
This means that you don’t have to juggle your fingers and try to press
the Play button on the camcorder and the Record button in the software
at exactly the same time. Just click the Capture button in a program like
iMovie or Pinnacle Studio, and the software automatically starts and
stops your camcorder as needed.
✦Hot-swap capability: You can connect or disconnect FireWire compo-
nents whenever you want. You don’t need to shut down the computer,
unplug power cables, or confer with your local public utility before con-
necting or disconnecting a FireWire component.
All new Macintosh computers come with FireWire ports. Some — but not
all — Windows PCs have FireWire ports as well. If your PC does not have a
FireWire port, you can usually add one via an expansion card. Windows 98
and higher include software support for FireWire hardware. (However,
I strongly recommend that you stick with Windows XP if you’re editing DV
on a PC.) If you’re buying a new PC and you plan to do a lot of video editing,
consider a FireWire port as a must-have feature.
All digital camcorders offer FireWire ports as well, although the port isn’t
always called FireWire. Sometimes FireWire ports are instead called “i.LINK”
or simply “DV” by camcorder manufacturers who don’t want to use Apple’s
trademarked FireWire name. But rest assured, all digital camcorders have a
FireWire-compatible port. FireWire truly makes video editing easy, and if
you are buying a new camcorder, I strongly recommend that you buy a cam-
corder that includes a FireWire port. Chapter 2 of Book II provides more
detail on choosing a great digital camcorder.

What Can You Do with Editing Software?
Okay, computer owners, gather ’round the campfire . . . let’s talk DV. You
already know that DV has advantages over VHS or other types of analog
video. And today’s low-end video editors — like iMovie or Studio — are
simple to use. But why do those advantages add up to a killer app? One
word: editing amateur video (well, okay, three words).
After all, for more than 20 years, you’ve been able to buy a VHS camcorder
and take videos on vacation, on the job, or at school. Before that, 8mm cam-
eras had been available for decades, offering families (from the dark ages of
the 1950s and later) the opportunity to bore other family members and
friends with endless spools of vacation film.
But, unless you were handy with a razor blade and had access to some
high-end equipment, it was beyond the average Jane’s resources to edit that
raw footage into something that can keep Uncle Ralph’s attention.
With a DV camcorder, you can easily get your footage into a FireWire-
equipped Mac. With iMovie or Studio, you can manipulate that footage, edit
it, and send it back out to the camera for easy playback. (Heck, you can
even control the camera from within these programs.) It’s easy, easy, easy.
Okay, using these video editors is easy. But are they powerful programs?
Actually, yes. Even I’m surprised at the sophistication that’s possible with
these programs. (And I don’t surprise easily. That time I cried in the
haunted house was because I was startled, not scared.) You can accomplish
the following video projects with a DV camcorder, a computer, and a video
editor like iMovie or Pinnacle Studio:
✦Home video: Shots of the kids, the dog, the car, the boat, the vacation
house, the beach, the birds, the moon, the stars, the relaxing ebb and
flow of the tide . . . (sorry, I got lost in the moment). Any of that stuff can
be dumped into your computer, edited, transitioned, and titled to make
it more entertaining to family and friends.
✦Event video: Shoot the company softball game, a kid’s play, or a church
function. Then edit it and clean up the sound, and you have it archived
for posterity.
✦Educational video: Teachers and students alike can use a video camera
and a video editor to document and edit all sorts of projects, from inde-
pendent research projects to field trips to the zoo or aquarium.
Likewise, kids can edit a video for a school-based news channel, teacher
or principal announcements, and so on.
✦Training video: Teachers, trainers, or human resources departments
can shoot training videos, informational videos, or videos of company
seminars that need to be edited and handed out to new hires or others
on a need-to-know basis. Plus, today’s video editors let you add still
images, animations, and graphics that were created in other programs,
so you can cut between slides and live action for training purposes.

Editing Video
Book II
Chapter 1
Introducing Digital Video
✦Organizational or sales video: Need to sell something, ask for money,
or otherwise toot your own organizational horn? A DV camcorder and
video editor are perfect for that sort of thing. Shoot the product entic-
ingly, interview your CEO or director, and show the world what your
organization is made of.
✦Fiction: Write something! Make something up! Assemble actors or
friends or family, and start yelling “Action!” and “Cut!”
Even without new footage from a DV camcorder, you can translate other
video, photos, or animation into a readable format (external devices for trans-
lating VHS tapes, for instance, are available) and edit away using your video
editor. For example, iMovie is a great way to create a standalone, narrated
slide show or presentation, even if it doesn’t have a lick of video footage.
Editing Video
Editing video projects with a program like Pinnacle Studio or Apple iMovie
is pretty easy, but this wasn’t always the case. Until recently, the only prac-
tical way for the average person to edit video was to connect two VCRs and
use the Record and Pause buttons to cut unwanted parts. This was a
tedious and inefficient process. The up-to-date (and vastly improved) way
to edit video is to use a computer. This section introduces you to the video-
editing techniques that you’re most likely to use. Check out Chapters 8
through 12 of Book II for the details on video editing.
Video (and audio, for that matter) is considered a linear medium because it
comes at you in a linear stream through time. A still picture, on the other
hand, just sits there — you take it in all at once — and a Web site lets you
jump randomly from page to page. Because neither of these is perceived as
a stream, they’re both examples of nonlinear media.
You tweak a linear medium (such as video) by using one of two basic meth-
ods — linear or nonlinear editing. If your approach to editing is linear, you
must do all the editing work in chronological order, from the start of the
movie to the finish. Here’s an old-fashioned example: If you “edit” video by
dubbing certain parts from a camcorder tape onto a VHS tape in your VCR,
you have to do all your edits in one session, in chronological order. As you
probably guessed, linear editing is terribly inefficient. If you dub a program
and then decide to perform an additional edit, subsequent video usually
has to be redubbed. (Oh, the pain, the tedium.)
What is the alternative? Thinking outside the line: nonlinear editing! You can
do nonlinear edits in any order; you don’t have to start at the beginning and
slog on through to the end every time. The magical gizmo that makes non-
linear editing possible is a combination of the personal computer and pro-
grams that are designed for nonlinear editing (NLE). Using such a program
(for example, Apple iMovie or Pinnacle Studio), you can navigate to any
scene in the movie, insert scenes, move them around, cut them out of the
timeline altogether, and slice, dice, tweak, and fine-tune to your heart’s
content.

Defining Key Image Terms
Most language and practices of video creation are rooted in film production.
Terms that were first coined in the era of silver nitrate film and megaphones
are still the fundamental lexicon of videography. This rich language contin-
ues to exist because video technology has, in many ways, simply improved
rather than evolved. Today, when you talk about shutter speeds or wide-
angle shots, you’re communicating ideas that are based on the develop-
ment of a time-honored craft. Your understanding of key words and
concepts makes a world of difference in the quality of your videos. The fol-
lowing list of key terms and ideas can help you develop wonderful shots:
✦CCD: In video, a camera acquires light and color on chips called Charge-
Coupled Devices, or CCDs. These CCDs collect visual images and con-
vert them into either an analog signal (waves with varying amplitudes)
or, in the case of your digital camcorder, a digital signal (a series of 1s
and 0s).
✦Focal point: The convex (curved outward) shape of a lens bends an
image and reduces it to a point, which is called the focal point.
✦Focal plane: The point where the object being photographed is in focus
and optimized in the lens. The image is an exact two-dimensional (2-D)
likeness of the object that is being photographed.
✦Focal length: The distance between the lens and the focal point.
✦Aperture: The opening of a lens that controls the amount of light that’s
permitted to reach either the film or CCD in video cameras. It controls
the amount of light that reaches the focal plane. The aperture is also
sometimes called the iris.
Aperture is calculated as the focal length divided by the diameter of
your lens. This measurement is also referred to as an f-stop. For exam-
ple, a 100mm lens with a diameter of 50mm has a maximum aperture 
(or f-stop) of f/2 (100mm divided by 50mm). 
If you have photography experience, you’ll be happy to know that the same
concepts in photography apply in video (and digital video).
You can also check out Book I, where you can find in-depth coverage of all
aspects of digital photography, as well as the book Photography For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Russell Hart (published by Wiley).

f you have just turned here from Chapter 1 of this minibook hoping to
find out how to achieve world peace, I’m sorry, but I can’t be of much
help. My editors noted that world peace was not in the original outline, so
that content had to be cut. Also, there was some question as to whether I
successfully resolved that Mac-versus-PC thing.
Fortunately, I can tell you about digital video gear because it was approved
in the outline. The most important piece of gear is, of course, a digital
camcorder.
Finding Information about Digital Camcorders
Digital camcorders — also called DV (digital video) camcorders — are
among the hot consumer electronics products today. This means that you
can choose from many different makes and models, with cameras to fit vir-
tually any budget. But cost isn’t the only important factor as you try to
figure out which camera is best for you. You need to read and understand
the spec sheet for each camera and determine whether it will fit your needs.
The next few sections help you understand the basic mechanics of how a
camera works, as well as compare the different types of cameras available.
I don’t make specific camera model recommendations — the market is con-
stantly changing — but I can list some up-to-date resources to help you
compare the latest and greatest digital camcorders. My favorites are
✦CNET.com (www.cnet.com): This is a great online resource for informa-
tion on various computer and electronics products. The editorial
reviews are helpful, and you can read comments from actual owners of
the products being reviewed. The Web site also provides links to vari-
ous online retailers. If you order a camcorder online, consider more
than just the price. Find out how much shipping will cost and pay close
attention to the retailer’s rating on CNET. Retailers earn high star ratings
by being honest with customers and fulfilling orders when promised.

Mastering Video Fundamentals
Before you go in quest of a camcorder, I recommend reviewing the funda-
mentals of video and how camcorders work. In modern camcorders, an
image is captured by a Charged-Coupled Device (CCD) — a sort of electronic
eye. The image is converted into digital data, and then that data is recorded
magnetically on tape.
The mechanics of video recording
It is the springtime of love as John and Marsha bound towards each other
across the blossoming meadow. The lovers’ adoring eyes meet as they race
to each other, arms raised in anticipation of a passionate embrace. Suddenly,
John is distracted by a ringing cell phone, and he stumbles, sliding face-first
into the grass and flowers at Marsha’s feet. A cloud of pollen flutters away
on the gentle breeze, irritating Marsha’s allergies, which erupt in a massive
sneezing attack.
As this scene unfolds, light photons bounce off John, Marsha, the blossom-
ing meadow, the flying dust from John’s mishap, and everything else in the
shot. Some of those photons pass through the lens of your camcorder. The
lens focuses the photons on transistors in the CCD. The transistors are
excited, and the CCD converts this excitement into data, which is then mag-
netically recorded on tape for later playback and editing. This process, illus-
trated in Figure 2-1, is repeated approximately 30 times per second.
Most mass-market DV camcorders have a single CCD, but higher-quality
cameras have three CCDs. In such cameras, individual CCDs capture red,
green, and blue light, respectively. Multi-CCD cameras are expensive (typi-
cally over $1,000), but the images produced are near-broadcast quality.
Early video cameras used video pickup tubes instead of CCDs. Tubes were
inferior to CCDs in many ways, particularly in the way they handled extremes
of light. Points of bright light (such as a light bulb) bled and streaked light
across the picture, and low-light situations were simply too dark to shoot.

Broadcast formats
A lot of new terms have entered the videophile’s lexicon in recent years:
NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. These terms identify broadcast television standards,
which are vitally important to you if you plan to edit video — because your
cameras, TVs, tape decks, and DVD players probably conform to only one
broadcast standard. Which standard is for you? That depends mainly on
where you live:
✦NTSC (National Television Standards Committee): Used primarily in
North America, Japan, and the Philippines.
✦PAL (Phase Alternating Line): Used primarily in Western Europe,
Australia, Southeast Asia, and South America.
✦SECAM (Sequential Couleur Avec Memoire): This category covers sev-
eral similar standards used primarily in France, Russia, Eastern Europe,
and Central Asia.
What you need to know about video standards
The most important thing to know about the three broadcast standards is
that they are not compatible with each other. If you try to play an NTSC-
format videotape in a PAL video deck (for example), the tape won’t work,
even if both decks use VHS tapes. This is because VHS is merely a physical
tape format and not a video format. 
On a more practical note, make sure you buy the right kind of equipment.
Usually this isn’t a problem. If you live in the United States or Canada, your
local electronics stores will sell only NTSC equipment. But if you’re shopping
online and find a store in the United Kingdom that seems to offer a really
great deal on a camcorder, beware: That UK store probably sells only PAL
equipment. A PAL camcorder is virtually useless if all your TVs are NTSC.
Another consideration involves video-editing software. Many video-editing
programs are compatible with both NTSC and PAL video, so make sure to
use program settings that match whatever video format you’re working
with. Here’s how to check settings in the programs featured in this book:
✦Apple iMovie: iMovie automatically detects your standard when you
capture video. If you want to export to a different format, choose
File➪Export➪To QuickTime, and then choose Expert Settings in the
Formats menu. Click Export, and then click Options in the Save
Exported File As dialog box. Click Settings under Video, and choose a
compressor that matches the standard you want to use (such as
DV–NTSC or DV–PAL).
✦Pinnacle Studio: Open Studio and choose Setup➪Capture Source. Make
sure that the TV Standard menu is set to your local standard.
✦Windows Movie Maker: From within the program, choose Tools➪
Options. On the Advanced tab of the Options dialog box, choose NTSC
or PAL under Video Properties.
343

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
344
About 99.975% of the time, you won’t need to change your video standard.
You should adjust video standard settings only if you know that you’re
working with video from one standard and need to export it to a VCR or
camcorder that uses a different standard. 
Some nice-to-know stuff about video standards
Video standards differ in two primary ways:
✦Video standards have different frame rates. The frame rate of video is
the number of individual images that appear per second, thus providing
the illusion that subjects on-screen are moving. Frame rate is usually
abbreviated as fps (frames per second). 
✦The video standards use different resolutions. Table 2-1 details the
differences.
Table 2-1
Video Standards
Standard
Frame Rate
Resolution
NTSC
29.97 fps
525 lines
PAL
25 fps
625 lines
SECAM
25 fps
625 lines
You’re probably familiar with resolution measurements for computer moni-
tors. Computer resolution is measured in pixels. If your monitor’s resolution
is set to 1024 x 768, the display image is 1024 pixels wide by 768 pixels high.
TV resolution, on the other hand, is usually measured by the number of hor-
izontal lines in the image. An NTSC video image, for example, has 525 lines
of resolution. This means that the video image is drawn in 525 separate hor-
izontal lines across the screen.
Interlacing versus progressive scan
A video picture is usually drawn as a series of horizontal lines. An electron
gun at the back of the picture tube draws lines of the video picture back
and forth, much like the printer head on your printer moves back and forth
as it prints words on a page. All three broadcast video standards — NTSC,
PAL, and SECAM — are interlaced, meaning the horizontal lines are drawn in
two passes rather than one. Every other line is drawn on each consecutive
pass, and each of these passes is called a field. So on a PAL display, which
shows 25 fps, there are actually 50 fields per second.
Noninterlaced displays are becoming more common. Modern computer
monitors, for example, are all noninterlaced — all the lines are drawn in a
single pass. Some HDTV (high-definition television) formats are noninter-
laced; others are interlaced.
Most camcorders record interlaced video, but some high-end camcorders
also offer a progressive-scan mode. Progressive scan — a fancy way of saying
noninterlaced — is a worthwhile feature if you can afford it, especially if you

Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing a Camcorder
Mastering Video Fundamentals
shoot a lot of video of fast-moving subjects. With an interlaced camera,
a problem I call interlacing jaggies can show up on video with a lot of move-
ment. Figure 2-2, for example, shows video of a fast-moving subject that was
shot using an interlaced camera. The stick seems to have some horizontal
slices taken out of it, an unfortunate illusion created because the subject
was moving so fast that the stick was in different places when each field of
the video frame was captured. If the entire frame had been captured in one
pass (as would have happened with a progressive-scan camcorder), the
horizontal anomalies would not appear.
The many aspects of aspect ratios
Different moving picture displays have different shapes. The screens in movie
theaters, for example, look like long rectangles; most TV screens and com-
puter monitors are almost square. The shape of a video display is called the
aspect ratio. The following two sections look at how aspect ratios affect your
video work.
Image aspect ratios
The aspect ratio of a typical television screen is 4:3 (four to three) — for
any given size, the display is four units wide and three units high. To put
this in real numbers, measure the width and height of a TV or computer
monitor that you have nearby. If the display is 32 cm wide, for example, you
should notice that it’s also about 24 cm high. If a picture completely fills
this display, the picture has a 4:3 aspect ratio.
Different numbers are sometimes used to describe the same aspect ratio.
Basically, some people who make the packaging for movies and videos get
carried away with their calculators, so rather than call an aspect ratio 4:3,
they divide each number by three and call it 1.33:1 instead. Likewise, some-
times the aspect ratio 16:9 is divided by nine to give the more cryptic-looking
number 1.78:1. Mathematically, these are just different numbers that mean
the same thing.

346
A lot of movies are distributed on tape and DVD today in widescreen format.
The aspect ratio of a widescreen picture is often (but not always) 16:9. If
you watch a widescreen movie on a 4:3 TV screen, you see black bars (also
called letterboxes) at the top and bottom of the screen. This format is popu-
lar because it more closely matches the aspect ratio of the movie-theater
screens for which films are usually shot. Figure 2-3 illustrates the difference
between the 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.
A common misconception is that 16:9 is the aspect ratio of all big-screen
movies. In fact, various aspect ratios for film have been used over the years.
Many movies have an aspect ratio of over 2:1, meaning that the image is
more than twice as wide as it is high! But for many films, 16:9 is considered
close enough. More to the point, it’s just right for you — because if your
camcorder has a widescreen mode, its aspect ratio is probably 16:9. 
Pixel aspect ratios
You may already be familiar with image aspect ratios, but did you know that
pixels can have various aspect ratios too? If you have ever worked with a
drawing or graphics program on a computer, you’re probably familiar with
pixels. A pixel is the smallest piece of a digital image. Thousands — or even
millions — of uniquely colored pixels combine in a grid to form an image on
a television or computer screen. On computer displays, pixels are square.
But in standard video, pixels are rectangular. In NTSC video, pixels are taller
than they are wide, and in PAL or SECAM, pixels are wider than they are tall.
Pixel aspect ratios become an issue when you start using still images cre-
ated as computer graphics — for example, a JPEG photo you took with a
digital camera and imported into your computer — in projects that also
contain standard video. If you don’t prepare the still graphic carefully, it
could appear distorted when viewed on a TV.
Color
Remember back in the old days when many personal computers used regular
televisions for monitors? In the early ’80s, I had a Commodore 64 hooked up
to a TV — it made sense at the time — but these days it’s hard to believe,
especially when you consider how dissimilar TVs and computer monitors
have become. Differences include interlacing versus progressive scan, hori-
zontal resolution lines, and unique pixel aspect ratios. On top of all that,
TVs and computer monitors use different kinds of color.

Choosing a Camcorder
Picking a Camera Format
Computer monitors utilize what is called the RGB color space. RGB stands
for red-green-blue, meaning that all the colors you see on a computer moni-
tor are combined by blending those three colors. TVs, on the other hand,
use the YUV color space. YUV stands for luminance-chrominance. This tells
us two things:
✦Whoever’s in charge of making up video acronyms can’t spell.
✦Brightness in video displays is treated as a separate component from
color. Luminance is basically just a fancy word for brightness, and
chrominance means color in non-techie speak.
I could go on for pages describing the technicalities of the YUV color space,
but there are really only two important things you need to know about color: 
✦Some RGB colors won’t show up properly on a TV. This is an issue
mainly when you try to use JPEGs or other computer-generated graph-
ics in a video project, or when you adjust the colors of a video image by
using effects and color settings in your video-editing program. RGB
colors that won’t appear properly in the YUV color space are often said
to be illegal or out of gamut. You won’t get arrested for trying to use
them, but they will stubbornly refuse to look right. Generally speaking,
illegal colors are ones with RGB values below 20 or above 230. Graphics
programs can usually tell you RGB values for the colors in your images.
Some graphics programs (like Adobe Photoshop) even have special fil-
ters that help you filter out broadcast “illegal” colors from your images. 
✦Video colors won’t look exactly right when you view them on a com-
puter monitor. Because you’ll probably do most of your video editing
while looking at a computer monitor, you won’t necessarily see the
same colors that appear when the video is viewed on a TV. That’s one
reason professional video editors connect broadcast-style video moni-
tors to their computer workstations. An external video monitor allows
an editor to preview colors as they actually appear on a TV.
Picking a Camera Format
A variety of video recording formats exist to meet almost any budget. By far
the most common digital format today is MiniDV, but a few others exist as
well. Some digital alternatives are expensive, professionally-oriented for-
mats; other formats are designed to keep costs down or allow the use of
very small camcorders. (Various analog formats still exist, though they are
quickly disappearing in favor of superior digital formats.) I describe the
most common video formats in the following sections.
MiniDV
MiniDV has become the most common format for consumer digital video-
tape. Virtually all digital camcorders sold today use MiniDV; blank tapes are
now easy to find and reasonably affordable. If you’re still shopping for a
camcorder and are wondering which format is best for all-around use,
MiniDV is it.
347

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
348
MiniDV tapes are small — more compact than even audiocassette tapes.
Small is good because smaller tape-drive mechanisms mean smaller, lighter
camcorders. Tapes come in a variety of lengths, the most common length
being 60 minutes.
All MiniDV devices use the IEEE-1394 FireWire interface to connect to com-
puters, and the DV codec serves to compress and capture video. (A codec —
short for compressor/decompressor — is a compression scheme that shrinks
the size of a DV clip.) The DV codec is supported by virtually all FireWire
hardware and video-editing software.
Digital8
Until recently, MiniDV tapes were expensive and available only at specialty
electronics stores, so Sony developed the Digital8 format as an affordable
alternative. Digital8 camcorders use Hi8 tapes instead of MiniDV tapes. A
120-minute Hi8 tape can hold 60 minutes of Digital8 video. Initially the
cheaper, easily available Hi8 tapes gave Digital8 camcorders a significant
cost advantage; however, MiniDV tapes have improved dramatically in price
and availability, making the bulkier Digital8 camcorders and tapes less
attractive.
Sony still offers a wide variety of affordably priced, high-quality Digital8
camcorders — Hitachi has offered Digital8s as well — and the format has
modernized to stay competitive. Digital8 camcorders record digital video by
using the same DV codec as MiniDV cameras, and Digital8 camcorders also
include i.LINK (Sony’s trade name for FireWire) ports. Digital8 cameras gen-
erally offer equivalent video quality to MiniDV cameras of similar price.
If you already have a lot of old Hi8 tapes and you’re on a tight budget, a
Digital8 camcorder may be worth considering. Digital8 camcorders have an
analog mode, which means they can read the analog video recorded by
your old Hi8 camcorder.
Keep in mind that Hi8/Digital8 compatibility goes only one way: Hi8 cam-
corders cannot read Digital8 video.
Other digital formats
Although MiniDV has become the predominant standard for consumer digi-
tal camcorders, many other formats exist. In addition to Digital8 (described
in the previous section), the available alternative formats include these:
✦DVD-R: A few digital camcorders now use recordable DVDs as the record-
ing medium. The main benefit of this format is that you can place a
recorded DVD into any computer with a DVD-ROM drive — no FireWire
required — or directly into your DVD player. Alas, there are downsides:
These units are still quite expensive, and built-in DVD-R drives draw a
heavy load from camcorder batteries. If you go this route, plan to use a
lot of wall current.
✦DVCAM: Originally developed by Sony for video professionals, this
format is based on MiniDV but offers a more robust tape design, higher
image quality, and some high-end features designed to appeal mainly to

Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing a Camcorder
Picking a Camera Format
professional video producers and editors. DVCAM camcorders tend
to cost about as much as a new economy car, and get much lower gas
mileage.
✦DVCPro: This is another expensive, MiniDV-based, professional-grade
format like Sony’s DVCAM. Panasonic is responsible for the DVCPro
format.
✦Digital Betacam: Here’s yet another professional format that most of us
probably can’t afford. Digital Betacam (another Sony creation) is based
on the dearly departed Betacam SP analog format, which for years was
a beloved format among professional videographers.
✦MicroMV: Someone at Sony really likes to create new recording formats.
(Remember Betamax?) Sony offers a few consumer-priced camcorders
that use the MicroMV format. As the name suggests, MicroMV tapes are
really small, allowing MicroMV camcorders to be small and light as well.
(Canon somehow manages to make some tiny MiniDV camcorders, but
if you must have a teensy-weensy Sony, then MicroMV is your format.)
With any alternative recording format, the first two things you should con-
sider are price and availability of recording media. If you’re considering a
camcorder that uses the WhizbangDV format, ask yourself how many stores
sell WhizbangDV tapes. Will you still be able to find WhizbangDV tapes five
years from now? 
Analog formats
Analog video has been with us for decades, but it is fading quickly from the
scene. Countless analog formats still exist. You’ve probably seen these for-
mats around, and you might have even owned (or still own) a camcorder
that uses one. Besides the generational-loss problems of analog video that I
describe in Chapter 1 of Book II, analog formats usually provide fewer hori-
zontal lines of resolution. The very best analog formats offer a maximum of
400 resolution lines — which is where the very cheapest digital formats start
(lots of MiniDV camcorders offer 500 resolution lines or more). Table 2-2
provides a brief overview of common analog formats.

Choosing a Camera with the Right Features
When you go shopping for a new digital camcorder, you’ll be presented with
a myriad of specifications and features. Your challenge is to sort through all
the hoopla and figure out whether the camera will meet your specific needs.
When reviewing the spec sheet for any new camcorder, pay special atten-
tion to these items:
✦CCDs: A 3-CCD (also called 3-chip) camcorder provides much better
image quality but is also a lot more expensive. A 3-CCD camera is by no
means mandatory, but it is nice to have.
✦Progressive scan: This is another feature that is nice but not absolutely
mandatory. (To get a line on whether it’s indispensable to your project,
you may want to review the section on interlaced video earlier in this
chapter.)
✦Resolution: Some spec sheets list horizontal lines of resolution (for
example: 525 lines); others list the number of pixels (for example:
690,000 pixels). Either way, more is better when it comes to resolution.
✦Optical zoom: Spec sheets usually list optical and digital zoom sepa-
rately. Digital zoom numbers are usually high (200x, for example) and
seem appealing. Ignore the big digital zoom number and focus (get it?)
on the optical zoom factor (which describes how well the camera lens
actually sees); the optical zoom factor should be in the 12x–25x range.
Digital zoom just crops the picture captured by the CCD and then makes
each remaining pixel bigger to fill the screen, resulting in greatly
reduced image quality. 
✦Tape format: MiniDV is the most common format, but for your equip-
ment, using other formats might make more sense.
✦Batteries: How long does the included battery supposedly last, and how
much do extra batteries cost? I recommend that you buy a camcorder
that uses lithium ion batteries — they last longer and are easier to main-
tain than NiMH (nickel-metal-hydride) batteries.
✦Microphone connector: For the sake of sound quality, the camcorder
should have some provisions for connecting an external microphone.
(You don’t want your audience to think, “Gee, it’d be a great movie if it
didn’t have all that whirring and sneezing.”) Most camcorders have a
standard mini-jack connector for an external mic, and some high-end
camcorders have a 3-pin XLR connector. XLR connectors — also some-
times called balanced audio connectors — are used by many high-quality
microphones and PA (public address) systems.
✦Manual controls: Virtually all modern camcorders offer automatic focus
and exposure control, but sometimes manual control is preferable.
Control rings around the lens are easier to use than tiny knobs or slider
switches on the side of the camera — and you’ll be familiar with them if
you already know how to use 35mm film cameras.

Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing a Camcorder
Choosing a Camera with the Right Features
The spec sheet may try to draw your attention to various other camcorder
features as well, but not all these features are as useful as the salesman
might like you to believe. Features that seem exciting but are generally less
important include
✦Night vision: Some camcorders have an infrared mode that enables you
to record video even in total darkness. Sony’s NightShot is an example
of this feature. If you want to shoot nature videos of nocturnal animals
this may be appealing to you, but for day-to-day videography, it’s less
useful than you might think.
✦Still photos: Many new digital camcorders can also take still photos.
This is handy if you want to shoot both video and stills but don’t want
to lug along two cameras — but even relatively cheap digital still cam-
eras take better photos than camcorders (even the most expensive
ones). 
✦USB port: Some camcorders offer a USB connection in addition to
FireWire. USB can be handy for transferring still photos into your com-
puter, but I strongly recommend that you rely on FireWire for digital
video capture. Many computer USB ports are not fast enough to handle
full quality digital video. 
✦Bluetooth: This is a new wireless networking technology that allows
various types of electronic components — including camcorders and
computers — to connect to each other using radio waves instead of
cables. Unfortunately the maximum data rate of current Bluetooth tech-
nology is still comparatively low (less than one megabit per second). In
practical terms, that means Bluetooth won’t be suitable for capturing
digital video from your camcorder for the foreseeable future. A few cam-
corders incorporate Bluetooth technology anyway, and that may (or
may not) come in handy if you still own the same camcorder a few years
from now.
351
The importance of being filtered
Oddly, many camcorders come out of the box with-
out any filter for the lens, even though all digital cam-
corders I’ve encountered are capable of accepting
them. Filters can be used for quite a few different
effects and touches, including changing the tone of
shots, helping with glare, and giving the shot a
slightly fuzzier, warmer, film-like look. (Suddenly I
feel like I’m writing copy for a toy catalog.)
In the meantime, buy and use a UV (ultraviolet light)
filter for your camcorder at all times! Install it and
forget about it, at least until you go to change the
filter. (In fact, you can usually stack other filters on
top of the UV filter.) The filter does two things: It pro-
tects the optics from damaging UV light, and it
offers a barrier from scratches and spills. Plus, if
the filter gets dirty or dusty or smudged, you can
clean it and eventually replace it with a new one.
Replacing a damaged lens, on the other hand, can
be so pricey that you may opt to replace the
camera instead.

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
352
And then there are some features that are essentially useless. Don’t pay
extra for these:
✦In-camera special effects: Most digital camcorders boast some built-
in effects. But why? You can add special effects much more effectively
(so to speak) by using your editing software on your computer.
✦Digital zoom: Digital zoom makes the image appear blocky and
pixilated — again, why do it? I tend to ignore the big digital-zoom
claims that camcorder manufacturers like to advertise. When you
test the zoom feature on a camcorder, make sure you can disable
digital zoom. Bottom line: You should be able to prevent the camera
from automatically switching to digital zoom when you reach the
optical zoom limit.
✦Built-in light: If a camcorder’s built-in light works as a flash for still
photos, it at least serves a semi-useful purpose. But on-camera lights
often have unfavorable lighting effects on your subjects; I recommend
that you rely on other light sources instead when you’re shooting video.

A
digital camcorder is just one part of the digital video equation. You
also need a computer that is ready to capture, edit, and export digital
video. Modern computers are pretty powerful, but you still have some
important factors to consider if you want a computer that’s well suited for
digital video work. This chapter helps you choose a new computer, upgrade
your current computer, and choose other gear that makes video editing fun
and easy. But first, I start with something simple — trying to resolve the
age-old debate of whether a Mac or Windows PC is better. (And if I succeed
at that, I can work on a way to achieve world peace in the next chapter!)
Resolving the Mac-versus-PC Debate Once and for All
Yeah, right.
Wanna start a ruckus? Wear an “I ♥Bill Gates” t-shirt to a Macworld conven-
tion. Go ahead, I dare you.
Legal disclaimer: Wiley Publishing, Inc., is not responsible for physical or
emotional harm that may result from compliance with the preceding foolish
suggestion.
Like the debate over whether cats or dogs make better pets, the question of
whether to use a Mac or a PC has been disputed tirelessly between the true
believers. (Coincidentally, the same used to be true in the ancient days of
the Atari and Commodore 8-bit computers.) The Mac versus PC struggle
has been a largely unproductive dispute: For the most part, Mac people are
still Mac people, and PC people are still PC people.
But who is right? If you want the best computer for working with digital
video, should you choose a PC or a Mac? Well, look at the following factors:
353

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
✦Ease of use: Macintosh users often boast that their computers are
exceedingly easy to use, and they are right. But if you’re a long-time
Windows user, you may not think so. Some things are easier to do on a
Mac, but other things are easier to do in Windows. Neither system offers
a clear advantage, so if you’re a creature of habit, you’ll probably be
happiest if you stick with what you know.
✦Reliability: The Windows Blue Screen of Death (you know, the dreaded
screen that often appears when a Windows PC crashes) is world famous
and the butt of countless jokes. But the dirty little secret of the Macintosh
world is that until recently, most Macs crashed nearly as often as Windows
PCs. Apple’s new Macintosh operating system, Mac OS X, is built on a
UNIX foundation, so it brings a new level of stability and refinement to the
Macintosh world — but the latest version of Windows (Windows XP)
is almost as dependable. Reliability is important to you because video
pushes your computer’s performance to its limits. Get a Mac with Mac
OS X or a PC with Windows XP, and you should be just fine.
✦Digital video support: I can’t be wishy-washy any longer. If you want a
great computer ready to edit digital video right out of the box, a new
Macintosh is the safer bet. All new Macs come with built-in FireWire
ports, making it easy to hook up your digital camcorder. Macs also
come with iMovie, a pretty good entry-level video-editing program, and
QuickTime, a great “Swiss army knife” that plays and converts all sorts
of digital media formats. Windows comes with Windows Movie Maker,
but it is not as capable as iMovie. Also, most Windows PCs still don’t
come with built-in FireWire. This means that you either have to special-
order it or install a FireWire card yourself.
So there you have it: Macs and PCs are both pretty good (with a slight edge
to the Mac when it comes to hardware). Sure, Macs all come with FireWire,
but if you shop around, you should be able to find a Windows PC with
FireWire for about the same price as a new Mac. Both platforms can make
excellent video-editing machines, so if you’re already dedicated to one or
the other, you should be fine with what you currently use.
Just don’t start any brawls, okay? You never know when a computer nerd
wielding an iPod might take offense.
Upgrading Your Computer
Picture this: Our hero carefully unscrews an access panel on the blinking
device, revealing a rat’s nest of wires and circuits. A drop of sweat runs
down his face as the precious seconds tick away, and he knows that fate
hangs by a slender thread. The hero’s brow creases as he tries to remember
the procedure: “Do I cut the blue wire or the red wire?”
If the thought of opening your computer and performing upgrades fills you
with a similar level of anxiety, you’re not alone. The insides of modern com-
puters can seem pretty mysterious, and you may be understandably nervous
about tearing apart your expensive PC or Mac to perform hardware upgrades.
Indeed, all the chips, circuit boards, and other electronic flotsam inside the

Upgrading Your Computer
computer case are sensitive and easily damaged. You can even hurt your-
self if you’re not careful, so if you don’t have any experience with hardware
upgrades, you are probably better off consulting a professional before
making any changes or repairs to your PC.
If you’re looking for a guiding light in the middle of the PC hardware wilder-
ness, take heart — I can highly recommend the best-selling Building a PC For
Dummies, 4th Edition, written by Mark L. Chambers (published by Wiley).
This great book helps you build a state-of-the-art Windows PC from the
ground up, and it can lead you through the installation of a FireWire card,
DVD recorder, or new hard drive upgrade. (Best of all, no experience is
required . . . after all, the first figure in the book is a picture of a Phillips
screwdriver!)
But if you have done hardware upgrades before, digital video may well
inspire you to make more upgrades now or in the near future. If you decide
to upgrade your computer, follow these basic rules:
✦Review your warranty. Hardware upgrades can invalidate your com-
puter’s warranty, if it still has one.
✦RTM. This is geek-speak for “Read the manual.” The owner’s manual that
came with your computer almost certainly contains important informa-
tion about what can be upgraded and what can’t. The manual may even
have detailed, illustrated instructions for performing common upgrades.
✦Back up your data. Back up your important files on recordable CDs, Zip
disks, or other storage device that’s available to you. You don’t want to
lose work, pictures, or other data that will be difficult or impossible to
replace.
✦Gather license numbers and ISP (Internet service provider) informa-
tion. If you have important things like software licenses stored in saved
e-mails, print them so that you have hard copies. Also, make sure that
you have all the access information for your ISP (account name, pass-
word, dialup numbers, server addresses, and so on) handy in case you
need to reinstall your Internet connection software.
✦Gather all your software CDs. Locate all your original installation discs
for your various programs, including your operating system (Mac OS or
Windows) so that you can reinstall the programs later if necessary.
✦Turn off the power. The computer’s power should be turned off to
avoid damage to components — and yourself.
✦Avoid static electricity buildup. Even if you didn’t just walk across a
shag carpet and pet your cat, your body still probably has some static
electricity built up inside. A tiny shock can instantly destroy the tiny cir-
cuits in expensive computer components. Before touching any compo-
nents, touch your finger to a bare metal spot on your computer’s case
to ground yourself. I also recommend wearing a grounding strap, which
can be purchased at most electronics stores for $2–$3. Now that’s what I
call cheap insurance!
✦Handle with care. Avoid touching chips and circuitry on the various
computer components. Try to handle parts by touching only the edges
or other less-delicate parts.
355

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
✦Protect those old parts. If you are taking out an old component (such as
a 64MB memory module) and replacing it with something better (like a
256MB memory module), the old part may still be worth something to
somebody. If nothing else, if your newly purchased part is defective, at
least you can put the old part back in to get your computer running
again. And if the new part works fine, you may be able to salvage a few
bucks by auctioning the old part on the Internet!
Again, when in doubt, consult with a computer hardware professional. In
fact, you may find that the retailer that sold you the upgraded parts also
offers low-cost or even free installation service.
Using a Macintosh
Apple has put considerable effort into promoting the great multimedia
capabilities of modern Macintosh computers. Indeed, Apple has been at the
forefront of many important developments in digital video, and the video
capabilities of current Macs are impressive. In fact, any new Macintosh will
work quite well with digital video. The following sections show you what to
consider when choosing a new Mac, how to decide whether your current
Mac can handle digital video, and what video-editing software is available
for your Mac.
Buying a new Mac
To work with digital video, your computer needs a powerful processor, lots
of memory, a big hard drive, and a FireWire port. Any new Macintosh meets
these requirements. That said, not all new Macs are created equal. Generally
speaking, the more money you spend, the better the Mac will be, so you
shouldn’t be surprised that some of the more affordable eMacs, iMacs, and
iBooks are merely adequate. If you’re serious about video, I recommend
that your new Mac meet the following minimum requirements:
✦512MB RAM: Video-editing software needs a lot of RAM (random access
memory) to work with, so the more the better. You may be able to get
away with 256MB for a while, but you will find that video editing work is
slow and tedious. Fortunately, the RAM in most Macs can be easily
upgraded. In fact, both desktop and laptop Macs incorporate a handy
little access panel that enables you to upgrade RAM in mere seconds.
✦An 800-MHz G3 processor: A lot of video pros will tell you that you
need a lot more, but you can get away with only an 800-MHz G3 Mac. As
you edit video, you’ll find that you spend a lot of time sitting there, wait-
ing for the computer to work. The faster the processor (and the more
RAM), the less time you will spend waiting. (Of course, a Mac powered
by a G4 or G5 processor can make your wait even shorter.)
✦A 60GB hard drive: I’m going to get e-mails from the video pros; I just
know it! Video files take up lots of drive space. At one time, 60GB was
considered insanely massive for a hard drive, but when you are working
with digital video, you’ll eat up that space in a hurry. Less than 5 minutes
of video eats up an entire gigabyte on your hard drive, which also has to
356

Book II
Chapter 3

Using a Macintosh
hold software files, system files, and all kinds of other information. Lots
of people will tell you that you need at least 100GB of drive space, and
they’re right: 100GB or more would be really nice. But you should be
able to get away with a 60GB hard drive if your budget is tight. If you
can afford a bigger drive, it’s worth the expense.
✦Mac OS X: Any new Mac includes the latest version of Apple’s operating
system software. But if you are buying an older Mac, I strongly recom-
mend that you buy one that already has Mac OS version 10.2 (Jaguar) or
higher. If the computer that you want to buy doesn’t have Mac OS X,
factor the cost of an operating system upgrade (about $130) into the
purchase price.
If you’re considering a portable iBook or PowerBook computer, pay special
attention to the specifications before you buy. Portable computers usually
offer considerably less RAM and hard-drive space than similarly priced
eMacs, iMacs, and PowerMacs.
Upgrading ye olde Mac
If you already have a Mac that is 2 or 3 years old, you should still be able to
use it with digital video if it meets the basic requirements that I describe in
the previous section. If it doesn’t meet those requirements, you may be able
to upgrade it. As a general rule, however, if your Mac doesn’t already have a
G3 or higher processor, upgrading is probably going to be more expensive
or challenging than simply buying a new Mac. And in the end, a very old
upgraded Mac probably will not perform that well anyway.
One of the biggest obstacles that you’ll face involves FireWire. If your Mac
does not already have a FireWire port, you may have difficulty adding one.
PowerMacs can usually be upgraded with a FireWire card, but what if you
have a PowerBook G3? In that case, look for a FireWire card that uses the
PowerBook’s CardBus interface.
Before you think you can get away without FireWire, keep in mind that if
your Mac is too old for FireWire, its USB 1.1 ports won’t be fast enough to
capture full-quality digital video.
Some parts of your Mac may be more easily upgradeable, as I describe in the
following sections. For more details on upgrade information and installation
instructions, check out the very comprehensive Mac OS X Panther All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers, or The iMac For Dummies,
by David Pogue (both published by Wiley). Macworld (www.macworld.com)
also provides online articles and tutorials to help you upgrade your Mac.
And of course, follow all the safe computer upgrade guidelines that I pro-
vide earlier in this chapter.
Improving your Mac’s memory
Digital video editing uses a lot of computer memory, so you should see sig-
nificant performance improvements if you upgrade your RAM. Memory is
usually pretty easy to upgrade in most desktop Macs. In fact, most iMacs
incorporate a handy access panel that enables you to add memory in mere
357

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
seconds. Depending on the age and speed of your Mac, memory comes on
little cards called DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules) or modules called
SDRAM (synchronous dynamic random access memory) modules. Both types
of memory easily snap into place in special memory slots on the computer’s
motherboard. Figure 3-1 illustrates what a DIMM looks like. Read the docu-
mentation from Apple that came with your Mac for specific instructions on
installing more memory.
Make sure that you obtain memory that is specifically designed for your
Mac — specify the model as well as its processor type and speed (for exam-
ple: an 800-MHz G4). Memory modules come in various sizes, so even if all
the memory slots in your Mac appear full, you may be able to upgrade by
replacing your current DIMMs or SDRAM modules with bigger ones.
Portable Macs can also receive memory upgrades, but the task is more
technically challenging. It usually requires that you remove the keyboard
and some other parts of your iBook or PowerBook. I recommend that you
leave such upgrades to a professional unless you really know what you are
doing.
Upgrading Mac hard drives
The hard drive in virtually any Mac can be replaced with a bigger unit. Most
modern Macs have EIDE — or Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics —
hard drives, a standardized hard-drive format that’s ubiquitous in the PC
world. (The latest round of PowerMac G5 models use a new super-speedy
interface called Serial ATA, but I doubt that you’ll be looking to upgrade one
of those whopping 160GB monsters anytime soon.)
Standardization keeps the initial cost of new Macs affordable, and it tends to
make replacement parts cheaper and easier to find. But resist the urge to run
off and buy (for example) that gargantuan 200GB EIDE drive that’s advertised
in a Sunday flier to replace the 4GB drive in your 4-year-old lime-green iMac.
Hold your horses until you consider the following potential problems:
✦The new hard drive may be too big. Older Macs may not support some
of the massive newer hard drives that are available today.
✦The new hard drive may be too hot. Literally. One of the greatest chal-
lenges facing computer hardware engineers today involves heat manage-
ment. Modern processors and hard drives give off a lot of heat, and if too
much heat is allowed to build inside the computer case, the life of your
Mac will be greatly shortened. Many older iMacs were not designed to
manage the heat that’s generated by the newest, fastest hard drives.

DIMMs look

like this.

Book II
Chapter 3
Preparing Your Computer

Using a Macintosh
You should only buy a hard drive that is recommended for your specific
Macintosh model. This means that you should buy a new hard drive from a
knowledgeable Macintosh retailer. As with memory, make sure that you
specify your Mac’s model and processor when purchasing a hard drive.
Adding an external hard drive to your Mac
By far, the easiest way to add storage space to your Mac is to use an exter-
nal hard drive. External drives that connect to a FireWire or USB port are
widely available, and although they tend to be more expensive than internal
drives, their ease of installation and use makes them worthwhile.
Unfortunately, external drives are usually less than ideal for working with
digital video. A FireWire 400 or USB 2.0 (a newer, faster USB standard) exter-
nal drive is slower than an internal drive — and drive speed is crucial when
you are capturing or exporting video. External hard drives are fine if you
need a big place to store music or other files, but I don’t recommend using
an external drive as your main drive for video work.
Choosing Mac video software
Apple offers a pretty good selection of video-editing software for the
Macintosh. It’s a good thing it does, too, because not many other software
vendors offer Mac-compatible editing programs. If you’re a Mac user, your
choices are pretty much limited to the following software:
✦Apple iMovie: It comes free with all new Macintosh computers, and the
latest version of iMovie is included in Apple’s inexpensive iLife suite.
iMovie is featured throughout Book II.
✦Apple Final Cut Pro HD: If you can afford pro-level prices and you want
one of the most cutting edge video-editing programs available, consider
Final Cut Pro HD (about $1000). Final Cut Pro, shown in Figure 3-2, is
used by many professional video editors.
✦Apple Final Cut Express 2: This program offers many of the features of
Final Cut Pro HD for a fraction of the price (about $300). Final Cut
Express 2 is a good choice if you want pro-style editing features but
can’t afford pro-level prices.
✦Avid Xpress DV: Avid has been making professional video-editing work-
stations and gear for years, so it’s no surprise that the company also
offers one of the most advanced video-editing programs as well. And it
better be good too because it retails for $700 (for Windows or the Mac).
As you can see, if you’re a professional video editor, you can choose among
several programs for your Mac. If you’re not a pro, however, your choices
are a little more limited. Fortunately, iMovie is a reasonably capable pro-
gram. You can even expand the capabilities of iMovie with plug-ins from
Apple (and some third parties). Visit www.apple.com/imovie/, and check out
the iMovie Downloads section for more information.

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
Using a Windows PC
Macintosh computers have long been favored by professional graphic and
video artists, but you can do some pretty advanced video editing on a
Windows PC as well. In fact, the greater variety of editing software that’s
available for Windows means that you can now do just about anything on a
PC that you can do on a Mac. The next few sections show you what to con-
sider when choosing and preparing a Windows PC for digital video.
Buying a new PC
Countless PC vendors now offer computers that run Windows for just about
any budget. For about the same amount of money as you would have spent
just to buy a printer 10 years ago, you can now buy a new PC — including
the monitor. And if you shop around, you may even find someone to throw
in the printer for free.
You may find, however, that a bargain-basement computer is not quite good
enough for digital video. The hard drive may be too small, the processor may
not be fast enough, the computer may not have enough memory, or some
other features may not be ideal. Look for the following features when you’re
shopping for a new PC:
✦Windows XP: Some bargain-basement PCs may come with Windows Me
(Millennium Edition). Windows Me had some fundamental problems
with stability and memory management that (in my opinion) make it
unsuitable for digital video work. Windows XP, on the other hand, is
Figure 3-2:

Book II
Chapter 3
Preparing Your Computer

Using a Windows PC
very efficient and stable. Upgrading a Windows Me machine to XP is
often challenging, so I recommend that you buy a PC that already has
XP installed.
✦512MB RAM: Video editing requires a lot of random access memory
(RAM) — the more the better.
As if you didn’t already have enough acronyms to remember, some PCs
have a type of memory called DDR (double data rate) RAM. DDR RAM
works twice as efficiently as regular RAM, so a computer with 256MB
DDR RAM can work about as well as a computer with 512MB of other
types of RAM.
✦64MB video RAM: The video image on your monitor is generated by a
component in your computer called the video card or display adapter.
The video card has its own memory — I recommend at least 64MB of
video memory. Some video cards share system RAM (the computer’s
spec sheet may say something like “integrated” or “shared” in reference
to video RAM). This tends to slow the performance of your computer,
so I recommend that you avoid shared video RAM.
✦A 1-GHz processor: I recommend a processor speed of at least 1 GHz
(that is, 1000 MHz). This shouldn’t be a problem because most new PCs
feature at least a 1-GHz processor. It doesn’t matter if the processor is
an Intel Pentium 4, an AMD Athlon XP, or even an AMD Duron or Intel
Celeron unit. The faster the better — naturally.
✦FireWire: Unlike Macs, the majority of new PCs still don’t come with
FireWire (also called IEEE 1394) ports. You can upgrade most PCs with
a FireWire card, but buying a computer that already has FireWire is a lot
easier.
✦A 60GB hard drive: When it comes to hard drives, bigger is better. If
you plan to do a lot of video-editing work, 60GB is an absolute minimum.
Sure, it sounds like a lot, but you’ll use it up in a hurry as you work with
digital video.
Another option, of course, is to build your own computer. For some, the act
of building a PC from scratch remains a vaunted geek tradition (you know
who you are). If you choose to build your own system, make sure that your
system meets — and preferably exceeds — the guidelines given here. I built
a computer last year that was tailored specifically for video editing — and it
only cost me about $400 plus some spare parts that I scrounged from my
own stocks. But know what you’re doing before you start down this path;
it’s definitely not the path of least resistance.
Again, you can turn to the written word for help in building a cutting-edge
PC from scratch: Pick up a copy of Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition,
written by Mark L. Chambers (published by Wiley). ’Nuff said.
If you’re a Linux devotee, good for you! However, if you plan to do much with
digital video, you’re going to have to bite the proverbial bullet and use either
a Mac or the dreaded Windoze. Currently the mainstream offers no video-
editing programs that are designed for Linux. Although some tools allow you
to run some Windows or Mac programs, system performance often deterio-
rates, meaning that you probably can’t capture and edit video efficiently.
361

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
Upgrading your PC for digital video
If you already have a PC, you can probably do some things to make it better
suited for video work. These tweaks may not be simple, however. The diver-
sity of the PC market means that your computer can probably be upgraded,
but performing hardware upgrades requires experience and expertise
(whether it’s your own or somebody else’s).
When considering an upgrade, your first step is to check your PC’s docu-
mentation for information about what upgrades can be performed. The
manufacturer may offer upgrade kits that are specifically designed for your
computer. The following sections address some specific upgrades that you
may be considering. Of course, be sure to follow the computer-upgrade
guidelines that I provide earlier in this chapter. I also recommend buying a
book that specifically covers PC upgrades, such as Upgrading and Fixing PCs
For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (published by Wiley).
Choosing a new hard drive
Not so long ago, I bought a 1.6GB hard drive for just $200. At the time, I
couldn’t imagine using up all that space, and the price seemed like an
almost unbelievably good deal. But drive sizes have grown and prices have
dropped — fast enough to make a lot of heads spin. Today that $200 can
buy you a 160GB hard drive — a hundred times more space — and that’s if
you don’t shop around for a better deal.
Big, cheap hard drives are a popular PC upgrade these days. They have
become so ubiquitous that even one of my local grocery stores sells hard
drives. Digital video consumes hard drive space almost as fast as my sons
gobble chips and salsa at the local Tex-Mex restaurant, so you may be con-
sidering a hard drive upgrade of your own. If so, consider the following
items before you nab that hard drive along with the broccoli at your local
supermarket:
✦An EIDE interface: Your hard drive connects to the rest of the com-
puter through a special disk interface. Most modern PCs use the EIDE
interface — and such drives are both fast and widely available. Check
your computer’s documentation to make sure that it uses this type of
interface. Most new high-performance PCs use a Serial ATA connection
for hard drives. A few computers use the SCSI (Small Computer System
Interface) format, which is also fast, but SCSI drives are expensive and
increasingly hard to find. If the PC is older and just uses a regular IDE
interface, it probably isn’t fast enough to work with digital video. It may
also not support the large size of modern hard drives.
✦Drive speed: EIDE drives are commonly available in speeds of 5,400 rpm
and 7,200 rpm, while virtually all Serial ATA drives turn at 7,200 rpm or
faster. This speed is always clearly marked on the drive’s packaging. For
digital video work, a 7,200-rpm drive is virtually mandatory.
✦Windows installation: If you’re replacing your old hard drive with a newer,
bigger drive, you must (you guessed it) reinstall Windows. Do you have
a Windows installation CD? You should have received an installation disc
with your PC. If not, figure on spending at least $199 for a new Windows
CD. (You’ll need to buy the full version, not a cheaper upgrade version.)
362

Book II
Chapter 3
Preparing Your Computer
for Video
Using a Windows PC
✦Support for big hard drives: Maybe your computer can’t support the
biggest hard drives that are on the market today (admittedly a remote
possibility). Check the BIOS section of your PC’s documentation to see
whether your computer has any drive-size limitations.
If you decide to upgrade to a bigger hard drive, you can either replace your
current hard drive or (in some cases) simply add a second hard drive to your
computer. If you look inside your computer case, you should see a gray
ribbon cable that runs from the motherboard to the hard drive. In some sys-
tems, that cable has two connectors — one connecting to the hard drive
and the other to the CD-ROM drive. This arrangement is called daisy-chaining,
and you can sometimes get away with daisy-chaining two hard drives. If you
can, that’s cool — you just keep your applications where they are and add
a second great big hard drive to use exclusively as a scratch pad for all your
video work. Again, consult your PC’s documentation (and a book like Building
a PC For Dummies or Upgrading and Fixing PCs For Dummies) to see whether
daisy-chaining is an option.
Finally, as I mention in the section “Adding an external hard drive to your
Mac,” earlier in this chapter, external hard drives (even FireWire 400 drives)
usually aren’t fast enough for video work. I recommend that you stick with
internal drives for the bulk of your video work.
Upgrading to Windows XP
Earlier I recommended that you should run Windows XP if you plan to work
with digital video. Windows XP is vastly more stable than previous versions
of Windows (especially Windows 95, 98, and Me) — and it does a much better
job of managing system memory, which is crucial when you work with video.
If you don’t already have Windows XP, you need to upgrade. If you already
have a version of Windows on your computer, you can purchase an upgrade
to Windows XP Home Edition. If you don’t already have Windows, the full
version of the Windows XP Home Edition will cost about twice as much as
the upgrade, and the full version of Windows XP Pro costs even more.
Windows XP Professional is nice, but so is XP Home. If you don’t need the
extra networking tools that are built into Windows XP Pro, XP Home is just
fine for video work.
You may have heard horror stories from friends who tried to upgrade their old
computers to Windows XP. To be honest, I have a horror story of my own (but
I’ll spare you the gruesome details). For now, I can offer the following advice:
✦Avoid installing Windows XP on any computer that is more than 2 or
3 years old. XP is a snob about modernity, and it may not support some
of your older components and hardware. A quick way to check the hard-
ware in your computer is to use Microsoft’s online Upgrade Advisor. Visit
the following Web site for instructions on how to download and use the
Upgrade Advisor:
www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/howtobuy/upgrading/
advisor.asp
The Advisor inspects your system and advises you whether your com-
puter can accept Windows XP.
363

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
✦Perform a “clean” installation. Although the installation CD provides
an option to upgrade your current version of Windows, this approach
will most likely cause you troubles in the near future. So back up all
your important data before you begin installing, and let the installer pro-
gram reformat and repartition your hard drive using the NTFS (NT File
System) when you are presented with these options. (NTFS hard drives
are both faster and more reliable in case of a lockup or power failure.)
The rest of the installation process is pretty simple. (Oh, yeah, you have
to restore all the data from your backup onto that reformatted hard
drive. You could be at it for a while.)
✦Check for online updates immediately after installation. Microsoft is
constantly developing updates and fixes for Windows XP, and you can
quickly download and install those updates by choosing Start➪All
Programs➪Windows Update. You must connect to the Internet to do so,
so make sure that you have all the necessary information handy to rein-
stall your Internet service’s software.
Installing a FireWire card
If you have a PC and want to work with digital video, you probably need to
install a FireWire (IEEE 1394) card. A FireWire card is crucial to capturing
video from a digital camcorder to your computer.
To install a FireWire card, you need to have an empty PCI slot inside your
computer. PCI slots usually look like the open slot that’s shown in Figure 3-3.
If you have an empty PCI slot, you should be able to install a FireWire card.
Numerous cards are available for less than $100. Many FireWire cards also
come packaged with video-editing software, so consider the value of that
software when you make your buying decision.

Using a Windows PC
When you purchase a FireWire card, read the box to make sure that your
computer meets the system requirements. Follow the installation instruc-
tions that come with the card to install and configure your FireWire card for
use. After the card is installed, Windows automatically detects your digital
camcorder when you connect it to a FireWire port and turn on the cam-
corder’s power. You can then use Windows Movie Maker or other video-
editing software to capture video from the camcorder.
Choosing Windows video software
Perhaps the nicest thing about using a Windows PC is that no matter what
you want to do, lots of software is available to help you. Countless video-
editing programs are available, but video-editing software for Windows
breaks down into the following three major categories:
✦Basic: At the low end of the price-and-feature scale are free programs
(such as Windows Movie Maker) or programs that come free with cheaper
FireWire cards (such as Ulead VideoStudio or Roxio VideoWave). These
programs are usually capable, but limited in advanced features. I recom-
mend moving up to the next level as soon as your budget allows.
✦Intermediate: A growing number of video-editing programs now offer
more-advanced editing features at a price that is not out of the average
consumer’s reach. Pinnacle Studio 9 — featured throughout this book —
is a good example. Studio retails for $99 and offers more-advanced edit-
ing than most basic programs — plus you can expand the capabilities
even more with the Hollywood FX Plus plug-in ($49).
✦Advanced: If you’re willing to spend $400 or more, you can get some of
the same programs that the video pros use. Advanced video-editing pro-
grams include Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid Xpress DV, Pinnacle Edition,
and Sonic Foundry Vegas.
Optimizing Windows for video work
Even if you have a brand-new computer with a wickedly fast processor and
lots of RAM, you may experience problems when you work with digital
video. Perhaps the most common problem is frames being dropped during
capture or export. A dropped frame occurs when your computer can’t keep
up with the capture or export process and loses one or more video frames.
Pinnacle Studio and most other video-editing programs report dropped
frames if they occur. If you encounter dropped frames (or you just want to
help your computer run more efficiently for video work), try the tips in the
following sections to improve performance.
I recommend running Windows XP for digital video work, and the following
sections assume that you are using XP (either the Pro or Home version). If
you’re using an earlier version of Windows (such as Me), you can still follow
along, although some steps may be slightly different.
Updating video drivers
Windows operates the various components in your computer by using soft-
ware tools called drivers. Outdated drivers can cause your computer to run
slowly — or even crash. This is especially true of video display drivers in
365

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
Windows XP. The display adapter (another name for the video card) is the
component that generates the video image for your computer’s monitor.
Hardware vendors frequently provide updates, so check the manufacturers’
Web sites regularly for downloadable updates. If you aren’t sure who made
your display adapter, follow these steps to verify the manufacturer and
model:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
2. In the Windows Control Panel, click the Performance and
Maintenance icon if you see that option, and then double-click the
System icon.
If you do not see a Performance and Maintenance icon, simply double-
click the System icon.

Adjusting power settings and screen savers
Your computer is probably set to power down after a period of inactivity.
Normally this is a good thing because it conserves energy, but it can cause
problems during video capture and some other video-editing actions. To
temporarily disable power-saving options, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
2. In the Windows Control Panel, click the Performance and
Maintenance icon if you see that option, and then double-click the
Power Options icon.
If you do not see a Performance and Maintenance icon, simply double-
click the Power Options icon.
The Power Options Properties dialog box appears.
3. On the Power Schemes tab, set all four pull-down menus (near the
bottom of the dialog box) to Never, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Alternatively, you can just choose the Always On scheme from the
Power Schemes pull-down menu.
4. Click the Save As button, name the power scheme Video in the Save
Scheme dialog box that appears, and then click OK.
5. Click OK again to apply the changes and close the Power Options
Properties dialog box.
To conserve power in the future, you can turn on the power-saving features
by simply choosing a different power scheme in the Power Options
Properties dialog box.
I also recommend that you disable screen savers when you are getting ready
to work with video. To do so, right-click an empty area of the Windows desk-
top and choose Properties from the menu that appears. In the Display
Properties dialog box, click the Screen Saver tab and choose (None) in the
Screen saver menu. Click OK to close the Display Properties dialog box.

Choosing Analog Capture Hardware
The best way to capture video from a digital camcorder is to use a FireWire
port. But if you want to capture analog video — whether from a VCR, Hi8
camcorder, or other analog source — you need some specialized hardware.
You can install a video-capture card in your computer or (possibly) use an
external analog/video converter that connects the analog device to your
computer’s FireWire or USB port.
Read the packaging carefully before you buy video-capture hardware, and
make sure that it is designed to capture analog hardware. Some FireWire
cards are marketed simply as video-capture cards, even though they can
only capture digital video.
When choosing an analog video-capture device, check the packaging to
make sure that your computer meets the system requirements. The device
should also be capable of capturing the following:
✦NTSC (in North America, Japan, and the Philippines) or PAL (in
Australia, South America, Southeast Asia, and most of Europe) video,
whichever matches your local video standard
✦30 frames per second (fps) for NTSC video or 25 fps for PAL video
✦720×534 video frames for NTSC or 768×576 video frames for PAL
✦Stereo audio
Although you don’t have to get a device that can capture and export S-
Video as well as composite video, try to get one if possible. S-Video pro-
vides better image quality than composite video. Composite video uses the
standard RCA-style jacks, which are color-coded yellow for video and
red/white for audio. Figure 3-6 shows an S-Video connector. S-VHS VCRs
have S-Video connectors, as do some higher-quality analog camcorders.
Selecting capture cards
In the section “Installing a FireWire card” (clever title, eh?) earlier in this
chapter, I provide an overview of how to install a FireWire card in a Windows
PC. Analog video-capture cards are usually installed inside your computer
in much the same way. This means that you need to have some expertise
in upgrading computer hardware, and you should follow the computer-
upgrade guidelines that I detail in that section.

Choosing Analog Capture Hardware
Okay, it may seem obvious, but I’ll say it anyway: Make sure that your com-
puter has an available expansion slot of the correct type in which you can
install the card.
Many capture cards have neat little accessories called breakout boxes. The
space that’s available on the back of an expansion card is pretty small and
may not provide enough room for all the needed audio and video ports.
Instead, the ports reside in a breakout box — which can sit conveniently on
your desk. The breakout box connects to the capture card using a special
(included) cable. Figure 3-7 shows the card and breakout box that you get
with Pinnacle Studio AV/DV Deluxe. This product allows both digital and
analog video capture because it not only has two FireWire ports on the card,
but it also has S-Video and composite video ports on a breakout box.
Selecting external video converters
If you don’t feel like ripping into the innards of your computer, you may want
to consider an external analog video converter, such as the Dazzle Hollywood
DV Bridge. These devices usually connect to your computer’s FireWire or USB
(Universal Serial Bus) port. You connect your VCR or analog camcorder to
the converter and connect the converter to your computer, and the analog
video is converted into digital video as it is captured into your computer.
If you buy a USB converter, make sure that both the device and your com-
puter use USB 2.0 (a newer, faster version of USB). The original version of
USB could transfer data only at a rate of 12 Mbps, which is not quite enough
for full-quality video capture. USB 2.0, however, can transfer 480 Mbps, which
is even faster than the original FireWire 400 specification. (Apple has now
introduced the second generation of FireWire, called FireWire 800, which
literally doubles the data transfer rate to 800 Mbps! Unfortunately, FireWire
800 ports are limited to the most expensive Mac models, and they’re not yet
standard equipment on DV camcorders and other DV hardware.)

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
Improving the Human–Machine Interface
A lot of science goes into the ergonomics of computers. Modern keyboards,
monitors, and mice are well designed, and they make using your computer
both pleasant and healthful — but they’re designed for general computer use.
Working with video is a lot easier if you have some specialized gear to improve
the interface between you and your computer. The following sections sug-
gest two special items that you may want to use to make video work easier.
Working with video monitors
Computer monitors and TV screens may look similar, but the two have pro-
found technological differences. The most important difference involves
color. Computer monitors can display more colors than TV screens. Also,
computer screens are noninterlaced; TVs are usually interlaced. (Interlaced
displays draw every other line of the picture on separate passes, whereas a
noninterlaced, or progressive scan, display draws the whole picture at
once.) The important point is that the video that you preview on your com-
puter monitor may look a lot different when it’s viewed on a TV.
To address this problem, many video editors connect a video monitor (that
is, a TV) to their computers so that they can preview how the video looks
on a real TV. Fortunately, you don’t need expensive, specialized hardware to
connect a video monitor to your computer. All you need is an old color TV
and one of the following devices that connect to your computer:
✦An analog-capture device: If you have an analog-capture card or video
converter, you may be able to connect a monitor to the video output
connectors. Check the capture device’s documentation for instructions
on connecting a video monitor.
✦A digital camcorder: Connect a TV to the analog outputs on your digital
camcorder, and connect the camcorder to your FireWire port. You can
even use the camcorder itself as a monitor — but keep in mind that the
LCD on your camcorder is probably noninterlaced, so you won’t be seeing
a “real” TV picture. (Is “real TV” an oxymoron? Who knows? Just make
sure that your movie looks right on an interlaced screen.)
370
What is a video-editing appliance, and do I need one?
Several companies market versions of an expen-
sive gadget called an editing appliance — basically
a computer that’s designed to do nothing but
edit video. It has a hard drive, capture ports, and
built-in editing software. Editing appliances are
usually quite powerful — and so is the price. The
Casablanca Prestige from Macro System (www.
casablanca.tv) carries a hefty price of over
$3,000 (monitor not included).
Unless you are a professional video editor working
in a broadcast environment (in which case you
probably aren’t reading this book), you don’t need
an editing appliance. A regular computer (PC or
Mac) provides you with a lot more value for your
money because not only can you do some pretty
advanced video editing on your computer, but you
can also send e-mails, type memos for work, and
shop at eBay. And when your computer is obsolete
in a few years, a local school or youth organization
will be happy to take it as a donation. An obsolete
editing appliance, on the other hand, won’t even
make a good boat anchor 5 years from now.

Book II
Chapter 3
Preparing Your Computer
for Video
Improving the Human–Machine Interface
Some video-editing programs allow you to play video directly to an external
monitor. In Pinnacle Studio, you must first export the movie as if you were
going to export it to tape. After you have exported a file, simply connect
your monitor and click the Play button in Studio’s preview window.
If you have titles or other graphics in your movie that incorporate very thin
lines, interlacing could cause the graphics or letters to flicker when they’re
viewed on a TV. Pay special attention to anything with very thin lines when
you preview your movie on a video monitor.
Using a multimedia controller
A lot of video editing involves finding exactly the right spot to make a cut or
insert a clip. The ability to easily move back and forth through video pre-
cisely, frame-by-frame, is crucial, but it’s also not terribly easy when you are
using the keyboard and mouse. For years, professional video-editing work-
stations have used knobs and dials to give editors more intuitive, precise
control — and now you can get that same level of control on your com-
puter. A multimedia controller, such as the SpaceShuttle A/V from Contour
Design (www.contouravs.com), connects to your computer’s USB port and
makes manipulating video a lot easier. The SpaceShuttle A/V is shown in
Figure 3-8.

I have used the ShuttlePRO (another controller from Contour Design) exten-
sively with Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple iMovie, Final Cut Pro HD, and
Pinnacle Studio, and it truly makes common editing tasks a breeze. I don’t
have to spend time trying to remember which keyboard key starts playback
or moves to the next frame. Instead, I just use the simple, intuitive controls
on the multimedia controller to swiftly and effortlessly control my editing
program.

on’t spread this around, but I once heard a good friend of mine — who
is also a professional photographer — admit, “It’s not just the camera;
it’s all the stuff that hangs off of it as well.” (Old rock stars probably say the
same things about their guitars.) Welcome to the world of . . . (dramatic
pause) . . . accessories.
Now, of course your camcorder is the most important piece of equipment in
your video toolkit, but it’s not the only one . . . at least, it had better not be
the only one if you want a steady panning shot, if your subject isn’t well lit,
or if you have to capture someone’s dialog in the middle of an exceptionally
noisy environment. It’s in situations like these that you find out why the
best video artists carry around enough stuff to warrant a station wagon or
an SUV — like the Boy Scouts, they are just prepared.
In this chapter, I prepare you with details on the basic accessories that
every camera operator needs, and I even throw in a checklist at the end
that can help you stay organized during your first video shoot!
Accessorizing Your Camcorder
Few pieces of digital video gear are as underappreciated as camcorder
accessories. Beyond the obvious things like a camcorder bag and spare
tapes, you should have the following extras when you shoot video:
✦Extra batteries: Your new camcorder should come with at least one bat-
tery, and I recommend buying at least one extra. For more about batter-
ies, read the next section, “Managing Your Camcorder’s Battery.”
✦Lens cleaner: Your camcorder’s lens will inevitably need to be cleaned.
Purchase a cleaning kit that’s specifically recommended by your cam-
corder’s manufacturer. This is important because the lens on your cam-
corder may have a special coating that can be damaged by the wrong
kind of cleaner. Avoid touching the camcorder lens with anything (as
much as humanly possible). I like to use canned air (available at com-
puter supply stores) to blow dust or sand off the lens.
373

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
✦Lens hood: Some high-end camcorders have hoods that extend out in
front of the lens. A hood shades the lens surface to prevent light flares
or other problems that occur when the sun or some other bright light
source reflects directly on the lens. If your camcorder didn’t come with
a hood and your manufacturer doesn’t offer one as an accessory, you
can make a hood using black photographic paper tape (available at pho-
tographic supply stores). Make sure to check the camcorder’s viewfinder,
however, to ensure that your homemade hood doesn’t show up in the
video image!
✦Lens filters: Filters fit onto the front of your lens and serve a variety of
purposes. Some filters correct or modify the light that comes into the
lens. Polarizing filters reduce reflections on glass or water that appear in
a video shot. A neutral-density filter improves color in bright sunlight. A
clear or UV (ultraviolet) filter is often used simply to protect the camera’s
lens from getting dirty or scratched. Filters usually screw into a threaded
fitting that’s just in front of the lens, and you can purchase filters from
consumer electronics or photographic supply stores. If your camcorder
doesn’t accept a standard filter size (such as 37mm or 58mm), you prob-
ably have to order filters that are specially designed for your camcorder
by its manufacturer.
Some high-end cameras have built-in neutral-density filters that you can
turn on and off or adjust. This is a handy feature, but I still recommend
that you always install at least a UV filter in front of your camcorder’s
lens to protect it from damage. A $15 UV filter is a lot easier and cheaper
to replace than the glass lens in your camcorder. Tiffen (www.tiffen.com)
sells a variety of camcorder filters; its Web site includes some excellent
photographs that illustrate the effects of various lens filters on your
video image.
Managing Your Camcorder’s Battery
Rechargeable camcorder batteries can cost $40 or more, so knowing how to
prolong the life of your battery and the perils of not caring for your battery
properly saves you money as well as heartache from missed shots. First,
you need the right battery for your camcorder. This is no big deal when you
purchase your camcorder because a battery and charger are normally
included in the purchase. The more you use your camcorder, though, the
more you’ll notice that your battery doesn’t seem to stay charged as long as
you would like or that it takes too long to recharge.
Now you have entered into the never-never land of camcorder rechargeable
battery dilemmas. You ask yourself (because you don’t know who else to
ask) the following questions:
✦Is it okay to partially charge a battery before taking it off the charger
and putting it back in the camcorder?
Yes — providing you own a newer camcorder, such as a digital cam-
corder. Newer camcorder manufacturers typically provide lithium ion
batteries. These batteries can be partially recharged before reuse. Other
batteries — especially nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries — can be dam-
aged by only partially charging them.
374

Chapter 4

Managing Your Camcorder’s Battery
✦Is it okay to recharge a battery when some charge remains?
If it’s a lithium ion battery, yes. If it’s a NiCad battery, no.
✦How do you know when to purchase a new camcorder battery?
Battery manufacturers generally consider a rechargeable battery to
have reached its useful life when it can provide only about half of its
original consumption. For instance, if your battery could originally pro-
vide an hour’s worth of power, you should replace it when it can pro-
vide only a half-hour’s worth.
You can save yourself a lot of trouble by purchasing an extra battery or two
when you buy your camcorder. That way, you always have a backup in case
the primary battery runs out of power. When purchasing batteries for your
camcorder, consider the following:
✦Camcorder batteries have different specifications on how long they
last. How much recording time relates to how much battery power?
Most professional camcorder operators tell you that the camcorder bat-
tery should be rated to operate for a period of time that’s twice that of
the tape. Don’t assume that the battery that’s provided with your cam-
corder is the best battery for your circumstances. A manufacturer usu-
ally provides you with a battery that’s good for about an hour of camera
usage. Because digital camcorder and Digital8 tape is usually 60 minutes
long, you may think you have the correct battery, but chances are you
don’t. Most people run their camcorders in the nonrecord mode as much
as they do in the record mode because you can’t look through the view-
finder of a camcorder unless it’s turned on. So, if you’re using a 1-hour
tape, you would be wise to use a 2-hour battery. Besides, a 2-hour battery
is good for 2 hours only when it’s new. Within a year or so, your 2-hour
battery will have become a 1-hour battery due to normal aging factors.
This inevitable aging is accelerated if you don’t take proper care of your
battery. 
✦When buying a new battery, what type should I consider?
Always buy batteries that are made for your charger. And, obviously,
always buy batteries that are rated for your camcorder. By rated, I mean
that your camcorder has a certain power supply; for example, the Canon
GL1 is rated as 7.2 volts DC.
Caring for your camcorder battery doesn’t mean that you must have an
emotional attachment. But you do need to discipline yourself to certain
practices, or you’ll waste money and lose valuable shooting opportunities
because you’ll be tending to sick batteries. Follow these basic guidelines,
and your batteries should serve you well:
✦Never expose your batteries to elevated temperatures. The numero
uno enemy of batteries is heat. Anton/Bauer claims that heat can accel-
erate your battery’s aging process by as much as 80 percent! Heat can
also cause a lithium ion battery to lose its ability to hold a charge.
✦For long-term storage between uses (as in weeks), keep your batteries
in the refrigerator. But before you nestle the batteries between the
375

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
lettuce and rutabagas, put them (the batteries, that is) in a plastic bag
to avoid the rare possibility of the battery seeping and causing food
contamination.
✦Don’t put a cold battery on a battery charger! If you take a battery out
of cold storage or out of a cold environment (such as your car in
winter), always allow your battery to reach room temperature before
charging. Batteries have been known to explode if placed on a charger
while cold. Charging creates heat.
✦Don’t allow your batteries to jostle around while you’re carrying
them. Jostling directly affects your battery’s life and performance. Also,
never use a battery that has been physically damaged. The coating on
the battery is supposed to keep the battery acid from seeping out. If the
battery is damaged, these chemicals (which can be unstable and dan-
gerous) can leak and cause damage to anything they touch.
Sounding Out Audio Equipment
All digital camcorders have built-in microphones, and most of them record
audio adequately. You will probably notice, however, that the quality of the
audio that’s recorded with your camcorder’s mic never exceeds “adequate.”
(And take it from me, brothers and sisters, the built-in audio that’s provided
by some camcorders really stretches the definition of the word.)
Most professional videographers emphasize the importance of good audio.
They note that while audiences can tolerate some flaws in the video presen-
tation, poor audio quality immediately turns off your viewers. To record
better audio, you have the following options (which I further discuss
throughout this section):
✦Use a high-quality accessory microphone. Accessory microphones are
usually available from the manufacturer. These accessory units make
use of connections, accessory shoes, and other features of your cam-
corder. A good place to look for high-quality microphones is at a musi-
cian’s supply store. Just make sure that the connectors and frequency
range are compatible with your camcorder or other recording device
(check the camcorder’s documentation). Finally, the Internet is always a
good resource as well. One good resource is www.shure.com, the Web
site of Shure Incorporated. Shure sells microphones and other audio
products, and its Web site is an excellent resource for general informa-
tion about choosing and using microphones.
✦Record audio using a separate recorder. Separate sound recorders
give you more flexibility, especially if you just want to record audio (but
not video) in a certain location.
Choosing a microphone
One of the crazy inconsistencies of video creation is that a lens is useful
only if it remains connected to its camera body, but a microphone is often
more useful when it is not connected to a camera body. Sitting on top of a
camcorder, a microphone is susceptible to machine noises and inadvertent
sounds that are made by the camera operator and crew. Also, especially
376

Book II
Chapter 4

indoors, a camera-mounted microphone tends to be subject to reflective
sounds. So you probably don’t want to rely on your camcorder’s built-in mic.
Omnidirectional, unidirectional, and shotgun microphones
Keep the following classifications of microphones in mind for your video-
graphy needs:
✦Omnidirectional — a microphone for all directions: Omnidirectional
microphones pick up sound from all directions. These microphones are
typically used when you are confident that all the sound sources within
an immediate proximity to the microphone are desirable. Your cam-
corder’s factory-supplied microphone is probably omnidirectional.
Omnidirectional microphones can cost as little as $29 or can cost hun-
dreds of dollars.
✦Unidirectional — a one-person-at-a-time microphone: Just the opposite
of the omnidirectional type, a unidirectional microphone collects sound
only from the area that’s directly in front of it. Unidirectional microphones
are especially helpful where you have more than one person wearing a
microphone and you need to independently control the volume of each
person. They are also useful in situations where you need to isolate one
sound from a bunch of unwanted sounds. Unidirectional microphones
also can cost as little as $29 or can cost hundreds of dollars.
✦Shotgun — a long-range microphone: The term shotgun microphone
may imply that it is a roaming and haphazard microphone. A shotgun
microphone is just the opposite. You use it for pinpoint isolation of
sound. Typically, you use shotgun microphones when you cannot place
a microphone directly in front of a person on-camera. A crew member
stands off-camera and directs the shotgun microphone at the person
who is speaking. The shotgun microphone picks up sound only from
where it is aimed. Basic shotgun microphones start at around $39 but
can cost $1,000 or more.
In Figure 4-1, note that the room causes a multiplication of audio sources,
that is, the camcorder’s audio recorder is faithfully recording what it is
receiving from the microphone. However, the omnidirectional camcorder
microphone shown in Figure 4-1 is receiving the sum of all the sounds in the
immediate environment — not just the speaker’s voice. One way to put your
microphone on a “sound diet” is by modifying or controlling the sound envi-
ronment around the microphone.
Lavalier and handheld microphones
When you’re recording weddings, training, or any other kind of video where
the quality of the audio reproduction is important, I suggest that you invest
in a decent lavalier microphone. A lavalier microphone is a small micro-
phone that can be clipped to a necktie or blouse (see Figure 4-2). Hiding a
lavalier microphone is easier than hiding a handheld microphone, but the
handheld variety is more versatile. Although lavaliers are usually omnidi-
rectional, you can buy unidirectional ones, which are typically used for
recording musical instruments.
377

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
You may also want a handheld microphone. Handheld microphones aren’t
always handheld (they’re often on microphone stands), but that’s not really
important. Like lavaliers, most handheld microphones are omnidirectional.
Wired and wireless microphones
Based on your budget and your recording needs, you can use a wireless
microphone, transmitter, and receiver or a hard-wired microphone, which is
a microphone that’s connected to a long cable. Hard-wired systems are . . .

Sounding Out Audio Equipment
well, you know, hard-wired. You have a microphone, and the microphone is
connected to the recorder by a long audio cable — in some instances, a
very long cable. A decent wireless microphone system typically costs
$400–$500. You can find wireless microphone systems that cost less than
this, but you’ll have difficulty finding a system with a receiver small enough
to fit on a digital camcorder for less than $400.
When you’re buying a camcorder, double-check that it has a connector for
an external microphone. And while you’re at it, make sure that a headphone
jack is included, too. Most digital camcorders have external headphone and
microphone jacks, but these are good things to confirm nonetheless. The
headphone jack is good for listening to sound levels. I further describe this
helpful tip in the next section.
Hard-wired systems are inexpensive and dependable. Just plug one end of
the cord into the microphone and the other into the recording device. Like
wireless systems, wired systems also have limitations. Following are some
limitations:
✦Dragging the cord around on the floor causes it to accumulate dirt,
which could result in equipment damage or signal distortion.
✦Hiding the wiring when recording can be problematic.
✦You may pick up a low hum if you inadvertently run audio wiring in a
parallel path with electrical wiring.
Wireless systems combat some of the wired system’s problems but have
limitations of their own, as follows:
✦They have a never-ending demand for fresh batteries.
✦The transmitter is hard to hide on clothing.
✦Radio interference is occasionally possible.
Whenever I have a choice, I use a wired system rather than a wireless one.
Experience has proven, though, that Murphy’s Law requires having both
options (and spare batteries) handy.
Selecting an audio recorder
Many professionals use DAT (digital audio tape) recorders to record audio,
but DAT recorders typically cost hundreds or (more likely) thousands of
dollars. Digital voice recorders are also available, but the amount of audio
that they can record is often limited by the storage that is built in to the
unit. For a good balance of quality and affordability, some of the newer mini-
disc recorders are good choices.
If you record audio with a separate recorder, one problem that you’ll have
later is precisely synchronizing the audio recording with the video image
that you recorded. Professional video and filmmakers solve this problem
using slates. A slate (also called a take board) is that black-and-white board
thingie with all the chalk writing on it that someone snaps closed just
before the director yells, “Action!”
379

Part I: Getting Ready for Video
The slate isn’t just a kitschy Hollywood gimmick. When the slate is snapped
closed in front of the camera, it makes a loud snapping noise that’s picked
up by all audio recorders on the set. That sound and the video image of the
slate can be used later to precisely synchronize the separate audio and
video recordings. If you plan to record audio with a separate audio recorder,
I recommend that you construct and use a simple slate of your own. You
can make it using two boards and a hinge purchased at any hardware store.
(Just watch your fingers, okay?)
Shedding Some Light on the Scene
Most digital camcorders provide automatic aperture control (often called
exposure control). The aperture is the part of the camera that controls how
much light is let in through the lens. It expands and contracts depending on
light conditions, much like the iris in the human eye. But all the automatic
controls in the world can’t make up for a poorly lit scene. Basically, you
need the following key bits of gear to better light your scene:
✦Lights: Right about now, you’re probably thinking, “No kidding.” You can
buy professional lights if you want, but you don’t need to spend hun-
dreds of dollars to get good lights. Fluorescent shop lights are afford-
able and provide good-quality light, as are halogen work lights, which
are available at many hardware stores.
✦Backdrop material: For some shots, you may want to have a backdrop
behind your subject. You can make a backdrop frame out of pipe or
cheap 1×3 pine boards (also known as furring strips) from your local
lumber yard and then tie, clamp, or staple the backdrop material to the
frame. A backdrop of blue vinyl tablecloth material can even be used to
create a “blue screen” special effect.
✦Clamps: While you’re at the hardware store buying lights and backdrop
stuff, pick up some cheap spring clamps. Clamps can be used for hold-
ing backdrops together, holding lights in position, or playfully clipping
unsuspecting crew members as they walk past.
✦Extension cords: You need to plug in all your fancy lights somehow.
✦Duct tape: If you can’t do it with duct tape, it probably can’t be done! I
like to use duct tape to secure extension cords to the ground so that
they aren’t a trip hazard.
✦Translucent plastic sheets and cheesecloth: Get these at your local art
supply store to help diffuse and soften intense lights.
✦Reflective surfaces: Use poster board, aluminum foil, or even plastic
garbage bags to bounce light onto your subjects. Crumple foil to pro-
vide a more diffuse reflection, and tape the foil or plastic bags to boards
so that they’re easier to handle.
Lights get hot, so use care when handling them after they’ve been in use for
a while. Also, if you use plastic, cheesecloth, or other materials to diffuse
light, position those materials so they aren’t too close to hot lights.

Stabilizing Your Video Image
Although modern camcorders are small and easy to carry around, you’ll
probably find that most of your shots benefit from a tripod or other method
of stabilization. Even the cheap $20 tripod that you got for free with your
camcorder purchase is better than nothing for stationary shots. If you’re
looking for a higher-quality tripod, the following features can make it worth
the extra cash:
✦Strong legs and bracing: Dual-stanchion legs and strong bracing greatly
improve the stability of the camera.
✦Lightweight: The best tripod in the world doesn’t do you any good if it’s
so heavy that you never take it with you. Better tripods use high-tech
materials like aircraft aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber to provide
lightness without sacrificing strength.
✦Bubble levels: Some tripods have bubble levels (like those carpenters
use) to help ensure that the camera is level. Few things are more disori-
enting in a video shot than an image that is slightly skewed from level.
✦Counterweights: Adjustable counterweights help you keep the tripod
head and camera balanced even if you’re using a heavy telephoto lens
or other camcorder accessory.
✦Fluid heads: This is probably the most important feature of a high-quality
tripod. A fluid head enables you to pan the camera smoothly, eliminating
the jerky panning motion that’s associated with cheaper tripods.
Video-Shoot Checklist For Dummies
A well-organized video shoot almost always results in better-quality video.
But because you have so many things to remember, it’s easy to forget a few
things. Before I leave you to your creative banquet, I provide you with a
couple of checklists to help you remember what you need to bring when
you’re preparing for a video shoot.
Basic checklist
The following basic checklist includes important items that you need on vir-
tually any shoot, no matter how informal:
Camcorder
Lens cleaner
Lens filters
Spare blank tapes
Tripod
Your camcorder’s owner’s manual
Duct tape
Extra charged batteries
Scene list
Camcorder accessories (remote 
control, telephoto lens, and so on)

CHECK IT OUT
Transforming Your Living Room into a Studio
If you can temporarily prevent outdoor lighting
from entering your living room (or any other
large room in your house), you have the makings
for a studio. You need to have the following
essentials:
Studio light: Studio lights, such as the Omni Lights
that I am proud to own, are a valuable investment.
However, regular incandescent lights do very well,
too. The important issue is that your lights need
to be portable and powerful. Just remember the
following basics:

Lights get very hot. After they’ve been on
a while, use gloves to handle them. Of
course, keep the lights away from flamma-
ble objects.

You’re likely to need some commercial-
quality extension cords so that you can
move the lights wherever you want and
distribute the power load to more than one
circuit in the house. Home-quality exten-
sion cords can overheat and pose a seri-
ous electrical shock and fire hazard.
Backdrop: A nondescript backdrop is essential
for studio shots. Here’s what I suggest (and, in
fact, am using as I write this book — in my living
room): Buy some muslin at a fabric store. Paint it
a dull, neutral color such as blue-gray. Make a
backdrop frame (one that you can easily assem-
ble and break down for carrying in your car). My
frame is 8 feet wide by 7 feet high. I simply pur-
chased 3⁄4-inch galvanized pipe at the local hard-
ware store to make the frame.
To construct a backdrop frame, go to your favorite
hardware store and buy the following items:

Four sections of threaded galvanized pipe,
each 4 feet long by 3⁄4 inch in diameter.

Two sections of threaded galvanized pipe,
each 3 feet long by 3⁄4 inch in diameter.

Three 3⁄4-inch couples (for putting the 7-feet
lengths and the 8-feet lengths together).

Two 90-degree elbows (for connecting the
sides with the top).

Two T-shaped connectors (for connecting
to the bottom of the 7-feet sides).

Four 1-foot by 3⁄4-inch threaded galvanized
nipples (for making the backdrop feet).

Four 3⁄4-inch female caps (for making the
ends of the feet).

Spring clamps (six will probably do) for
clamping your backdrop to the frame.
These clamps are invaluable in video cre-
ation for a multitude of ingenious purposes.
Foamcore: At your local craft or office supply
store, buy some 2 feet × 4 feet white foamcore
board (1⁄4-inch or 3⁄8-inch thick). This board is great
for bouncing light as a soft light. You can also cut
out shapes and slots and place them in front of a
light to create fascinating background patterns.
Finally, you can use the foamcore in front of a
light to flag, a procedure in which you block light
to keep it from hitting or spilling into areas of the
shot where the light isn’t wanted.

O
ne of the great things about digital video is how easy it is to edit. But 
all the editing in the world doesn’t do you any good if you don’t have
decent source material from which to work. Shooting video is definitely an
art form, but that doesn’t mean that you need to be naturally gifted or have
years of media schooling to produce great movies. All you really need is
some patience, a few helpful tips, and maybe a little creativity. Oh yeah, and
tapes — lots of blank videotapes. Not even the pros shoot perfect video
every single time!
This chapter helps you shoot and record better audio and video. I show
you how to plan a video project, and how to shoot video and record audio
effectively.
Planning a Video Production
Camcorders are so simple to use these days that they encourage seat-of-
the-pants videography, which isn’t always the best idea. Just grabbing your
camcorder and hastily shooting may be fine if you’re shooting the UFO that
happens to be flying overhead, but for most other situations, some careful
planning can improve your movie.
The first thing you’re probably going to do in any video project is to shoot
some video. Even if you are shooting a simple school play or family gather-
ing, you can and should plan many aspects of the shoot, as follows:
✦Make a checklist of shots that you need for your project. While you’re
at it, make an equipment checklist, too.
✦Survey the shooting location. Make sure that passersby can’t trip over
your cables or bump the camera. (It makes you unpopular, and can ruin
your footage to boot.)
383

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
✦Talk to property owners or other responsible parties. Identify potential
disruptions, and make sure that you have permission to shoot. For exam-
ple, your kids’ school probably doesn’t mind if you shoot video of Suzie’s
band concert, but commercial concerts or sporting events usually have
rules against recording performances.
✦Plan the time of the shoot. This is especially important if you are shoot-
ing outside. What part of the sky will sunlight be coming from? Do you
want to take advantage of the special light that’s available at sunrise or
sunset?
✦Bring more blank tapes and charged batteries than you think you’ll
need. You never can tell what may go wrong, and preparing for the
worst is always a good idea. When it comes to blank tapes and spare
(charged) batteries, too many is always better than not quite enough.
If you want to shoot high-quality video, you’ll be glad to know that staging
an elaborate video production with dozens of staff members, acres of
expensive equipment, and lots of caterers is not necessary. But you can do
some simple things to improve any shooting situation — whether you are
casually recording a family gathering or producing your own low-budget 
sci-fi movie. The following sections help you shoot better video, regardless
of the situation.
Composing a Shot
Like a photograph, a great video image must be thoughtfully composed.
Start by evaluating the type of shot that you plan to take. Does the shot
include people, landscapes, or some other subject? Consider what kind of
tone or feel you want to achieve. Figure 5-1 illustrates how different compo-
sitions of the same shot can affect its overall tone. In the first shot, the
camera looks down on the subject. Children are shot like this much too
often. This approach makes them look smaller and inferior. The second shot
is level with the subject and portrays him more favorably. The third shot
looks up at the subject and makes him seem important and dominant —
almost larger than life.
Being off-center
One of the most basic rules of video composition is to put your subject
matter just slightly off-center in the viewfinder. Center, after all, is where your
news anchor, president, or terrorist goes when he or she has something
Figure 5-1:
Composition

how your
subject is
perceived.
384

Book II
Chapter 5
Shooting Great
Digital Video
Composing a Shot
important to say directly to the camera. When your subject isn’t speaking
directly to the camera, it makes more sense to the audience if he or she
(or it) is about one-third of the way from the edge of the screen.
Which third? If the subject is a person, the rule is to have that person look-
ing into the center of the screen, not toward the edge of the screen. In other
words, if the subject is looking to the right, he or she should be on the left
side of the frame; if the subject is looking left, he or she should be on the
right side of the frame. That way, it seems that they are always looking
toward the center instead of off-camera. Note that if you need your subject
to be looking off-camera, it makes sense for them to look toward the edge
instead of toward the center.
If your subject isn’t a close-up of a person, you should still remember that
the audience thinks of itself as being in the center, so action should take
place across the center. This means that action should go from the left of
the frame to the right of the frame, or vice versa, to involve the audience.
This doesn’t mean that the subject can’t be walking toward or away from
you; it simply means that you should place the camera so that the person
walks across the center of the frame, if possible. (For instance, the person
starts far away on the left side of the frame and, as he or she approaches,
moves across the center of the frame toward the right side.)
Of course, rules are made to be broken. Occasionally, you see a shot in
which all the action occurs only on one side of the frame. This is usually an
artistic choice (it occurs a lot in music videos), where the videographer
doesn’t use the entire frame for the shot. If you see this while channel surf-
ing, note that it’s a stylized approach that may be jarring in nonfiction or
corporate video but can be fun to use for other types of productions.
Avoiding amputations
When you’re shooting a person, avoid cutting off the top of the head and
don’t frame a person so that he or she is cut off at the neck, waist, knees, or
ankles. All of these shots look disconcerting, as if the person doesn’t have a
body, legs, calves, or feet, respectively. Instead, shoot just below the neck
(so that we see a little shirt collar), waist (so that we see the top of her jeans),
and so on, so we know that the person continues from the end of the frame.
Also, in an extreme close-up, cutting off the top of someone’s head is accept-
able but cutting off the chin is not. Seeing someone’s mouth open and close
without seeing the chin move is odd and looks like an uncomfortable B-movie
horror shot in which a disembodied lump of flesh is talking on its own.
Watching your background
Shooting with the sun or another light source directly behind the subject
can cause problems, as can any oddly shaped, colorful, or busy back-
ground. Also, make sure that you aren’t accidentally composing the shot
against a distracting background object, such as shooting so that it appears
that a tree is coming out of your subject’s head.
385

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
One frequent recommendation is that you shoot with the sun over your
shoulder and behind you, with it shining on your subject. This is good
advice, unless your subject is squinting into the sun or otherwise made
uncomfortable. In that case, a little shade for the subject may be in order, or
you can try a slightly different angle with the sun off to one side of both you
and the subject. Just try to avoid heavy shadows on the subject’s face.
Also note that for most computer-based video playback (CD-ROM, desktop,
and Web-based video), the more complex the background, the worse the
final video clip will look and the less it will compress. When a QuickTime
movie is compressed into a final movie file, duplicate material in the back-
ground on each frame is discarded to make the file more compact. If you
have a lot of movement in the background (such as waving tourists or cars
in traffic), all that movement must be rendered in the final QuickTime file.
The result is a movie that’s hard to watch and takes up a lot of room on
your hard drive or CD-ROM. The solution is to put your subjects against a
simpler background that doesn’t move on its own. 
Considering your angles
When composing shots, another important consideration is the angle that
you use between the camera lens and your subject. The following are a few
considerations:
✦Shooting up from low angles: If you shoot your subject from below, it
makes the subject appear bigger and more imposing. In Citizen Kane,
director Orson Welles had sections of his sound stage floor removed so
that he could get dramatic camera shots from far below the Kane char-
acter, making him appear larger than life. (Orson Welles later took a dif-
ferent, more culinary approach to making himself look larger than life.)
✦Shooting down from high angles: Stand on a chair or a ladder or use a
camera crane, and shoot down at your subject or actor and you make
him or her appear small and meek. (If you also end up showing his bald
spot, you better check his contract to make sure that’s allowed.) High
angles are good to suggest adults looking at kids; low angles are good
for suggesting kids looking at adults.
✦Shooting at crazy angles: Tilting, or dutching, the camera at an angle to
the ground (the MTV or Monday Night Football interview effect) can give
a suggestion of hipness, coolness, or mystery to a shot — if used very
sparingly. Crazy angles can also be used to suggest sloping ground or
the “ship is sinking” effect, or to show the crazed psycho chasing down
the innocent victim in a slasher film. Again, use crazy angles as a confec-
tion, not the main course.
Two other rules govern angles. Professionals call the first one the 180-degree
rule, which suggests that you shouldn’t change the “right and left” of a scene
between cuts. You should try to avoid crossing the line of action: If you start
on one side of the action, stay on that side of the action. Otherwise, the
audience becomes confused — it’s like constantly switching sidelines while
watching your kid’s soccer game. (The only time this works is in a Rocky-
esque 360-degree shot, where the camera rolls all the way around the action
to establish tension.)
386

Book II
Chapter 5
Shooting Great
Digital Video
Evaluating Lighting
The other rule is the 30-degree rule, which means that you should change
the angle of the camera (relative to your subject) at least 30 degrees if
you’re cutting between two angles without a transition. Of course, you don’t
need to use your protractor and vast knowledge of trigonometry to figure out
what equals 30 degrees; the idea is simply to make sure that you’re changing
the angle of the camera between two shots that are to be edited together. If
you cut between two clips that don’t have a dramatic enough difference in
angles, it just looks like you bumped the camera or made a mistake in editing.
Evaluating Lighting
For the purposes of shooting video, light can be subdivided into two cate-
gories: good light and bad light. Good light allows you to see your subject,
and it flatters your subject by exposing details that you want to show. Good
light doesn’t completely eliminate shadows, but the shadows don’t dominate
large portions of the subject either. Bad light, on the other hand, washes out
color and creates lens flares (the reflections and bright spots that show up
when the sun shines across the lens) and other undesired effects. Consider
Figure 5-2. The right side of the subject’s face is a featureless white glow
because it’s washed out by intense sunlight. Meanwhile, the left side of the
face is obscured in shadow — not good.
Your camera probably has settings to accommodate many special lighting
situations. Always read the camcorder’s documentation to see what fea-
tures may be available to you — and practice using those features to see
which ones work well and which ones don’t.
Setting white balance
White-balancing is the process of telling the camera what color to use
as a reference for pure white. Set white balance anytime you change the
Figure 5-2:

happens
when you
don’t pay
attention
to light.
387

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
lighting in which the camera is operating; the process gives the camera a
color reference for the current lighting.
Camcorders can do an adequate job of white-balancing automatically, but
automatic white-balancing is best in situations where the lighting will
change — when you’re moving from inside to outside, for instance. If you
have the camera fixed in one spot for filming (such as for an interview in
the subject’s office), you should set up your lights for the shot and then
manually white-balance the camera.
To white-balance manually, hold up a white card or piece of paper and then
zoom the camera in so that the white object fills the frame. Then set the
manual white-balance control on the camera. Zoom back out, and your
camera is balanced to a pure white under the current lighting conditions,
meaning that you’ll get good color for filming.
Choosing lights
How do you light your shots effectively? Remain ever aware of both the good
light and the bad. If you don’t have control over lighting in a location, try to
compose the shot to best take advantage of the lighting that is available.
Professional photographers and videographers typically use several differ-
ent lights of varying type and intensity. Multiple light sources provide more
control over shadows and image detail, and different kinds of lights have
different effects. You can use the following types of lights:
✦Incandescent: These are your good old-fashioned light bulbs like the
ones that Thomas Edison invented. Most of the light bulbs around your
house are probably incandescent. Incandescent lights are usually
cheap, but the light temperature is lower than with other types of light-
ing (meaning that they are not as bright), and they usually provide
wavering, inconsistent performance.
✦Halogen: Okay, technically, halogen lights are also incandescent, but
they usually burn at a much higher temperature (and provide a more
consistent light over their lifetime) than do regular bulbs. Many profes-
sional video-lighting systems are tungsten-halogen lights. These lights
have a tungsten filament that passes through a sealed tube of halogen
gas. Good, cheap halogen work lights also work well for video lighting —
and they are generally available at tool and hardware stores. Halogen
work lights also sometimes come with useful stands, although you can
make your own stands using threaded plastic pipe and clamps from
your friendly neighborhood hardware store.
✦Fluorescent: Fluorescents also tend to give off a high-temperature light,
although the temperature can vary greatly depending on the condition
and age of the bulb. Fluorescent light is usually both very white and
soft, making it ideal for video lighting. (A good example: I use fluores-
cent lights to make sure that a blue screen is brightly and evenly lit.)
Fluorescent fixtures and bulbs can be purchased for less than $20 and
can be easily suspended above your subject.
388

Book II
Chapter 5
Shooting Great
Digital Video
Evaluating Lighting
If you use fluorescent bulbs, let them warm up for a few minutes before
shooting your video. This should prevent flicker. If the bulbs still flicker after
they’ve warmed for a bit, try using new or different bulbs. Also, pay attention
to how fluorescent lights affect your audio recordings. Fluorescent bulbs tend
to produce a hum in audio recordings, so some practice and testing may be
necessary. If fluorescent humming in your audio recording is a problem,
record audio separately or use a different kind of light.
Bouncing light
Shining a light directly on a subject is not necessarily the best way to illumi-
nate it. You can often get a more diffuse, flattering effect by bouncing light
off a reflective surface, as shown in Figure 5-3.

389
Understanding color temperature
Color temperature is a standardized measurement
of how colors appear, based on the characteristics
of the light in which you see the colors. Your cam-
corder has to be told how to interpret color based
on the color temperature of the light source(s)
where you are recording. When you record in the
sunlight, your camcorder’s interpretation of an
object’s color is entirely different from its interpre-
tation of that same object indoors.
A typical scenario is when you record video as
you follow someone from outdoors to indoors.
As you go indoors, your camcorder goes through
all kinds of gyrations trying to adjust the iris. But you
may notice that for a few moments, everything
in the room appears to have a bluish cast and
then appears normal again. This transition hap-
pens because the camera is trying to adjust to the
new color temperature. The following table charts
approximate color temperatures of various light
sources. Remember: Fluorescent light color tem-
perature varies according to the age of the lamp,
coating, filtering, and other factors.

You can make reflectors out of the following materials, depending on what
light effect you’re looking for:
✦Poster board: White poster board is a good, cheap material that you
can find just about anywhere. Thicker poster board is easier to work
with because it’s rigid (that is, it doesn’t flop all over the place and
make noise while a helper holds it). With some spray paint, coat one
side of a poster board gold and the other silver. Experiment using each
side to gain just the right light quality.
✦Aluminum foil: Crumple a large sheet of foil, and then spread it out
again and tape it to a backing board. Crumpling the foil provides a more
diffuse reflection than you can get from flat foil, but its reflection is still
highly effective.
✦Black plastic garbage bag: Yep, black plastic bags are pretty good
reflectors even though they have a dark color. As with foil, you can tape
or staple the bag to a backing board to make it easier to work with.
Reflectors can also be used to “fill” the lighting of your subject. Consider
Figure 5-4: A light is directed at the subject to light up his face. This light is
often called the key light. A reflector is positioned so that some of the light
that goes past the subject is bounced back onto the other side to fill in
facial or other details.
Hitting with hard light
Hard light is a term that is used in film and video for a direct light source
that creates sharply defined (high-contrast) shadows. Hard light is domi-
nant; it causes the eye to focus on highlights rather than shadows. As a
rule, the smaller the diameter of the light source, the sharper the contrast
between the light and the shadow. Figure 5-5 illustrates a single hard-light
source that is imposed on a figure. If you’re shooting indoors, you can
adjust a hard light to be focused and trimmed so that it illuminates exactly
what you want. Direct sunlight outdoors is usually hard light.

Suggesting with soft light
Sometimes you may find that a light you’re using to illuminate a subject is
too intense. This is especially common with key lights. To counter this situ-
ation, you use soft light, which is more subjective than hard light. Soft light
washes an area with light and creates wispy (low-contrast) shadows, as
shown in Figure 5-6.

391

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
Indoors, soft light is created by indirect light sources, such as hard light
bouncing off a white surface or hard light covered with a diffusing cloth or
filter. Outdoors, soft light can be achieved by shooting on a cloudy day or in
the shadow of a structure. Lighting crews sometimes use one of the follow-
ing materials between the light and your subject:
✦Cheesecloth: Available at art and cooking supply stores (and some gro-
cery stores), cheesecloth has a coarse mesh and is useful both for dif-
fusing light and for straining beans or cottage cheese in the kitchen.
✦Translucent plastic: Sheets of translucent plastic are also available at
arts-and-craft stores. Professional videographers call these gels.
Colored gels are often placed in front of lights that illuminate a backdrop
for special lighting effects. If you do this, make sure that you place a bar-
rier between your key light and the backdrop (as shown in Figure 5-7)
so that the colored light from the gel isn’t washed out by the white key
light. A barrier may simply be a piece of cardboard that is held up by a
stand or helper.
If you diffuse your light, you may have to move your lights closer to the
subject. Experiment to get the best results.
Lights (especially halogens) tend to get very hot. To avoid fire hazards, use
extreme care when placing gels or cheesecloth in front of lights. Never
attach diffusers directly to lights. Position your diffusers some distance
away from the lights so that they don’t melt or catch on fire, and check the
condition of your lights and diffusers regularly. Read and heed all safety
warnings on your lights before using them.
Controlling shadows
Shadows are the places where light is physically blocked by an object. How’s
that for an objective definition? Shadows can be good (see Figure 5-8), and

they can be very bad. The worst shadows are those that are caused by
someone’s nose, which can sometimes make that nose the focal point of the
video. The simplest way to ensure that shadows make your subject look
good is to believe what you see in your viewfinder. Your camera “sees”
shadows differently than your eyes do because your camera sees in two
dimensions instead of three dimensions.
Key light (making Aunt Harriet a glamorous star)
The primary light of a shot is the key light. It sets the stage for the shot,
establishes the texture and depth of a primary figure, and determines the
direction of the shadows. The key light typically comes from a single direc-
tion, as shown in Figure 5-9, and is often a hard light. (See the section
“Hitting with hard light,” earlier in this chapter.) The key light can create
problems by overlighting objects and casting ugly shadows.

Key light is especially important when filming someone’s face because
subtle nuances of light can flatter or distort a facial feature. Correctly film-
ing someone’s face takes practice. The great challenge of recording the
human face comes from the infinite variety of facial shapes and shades; you
can’t film everyone in the same manner. Of course, the intent of the shot
can also dictate the manner in which you want the face to look. For exam-
ple, lighting a face for a mysterious, eerie scene is entirely different from
lighting the face for a casual interview.
The images in Figure 5-10 show how key lighting affects the way people look.
(A) is an unusual angle, creating a mysterious look; (B) is a natural angle; (C)
is also natural but highly shadowed; and (D) is overly bright on the forehead.
In Figure 5-10, I adjusted the vertical and horizontal location of the key light
in each image to emphasize various features. Using a single facial structure,
you can change the angle and the intensity of the key light to create a vari-
ety of effects, which creates a dynamic effect.
Set the key light by placing your light source 30 to 45 degrees to the right or
left of your camera. A good general rule is to follow the natural light source,
so if you’re inside and the window is on the right, aim your light in the same
direction as the light that is streaming through the window. I prefer to have
the light on the left side, but experiment with both sides to determine
which side you prefer.

fill light casts no shadows and decreases some of the harshness of the key
light’s shadows (see Figure 5-11). Just as a key light can harshly overlight a
subject, too much fill light can destroy the details of an image. For example,
using too much fill light causes facial contours to disappear and surfaces to
lose their texture. Place your fill light at a 45-degree angle to your camera
on the opposite side from your key light (which is also at a 45-degree angle
to the camera).
Fill light comes from different sources, such as light coming through a
window or light from a lamp in a corner. If you’re trying to control fill light,
you can close the drapes, turn off the room lights, and point a bright light at
a piece of white poster board so that the light bounces onto your subject in
an unfocused (fill) manner.
Backlight (giving Aunt Bertha much-needed depth)
Video creates a two-dimensional illusion of three-dimensional reality. When
recording video, one of the basic challenges is to avoid giving the impression
of pasting the subject against the background. The perception of separation
of the subject from the background is a much more visually comfortable
illusion. You can accomplish this separation by using backlight.
Backlight creates a kind of aura around the subject. The highlight lifts the
subject from the background (see Figure 5-12). Backlight is accomplished
by pointing a light from the back toward (but not directly at) the camera,
illuminating the subject from behind.
To make backlight, aim an incandescent light (such as a utility light from a
hardware store) from above and slightly behind the subject onto the sub-
ject’s head and shoulders.

Using lens filters
Your camcorder can probably accept some filters that screw on in front of
the lens. Filters can be used to improve various lighting situations. For
example, if you are shooting outdoors in a brightly sunlit location, you may
find that colors look kind of washed out in the light. A neutral-density filter
can compensate for the light and improve the way that colors look.
Other lens filters can provide special lighting effects. For example, a star
filter causes star patterns to shoot out from light points that appear in the
image. This can give the scene a magical look. For more details on how lens
filters can change and improve the way your video images look, check out
the Tiffen Web site at www.tiffen.com.
Controlling Focus and Exposure
Virtually all modern camcorders include automatic-exposure and -focus
controls. Automation is really handy most of the time, but it’s not perfect. If
you always rely on auto focus, you will inevitably see the lens “hunting” for
the right setting during some shots. This can happen a lot if you shoot
moving subjects. Likewise, if you are shooting over a crowd or past other
objects, the camera may focus on the closer objects instead of the desired
subject. If your camera has a manual-focus mode, you can avoid focus hunt-
ing by turning off auto focus.
Manual focus is pretty difficult to control if you’re using a small dial or
slider switch on the side of a camcorder. Try to get a camera with a focus
ring around the lens; this makes manual focus much easier to control.
I also urge you to know how to use the manual-exposure control (also called
the iris). Exposure determines how much light is allowed to pass through
the lens. The lens dilates and contracts much like the iris in a human eye.
Manual exposure control allows you to fine-tune exposure if the automatic
control or camcorder presets aren’t providing the desired light levels. Some

Setting Up Your Camcorder
higher-end digital camcorders have a helpful feature called a zebra pattern.
As you adjust the exposure, a striped pattern appears in the overexposed
portions of the image. Overexposed areas appear as washed-out, colorless
white blobs in your video image. A zebra pattern makes controlling exposure
a lot easier: I have found that overexposing a video shot when you are man-
ually adjusting exposure is very easy. For an example of an overexposed
image, refer to Figure 5-7.
Although every camera is different, most camcorders have an infinite set-
ting (∞) on the manual-focus control. In most cases, anything that is more
than about ten feet away will be in focus when the lens is set to infinite. Ten
feet isn’t a long distance, so you may be able to resolve many focus prob-
lems by simply using the infinite setting.
Like a still camera, shutter speed for a camcorder is measured in fractions,
suggesting what percentage of a second each frame is exposed. A video
camera’s shutter speed can affect the perception of motion for your audience.
Standard shutter speed is 1⁄60, which means that each frame is exposed for 1⁄60
of a second. Under normal, good light conditions, this is the right setting. If
you’ll be shooting fast motion, you may want to increase the shutter speed
slightly (to 1⁄250 or so) to keep the action from blurring. In lower-light situa-
tions or when you want to blur fast motion (for a streaking effect that’s
great for filming a lighted highway at night), select a slower shutter speed if
your camera supports it.
Setting Up Your Camcorder
Perhaps the most important tip I can give you before you shoot your video
is this: Know your camera. Even today’s least-expensive digital camcorders
are packed with features that were wildly advanced (and expensive) just a
few years ago. Most digital camcorders include image stabilization, in-
camera effects, and the ability to record 16-bit stereo audio. But these
advanced features won’t do you much good if they aren’t turned on or con-
figured properly. Spend a few hours reviewing the manual that came with
your camcorder, and practice using every feature and setting. In particular,
check the following items:
✦Audio: Many new camcorders are set by default to record only 12-bit
audio, also sometimes called the 32-kHz setting. Fire up your camcorder
right now and make sure that it is set to 16-bit (48-kHz) audio instead,
and never change it back. Sixteen-bit audio is higher quality, and it
won’t cause any problems later on when you want to capture video to
your computer (or do pretty much anything else with it). For more on
working with audio and understanding the bit and kilohertz settings,
see Chapter 7 of Book II. I also describe audio recording in the section
“Recording Sound,” later in this chapter.
✦Focus and exposure: In the previous section, I mention those times when
you want to control focus and exposure manually. If you use manual-focus
or -exposure control, switch these settings back to automatic before you
turn off the camcorder. That way, the camcorder is ready for quick use
later, when Bigfoot momentarily stumbles into your camp.
397

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
✦Special effects and exposure modes: As with manual focus and exposure,
if you use any of the built-in effects in your camera, be sure to disable
them before turning off the camcorder so that it will be ready to go the
next time you use it. The same thing goes for special exposure modes.
✦Stow the lens cap securely: It seems obvious, I know, but if you have a
clip or something that allows you to securely stow the camcorder’s lens
cap, use it. If you let the cap hang loose on its string, it will probably
bang into the microphone and other parts periodically, making a lot of
noise that you don’t want to record.
✦Use a new tape: Even though digital video doesn’t suffer from the same
generational loss problems as analog video (where each play of the tape
degrades the recording quality), various problems can still occur if you
reuse digital tapes. Potential problems include timecode breaks
(described in the section “Avoiding timecode breaks,” later in this chap-
ter) and physical problems with the tape itself.
Keep the camcorder manual in your gear bag when you hit the road. It may
provide you with an invaluable reference when you’re shooting on location.
Also, review the manual from time to time: Your camcorder no doubt has
some useful or cool features that you forgot about. If you’ve lost your manual,
check the manufacturer’s Web site. You may be able to download a replace-
ment manual.
Shooting Video
When your camcorder is configured and set up the way you want it, it’s time
to start shooting some video. Yay! One of the most important things that
you should work on as you shoot video is to keep the image as stable as
possible. Your camcorder probably has an image-stabilization feature built
in, but image stabilization can do only so much. I recommend using a tripod
for all static shots and a monopod or sling for moving shots.
Pay special attention to the camera’s perspective. As I mention earlier (and
demonstrate in Figure 5-1), the angle of the camera greatly affects the look
and feel of the video that you shoot. I often find that lowering the level of the
camera greatly improves the image. Some high-end camcorders have handles
on top that make shooting from a lower level easier. Virtually all digital cam-
corders have LCD panels that can be swiveled up so that you can easily see
what you’re recording, even if you’re holding the camera down low.
If you’re shooting a person in a studio-like situation, complete with a back-
drop and fancy lighting, provide a stool for your subject to sit on. A stool
can help your subject remain both still and relaxed during a long shoot,
and (unlike a chair) a stool also helps the subject maintain a more erect
posture.
Panning effectively
Moving the camera across a scene is called panning. You often see home
videos that are shot while the person who is holding the camcorder pans
398

Book II
Chapter 5
Shooting Great
Digital Video
Shooting Video
the camera back and forth and up and down, either to follow a moving 
subject or to show a lot of things that don’t fit in a single shot. This tech-
nique (if you can call it that) is called firehosing — and is usually not a good
idea. Practice the following rules when panning:
✦Pan only once per shot.
✦Start panning slowly, gradually speed up, and then slow down again
before stopping.
✦Slow down! Panning too quickly — say, over a landscape — is a
common mistake.
✦If you have a cheap tripod, you may find it difficult to pan smoothly.
Try lubricating the tripod’s swivel head with WD-40 or a silicon spray
lubricant. If that doesn’t work, limit tripod use to stationary shots.
Ideally, you should use a higher-quality tripod with a fluid head for
smooth panning.
✦If you’re shooting a moving subject, try moving the camera with the
subject, rather than panning across a scene. Doing so reduces out-of-
focus issues with the camera lens and helps keep the subject in-frame.
Knowing when to tilt
Tilting the camera (moving it up and down relative to your subject) is
another movement that you’ll do less than you may think. After you have
the camera placed correctly for a medium shot, for instance, moving the
camera up and down is rarely useful. One instance where it can be used to
good effect is to show extreme size — for instance, to tilt up from a low
angle to show how huge a professional wrestler, a politician, or a city build-
ing is. Another common use of tilting is to add a sense of confusion or
danger or to even indicate that something’s not quite right with one of your
characters. (My favorite classic TV program of all time is Batman, where tilt-
ing was practically a way of life when the camera was on arch-villains like
the Joker, the Penguin, or Catwoman!)
If you decide to tilt, use a smooth motion and keep the subject nicely
framed. When you reach the end of the tilt, hold the shot for a few seconds
before performing any zoom or other movements.
Avoiding timecode breaks
Each frame of video is identified using a number called a timecode. When
you edit video on your computer, the timecode identifies the exact places
where you make edits. On your camcorder, a timecode indicator tells you
how much video has been recorded on the tape. This indicator usually
shows up in the camcorder’s viewfinder or the LCD panel. A typical time-
code looks something like this:
00:07:18:07
This number stands for 0 hours, 7 minutes, 18 seconds, and 8 frames (since
the timecode began at 00). If you have a 60-minute tape, the timecode on that
tape probably starts at 00:00:00:00 and ends at 00:59:59:29. In some cases,
399

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
however, the timecode on a tape can become inconsistent. For example,
suppose you record 1 minute of video, rewind the tape 20 seconds, and
then start recording again. Depending on your camcorder, the timecode
may count up to 00:00:40:00 and then start over at 00 again. An inconsis-
tency like this is called a timecode break. A timecode break is more likely to
occur if you fast-forward a tape past a blank, unrecorded section and then
start recording again.
When you capture video from a digital camcorder into your computer, the
capture software reads the timecode from the tape in your camcorder. If the
software encounters a timecode break, it will probably stop the capture and
be unable to capture any video past the break.
The best way to avoid timecode breaks is to make sure that you don’t shut-
tle the tape (fast-forward or rewind it) between recording segments. An
alternative approach is to pre-timecode your tapes before shooting (as
described in the sidebar “Blacking and coding your tapes”). If you have to
rewind the tape (when, for example, someone wants to see a playback of
what you just recorded), make sure that you cue the tape back to the end of
the recorded video before you start recording again. Many camcorders have
an end-search feature that automatically shuttles the tape to the end of the
current timecode. Check your camcorder’s documentation to see whether it
has such a feature.
Mastering your tripod
If you have friends or neighbors who own video cameras, you’ve probably
seen some pretty bad amateur home video. The bottom line is that the cam-
eras can only get so sophisticated. Eventually, it’s up to the carbon-based
camera activation unit (you) to make some decisions and get things right.
400
Blacking and coding your tapes
Video pros also have a formatting process for new
videotapes called blacking and coding. As the
name suggests, blacking and coding is the process
of recording black video and timecode onto new
tapes. This helps ensure consistent timecode
throughout the entire tape, thus avoiding potential
timecode breaks. You don’t need special equipment
to black and code new camcorder tapes. All you
need is a lens cap. Place the lens cap on the cam-
corder and start recording from the start of the tape
all the way to the end. You should do this in a quiet,
darkened room in case the lens cap leaks a little
light. As the black video is recorded onto the tape,
consistent timecode is also recorded on the entire
tape from start to finish. If consistent timecode is
recorded on the entire tape, timecode breaks are
not likely to occur when you use the tape later to
record real video.
Blacking and coding tapes is not mandatory with
modern mini-DV camcorders: As long as you follow
the basic recording guidelines that I mention ear-
lier, you should be able to avoid timecode breaks.
But if you find that timecode breaks are a problem
with your camera, you should black and code all
new tapes before you use them. I especially rec-
ommend blacking and coding your tapes if you
have a Sony Digital8 camcorder. Because Digital8
camcorders use Hi8 tapes, the camcorder may
switch to analog Hi8 mode during playback or cap-
ture if you accidentally play or fast-forward past the
end of recorded digital timecode.

Shooting Video
Here’s one way to do it: Watch a little TV. But instead of getting engrossed in
the dramatic story line (Did he do it? Was he framed?) or giggling along with
the laugh track, take some time to watch the camera work. (This is especially
effective when you’re watching the evening news or some other show where
a lot of one-camera, handheld shots are used.) You can see some of the basic,
professional video tricks play out right before your eyes.
The number one rule? Move the camera only when you have to and only
when it makes sense for the shot. And when you decide to move the camera,
do it cleanly, deliberately, and with authority. (In this respect, it’s sort of like
karate, but you can wear jeans.)
Want to instantly make your video doubly-watchable? (Is that a word?) Buy
a tripod, and put your camera on it. Use the tripod as much as you can.
Most of what seems amateur about amateur video is a shaking camera.
Although some DV camcorders offer a special image-stabilization feature,
this feature won’t cover up the fact that you’re holding the camera in your
hand. In most cases, a digital stabilization feature can help in only limited
ways, such as by smoothing out shots in which you use a high level of
zoom. But only a good tripod can keep you from moving the camera too
abruptly, tilting it slightly, or jostling it accidentally.
The tripod doesn’t have to be pricey; an inexpensive one ($35 or less) should
do fine. Most tripods are easy to adjust, standing to 5 feet or more but col-
lapsing, even with the camera still attached, to 2 feet or less. Most tripods
can also often help you pan the camera smoothly, and some enable you to
tilt the camera up and down smoothly as well.
If you’re in a situation where you can’t use a tripod, you still have a few
options. First, you can use some sort of camera-stabilization device to help
you keep the camera steady. Stabilization systems range from shoulder-
mounted steady-cam setups to small, weighted balances that you can use for
easy, handheld shots where you need to move the camera. These systems
cost a few hundred dollars and may not be right for home video, but they’re
perfect for video that you’re shooting for an organization or business.
Second, you can place the camera on something that will make it as steady
as possible, such as a fence post or a car hood. If you can’t get the right
angle on the shot with the camera on such a platform, you can try putting
your elbows on the platform to hold the camera as steady as possible.
If you’re forced to hold the camera, try to hold it in two hands, preferably
with one hand under the base of the camera. (You may also find this con-
venient for zooming or manual focusing.) Keep your elbows close to your
body, and plan your shots so that you can rest between them. You’ll get
tired of holding the camera like this, and your shots will start to get jittery
and uneven.
Start recording early
If you’re filming with actors or directing your subjects, calling, “Action!”
tells them to begin performing. However, you should start recording a few
401

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
seconds before the action starts. This is called getting an in handle, which
gives you a little extra footage on the tape to play with when you’re editing
later. Then, everyone in the scene should count to three (silently) after
hearing “Action!” before doing anything because it makes it easier to edit
out the “Action!” statement. (You can also point to your actors or count
down with your fingers to silently tell your actors when to start acting. On
the set of a TV show, the control-room director usually starts the tape, and
then a floor director would say “5, 4, 3, 2, 1” and point to signal “Action!”)
Stop recording late
Now for the flip side for the previous section: You should also wait a few sec-
onds after the action in a scene has taken place to yell, “Cut!” More impor-
tantly (especially if it’s not the right time or place to yell, such as during a
wedding), you should wait a few seconds before pressing the Pause button
on your camcorder. This gives you an out handle, which makes it easier, once
again, to edit in iMovie. If you press Pause immediately after the action stops,
you may find that you didn’t quite get enough footage for a clean transition
when you’re editing.
The Fine Art of Zooming
Zooming is the process of changing the focal length of a lens. If you’ve ever
had a fixed-length camera lens (one that didn’t zoom), you know that to
change the perceived distance to a particular object, you have to move the
camera. With a zoom lens, you can change the focal length without chang-
ing the location of the camera.
Another calling card of amateur video is zealous use of the zoom buttons.
Something happens to people when they get behind a camcorder with a
zoom feature. They zoom in; they zoom out. Zoom in on the baby, zoom out
from the baby. Zoom in on grandma, zoom out from grandma. Zoom in on
the plush interior of your new car . . .
Spend a little time doing some research (that is, watching TV), and you’ll
see that a professional rarely zooms in and out during a single shot. (It hap-
pens sometimes in news footage and during newscasts but not much in
interviews, informational shows, and fictional shows.) This doesn’t mean
that the zoom feature is useless. It just means that changing the focal length
between shots instead of during shots is generally more effective.
Zoom technique and the three shots
Rather than zooming and moving the camera to follow the action, profes-
sional videographers often use a series of shots that are taken from differ-
ent angles and that use different focal lengths. To get better-looking
pictures for your own video, you should consider using this tactic. The
common shots are as follows:
✦An establishing shot: An establishing shot gives your audience a sense
of location. Using a wide-angle focal length (zoom set to 0 or, on some
cameras, W for wide), you shoot an entire scene without necessarily
402

Book II
Chapter 5
Shooting Great
Digital Video
The Fine Art of Zooming
showing your main action or by showing it as only a small part of the
scene. In establishing shots, showing some zoom, especially to suggest
the direction of the action, is common. For instance, if you’re showing
New York’s Times Square in wide angle and you want to make it clear
that you’re going in to the heart of Times Square, you may smoothly
zoom in a bit to convey that action.
✦A medium shot: A medium shot keeps your subject in full frame, giving
the audience the sense of what action is taking place and who or what is
the main subject. A lot of your footage is likely to be shown in medium
shots. Rarely will you want any zooming to go on during a medium shot
because it simply distracts from the action.
✦A close-up shot: A close-up shot shows something particular that con-
tinues to tell the story, such as a small object or a person’s reaction
during dialog. The number of close-ups that you use can vary depend-
ing on the meaning that you’re trying to convey. You can sometimes
zoom while in close-up mode but usually only to emphasize an action.
For example, you may zoom in slightly on a sweating interview subject
as he makes the fatal admission or zoom away from your on-air narrator
as the story is ending. Otherwise, keep the focal length locked and just
shoot the action with a steady hand (or better yet, a tripod).
The point, then, is to avoid zooming too much during each individual shot.
Instead, shoot your establishing shot and hold steady for a while. Then
change the focal length (zoom in) to a medium shot, and hold that one.
Now, zoom in to a close-up shot and hold it. Zoom back to a medium shot,
and hold that.
In most cases, you should also move the camera to change angles on your
subject so that your establishing, medium, and close-up shots all have a
slightly different look at your subject. For instance, you could start with a
wide, establishing shot from behind your family walking into Times Square.
Then get a medium shot from the side of them as they walk past stores.
Finally, end with a straight-on close-up shot from in front of your daughter
as she spots something interesting at a sidewalk vendor’s table.
How would you get all these shots? Ideally, you would get one shot, pause
the camera, move it, change the focal length, get the next shot, pause the
camera, move it, and so on. In practice, this can be tough to do if you’re
shooting vacation footage. In that case, you should simply make sure that
you’re holding each shot — establishing, medium, and close-up — long
enough before you begin zooming and finding a new angle. Then, you can
edit out all the zooms and movements while having enough steady footage
of each shot to build your edited video nicely.
Performing the zoom
Get to know your camera’s zoom controls intimately. How you use them can
make the difference between effective zooms and those that aren’t as effec-
tive, especially if you want your zoom to end up in the final, edited video. (If
you’re zooming just to get to a different focal length, don’t worry about how
smoothly you press the buttons, as long as you have enough steady footage
for each different shot between zooms.)
403

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
Zoom smoothly. Avoid zooming too quickly (unless you’re making a music
video or following a flying saucer through the sky), and try not to jostle or
tilt the camera while zooming. Watching stories on a news program such as
20/20 or the evening national news can give you a good idea of how quickly
you should zoom the camera in different circumstances. Most likely, smooth
zooming simply means getting used to the controls of your camera. Remember
that the more you zoom, the more a small movement of the camera will look
like an earthquake to the viewer. If you have some serious zoom action going
on, put your camcorder on a tripod.
It’s important to plan your zoom shots before you record them. Sometimes,
as you’re zooming, you realize that you don’t have the subject framed cor-
rectly. When you move the camera to correct this oversight, the jagged
movement doesn’t look great in the final product. Here’s a simple trick: If
you can, zoom in to the subject (or some landmark) first, before you record,
and then zoom back out. Now you know that you can press the Record
button and zoom in with the shot well composed.
Many cameras include a wireless remote controller that may, at first glance,
seem completely useless. But it can be helpful for smooth zooming, espe-
cially if you’re working with the camera on a tripod. Using the remote, you
can zoom the camera without touching it, ensuring that the zoom move-
ment is as smooth as possible. This means that you can even zoom in and
out if you’re filming yourself!

Sound recording tips
In video creation, overcoming the challenges in the
audio environment is one of your biggest jobs. Your
goal is to make the audio on the tape sound like
what your ears are hearing in real life. This is
seldom an easy task.
A cardinal rule is not to overdrive your audio
recording capability. Overdriving occurs when you
place a microphone too close to someone’s mouth
or too close to musical equipment. If you overdrive
your recording, you will most likely distort the audio
portion.
Here are some tips for increasing your success
with sound recording. You can definitely achieve a
high quality on a regular basis by observing the fol-
lowing simple rules:
 Obtain a set of earphones, plug them into the
audio-monitoring port on your camcorder, and
wear them during setup and recording. Once
you’re sure that the sound is okay, you can take
off the earphones.
 Try turning off the automatic gain control (AGC)
on your camcorder. I typically use the AGC in
only two circumstances: when I don’t have the
time to worry about how the audio turns out
and when the audio situation is out of control,
such as at a loud basketball game. Otherwise,
I leave the AGC turned off and keep my fingers
poised on the volume control.
 Sound-check your on-camera person (people).
Whenever you can, get your people to talk nat-
urally on-camera in the location that they will
speak, adjust your sound level, record, and play
back. With a little practice, you can perform
this procedure in less than a minute. I promise
that you will enjoy your time shooting video a
lot more if you’re confident that the audio is
recording properly.
 Riding the gain is the practice of keeping an
eye on the volume meter and a finger on the
volume (gain) control. With a little practice, you
can train yourself to anticipate moments when
a presenter is about to speak loudly or softly.
These subtle adjustments can prevent the pre-
senter’s voice from distorting or disappearing.

Book II

Recording Sound
One more bit of advice: Avoid zooming the camera out to frame your sub-
ject, especially if you’re in a close-up. Such a corrective zoom is like holding
up a sign saying, “Whoops, I made a mistake here!” After you’ve zoomed in
close, a smooth tilt or pan of the camera to get the person properly in frame
almost always looks better than “searching” with a zoom movement.
Finally, if your camera has a digital zoom feature, I recommend that you
turn it off. Digital zoom uses computer algorithms to go beyond the lens’s
physical capabilities for zoom. The numbers can be impressive — 320x opti-
cal zoom, for instance, as opposed to 10x or 16x — but the results aren’t
impressive. Most digital zooms look like spy camera footage at best. Unless
you’re trying to make the footage look like a shaking picture that’s taken
from the scope of an assassin’s rifle, avoid using digital zoom. If you turn it
off by default, you can’t accidentally spill over into digital mode when
you’re pressing the zoom button.
Recording Sound
Recording great-quality audio is no simple matter. Professional recording
studios spend thousands (sometimes even millions) of dollars to set up
acoustically superior sound rooms. I’m guessing that you don’t have that
kind of budgetary firepower handy, but if you’re recording your own sound,
you can get pro-sounding results if you follow these basic tips:
✦Use an external microphone whenever possible. The microphones
that are built in to modern camcorders have improved greatly in recent
years, but they still present problems. They often record undesired
ambient sound near the camcorder (such as audience members at a
play) or even mechanical sound from the camcorder’s tape drive. If pos-
sible, connect an external microphone to the camcorder’s mic input.
✦Eliminate unwanted noise sources. If you must use the camcorder’s
built-in mic, be aware of your movements and other things that can
cause loud, distracting noises on tape. Problem items can include a
loose lens cap banging around, your finger rubbing against the mic,
wind blowing across the mic, and the swish-swish of those nylon work-
out pants that you wore this morning. I discuss ambient noise in greater
detail in the following section.
✦Obtain and use a high-quality microphone. If you’re recording narration
or other audio in your “studio” (also known as your office), use the best
microphone that you can afford. A good mic isn’t cheap, but it can make
a huge difference in recording quality. The cheap little microphone that
came with your computer probably provides very poor results.
✦Position the microphone for best quality. If possible, suspend the mic
above the subject. This way, the microphone is less likely to pick up
noises that are made by the subject’s clothes or the bumping of the
microphone stand.
✦Watch for trip hazards! In your haste to record great sound, don’t forget
that your microphone cables can become an on-scene hazard. Not only
is this a safety hazard to anyone walking by, but if someone snags a cable,
your equipment could be damaged as well. If necessary, bring along
some duct tape to temporarily cover cables that run across the floor.

Earlier I mention that you should plan which video scenes you want to
record. Planning the audio scenes that you want to record is also important.
For example, suppose I want to make a video about a visit to the beach. In
such a project, I would like to have a consistent recording of waves crashing
on the shore to use in the background. But if I record short, 5-to-10-second
video clips, I’ll never get a single, consistent audio clip. So, in addition to my
various video clips, I plan to record a single, unbroken clip of the ocean.
Managing ambient noise
Ambient noise is the general noise that we don’t usually think much about
because it surrounds us constantly. Ambient noise can come from chirping
birds, an airplane flying overhead, chattering bystanders, passing cars, a
blowing furnace, the little fans that spin inside your computer, and even the
tiny motor that turns the tape reels in your camcorder or tape recorder.
Although it’s easy to tune out these noises when you’re immersed in them,
they will turn up loud and ugly in your audio recordings later on.
If you’re recording outdoors or in a public gathering place, you probably can’t
do much to eliminate the sources of ambient noise. But wherever you are
recording, you can take the following basic steps to manage ambient noise:
✦Use a microphone. I know, this is about the millionth time I’ve said it,
but a microphone that’s placed close to your subject can go a long way
toward ensuring that the sound you want to record is not totally over-
whelmed by ambient noise.
✦Wear headphones. Camcorders and tape recorders almost always have
headphone jacks. If you plug headphones into the headphone jack, you
can listen to the audio that is being recorded — and possibly detect
potential problems.
✦Shield the camcorder’s mic from the wind. A gentle breeze may seem
almost silent to your ear, but the camcorder’s microphone may pick it
up as a loud roar that overwhelms all other sound. If nothing else, you
can position your hand to block wind from blowing directly across the
screen on the front of your camcorder’s mic.
✦Try to minimize sound reflection. Audio waves reflect off any hard sur-
face, which can cause echoing in a recording. Hanging blankets on walls
and other hard surfaces can significantly reduce reflection.
✦Turn off fans, heaters, and air conditioners. Air that’s rushing through
vents creates a surprising amount of unwanted ambient noise. If possi-
ble, temporarily turn off your furnace, air conditioner, or fans while you
record your audio.
✦Turn off cell phones and pagers. You know how annoying it is when
someone’s cell phone rings while you’re trying to watch a movie; just
imagine how bothersome it is when you’re making a movie! Make sure
that you and everyone else on the set turns those things off. Even the
sound of a vibrating pager may be picked up by your microphones.
✦Shut down your computer. Obviously this is impossible if you are
recording using a microphone that is connected to your computer, but
computers tend to make a lot of noise, so shut them down if you can.

Recording Sound
✦Warn everyone else to be quiet. If other people are in the building or
general area, ask them to be quiet while you’re recording audio. Noises
from the next room may be muffled, but they still contribute to ambient
noise. Likewise, you may want to wait until your neighbor is done mowing
his lawn before recording your audio.
✦Record and preview some audio. Record a bit of audio, and then play it
back. This can help you identify ambient noise or other audio problems.
Creating your own sound effects
As you watch a TV show or movie, it is easy to forget that many of the
subtle sounds that you hear are actually sound effects that were added
during editing, rather than “real” sounds that were recorded with the video
image. This is often because the microphone was focused on the voice of a
speaking subject as opposed to other actions in the scene. Subtle sounds
like footsteps, a knock on the door, or splashing water are often recorded
separately and added to the movie later. These sound effects are often
called Foley sounds by movie pros, and someone who makes Foley sounds is
called a Foley artist. Foley sound effects are named after audio pioneer Jack
Foley, who invented the technique in the 1950s.
Recording your own sound effects is pretty easy. Many sounds can actually
sound better in a video project if they’re simulated, as opposed to record-
ing the real thing. Consider the following examples:
✦Breaking bone: Snap carrots or celery in half. Fruit and vegetables can
be used to produce many disgusting sounds, and they don’t complain
about being broken in half nearly as much as human actors.
✦Buzzing insect: Wrap wax paper tightly around a comb, place your lips
so that they are just barely touching the paper, and hum so that the wax
paper makes a buzzing sound.
✦Fire: Crumple cellophane or wax paper to simulate the sound of a crack-
ling fire.
✦Footsteps: Hold two shoes and tap the heels together followed by the
toes. Experiment with different shoe types for different sounds. This
may take some practice to get the timing of each footstep just right.
✦Gravel or snow: Walk on cat litter to simulate the sound of walking
through snow or gravel.
✦Horse hooves: This is one of the classic sound effects. The clop-clop-
clopping of horse hooves is often made by clapping two halves of a
coconut shell together.
✦Kiss: Pucker up and give your forearm a nice big smooch to make the
sound of a kiss.
✦Punch: Punch a raw piece of steak or a raw chicken.
✦Thunder: Shake a large piece of sheet metal to simulate a thunderstorm.
✦Town bell: To replicate the sound of a large bell ringing, hold the handle of
a metal stew pot lid and tap the edge with a spoon or other metal object.
Experiment with various strikers and lids to get just the right effect.

Some sound effects may be included with your editing software or are avail-
able for download. Pinnacle Studio, for example, comes with a diverse library
of sound effects, which you can access by clicking the Show Sound Effects
tab or by choosing Album➪Sound Effects. If the sound effects aren’t cur-
rently listed, navigate to the folder C:\Program Files\Pinnacle\Studio 8\
Sound Effects and then open one of the 13 sound-effect category folders,
such as \Animals or \Squeaks.
Apple iMovie also includes some built-in sound effects. Open iMovie, and
click the Audio button. To view a list of sound effects, make sure that you
have iMovie Sound Effects listed in the menu at the top of the audio browser
(as shown in Figure 5-13). You may also be able to download additional sound
effects periodically from the following Web site:
www.apple.com/imovie/audio_effects.html
If you use Windows Movie Maker, you may be able to download free sound
effects from Microsoft. Visit the following Web site, and look for links to
downloadable sound effects:

If you are using another video-editing program, check the documentation or
visit the publisher’s Web site to see whether free sound effects are available.

 Troubleshooting video-capture problems
 Capturing analog video
S
oftware vendors all over the computer world have been rushing to offer
programs that allow you to create and edit exciting movies on your
computer. Video-editing programs have even become basic components of
modern PC operating systems. Just as Microsoft Windows and the Apple
Macintosh OS X come with Internet browsers, e-mail programs, and even
text editors, current versions of Windows and the Mac OS include free tools
to help you make movies. Windows XP includes a program called Windows
Movie Maker, and Mac OS X comes with iMovie.
But all the video-editing software in the world doesn’t do you much good if
you don’t have some actual video to edit. Thanks to FireWire (a new tech-
nology that allows computers and camcorders to easily share video) and a
few other technologies, transferring video from the tape in your camcorder
to the hard drive in your computer is easy. This chapter shows you how. I
also show you how to work with video that was shot with an analog cam-
corder or transferred from a VHS videotape to your computer.
Preparing for Digital Video Capture
The process of transferring video to your computer is often called capturing.
Capturing digital video is pretty easy, but you should take some specific
steps to ensure that everything goes smoothly. In this section, I detail those
steps for you. In the next section, I discuss capturing digital video with
Studio and iMovie.
Your computer needs the right components to capture video — which
means (among other things) that you need to have a FireWire or other cap-
ture card installed. For step-by-step instruction on adding a card to your PC,
visit Chapter 2 of Book III.
Why is the process of transferring video to the hard drive called capturing
instead of just copying? Even though the video is stored as digital data on
your camcorder tape, that data must be converted to a computer file to be
stored on your hard drive. Capturing is the process of turning video data
into a computer file.
409

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
Turning off unnecessary programs
If you are like most people, you probably have several different programs
running on your computer right now. Video capture requires a lot of avail-
able memory and processor power, and every running program on your
computer uses some of those resources. E-mail, Web browser, and MP3
jukebox? Close ’em. Cute desktop schemes and screen savers? Disable
those, too. I even recommend that you temporarily disable your antivirus
software during video capture.
If you’re using Windows, take a look at the system tray. (That’s the area in
the lower-right corner of your screen, next to the clock.) Every little icon
that you see down there is a running program. Right-click each icon, and
close or disable as many of them as possible. Eventually (well, okay, ideally)
your system tray and taskbar look something like what’s shown in Figure 6-1.
You don’t have to get rid of every item, but try to close or disable as many
as possible. After all, it’s a temporary arrangement. You should also disable
your Internet connection during video capture. You can reactivate system
tray items later — including your antivirus software — by simply restarting
your computer.
If you’re using a Macintosh, look at the Mac OS X Dock to make sure that
your programs are closed. (An active program has a little arrow under it, as
shown in Figure 6-2.) To exit a program, click its icon in the Dock and press
Ô+Q. The only icon that you can’t close is the Finder, of course.
Defragmenting your hard drive
When your computer’s operating system puts files on your hard drive,
those files may wind up spread all over the place. This means that even if

Book II
Chapter 6
Importing Video Clips
Preparing for Digital Video Capture
you have 60GB of free space, that 60GB may be broken up into little chunks
here and there. This can cause trouble during video capture, especially with
Windows machines — and most especially with version of Windows before
Windows XP (such as Windows Me). Even if you have a Mac, defragmenting
is still a good regular computer maintenance practice, and if you experience
dropped frames during video capture, defragmentation can only help.
I recommend that you defragment your hard drive monthly, or right before
video capture if the drive hasn’t been defragmented recently. Defragmenta-
tion organizes the files on your hard drive so that the empty space is in larger,
more usable chunks. Some computer experts will probably tell you that
defragmentation isn’t as important with modern operating systems like OS X
and Windows XP, but that advice does not apply when you’re working with
video. Video is one of the few remaining tasks that still requires a defrag-
mented hard drive.
To defragment a hard drive in Windows, choose Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk Defragmenter. Choose the hard drive that
you want to defragment, and click the Defragment button (in Windows XP)
or the OK button (in Windows Me and earlier versions).
The Macintosh OS doesn’t come with a built-in defragmenter, but you can
use an aftermarket defragmentation utility such as Norton Disk Doctor.
Making room for video files
Video files need a lot of space. Digital video typically uses 3.6MB of space
per second, which (if you do the math) means that you need 1GB of space
to hold about 5 minutes of video. You also need working space on the hard
drive — so figure out approximately how much video you want to capture
and multiply that number by 4. For example, to capture about 15 minutes of
video, you’ll need at least 3GB of drive space to store it. Multiply that by 4
(as a general rule) to figure out that you should have at least 12GB of free
space on your hard drive to get the job done.
When I say that you need at least 12GB of space for 15 minutes of video, I do
mean at least. Even though hard drive space may appear empty, your oper-
ating system — as well as your video-editing program — has to use that
empty space periodically while working in the background. When it comes
to hard-drive space, more really is better when you’re working with video.
The first thing that you need to do is to figure out how much free space is
available on your hard drive. In Windows, open My Computer (Choose
Start➪My Computer). Right-click the icon that represents your hard drive,
and choose Properties from the menu that appears. The Properties dialog
box appears, which is similar to the one shown in Figure 6-3. It tells you
(among other things) how much free space is available. Click the OK button
to close the dialog box.
On a Macintosh, click the icon for your hard drive once; then press Ô+I. An
Info dialog box (similar to Figure 6-4) appears, showing you how much free
space is available. Click the Close button or press Ô+Q to close the Info
dialog box.
411

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
What if you need more space? Your options may be limited, but consider
the following items:
✦Take out the garbage. Empty the Recycle Bin (in Windows) or Trash
(on a Mac).
✦Delete unneeded Internet files. The cache for your Web browser could
be taking up a lot of hard-drive space. The Windows Disk Cleanup utility
(pictured in Figure 6-3) can help you get rid of these and other unneces-
sary files. On a Mac, you can empty the cache or control how much
drive space is devoted to cache by using the Preferences window for
your Web browser.
✦Add a hard drive to your computer. Adding a second hard drive to
your computer can be a little complicated, but it’s certainly one good
way to gain more storage space.

Preparing for Digital Video Capture
Connecting a digital camcorder to your computer
Before you can edit video on your computer, you need to get the video into
the computer somehow. Sorry, a shoehorn doesn’t work — you usually con-
nect a cable between your camcorder and the FireWire or USB port on your
computer. Of the two, FireWire (also called IEEE 1394) is usually preferable.
FireWire ports have two basic styles: 6-pin and 4-pin. Note that I’m talking
about the original FireWire port here, now affectionately called FireWire
400. The second-generation FireWire standard, called FireWire 800, is twice
as fast but uses a different type of connector. It’s currently available only
on the latest and most expensive Mac computers. The FireWire 400 port on
your computer probably uses a 6-pin connector, and the port on your cam-
corder probably uses a 4-pin connector. This means that you may need to
buy a 6-pin–to–4-pin FireWire cable, if you don’t already have one. Figure 6-5
illustrates the differences between FireWire 400 connectors.
The FireWire connector on your camcorder may not be labeled “FireWire.”
It may be called IEEE 1394 (the “official” term for FireWire), DV, or i.Link. In
any case, if the camcorder is digital and it has a port that looks like one of
the connectors that are shown in Figure 6-5, it’s FireWire compatible.
FireWire is a hot-swappable port technology. This means that you don’t have
to power off your computer when you want to connect a camcorder or
other FireWire device to a FireWire port. Just plug in the device and turn it
on, and away you go. (Meanwhile, you may want to practice saying buzz-
words like hot-swappable with a straight face.)
Connect the FireWire cable between the camcorder and your computer, and
then power on your camcorder. Your camcorder probably has two power
modes. One is a camera mode, which is the mode that you use when you
shoot video. The second mode is a player or VTR mode. This second mode
is the one that you should turn on when you prepare to capture video from
the camcorder’s tape into your computer.
When you turn on the camcorder, your Windows PC will probably chime and
then display the Digital Video Device window, which asks you what you want
to do. This window is one of those handy yet slightly annoying features that
tries to make everything more automatic in Windows. Click the Cancel button
to close that window for now.

413

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
One really cool feature of FireWire is a technology called device control. In
effect, this technology allows software on your computer to control devices
that are connected to your FireWire ports — including digital camcorders.
This means that when you want to play, rewind, or pause video playback on
the camcorder, you can usually do it by using the Play, Rewind, Pause, and
other control buttons in your Pinnacle Studio or Apple iMovie application.
Some camcorders can use USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports instead of
FireWire ports. The nice thing about USB ports is that — unlike FireWire
ports — virtually all PCs that were made in the last 5 years have them. The
not-so-nice thing is that USB 1.1 ports are too slow to handle full-quality
video. (USB 2.0 ports are fine because the speed of a USB 2.0 transfer is
actually faster than standard FireWire.) Pinnacle Studio and Apple iMovie
can capture from USB cameras using the same procedures that I describe in
the next section, but you may find that the video quality is reduced when
capturing using a USB 1.1 connection. Therefore, I recommend that you use
FireWire or USB 2.0 whenever possible.
Capturing Digital Video
Modern video-editing software makes capturing really easy. In the following
sections, I show you how to capture video using Pinnacle Studio (on a
Windows PC) and iMovie (on a Mac). Fortunately, the capture process in
most programs is pretty similar, so you should be able to follow along
regardless of what software you are using.
Even if your FireWire card came with a separate capture utility, I recommend
that you capture video in the program that you plan to use for editing when-
ever possible. That way, you don’t have to go through the trouble of figuring
out how to get the video from that capture utility into your desired editing
program.
Capturing video in Pinnacle Studio
Pinnacle Studio for Windows offers an amazing level of moviemaking power
for its price. The software is available by itself for a suggested retail price of
$99, or you can buy it bundled with digital (FireWire) or analog video-capture
cards for about $30 more. Other bundling deals include the Studio software,
capture hardware, and the Hollywood FX plug-in (which adds advanced
video-editing tools to the basic Studio package).
To begin the capture process in Studio, click the Capture tab or choose
View➪Capture. The Capture mode appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
Setting capture options
Pinnacle Studio has some cool options for capturing video. Unlike most
affordable video-editing software, Studio supports online and offline editing.
Studio facilitates offline editing using the Preview-quality capture mode.
When capturing video with Studio, you can choose one of the following
basic quality settings:
414

Book II
Chapter 6
Importing Video Clips
Capturing Digital Video
✦DV full-quality capture: Choose this option if you plan to export your
movie to videotape — and you have a generous amount of hard-drive
space to use.
✦MPEG full-quality capture: Choose this option if you plan to output your
video to a VCD, S-VCD, DVD, or the Internet. MPEG capture can be further
customized by using some suboptions that I describe in the next section.
✦Preview-quality capture: Choose this option to capture a lot of video to
your hard drive when storage space is a concern. With this option,
Studio captures video at a lower quality, which results in a smaller file
size. Later, when you’re done editing, Studio recaptures — at full DV
quality — only the portions that you want for your final movie; all your
edits are automatically applied to the full-quality video.
If you’re not quite satisfied with the quality of the preview that you get,
you can customize Preview-quality capture with suboptions that I
describe in the section “Previewing your capture settings,” later in this
chapter.
In addition to the three basic quality settings, Studio provides you with a
variety of other capture options. You can find these options in the lower-
right portion of the screen (as shown in Figure 6-6). One of the things that
you can customize is the storage location for your captured video, which is
often called the scratch disk. Click the folder icon to review the scratch disk
folder, and change it if you want. For example, you may have a second hard
drive that you want to use for video storage. The default location for your
scratch disk is as follows:
C:\My Documents\Pinnacle Studio\Captured Video

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
This folder is created automatically when you install Studio on your 
computer.
You can also specify a variety of other capture settings. Click the Settings
button in the lower-right corner of the screen to open the Pinnacle Studio
Setup Options dialog box. Click the Capture Source tab to bring it to the
front, as shown in Figure 6-7.
This dialog box contains a lot of options and settings, but only two of them
are important for right now. First, I strongly recommend that you deselect
the Capture Preview check box, which is on the Capture Source tab. When
this check box is selected, Studio shows a preview of the video on-screen as
you capture it. This preview uses valuable memory and processor power
that is better devoted to the actual video-capture process. You can still view
the video on the LCD or viewfinder of your camcorder, so the on-screen pre-
view is redundant.
Second, review the scene-detection settings. Studio can automatically detect
when one scene ends and another begins and automatically turn each scene
into a separate video clip. This comes in handy during editing, but if you
don’t like the feature, you can select the No Auto Scene Detection — Press
Space Bar to Create Scene radio button. Otherwise, I recommend that you
keep the default setting, as shown in Figure 6-7.
After you have changed these settings, click the Capture Format tab to
bring it to the front. If you are using the DV capture preset, you can’t cus-
tomize any of the settings on this tab. But if you are using the MPEG or
Preview preset, you can adjust some options, as described in the next two
sections.
Checking MPEG capture settings
If you’re using the MPEG preset (your current preset is shown in the drop-
down list in the upper-left corner of the Capture Format tab), you can
choose a standard group of settings or customize your settings (as shown
in Figure 6-8). You can adjust the following MPEG capture settings:
Figure 6-7:

Chapter 6
Importing Video Clips
Capturing Digital Video
✦Sub-Preset: Choose a sub-preset from the menu that’s shown in Figure
6-8. Sub-presets include High quality (DVD), Medium quality (SVCD),
Low quality (Video CD), and Custom. If you choose Custom, you can
modify the remaining settings. If you choose the High, Medium, or Low
quality sub-presets, the remaining options are grayed out.
✦MPEG Type: Choose MPEG1 to make sure that your final movie is com-
patible with the widest variety of computers, or choose MPEG2 for
slightly better quality.
✦Resolution: This is the screen size, in width and height in pixels, of the
image that you will capture. The size for full-quality DV is 720×480. A
smaller size means a smaller image, but it also means that the file sizes
for your video will be much smaller.
✦Pre-Filter: If you’re capturing at a smaller resolution, select this check
box to improve the appearance of the image slightly (at the cost of
sharpness).
✦Fast Encode: This option speeds up the capture process, but it can
reduce quality.
✦Data Rate: You can fine-tune quality and file size by adjusting the data
rate. To adjust the data rate, move the slider back and forth. Lower data
rates mean smaller files but also lower quality. In most cases, you
should keep the default data rate setting.
✦Include Audio: If you want to capture only the video image from your
tape, and not the audio, deselect this check box.
✦MPEG Capture: This list box helps you tailor capture to the speed of
your computer. The safest option is to simply select the Use Default
Encoding Mode entry from the list box. If your computer is very fast
(with a 2-GHz or faster processor), you can make capture more efficient
by selecting the Encode in Real Time entry from the list box. If your
computer is slower (with a 1-GHz or slower processor), select the
Encode After Capturing entry from the list box if you encounter
dropped frames or other problems during capture.
When you’re done setting capture-format options, click the OK button to
close the Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box.

Previewing your capture settings
Pinnacle Studio’s Preview capture mode is an excellent tool because it lets
you store more source material on your hard drive for editing purposes
without using up so much drive space. Like MPEG capture, if you choose
the Preview preset in the main capture window (see Figure 6-6) and then
click the Settings button, you have a group of sub-presets to choose from on
the Capture Format tab (see Figure 6-8). It’s usually best to just use one of
the sub-presets, but if you choose Custom quality, you can also adjust the
following settings:
✦List All Codecs: Choose this option to list all the codecs that are installed
on your system. (Codecs are compressor/decompressor schemes for
audio and video.) I don’t recommend using this option because some of
the codecs that are installed on your computer may not be compatible
with the Pinnacle Studio software.
✦Compression: Here you can choose a specific codec. For most preview
captures, the Intel Indeo Video R3.2 or PCLEPIM1 32-bit Compressor
codec is fine.
✦Width and Height: Here you can choose a custom size for the video.
Remember, the smaller the size, the less hard-drive space you need. If
you’re using a PIM1 codec, I recommend a frame size of 352×240 or
smaller. For Indeo codecs, use 360×240 or smaller.
✦Frame rate: The default frame rate for NTSC video is 29.97, but your
files will be much smaller if you choose 14.985. If you’re working with
PAL video, you can choose a frame rate of 25 or 12.5. A lower frame rate
means that the video image won’t be quite as smooth, but because it’s
only preview quality, this usually isn’t a big deal.
✦Quality or Data Rate: Select either the Quality or Data Rate radio button,
and then use this slider to adjust the quality or data rate for the capture.
It doesn’t matter whether you choose Quality or Data Rate; the end
result is the same. Remember, lower quality (or data rate) means smaller
file sizes.
✦Include Audio: Deselect this check box if you want to capture video only.
✦Channels: Choose between 16-bit stereo (for better-audio quality) or 
16-bit mono (for smaller files).
✦Sample Rate: You can probably say it with me by now: Higher sample
rates provide better quality; lower sample rates produce smaller files.
When you’re done setting capture-format options, click the OK button to
close the Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box.
Capturing video
When you finally have your capture settings just the way you want them,
you’re ready to capture. To do so, simply follow these steps:
1. Connect your camcorder to your FireWire port, as described in the
“Preparing for Digital Video Capture” section.
418

Book II
Chapter 6
Importing Video Clips
Capturing Digital Video
2. In Pinnacle Studio, click the Capture tab near the top of the window
or choose View➪Capture.
3. Configure your capture options (as described in the section “Checking
MPEG capture settings,” earlier in this chapter).
4. Use the camera controls (as shown in Figure 6-6) to shuttle the cam-
corder tape to the spot where you want to start capturing video.
Shuttle is another fancy term that video pros like to use when they talk
about moving a videotape. When you rewind or fast-forward a tape, you
are shuttling it. See: You’re already a video pro and you didn’t even
know it!
5. Click the Start Capture button.
The Capture Video dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-9.
6. Enter a name for the capture; this name will be used as the filename
for the captured video later. You can also enter a time limit for the
capture.
By default, the time that is shown reflects the amount of free space on
your hard drive. Figure 6-9 shows that my hard drive has enough room
to store 607 minutes and 21 seconds of video using my current quality
settings. It’s usually safe to just leave this number alone unless you
want Pinnacle to automatically stop capturing after a certain amount of
time. For example, if I know that I want to capture only the first 5 min-
utes, I can enter 5 in the minutes field and 0 in the seconds field. Then I
can go and get a cup of coffee or do something else without having to
hurry back to manually stop capturing at some point. Pinnacle automat-
ically stops capturing after 5 minutes have elapsed.
7. Click the Start Capture button.
Studio automatically starts playing your camcorder and capturing video.
8. When you want to stop capturing, click the Stop Capture button or
press Esc.
As Studio captures your video, keep an eye on the Preview window, even if
you have disabled on-screen preview in the capture settings. The Frames
Dropped field should remain at 0. Dropped frames are a serious quality
problem, but they can often be resolved. If you drop some frames, see the
section “Frames drop out during capture,” later in this chapter.

Capturing video in Apple iMovie
Apple’s iMovie doesn’t offer quite as many capture options as Pinnacle
Studio, but the capture process is simple and effective nonetheless. In fact,
you can set just two capture options. To adjust capture preferences, choose
iMovie➪Preferences. The Preferences dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 6-10. The two options that relate to video capture are as follows:
✦New Clips Go To: This default setting sends incoming clips to the Clips
Pane. This is the best place to send new clips, unless you want to quickly
convert your imported video into a movie without any editing. What’s
the fun in that?
✦Automatically Start New Clip at Scene Break: iMovie automatically rec-
ognizes when one scene ends and a new one begins. This useful feature
often makes editing easier, so I recommend that you leave this check box
selected.
The iMovie interface is simple and easy to use. To capture video, follow
these steps:
1. Connect your camcorder to the FireWire port (as described in the sec-
tion “Connecting a digital camcorder to your computer,” earlier in this
chapter).
2. Switch the camera to VTR mode.
3. In iMovie, click the Camera button to switch iMovie to the Camera
mode.
The Preview pane displays the message Camera Connected, as shown in
Figure 6-11.
4. Use the camera controls to identify a portion of video that you want
to capture.
When you are ready, rewind the tape about 10 seconds before the point
at which you want to start capturing.
5. Click the Play button in the camera controls.

Troubleshooting Capture Problems
Video capture usually works pretty easily and efficiently with modern hard-
ware, but some problems can still occur. Here’s a quick tour of some
common digital-capture problems — and their potential solutions.
You can’t control your camera through
your capture software
When you click the Play or Rewind button on the camera controls in your
video-capture software, your digital camcorder should respond. If not, check
the following items:
✦Check all the obvious things first: Are the cables connected properly?
Is your camcorder turned on to VTR mode? Does the camera have a
dead battery?

✦Did the camera automatically power down due to inactivity? If so, check
the camera’s documentation to see whether you can temporarily disable
the power-saver mode. Also, consider plugging the camera in to a charger
or AC power adapter so that you aren’t just running on battery juice.
✦Is your FireWire card installed correctly? Open the System icon in the
Performance and Maintenance section of the Windows Control Panel.
Click the Hardware tab, and then click the Device Manager button. If you
see a yellow exclamation mark under IEEE 1394 Bus host controllers,
you have a hardware problem.
✦Is your camcorder supported? Most modern digital camcorders are
supported by Apple iMovie, Pinnacle Studio, Windows Movie Maker,
and other programs. But if the software just doesn’t seem to recognize
the camera, check the software vendor’s Web site (www.apple.com,
www.pinnaclesys.com, or www.microsoft.com, respectively) for camera
compatibility information. If your camera is so new that it wasn’t origi-
nally supported by your editing software, check the publisher’s Web
site to see whether software updates are available to accommodate
newer camcorder models.
Frames drop out during capture
Video usually captures about 30 frames per second, but if the capture
process doesn’t go smoothly, some of those frames could get missed or
dropped, as video pros call it. Dropped frames show up as jerky video and
cause all kinds of other editing problems, and they usually point an accus-
ing finger at your hardware, for one of the following reasons:
✦Your computer isn’t fast enough. Does your computer meet the soft-
ware’s system requirements? How fast is the processor? Does it have
enough RAM?
✦Your computer isn’t operating efficiently. Make sure that all unnecessary
programs are closed, as I describe in the section “Turning off unnecessary
programs,” earlier in this chapter. You may also be able to tweak your
computer’s settings for better video-capture performance. Check out the
OS Tweaks in the Tech Support section of www.videoguys.com for tips
and tricks to help your computer make the best use of its resources.
✦You left programs running. Make sure that your e-mail program,
Internet browser, music jukebox, and other programs are closed. You
should also disable your Internet connection during video capture, even
if you have a broadband (cable modem or DSL) connection. When your
connection is active, you probably have a few utilities running in the
background that are looking for software updates to your operating
system and other programs. A well-meaning message that updates are
available for download can appear right in the middle of video capture,
causing dropped frames.
✦Your hard drive can’t handle the data rate. Does your hard drive meet
your software’s performance requirements? If so, maybe some hard-drive
maintenance is in order. Remember, the more stuff that is packed onto
your hard drive, the slower it will be. This is one reason that I recommend
(pretty often, in fact) that you multiply the amount of space you think you’ll
need by 4.
422

Capturing Analog Video? Yuck!
To keep your hard drive working efficiently and quickly, defragment
your hard drive periodically (at least once a month). In Windows, choose
Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk Defragmenter.
On a Mac, you need to obtain a third-party disk-maintenance tool such
as Norton Disk Doctor.
If you’re using Pinnacle Studio, you can use that software to test your hard
drive’s data rate. In Studio, choose Setup➪Capture Source. In the Setup
Options dialog box that appears, click the Test Data Rate button. Studio
tests your data rate and lists the read, write, and Max safe speeds. The Max
safe speed is a speed that Studio determines is necessary for glitch-free
video capture. For DV-format video, the Max safe speed should be at least
4000 kilobytes per second.
Capture stops unexpectedly
If the capture process stops before you want it to, your culprit could be a
mechanical glitch. Check the following items:
✦Did you forget to rewind the camcorder tape? This is a classic “oops”
that happens to nearly everyone sooner or later.
✦Is your hard drive full? This is bad juju, by the way. Try to avoid filling
your hard drive at all costs.
✦Is there a timecode break on the tape? Inconsistent timecode on a digi-
tal videotape can create all sorts of havoc when software tries to cap-
ture video.
✦Did Fluffy or Junior step on the Esc key? It happens. My cat has fouled
more than one capture process. (Hey, biomechanical still counts as
“mechanical,” right?)
Capturing Analog Video? Yuck!
After all this talk about how great digital video is, you may be wondering
why I devote an entire section to analog video. Most people assume that
digital video is the new hotness and that analog video is just old and stinky.
Analog video is old and stinky, but you may still have some really good old
video footage on analog tapes. Your daughter in middle school isn’t going to
be taking those first baby steps again, so if you have those steps on analog,
you probably need to have a way to convert it to digital. If you have or used
to have a VHS, VHS-C, S-VHS, 8mm, or Hi-8 camcorder, you can still capture
video that was shot with those cameras into your computer. You can then
edit it, put it online, or even burn it on a DVD. All you need is the right hard-
ware. This section shows you how to use ye olde analog video with your
brand new (or even not-so-new) computer.
Preparing for analog video capture
Earlier in this chapter, I show you how to capture digital video into your
computer. If you have the right hardware — a digital camcorder and a
423

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
FireWire port — digital video is really easy to work with. Analog video can
also be easy to capture if you have the right hardware. The next few sections
help you prepare to capture analog video into your computer.
Unlike digital video, analog video is not compatible with computers. This is
because all the data that computers work with is digital. Before you can use
analog video in your computer, it must be converted to digital format, or be
digitized. Analog video-capture hardware digitizes the video as it is captured.
Getting your computer ready to capture analog video is a lot like getting
ready to capture digital video. Before you can capture analog video, you
have to do the following things:
✦Set up your capture hardware. I show you what hardware you need
and how to set it up in the following section.
✦Turn off unnecessary programs. Whether you’re working with analog
or digital video, your computer works more efficiently if you close all pro-
grams that are not needed for the capture process (as I demonstrate in
the cleverly named section “Turning off unnecessary programs,” earlier
in this chapter).
✦Make sure that you have enough free space on your hard drive. Five
minutes of digital video uses about 1GB of hard-drive space. Unfortunately,
no single, simple formula exists for figuring out how much space your
analog video will require.
Digital video that was recorded with a MiniDV, MicroMV, or Digital8 cam-
corder uses the DV codec, which uses a steady 200 megabytes per
minute of video. A codec (that’s short for compressor/decompressor) is
the software scheme that’s used to compress video so that it fits reason-
ably on your computer. Some analog-capture devices let you choose
from a list of different codecs to use during video capture; many codecs
have settings that you can adjust. The codec that you use (and the set-
tings that you select) can greatly affect both the quality of your capture
video and the amount of space that it consumes on your hard drive. I
show you how to adjust capture settings in the section “Adjusting
analog video-capture settings in Studio,” (another clever name!) later in
this chapter.
Fortunately, most analog video-capture programs make it pretty easy to
determine whether you have enough hard drive space. The Pinnacle
Studio capture window, for example, shows you exactly how much free
space is available on your hard drive, and it gives you an estimate of
how much video you can capture using the current settings.
You need to leave some free space on your hard drive to ensure that your
video-editing software and operating system can still work efficiently.
Setting up capture hardware
Before you can capture analog video, you need to have some way to con-
nect your VCR or analog camcorder to your computer. To do so, you have
two basic options. You can either use an analog-capture card or an external
video converter. I describe each option in the next two sections.
424

Book II
Chapter 6
Importing Video Clips
Capturing Analog Video? Yuck!
Using a capture card
The best quality in analog video capture is available if you use a special
video-capture card. Analog-capture cards are available at many computer
and electronics retailers. A capture card connects to the motherboard
inside your computer — so installation requires some expertise in working
with computer hardware. Also, make sure that your computer has room to
add an expansion card.
If you buy a capture card, make sure that it can capture analog video. Many
FireWire cards are marketed as digital-video capture cards, but if you don’t
read the packaging carefully, you may be confused about the card’s capabil-
ities. If a FireWire card doesn’t specifically say that it can also capture analog
video, assume that it can’t. Your analog capture card is likely to use an exter-
nal breakout box, with analog connectors for capturing analog video. Most
analog-capture cards have breakout boxes because enough room isn’t usually
available on the back of a narrow expansion card for all the necessary analog
connectors.
If you decide to buy and install an analog-capture card in your computer,
you should use the software that came with the card when you’re ready to
capture. A capture card normally comes with software that is optimized for
that card.
After you have a capture card installed in your computer, all you need to do
is connect your VCR or analog camcorder to the appropriate ports. Those
ports are usually located on an external breakout box. You will probably
have to choose from among the following kinds of connectors:
✦Composite: Composite connectors — the most common type — are
often used to connect video components in a home entertainment
system. Composite connectors may also be called RCA jacks and use
only one connector for the video signal. A composite video connector is
usually color-coded yellow. Red and white composite connectors are for
audio. Make sure that you connect all three.
✦S-Video: S-Video connectors are found on many higher-quality analog
camcorders as well as S-VHS VCRs. S-Video provides a higher-quality
picture, so use it if it’s available as an option. The S-Video connector
only carries video, so you still need to use the red and white audio con-
nectors for sound.
✦Component: Component video connectors often look like composite
connectors, but the video image is separated over three connectors
that are color-coded red, green, and blue. The red cable is sometimes
also labeled R-Y and carries the red portion of the video image, minus
brightness information. The green cable (sometimes labeled Y) car-
ries brightness information. Video geeks like to say luminance instead
of brightness, but it means the same thing. The blue wire (sometimes
labeled B-Y) carried the blue portion of the image, minus brightness.
Component video provides a higher-quality video image, but it’s usually
found only on the most expensive, professional-grade video-capture
cards. Like S-Video, component connectors don’t carry audio, so you
still need to hook up the red and white audio cables.
425

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
When you’re done hooking everything up, you’ll probably have quite a rat’s
nest of cables. Your capture software can’t control your VCR or camcorder
through the analog cables, so you’ll have to manually press the Play button
on the device before you can start capturing in the software.
Using a video converter
Video converters are kind of neat because they don’t require you to break
out the tools and open your computer case. As their name implies, video
converters convert analog video to digital before it even gets inside your
computer. The converter has connectors for your analog VCR or camcorder,
and it connects to your computer via the FireWire port. Converters are
available at many electronics retailers for about $200. Common video con-
verters include the following:
✦Canopus ADVC-50: www.canopuscorp.com
✦Data Video DAC-100: www.datavideo-tek.com
✦Dazzle Hollywood DV Bridge: www.dazzle.com
All three of these video converters are compatible with both Macintosh and
Windows computers. Video converters pipe in video through a FireWire
port — so as far as your computer is concerned, you’re capturing digital
video. Capturing analog video with a video converter is just like capturing
digital video. The only difference is that you have to manually press the
Play button on your analog camcorder or VCR before you start to capture.
If you have a digital camcorder, you may be able to use it as a video converter
for analog video. Digital camcorders have analog connectors so that you can
connect them to a regular VCR. Connect a VCR to the camcorder, set up the
camcorder and your computer for digital capture, and push the Play button
on the VCR. If the video picture from the VCR appears on the capture-preview
screen on your computer, you can use this setup to capture analog video.
This should work without having to first record the video onto tape in your
digital camcorder. This means that using your camcorder as a converter
doesn’t cause increased wear on the camcorder. Alas, some camcorders
don’t allow analog input while a FireWire cable is plugged in. You have to
experiment with your own camera to find out whether this method works.
Capturing those analog clips
After you have your capture hardware set up and connected properly, you’re
ready to start capturing video. If you’re using an external video converter
that’s connected to your computer’s FireWire port, follow the instructions
for digital capture in the section “Capturing Digital Video,” earlier in this
chapter. The only difference is that you have to manually press the Play
button on the analog VCR or camcorder before you can start capturing.
Apple iMovie can’t capture video from an analog capture card. To capture
analog video in iMovie, you must use a video converter that’s connected to
your Mac’s FireWire port. Capturing video in this manner is just like captur-
ing digital video, as I demonstrate in the section “Capturing video in Apple
iMovie,” earlier in this chapter.
426

Chapter 6
Importing Video Clips
Capturing Analog Video? Yuck!
The exact procedure for capturing analog video varies; it depends on the
software that you’re using. Because I feature Pinnacle Studio throughout
this chapter, I show that program here for the sake of consistency. Begin by
opening Studio, and then choose View➪Capture. Studio’s capture window
appears, as shown in Figure 6-6. The next section shows you how to adjust
Studio’s settings to get ready for analog capture.
Adjusting analog video-capture settings in Studio
To make sure that Studio is ready to capture analog video instead of digital
video, click the Settings button at the bottom of the capture window. The
Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box appears. Click the Capture Source
tab to bring it to the front. On that tab, review the following settings (refer
to Figure 6-7):
✦Video: Choose your analog capture source in this menu. The choices in
the menu can vary, depending on the hardware that you have installed.
✦Audio: This menu should match the Video menu.
✦Capture preview: You should deselect this check box — selecting it
may cause dropped frames (that is, some video frames are missed
during the capture) on some computers.
✦Scene detection during video capture: This setting determines when a
new scene is created. For most purposes, I recommend selecting the
Automatic Based on Video Content check box for analog capture.
✦Data rate: This section tells you how fast your hard drive can read or
write. Click the Test Data Rate button to get a current speed estimate.
Ideally, both numbers should be higher than 10,000 kilobytes per
second for analog capture. If your system can’t reach that speed, see
the discussion on optimizing your hard drive in the section
“Defragmenting your hard drive,” earlier in this chapter.
If you have trouble with dropped frames when you capture analog video, try
disabling automatic scene detection by selecting the No Automatic Scene
Detection radio button. Scene detection uses some computer resources,
and it can cause some dropped frames if your computer isn’t fast enough.
When you’re done reviewing settings on the Capture Source tab, click the
OK button to close the Setup Options dialog box. You are almost ready to
begin capturing analog video. Like many analog video-capture programs,
Studio lets you fine-tune the audio and video that will be captured. Click the
buttons on either side of the capture controller to open the Video Input and
Audio Capture control panels. These control panels allow you to adjust
color, brightness, and audio levels of the incoming video.
On the Video Input control panel, first choose whether you’re going to cap-
ture video from the Composite or S-Video connectors using the radio but-
tons under Video Input. The Audio Capture control panel allows you to turn
audio capture on or off.
Now press the Play button on your VCR or camcorder to begin playing the
video that you plan to capture, but don’t start capturing it yet. As you play
the analog video, watch the picture in the preview screen in the upper-right
427

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
corner of the Studio program window. If you don’t like the picture quality,
you can use the brightness, contrast, sharpness, hue, and color saturation
sliders on the Video Input control panel to adjust the picture. Experiment a
bit with the settings to achieve the best result.
As you play your analog tape, you’ll probably notice that although you can
see the video picture in the preview window, you can’t hear the sound
through your computer’s speakers. That’s okay. Keep an eye on the audio
meters on the Audio Capture control panel. They should move up and down
as the movie plays. Ideally, most audio should be in the high green or low
yellow portion of the audio meters. Adjust the audio-level slider between
the meters if the levels seem too high or too low. If the audio seems biased
too much to the left or right, adjust the balance slider at the bottom of the
control panel.
If you’re lucky, the tape that you’re going to capture from has color bars and
a tone at the beginning or end. In that case, use the bars and tone to cali-
brate your video picture and sound. The tone is really handy because it’s a
standard 1-kHz tone that’s designed specifically for calibrating audio levels.
Adjust the audio-level slider so that both meters read just at the bottom of
the yellow zone.
When you’re done playing with the settings in the Video and Audio control
panels, stop the tape in your VCR or camcorder and rewind it to where you
want to begin capturing.
Capturing your analog video
Once all your settings are, uh, set, you’re ready to start capturing — finally! I
recommend that you rewind the tape in your VCR or camcorder to at least
15 seconds before the point at which you want to begin capturing. Then
follow these steps to capture an analog video source:
1. Click the Start Capture button at the bottom of the Studio capture
window.
2. Enter a descriptive name for the capture.
3. To automatically stop capturing after a certain period of time, enter
the maximum number of minutes and seconds for the capture.
4. Press the Play button on the VCR or camcorder.
5. Click the Start Capture button in the Capture Video dialog box.
The capture process begins, and you’ll notice that the green Start
Capture button changes to a red Stop Capture button. As Studio cap-
tures your video, keep an eye on the Frames Dropped field under the
preview window. If any frames are dropped, try to determine the cause
and then recapture the video. Common causes of dropped frames
include programs that are running in the background, power-saver
modes, or a hard drive that hasn’t been recently defragmented.
6. Click the Stop Capture button when you’re done capturing.
Studio reviews the video that has been captured and improves scene
detection if possible. When the process is done, the captured clips
appear in Studio’s clip album.

e often think of movies as a purely visual medium. As a result, over-
looking audio is easy. But most video and film professionals will tell
you that audio is almost as important as — if not more important than —
the visual picture. Those same pros will probably tell you that audiences
can forgive or ignore a few visual flaws, but poor-quality audio immediately
enhances the cheese factor of a movie. 
Movie sound is a pretty big subject, which is why I devote not one but two
chapters in this minibook to audio. This chapter helps you understand the
fundamentals of audio, and it helps you obtain and record better quality
audio. After you have some audio source material to work with, check out
Chapter 17 for more on working with audio during the shoot.
Understanding Audio
Consider how audio affects the feel of a video program. Honking car horns
on a busy street; crashing surf and calling seagulls at a beach; a howling
wolf on the moors — these sounds help us identify a place as quickly as our
eyes can, if not quicker. If a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes a
sound in your movie is worth a thousand pictures.
What is audio? Well, if I check my notes from high school science class, I get
the impression that audio is produced by sound waves moving through the
air. Human beings hear those sound waves when they make our eardrums
vibrate. The speed at which a sound makes the eardrum vibrate is the fre-
quency. Frequency is measured in kilohertz (kHz), and one kHz equals 1,000
vibrations per second. (You could say it really hertz when your eardrums
vibrate. I’m sorry, I should have avoided that one.) A lower-frequency
sound is perceived as a lower pitch or tone, and a higher-frequency sound
is perceived as a high pitch or tone. The volume or intensity of audio is
measured in decibels (dB).
Understanding sampling rates
For over a century, humans have been using analog devices (ranging from wax
cylinders to magnetic tapes) to record sound waves. As with video, digital
429

Part II: Action! Shooting Fun Footage
audio recordings are all the rage today. Because a digital recording can 
only contain specific values, it can only approximate a continuous wave 
of sound. A digital recording device must sample a sound many times per
second; the more samples per second, the more closely the recording
approximates the live sound (although a digital approximation of a “wave”
actually looks more like the stairs on an Aztec pyramid). The number of
samples per second is called the sampling rate. As you might expect, a
higher sampling rate provides better recording quality. CD audio typically
has a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz — that’s 44,100 samples per second — and
most digital camcorders can record at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. You will
work with the sampling rate when you adjust the settings on your cam-
corder, import audio into your computer, and export movie projects when
they’re done.
Delving into bit depth
Another term you’ll hear bandied about in audio editing is bit depth. The
quality of a digital audio recording is affected by the number of samples per
second, as well as by how much information each sample contains. The
amount of information that can be recorded per sample is the bit depth.
More bits per sample mean more information — and generally richer sound.
Many digital recorders and camcorders offer a choice between 12-bit and
16-bit audio; choose the 16-bit setting whenever possible. For some reason,
many digital camcorders come from the factory set to record 12-bit audio.
Using the lower setting doesn’t give you any advantage, so always check
your camcorder’s documentation and adjust the audio-recording bit depth
up to 16-bit if it isn’t there already.
Recording Audio
At some point, you’ll probably want to record some narration or other
sound to go along with your movie project. Recording great-quality audio is
no simple matter. You can get nearly pro-sounding results by following the
basic tips I provide in Book II, Chapter 4. The easiest way to record audio is
with a microphone connected to your computer, although some computers
can make a lot of noise with their whirring hard disks, spinning fans, and
buzzing monitors. The following sections show you how to record audio
using a microphone connected to the microphone jack on your computer.
Recording audio with your Macintosh
You can record audio directly in iMovie. In fact, if you have an iMac,
PowerBook, or newer iBook, your computer already has a built-in micro-
phone. It will work for very basic narration, but keep in mind that the 
built-in mic does not record studio-quality sound. If you have a better mic,
connect it to the computer’s external microphone jack. The following sec-
tions show you how to set up your microphone and record audio. 
430

Book II
Chapter 7
Importing Audio
Recording Audio
Setting up an external microphone
Some microphones can connect to the USB port on your Mac. A USB micro-
phone is easier to use because your Mac automatically recognizes it and
selects the USB mic as your primary recording source. If your external
microphone connects to the regular analog microphone jack — and your
Mac already has a built-in mic — you may find that iMovie doesn’t recog-
nize your external microphone. To correct this problem, you must adjust
the Sound settings within Mac OS X:
1. Open the System Preferences window by choosing Apple➪System
Preferences.
2. Click the Sound icon to open the Sound Preferences dialog box.
3. Click the Input tab to bring it to the front.
4. Click the External Microphone/Line In entry in the device list box.
5. Press Ô+Q to close the Sound Preferences dialog box and System
Preferences.
Your external microphone should now be configured for use in iMovie.
Recording in iMovie
After you decide which microphone to use and configure it as described in
the previous section, you’re ready to record audio using iMovie. As with
most tasks in iMovie, recording is pretty easy:
1. Open the project for which you want to record narration or other
sounds, and switch to the timeline view if you’re not there already.
If you don’t have a project yet and just want to record some audio,
that’s okay too.
2. If you’re working with a current movie project, move the play head to
the spot where you want to begin recording.
3. Click the Audio button above the timeline to open the audio pane
(shown in Figure 7-1).
4. Say a few words to test the audio levels.
As your microphone picks up sound, the audio meter in iMovie should
indicate the recording level. If the meter doesn’t move at all, your micro-
phone probably isn’t working. You’ll notice that as sound levels rise, the
meter changes from green to yellow and finally red. For best results, try
to keep the sound levels close to the yellow part of the meter.
If the audio levels are too low, the recording may have a lot of unwanted
noise relative to the recorded voice or sound. If levels are too high, the
audio recording could pop and sound distorted. Unfortunately, iMovie
doesn’t offer an audio level adjustment for audio you record, so you’ll
have to fine-tune levels the old fashioned way, by changing the distance
between the microphone and your subject. 
431

5. Click Record and begin your narration.
The movie project plays as you recite your narration.
6. When you’re done, click Stop.
An audio clip of your narration appears on the timeline.
Recording voice-over tracks in Pinnacle Studio
Recording audio in Windows is pretty easy. Most video-editing programs —
including Pinnacle Studio and Windows Movie Maker — give you the capa-
bility to record audio directly in the software. Before you can record audio,
however, your computer must have a sound card and a microphone. (If
your computer has speakers, it has a sound card.) The sound card should
have a connector for a microphone as well. Check the documentation for
your computer if you can’t find the microphone connector.
After your hardware is set up correctly, you’re ready to record audio in
Pinnacle Studio or most any other movie-making program. To record audio
in Studio, follow these steps:
1. Open the movie project for which you want to record audio, and
switch to the timeline view if you aren’t there already.
If you don’t have a project yet and just want to record some audio,
that’s okay too.

the spot where you want to begin recording.
3. Choose Toolbox➪Record Voice-over.
The voice-over recording studio appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
4. Say a few words to test the audio levels.
As your microphone picks up sound, the audio meter in Studio should
indicate the recording level. If the meter doesn’t move at all, your micro-
phone probably isn’t working. You’ll notice that as sound levels rise, the
meter changes from green to yellow and finally red. For best results, try
to keep the sound levels in or near the yellow part of the meter. You can
fine-tune the levels by adjusting the recording volume slider.
5. Click Record.
A visible three-second countdown appears in the recording-studio
window, giving you a couple of seconds to get ready.
6. When recording begins and your movie project starts to play, recite
your narration.
7. When you’re done, click Stop.
An audio clip of your narration appears on the timeline.

Working with CD Audio
If you’re even remotely interested in technology — and because you’re
reading this book, I’ll go out on a limb and guess that you are — you proba-
bly started upgrading your music collection to compact discs (CDs) many
years ago. At some point, you’ll probably want to use some of the music on
those CDs for your movie soundtracks. Most editing programs make it
pretty easy to use CD audio in your movie projects. The next few sections
show you how to use CD audio in Pinnacle Studio and iMovie.
Importing CD audio in iMovie
If you’re using Apple iMovie, you can take audio directly from your iTunes
library or import audio from an audio CD. Here’s the basic drill:
1. Put an audio CD in your CD-ROM drive, and then click the Audio
button above the timeline on the right side of the iMovie screen.
The audio pane appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
2. If iMovie Sound Effects are currently shown, open the pull-down
menu at the top of the audio pane and choose Audio CD. 
A list of audio tracks appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
3. Select a track and click the Play button in the audio pane to preview
the song.
4. Click the Place at Playhead button in the Audio panel to place the song
on the timeline, beginning at the current position of the play head.
434
Comprehending copyrights
As I show throughout this chapter, you can easily
import music into your computer for use in your
movies. The tricky part is obtaining the rights to use
that music legally. Realistically, if you’re making a
video of your daughter’s birthday party, and you
plan to share that video with only a grandparent or
two, Kool and the Gang probably don’t care if you
use the song “Celebration” as a musical sound-
track. But if you start distributing that movie all over
the Internet — or (even worse) start selling it —
you could have a problem that involves the band,
the record company, and lots and lots of lawyers.
The key to using music legally is licensing. You
can license the right to use just about any music you
want, but it can get expensive. Licensing “Celebra-
tion” for your movie project (for example) could cost
hundreds of dollars or more. Fortunately, more
affordable alternatives exist. Numerous companies
offer CDs and online libraries of stock audio and
music, which you can license for as little as $30 or
$40. You can find these resources by searching the
Web for royalty free music or by visiting a site such
as www.royaltyfree.com or www.royalty
freemusic.com. You usually must pay a fee to
download or purchase the music initially, but after
you have purchased it, you can use the music
however you’d like. If you use audio from such a
resource, make sure you read the licensing agree-
ment carefully. Even though the music is called
“royalty free,” you still may be restricted on how
many copies you can distribute, how much money
you can charge, or what formats you can offer.
Another — more affordable — alternative may be
to use the stock audio that comes with some movie-
making software. Pinnacle Studio, for example,
comes with a tool called SmartSound that automat-
ically generates music in a variety of styles and
moods. Although you should always carefully review
the software license agreements to be sure, nor-
mally the audio that comes with moviemaking soft-
ware can be used in your movie projects free of
royalties.

Working with CD Audio
Importing CD audio in Studio
Pinnacle Studio provides an audio toolbox to help you work with CD audio
and other formats. To open the audio toolbox in Studio, place an audio CD
in your CD-ROM drive and choose Toolbox➪Add CD Music. You may be
asked to enter a title for the CD. The exact title doesn’t matter, as long as
it’s something you will be able to identify and remember later. The audio
toolbox then appears (see Figure 7-4), which enables you to perform a 
variety of actions:
✦Choose audio tracks from the CD by using the Track drop-down list. 
✦Use playback controls in the audio toolbox to preview audio tracks. 
✦Add only a portion of the audio clip to your movie by adjusting the in
point and out point markers. 
✦Add a track to the movie as a clip in the background music track at the
bottom of the timeline by clicking the Add to Movie button. The clip is
at the current position of the play head.
After you add a CD audio track to your movie project, play the project to
preview your addition. The first time you preview the movie with the CD
audio track added, Studio captures the required audio from the CD. If the
disc isn’t in the CD-ROM drive the first time you try to play the project,
Studio asks you to insert the disc before the process can continue.

Working with MP3 Audio
MP3 is one of the most common formats for sharing audio recordings today.
MP3 is short for MPEG Layer 3, and MPEG is short for Motion Picture Experts
Group, so really you can think of MP3 as an abbreviation of an abbreviation.
I’m sure that in a few years an MP3 file will simply be called an M or P (or
maybe even a 3) file — but whatever their collective nickname, MP3 audio
files are likely to remain popular. The MP3 file format makes for very small
files — you can easily store a lot of music on a hard drive or CD — and
those files are easy to transfer over the Internet.
Who am I kidding? You probably already know all about MP3 files. You might
even have some MP3 files already stored on your computer. If so, using those
MP3 files for background music in your movie projects is really easy:
✦In iMovie: Pull MP3 files directly from your iTunes library into iMovie,
using the procedure described earlier in this chapter for importing CD
audio. Simply choose iTunes from the pull-down menu at the top of the
audio pane.
✦In Studio: Choose Album➪Sound Effects to show the sound-effects
album. Click the folder icon and browse to the folder on your hard drive
that contains the MP3 files you want to use (as shown in Figure 7-5).
When a list of MP3 files appears in the album, simply drag and drop the
desired files on the background music track of your timeline.

Importing Audio
Working with MP3 Audio
Storing audio on your hard disk is handy because the audio will be easier to
plop into your movie projects. MP3 is a great format to use because the
audio sounds about as good as CD audio, but it takes up a lot less storage
space. If you’re not sure how to copy music from audio CDs onto your hard
disk in MP3 format — the process of converting audio to the MP3 format is
often called encoding or ripping — check out the next two sections. 
Ripping MP3 files on a Mac
The process of turning an audio file into an MP3 file is sometimes called rip-
ping or encoding. Apple has thoughtfully provided the capability to create
MP3 files with its free audio-library-and-player program, iTunes (now avail-
able on both Mac OS X and Windows). To download the latest version of
iTunes, visit www.apple.com/itunes/ and follow the instructions there. After
iTunes is installed on your computer, copying audio onto your hard drive in
MP3 format is quite simple:
1. Insert an audio CD into your CD-ROM drive.
2. If iTunes doesn’t launch automatically, open the program using the
Dock or your Applications folder. 
3. With the iTunes program window active (as shown in Figure 7-6),
choose iTunes➪Preferences.
The iTunes Preferences dialog box opens.

4. Click the Importing button at the top of the Preferences dialog box.
5. Make sure that MP3 Encoder is selected in the Import Using menu
and then click OK.
The iTunes Preferences dialog box closes, and you return to the main
iTunes window.
6. Place check marks next to the songs you want to import.
You can use the playback controls in the upper-left corner of the iTunes
window to preview tracks. In Figure 7-6, for example, I have chosen
three tracks to import.
7. Click Import in the upper-right corner of the iTunes window.
The songs are imported; the process may take several minutes. When
it’s done, the imported songs are available through your iTunes library
for use in iMovie projects.
Ripping MP3 files in Windows
The process of turning audio files into MP3 files is sometimes called encoding
or ripping. Microsoft provides a free audio-player program called Windows
Media Player — WMP for short. It comes with Windows, and you can down-
load the latest version from www.windowsmedia.com. WMP allows you to
copy music from audio CDs to your hard drive in a high-quality (yet com-
pact) format. Unfortunately, as delivered, WMP does not rip files in MP3
format. Instead, it uses the Windows Media Audio (WMA) format.
Windows Media files are about as small as MP3 files, but it’s a proprietary
format: Most video-editing programs can’t import WMA files directly. If you
want to import music from CDs into a Studio movie project, it’s better to
copy the music directly from within Studio, as described earlier in this
chapter. 
Figure 7-6:

Book II
Chapter 7
Importing Audio
Working with MP3 Audio
If you really want to be able to copy music onto your hard drive in MP3
format, you can use iTunes for Windows — or, you can pick up a commercially
available MP3 encoding program. Such programs are available at most elec-
tronics stores, and you can also download software from Web sites such as
www.tucows.com. 
For example, if iTunes isn’t handy, I use a tool called Musicmatch Jukebox
from Musicmatch (www.musicmatch.com), shown in Figure 7-7. The Basic ver-
sion of Jukebox is still free — what a bargain! — and allows you to encode
MP3 files.

CHECK IT OUT
Connecting a Tape Player to Your Computer
If you’ve recorded audio onto an audio tape, you
can connect the tape player directly to your com-
puter and record from it just as if you were
recording from a microphone. Just follow these
steps:
1.
Buy a patch cable (available at almost
any electronics store) with two male
mini-jacks (standard small audio connec-
tors used by most current headphones,
microphones, and computer speakers).
2.
Connect one end of the patch cable to the
headphone jack on the tape player and
connect the other end to your computer’s
microphone jack.
The key, of course, is to have the right kind
of cable. You can even buy cables that
allow you to connect an old record player
to your computer and record audio from
your LPs.
3.
Record audio from the tape using the
same steps described in the sections in
this chapter on microphone recording.
You have to coordinate your fingers so
that you press Play on the tape player and
click Record in the recording software at
about the same time. If the recording
levels are too high or too low, adjust the
volume control on the tape player.

A
ll too often, things in this world are chosen simply by their price — and
hey, I can understand that completely. After all, I have a die-cast model
of a $150,000 Aston Martin Vanquish V12 sitting on my desk instead of the
real thing in my garage. I opted for a slightly less expensive Jeep instead.
Just a few short years ago, video-editing software was another good example
of price-tag envy — you either shelled out $5,000 (or more) for a professional-
level package, or you sat helplessly on the edge of your computer chair and
wished you had the money. After all, DV camcorders were expensive too, and
you had to be a Mensa member to handle the countless controls and settings
in a video editor. So, why even bother?
Then, friends, we were liberated by an application with a funny-sounding
name — iMovie — and suddenly nothing was the same. iMovie was cheap, it
was easy to use, and it produced a quality movie that you weren’t ashamed
to show to others. (Thanks, Steve — and all the rest of the good folks at
Cupertino — we all owe you one.) Sudden demand from normal human
beings forced down the price of DV camcorders . . . and the rest, as they
say, is history.
In this chapter, I introduce you to four modern video editors (starting with
iMovie) and list the pros and cons of each. The first two qualify as truly
inexpensive, ranging in price from free — say that with me, free — to
around $100. The last two will set you back a little more (up to $1,000), but
they’re filled with enough powerful state-of-the-art features to satisfy most
video-editing professionals, and they run on today’s PCs and Macs.
Sure, you can still spend $5,000 on a dedicated video-editing system . . . but
not me, pardner.
Making the Smart Choice
Although I don’t have the room in this short chapter to fully describe every
detail in each of these editors, I think most computer owners who want to
start editing video will make a final decision on what application to use (or
buy) based on four criteria:
441

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
✦Price: There I go again, but price is indeed the primary limiting factor. (I
bet you don’t drive an Aston Martin either.)
✦Ease-of-use: How do I make it go? Even the higher-priced editors in this
chapter have received at least one facelift to make sure they’re more
user-friendly.
✦Platform: All of these editors are limited to either PC or Mac.
✦Power-user features: What can you do with an editor after you’ve mas-
tered the basics? Naturally, the high-end entries will be chock-full of
toys for advanced users, but I think you’ll be surprised at just how capa-
ble a $100 video-editing program can be.
Therefore, in this chapter, I address each of these issues for each applica-
tion and provide one author’s opinion as well.
I encourage you to read further reviews on the Web and within your favorite
computer and video print magazines before you make your choice. Each
of these programs is well supported on its home turf with descriptions,
screenshots, and the occasional tutorial, so take advantage of this informa-
tion and read before you buy.
It Began with iMovie
Apple’s iMovie still turns heads, even though it now has competition from
other low-end editors. Take a gander at Figure 8-1, and you’ll see why — you
can understand what’s going on.

Book II
Chapter 8
Choosing Your 
Video-Editing Software
It Began with iMovie
Here’s the rundown:
✦Price: If you’re considering a new Macintosh or you’ve just bought one,
I encourage you to dance the Superiority Jig for a moment or two —
iMovie is bundled free with new Macs as part of the iLife suite. (If you
didn’t get iMovie with your Mac or you want the latest version, you can
pick up a copy of iLife ’04 for around $50 at www.apple.com. That’s prac-
tically free, and you get copies of iTunes, iDVD, GarageBand, and iPhoto
as well.)
✦Ease-of-use: iMovie is drag-and-drop heaven. I think it’s safe to say that,
of all the editors I describe in this chapter, iMovie is the easiest to use.
Everything happens in one window, and iMovie is integrated with iTunes
and iPhoto, allowing you to easily choose material from your music
library and digital photograph collection to include with your video.
You can capture directly from your DV camcorder, too.
✦Platform: It’s designed for Mac only, so PC owners will have to look
elsewhere — perhaps the latest version of Windows Movie Maker, which
is bundled for free with Windows XP (for more information, visit
www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/moviemaker).
✦Power-user features: iMovie includes the now-infamous Ken Burns
Effect, which lets you pan and zoom to add motion to still photos. If you
export your finished film to QuickTime (Apple’s multimedia player and
conversion utility), you can convert it into dozens of different file for-
mats so that you can offer clips on your Web site or import them into a
Windows video application. Within iMovie, iDVD is just a button away
for adding chapter markers and burning your new creation to disc. The
latest version of iMovie 4 allows you to edit multiple clips at once, and
you can set alignment guides to ensure that your audio tracks and video
clips are synchronized. Plug-ins are available from a wide range of third-
party vendors, so you can expand your system with new titles, effects,
and transitions.
Folks using iMovie 4 can take advantage of professional-quality audio effects
provided by Skywalker Sound, as shown in Figure 8-2. Perhaps this same
sound has shown up in one of those little-known films by George Lucas. I
can’t think of any right now, but he’s done some good work.
On the downside, iMovie doesn’t come with a bushel basket full of transitions
and effects, and it’s not the speediest performer when rendering effects or
converting video. However, iMovie is easy enough for your kids to use, and I
highly recommend it to any Mac owner who’s never dabbled in digital video.
(If you’re willing to spend $300, you can graduate to Final Cut Express 2, the
baby brother of Final Cut Pro HD. It addresses the performance shortcomings
of iMovie, but the learning curve is much steeper.)
For a more in-depth look at iMovie, iDVD, and QuickTime, pick up a copy of
Mac OS X Panther All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, written by Mark
L. Chambers (published by Wiley). The book includes chapters devoted to
each of these applications.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Studio Fits Like a Glove
Figure 8-3 illustrates Pinnacle Studio 9, from Pinnacle Systems (www.
pinnaclesys.com). This video-editing software is a step above iMovie in 
features, while maintaining a more intuitive menu system and control
layout than “the big boys.”
Here’s the rundown:
✦Price: Studio 9 runs a clean $100 from the Pinnacle Systems Web store.
(Because most PCs still don’t come with a FireWire port, Pinnacle Systems
also sells a number of different kits that bundle Studio 9 and a FireWire
PCI adapter card, allowing you to install FireWire on your PC.)
✦Ease-of-use: Although the Studio window is a bit more complex
than iMovie, the essential Timeline display and clip library remain 
recognizable, and I like the streamlined, tabbed Capture/Edit/Make
Movie interface — it’s a 1-2-3 approach to editing.
✦Platform: It runs under Windows 98SE/Me/2000 and Windows XP only.
✦Power-user features: Studio offers widescreen video support, as well
as voiceover narration. You can create movies with surround sound,
and Studio includes a noise-reduction audio tool. (If you’ve got a shaky
camera hand, the Image Stabilization enhancement feature comes in
quite handy, too.) Both audio and video plug-ins are supported (see
Figure 8-4). Studio offers a great range of output, too: You can send your
completed film back to your DV camcorder, create an AVI/MPEG/Windows

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
All is not perfect, however: Studio has suffered from more than its share of
software bugs in past versions, and Studio 9 is no exception. (Make sure
you update your copy immediately with the latest patch as soon as you
install it, and I recommend running Studio 9 only on a PC that exceeds the
minimum requirements specified by Pinnacle Systems.) Like iMovie, render-
ing is slower than it should be, and the Timeline display and controls are
somewhat quirky.
Prosumers Prefer Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro has been around for many years now, but the rather
steep price tag and its hardware requirements have made it less appealing
to entry-level digital filmmakers.
Here’s a rundown of the big four criteria:
✦Price: You’ll drop $700 on Premiere Pro 1.5.
✦Ease-of-use: The program’s tabbed windows and plethora of toolbars
simply scream “Photoshop” to everyone who sees them, so expect a far
steeper learning curve than either of the previous two editors.
✦Platform: It runs under Windows XP only.
✦Power-user features: The latest version of Premiere Pro includes —
insert drum roll here — HD (high-definition) video support, as well as
project management tools and automatic video color adjustment. Not
only can you use the built-in filters and effects, but you can also use
standard Premiere plug-ins and even your Adobe After Effects plug-ins.
Oh, did I mention that your effects are rendered in real time? (That
means no waiting!) This is a professional-grade video editor, and the
tools you get reflect that.
Other than the price and learning curve, most entry-level video-editing
junkies will pale at the hardware required to run Premiere Pro. I recommend
nothing less than the most powerful Pentium 4 you can afford, with a bare
minimum of 512MB of memory and at least 120GB of EIDE hard drive terri-
tory (or serial ATA hard drive space, if you can afford it). Invest the time
and money in Premiere Pro only if you’re a serious amateur, or if you’re
working on professional-quality video projects. ’Nuff said.
Care to find out more about Premiere before you buy? Chapter 11 of Book II
gives you just a tiny taste of what you can do with this powerful editor. If
that taste whets your appetite for more, I recommend a copy of Adobe
Premiere Pro For Dummies by Keith Underdahl (published by Wiley). It’s a
wise investment that will help you decide if you need all that power.
All Hail Final Cut Pro HD
Ask professional Hollywood and TV video editors about their choice of soft-
ware, and you’ve got a better-than-even shot of hearing all about Apple’s
Final Cut Pro, shown in Figure 8-5. Final Cut Pro HD is generally considered
446

Book II
Chapter 8
Choosing Your 
Video-Editing Software
All Hail Final Cut Pro HD
the best video-editing package that doesn’t require dedicated hardware.
But, like Premiere Pro, you pay the price in dollars and hardware, so only
the serious need apply.
Here’s the summation:
✦Price: Apple charges a cool $1,000.
✦Ease-of-use: This application sports a face only a professional video
editor could love, with multiple windows, mixers, and color gadgets
hidden everywhere (which, of course, you can fully customize and con-
figure). Like Premiere Pro, you’re going to need time to absorb it.
✦Platform: Another Mac-only application.
✦Power-user features: Where to begin? The HD at the end of the name
means high-definition video support, as well as real-time rendering to
speed things up. You get Soundtrack, a separate application that can
create royalty-free soundtracks for your movies, and Cinema Tools to
help you track the progress of your film project. You’ll get the best
broadcast-quality video compression support in this price range, and
Apple is especially fond of LiveFonts, the animated font system for titles.
What I wrote earlier about Premiere Pro goes double for Final Cut Pro HD: I
wouldn’t even consider using this software on anything less than a Power
Mac G5 with 1GB worth of memory, and expect to spend days poking
around the menu system and dialogs before you even get an idea where
most of the settings are hidden. Final Cut Pro HD is used to create many of
today’s Hollywood classics — and it is not (repeat, not) for the faint of heart
or the casual filmmaker.

y themselves, digital video cameras aren’t that big of a deal. Sure, 
digital camcorders offer higher quality, but the video quality of analog
Hi8 camcorders really wasn’t too bad. Digital video doesn’t suffer from 
generational loss (where some video quality is lost each time the video is
copied or even played) like analog video does, but again, this isn’t some-
thing that should motivate millions of people to instantly trash their old
analog camcorders.
But video editing . . . now, that’s cool. Until recently, high-quality video pro-
ductions with special effects, on-screen titles, and fancy transitions between
scenes were magical productions made by pros using equipment that cost
hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars. But thanks to the dual
revolutions of digital camcorders and powerful personal computers, all you
need for pro-quality video production is a computer, a digital camcorder, a
little cable to connect them, and some software. Within just a few mouse
clicks, you’ll be making movie magic!
Starting a New Project
Your first step in working on any movie project is to actually create the new
project. This step is pretty easy. In fact, when you launch your video-editing
program, it usually starts with a new, empty project. But if you need to create
a new project or you just want to be sure that you’re starting from a clean
slate, choose File➪New Project. Regardless of whether you’re using Apple
iMovie, Pinnacle Studio, or almost any other video-editing program, a new,
empty project window should appear.
After you have a new project started, your first step is generally to capture
(from a video source like a camcorder) or import some video (from existing
files on your hard drive) so that you have something to edit. If you have
some video to import, see Chapter 6 of Book II for information on how to do
that. Captured video appears as clips in the clips pane (in iMovie) or the
Album (in Studio), where it is ready to use in your movies.
If you plan to use clips from your PC’s hard drive, you can import them into
Pinnacle Studio by following these steps:
449

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
1. Click the Edit view mode tab or choose View➪Edit to ensure that
you’re in Edit mode.
If this is the first time that you’ve used Studio, you’ll probably see the

2. Click the Select Video Files button in the clip browser, as shown in
Figure 9-1.
The generic Open File window, which is common to virtually all
Windows programs, appears.
3. Browse to the folder that contains your clips.
4. Choose the desired file, and click the Open button.
The file is imported — life is good!
If you’re using a Mac, import clips into iMovie by following these steps:

The generic Open File dialog box, which is common to virtually all Mac
OS X programs, appears.
2. Browse to the folder that contains the desired clips.

Basic Video Editing
Working with Clips
If you’re using Apple iMovie, you need version 3 or higher to import
QuickTime-format video files.
After you have imported the clips, I recommend that you save and name the
project by choosing File➪Save Project. Saving early is important because it
preserves your work and is also required before you can perform certain
editing tasks later on.
Working with Clips
As you make movies, you’ll quickly find that clip is the basic denomination
of the media that you work with. You’ll spend a lot of time with video clips,
audio clips, and even still clips (you know, those things that used to be
called “pictures” or “photos”).
A still clip usually consists of a single picture, an audio clip usually consists
of a single song or sound effect, and a video clip usually consists of a single
scene. A scene most often starts when you press the Record button on your
camcorder and ends when you press the Record button again, even if only for
a second. When you import video from your camcorder, most video-editing
programs automatically detect these scenes and create individual clips for
you. As you edit and create your movies, you’ll find this feature incredibly
useful.
Organizing clips
Virtually all video-editing software stores clips in a grid-like area called a
clip browser or album. Apple iMovie and Pinnacle Studio further subdivide
clips by content. Each program has separate browser panels for video clips,
audio clips, and still images. In Studio, you can access these panels by using
tabs along the left side of the clip browser or album, as it is called in
Pinnacle’s documentation. In iMovie (see Figure 9-2), you can access the
panels by using buttons at the bottom of the clip browser or pane, as
Apple’s documentation calls it.
The clip browser doesn’t just store your clips, it also tells you some impor-
tant information about them. One of the most important bits of info is the
length of the clip. If you’ve already imported clips, you notice a set of
numerals (like 19.04) next to each scene. This tells you that the clip is 19
seconds and 4 frames long. If you don’t see names or lengths listed next to
clips in the Studio clip browser, choose Album➪Details View. This should
change the browser view so that it looks more like that shown in Figure 9-3.
A video image is actually made up of a series of still images that flash by so
quickly that they create the illusion of motion. These still images are called
frames. Video usually has about 30 frames per second.
The clip also has a name, of course, and you can change the name if you
want. If, for example, you think that “Starship” would be a more descriptive
name than “Scene 5,” click the clip once, wait a second, and then click the
clip’s name once again. You can then type a new name. When you’re done
typing a new name, just press Enter or click in an empty part of the screen.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
If you have a lot of clips in the browser, they may not all fit on one screen. In
iMovie, simply scroll down (using the scroll bar on the right) to see more
clips. In Pinnacle Studio, you can select different groups of clips from the
menu at the top of the browser. If there are too many clips in a group to fit
on a single page all at once, you can click the arrows (as shown in Figure 9-3)
to view additional pages.

Chapter 9
Basic Video Editing
Working with Clips
In iMovie’s clip browser, you can manually rearrange clips by dragging them
to new empty blocks in the grid. You can move the clips wherever you want.
This handy feature allows you to sort clips on your own terms, rather than
just having them listed alphabetically or in some arbitrary order.
Previewing clips
As you gaze at the clips in your clip browser, notice that a thumbnail image
is shown for each clip. This thumbnail usually shows the first frame of the
clip. Although the thumbnail may suggest the clip’s basic content, you don’t
really know exactly what the clip contains until you preview the whole
thing. Previewing a clip is easy: Just click your chosen clip in the browser,
and then click the Play button in the playback controls of your software’s
preview window.
As the clip plays, notice that the play head under the preview window
moves. You can move to any portion of a clip by clicking and dragging the
play head with the mouse. Figure 9-4 shows Studio’s preview window and
playback controls.
As you preview clips and identify portions that you want to use in your
movies, you’ll find that precise, frame-by-frame control of the play head is
crucial. The best way to get that precision is to use keyboard buttons
instead of the mouse. Table 9-1 lists important keyboard controls for three
popular video-editing programs. If you’re using different editing software,
check the manufacturer’s documentation for keyboard controls.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Some controls are fairly standardized across many video-editing applica-
tions. In fact, the spacebar also controls the Play/Stop/Pause function in
professional-grade video editors like Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple Final
Cut Pro HD.
If you don’t like using the keyboard to move to just the right frame, you may
want to invest in a multimedia controller, such as the SpaceShuttle A/V from
Contour A/V Solutions (www.contouravs.com). This device connects to your
computer’s USB port and features a knob and dial that you can use to pre-
cisely control video playback. Using the SpaceShuttle A/V is so much easier
than using the mouse or keyboard, you’ll wonder how you ever got by with-
out one!
Trimming out the unwanted parts
Professional Hollywood moviemakers typically shoot hundreds of hours of
footage just to get enough acceptable material for a 2-hour feature film.
Because the pros shoot a lot of “waste” footage, don’t feel so bad if every
single frame of video that you shot isn’t totally perfect either. As you pre-
view your clips, you’re sure to find bits that you want to cut from the final
movie.
Consider a scene where the subject scratches his lip for a few moments at
the beginning of the clip, which would be fine, except that it kind of looks
like he is picking his nose. You can’t have that in the final movie. Besides,
the clip may be about 11 seconds long, and you really only need about 5
seconds or so.
The solution is to trim the clip to just the portion that you want. The easiest
way to trim a clip is to split it into smaller parts before you place it in your
movie project. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Open the clip that you want to trim by clicking it in the browser, and
move the play head to the exact spot where you want to split the clip.
Use the playback controls in the preview window to move the play
head. Table 9-1 lists some keyboard shortcuts to help you move the play
head more precisely.
2. In Pinnacle Studio, right-click the clip in the browser and choose Split
Scene from the menu that appears. In Apple iMovie, choose Edit➪
Split Video Clip at Playhead.
You now have two clips, where before you had only one.
3. To split the second clip again, choose the second clip by clicking it in
the browser and move the play head about 5 seconds forward in the
clip.
4. Repeat Step 2 to split the clip again.
You now have three clips that were created from the one original clip (as
shown in Figure 9-5). Splitting clips like I’ve shown here isn’t the only way to
trim unwanted portions of video. You can also trim clips once they’re placed
on the timeline of your movie project (a process described in the section
“Trimming clips in the timeline,” later in this chapter). But splitting the clips
454

Working with Clips
before you add them to a project is often a much easier way to work because
the unwanted parts are split into separate clips that you can use (or not use)
as you want. In the next section, I show you how to add clips to the timeline
or storyboard of your editing program and start turning your clips into a
movie.

Understanding timecode
A video image is actually a series of still frames that
flash by rapidly on-screen. Every frame is uniquely
identified with a number called a timecode. All
stored locations and durations of all the edits that
you perform on a movie project use timecodes for
reference points, so a basic understanding of time-
code is important. You’ll see and use timecodes
almost every time you work in a video-editing pro-
gram like Pinnacle Studio or Apple iMovie.
Timecode is often expressed like this:
hours:minutes:seconds:frames
The 14th frame of the third second of the 28th minute
of the first hour of video is identified as follows:
01:28:03:13
You already know what hours, minutes, and sec-
onds are. Frames aren’t units of time measurement,
but rather the individual still images that make up
your video. The frame portion of the timecode starts
with zero (00) and counts up to a number that’s
determined by the frame rate of the video — hence,
01:28:03:13 for the 14th frame. In PAL video, frames
are counted from 00 to 24, because the frame rate
of PAL is 25 frames per second (fps). In NTSC,
frames are counted from 00 to 29.
“Wait!” you exclaim. “Zero to 29 adds up to 30,
not 29.97.”
You’re an observant one, aren’t you? The frame rate
of NTSC video is 29.97 fps. NTSC timecode skips the
frame codes 00 and 01 in the first second of every
minute, except for every tenth minute. Work it out
(you may use a calculator), and you see that this
system of reverse leap-frames adds up to 29.97 fps.
This is called a drop-frame timecode. In some video-
editing systems, drop-frame timecode is expressed
with semicolons (;) between the numbers instead
of colons (:). Therefore, in drop-frame timecode, the
14th frame of the third second of the 28th minute of
the first hour of video is identified as follows:
01;28;03;13
Why does NTSC video use drop-frame timecode?
Back when everything was broadcast in black and
white, NTSC video was an even 30 fps. For the con-
version to color, more bandwidth was needed in the
signal to broadcast color information. By dropping
a couple of frames every minute, enough room was
left in the signal to broadcast color information,
while at the same time keeping the video signals
compatible with older black-and-white TVs.
Although the punctuation (for example, colons or
semicolons) for separating the numerals of time-
code into hours, minutes, seconds, and frames is
fairly standardized, some video-editing programs
still go their own way. Pinnacle Studio, for example,
uses a decimal point between seconds and frames.
But regardless of whether the numbers are sepa-
rated by colons, decimals, or magic crystals, the
basic concept of timecode is the same.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Don’t worry! Trimming a clip doesn’t delete the unused portions from your
hard drive. When you trim a clip, you’re actually setting what the video
pros call in points and out points. The software uses virtual markers to
remember which portions of the video that you chose to use during a par-
ticular edit. If you want to use the remaining video later, it’s still on your
hard drive, ready for use.
You can also usually unsplit your clips that you have split. In Pinnacle
Studio, hold down Ctrl and click each of the clips that you split earlier.
When each clip is selected, right-click the clips and choose Combine Scenes
from the menu that appears. Unfortunately, Apple iMovie doesn’t have a
simple tool for recombining clips that you have split. If you just split a clip,
you can undo that action by choosing Edit➪Undo or by pressing Ô+Z (this
only undoes the split).
Turning Your Clips into a Movie
You’re probably wondering when the fun begins. This is it! It’s finally time to
start assembling your various video clips into a movie. Most video-editing
programs provide the same two basic tools to help you assemble a movie.
These tools are as follows:
✦Storyboard: This is where you throw clips together in a basic sequence
from start to finish — think of it as a rough draft of your movie.
✦Timeline: After your clips are assembled in the storyboard, you can
switch over to the timeline to fine-tune the movie and make more
advanced edits. The timeline is where you apply the final polish.
The storyboard and timeline are basically just two different ways of show-
ing the same thing. In most editing programs — including iMovie, Studio,
and Windows Movie Maker — you can toggle back and forth between the
storyboard and the timeline whenever you want. Some people prefer to use
one or the other exclusively; for now, starting with the storyboard keeps
the example simple.
Visualizing your project with storyboards
If you’ve ever watched a “making of” documentary for a movie, you’ve prob-
ably seen filmmakers working with a storyboard. It looks like a giant comic
strip, where each panel illustrates a new scene in the movie. The story-
board in your video-editing program works the same way. You can toss
scenes in the storyboard, move them around, remove scenes, and generally
put your clips in the basic order in which you want them to appear in the
movie. The storyboard is a great place in which to visualize the overall con-
cept and flow of your movie.
To add clips to the storyboard, simply drag them from the clip browser to
the storyboard at the bottom of the screen. As shown in Figure 9-6, I have
added five clips to the iMovie storyboard.
456

Book II
Chapter 9
Basic Video Editing
Turning Your Clips into a Movie
The storyboard should show a series of thumbnails, as shown in Figure 9-6.
If your screen doesn’t quite look like this, you may need to switch to the
Storyboard view. Figure 9-6 shows the buttons that are used for toggling
between the Storyboard view and the Timeline view in iMovie; the equiva-
lent buttons for Studio are shown in Figure 9-7.

457

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
The storyboard is possibly one of the most aptly named items in any video-
editing program because the thumbnails actually tell the basic story of your
movie. The storyboard is pretty easy to manipulate. If you don’t like the
order of things, just click and drag clips to new locations. To remove a clip
from the storyboard in iMovie, Studio, or most other editing programs, click
the offending clip once to select it and then press Delete.
Using the timeline
Some experienced editors prefer to skip the storyboard and go straight to
the timeline because the timeline provides more information and precise
control over your movie project. To switch to the timeline, click the
Timeline button. (Refer to Figure 9-6 for the location of the button in iMovie;
refer to Figure 9-7 to find the button in Studio.)
One of the first things that you’ll probably notice about the timeline is that
not all clips are the same size. Consider Figure 9-8, which shows the
Timeline view of the same project that is shown in Figure 9-7. In the
Timeline view, the width of each clip represents the length (in time) of that
clip, unlike in Storyboard view, where each clip appears to be the same size.
In Timeline view, longer clips are wider and shorter clips are narrower.
Adding clips to the timeline
Adding a clip to the timeline is a lot like placing clips on the storyboard.
Just use the drag-and-drop feature to move clips from the clip browser to the
timeline. In Figure 9-9, I am inserting a clip between two existing clips on 
the timeline. Clips that fall after the insert are automatically shifted over to
make room for the inserted clip.

Turning Your Clips into a Movie
Zooming in and out on the timeline
Depending on the size of your movie project, you may find that clips on the
timeline are often either too wide or too narrow to work with effectively. To
rectify this situation, adjust the zoom level of the timeline. You can either
zoom in and see more detail or zoom out and see more of the movie. To
adjust the zoom, follow these guidelines:
✦Apple iMovie: Adjust the Zoom slider control in the lower-left corner of
the timeline (refer to Figure 9-9).
✦Microsoft Windows Movie Maker: Click the Zoom In or Zoom Out mag-
nifying glass button above the timeline, or press Page Down to zoom in
and Page Up to zoom out.
✦Pinnacle Studio: Press the plus key (+) to zoom in, or press the hyphen
(minus sign) key (–) to zoom out. Alternatively, hover your mouse
pointer over the timeline ruler until the pointer becomes a clock, and
then click and drag left or right on the ruler to adjust the zoom.
Tracking timeline tracks
The timeline displays several different tracks. Each track represents a 
different element of the movie — video resides on the video track and audio
resides on the audio track. You may have additional tracks available as well,
such as title tracks (see Book II, Chapter 10 for more on adding titles to your
movie) or music tracks (see Book II, Chapter 12 for details about adding
music to your movie). Figure 9-10 shows the tracks that are used in the
Pinnacle Studio timeline.
Some advanced video-editing programs (such as Adobe Premiere and Final
Cut Pro) allow you to have many separate video and audio tracks in a single
project. This advanced capability is useful for layering many different ele-
ments and performing some advanced editing techniques.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
When you record and capture video, you usually capture audio along with
it. When you place one of these video clips in the timeline (refer to Figure
9-10), the accompanying audio appears just underneath it in the audio
track. Seeing the audio and video tracks separately is important for a vari-
ety of editing purposes. (Chapter 12 of Book II describes working with audio
in greater detail.)
Locking timeline tracks in Pinnacle Studio
Pinnacle Studio offers a handy locking feature on timeline tracks. Locking
the track doesn’t prevent burglars from stealing it late at night, but it does
allow you to temporarily protect a track from changes as you manipulate
other tracks. For example, if you want to delete the audio track that came
with some video but you don’t want to delete the video itself, follow these
steps:
1. Click the track header on the left side of the timeline.
A lock icon appears on the track header, and a striped gray background
is applied to that track. In Figure 9-11, I have locked the main video track.
2. Perform edits on other tracks.
For example, to delete the audio track for one of your video clips, click
the audio clip once to select it (as shown in Figure 9-11) and then press
Delete. The audio portion of the clip disappears, but the video clip
remains unaffected.
3. Click the track header again to unlock the track.
You can undo changes (such as deleting an audio clip) in Pinnacle Studio by
pressing Ctrl+Z. If you followed the previous steps, press Ctrl+Z once to
relock the track and press Ctrl+Z again to undelete the audio clip.

Turning Your Clips into a Movie
What did iMovie do with my audio?
Apple iMovie 3 offers some useful improvements over previous versions
of the software — and a few changes that are less welcome. One thing that
I find a little aggravating is that the timeline does not automatically show
the audio clips that accompany video clips. Refer to Figure 9-9 to see what
I mean. Each clip in the timeline includes both audio and video, but the
timeline shows only a single track.
To view combined audio and video clips separately in iMovie, you must
extract the audio from each video clip individually. To do so, follow these
steps:
1. Click once on a clip on the timeline to select it.
2. Choose Advanced➪Extract Audio, or press Ô+J.
The audio now appears as a separate clip on the timeline, as shown in
Figure 9-12.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each clip on the timeline.
It may be a good idea to wait until later (like when you’re done editing the
video portion of the movie) to extract audio from your video clips. If you
still need to trim the video clip (as I describe in the section “Trimming clips
on the timeline,” later in this chapter), you have to trim the audio clip sepa-
rately if it has been extracted.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Fine-Tuning Your Movie on the Timeline
After you’ve plopped a few clips onto your timeline or storyboard, you’re
ready to fine-tune your project. This fine-tuning is what turns your series
of clips into a real movie. Most of the edits that I describe in this section
require you to work on the timeline, although if you want to simply move
clips around without making edits or changes, you’ll probably find that
easier to do in the storyboard. This is especially true if you’re using iMovie.
To move a clip, simply click and drag it to a new location, as shown in
Figure 9-13.
Trimming clips on the timeline
Dropping clips onto the storyboard or timeline is a great way to assemble
the movie, but a lot of those clips probably contain some material that you
don’t want to use. Suppose that a clip is about 19 seconds long, which is
much longer than you really want. As you play through the clip, you notice
that about 15 seconds into the clip, the camera moves. You don’t want to
include that in the movie, so you decide to trim the clip to just the first 5
seconds.
Trimming clips in Pinnacle Studio
The easiest way to trim clips in the Studio timeline is to use the Clip
Properties window. To open this window, double-click a clip in the timeline.
The Clip Properties window appears above the timeline, as shown in Figure
9-14. The left pane of this window shows the in point frame, which is the
first frame of the clip. The right pane shows the out point frame, or the end
of the clip. To adjust the in and out points, click and drag the in and out
point razor tools back and forth. As shown in Figure 9-14, I have dragged the
out point razor so that only the first 5 seconds of the clip will play.
You can also adjust the in and out points by typing new numbers in the
timecode indicators under each pane.
The playback controls in the Clip Properties window include a Play Clip
Continuously button. Click this button to preview the clip so that it loops
continuously. This can help you better visualize the effects of any changes
that you make to the in and out points.
When you’re done trimming the clip, click the Close button in the upper-right
corner of the Clip Properties window. The window closes, and the length of
your clip on the timeline is changed accordingly.
Trimming clips in Apple iMovie
Apple iMovie’s approach to trimming is typical Apple — simple and effec-
tive. iMovie uses the preview window for clip-trimming operations. If you
look closely at the lower-left corner of the preview window, you can see two
tiny triangles, as shown in Figure 9-15. These are in point and out point
markers; you can use them to trim clips in the timeline.

To trim a clip in iMovie, follow these steps:
1. Click a clip on the timeline to select it.
When you click the clip, it should load into the preview window. If it
does not, make sure that the desired clip is selected on the timeline.
The clip should turn blue when it is selected.
2. Click and drag the out point marker in the lower-left corner of the
preview window to a new location along the playback ruler (see
Figure 9-15).
3. Click and drag the in point marker to a new position, if you want.
The selected portion of the clip — that is, the portion between the in
and out points — turns yellow in the preview window playback ruler.
4. Choose Edit➪Crop.
The clip is trimmed (cropped ) to just the portion that you selected with
the in and out points. Subsequent clips on the timeline automatically
shift to fill in the empty space on the timeline.
If you trim a video clip from which you have extracted the audio, only the
video clip is trimmed; you have to trim the audio separately.
Removing clips from the timeline
Changing your mind about some clips that you placed in the timeline is vir-
tually inevitable, and fortunately, removing clips is easy. Just click the
offending clip to select it, and press Delete. Poof! The clip disappears.

Chapter 9
Basic Video Editing
Fine-Tuning Your Movie on the Timeline
If you’re using iMovie, you should know, however, that when you delete a
clip by pressing Delete, the clip goes to the iMovie Trash bin. After the trash
is emptied (by double-clicking the Trash icon at the bottom of the iMovie
program window), the deleted clip is no longer stored on your hard drive.
This means that if you decide you want it back later, you have to recapture
it. Therefore, to simply remove a clip from the timeline, I recommend that
you first switch to the storyboard, and then drag the unwanted clip back up
to the clip browser so that you can use it again later.
Undoing what you’ve done
Oops! If you didn’t really mean to delete that clip, don’t despair. Just like word
processors (and many other computer programs), video-editing programs let
you undo your actions. Simply press Ctrl+Z (in Windows) or Ô+Z (on the
Mac) to undo your last action. Both Pinnacle Studio and Apple iMovie allow
you to undo several actions, which is helpful if you’ve done a couple of other
actions since making the “mistake” that you want to undo. To redo an action
that you just undid, press Ctrl+Y (in Windows) or Ô+Shift+Z (on the Mac).
Another quick way to restore a clip in iMovie to its original state — regardless
of how long ago you changed it — is to select the clip on the timeline and
then choose Advanced➪Restore Clip. The clip reverts to its original state.
Adjusting playback speed
One of the coolest yet most unappreciated capabilities of video-editing 
programs is the ability to change the speed of video clips. Changing the
speed of a clip can serve the following purposes:
✦Add drama to a scene by slowing the speed to create a “slow-mo” effect.
✦Make a scene appear fast-paced and action-oriented (or humorous,
depending on the subject matter) by speeding up the video.
✦Help a given video clip better fit into a specific time frame by speeding it
up or slowing it down slightly. For example, you may be trying to time a
video clip to match beats in a musical soundtrack. Sometimes this can
be achieved by slightly adjusting the playback speed of the video clips.
Of course, you want to carefully preview any speed changes that you make
to a video clip. Depending on the software, you could encounter some jit-
tery video images or other problems when you play around with speed
adjustments.
Pay special attention to audio clips when you adjust playback speed. Even
though a small speed adjustment may be barely perceptible in a video clip,
even the tiniest speed changes have radical affects on the way that audio
sounds. Usually, when I adjust video speed, I discard the audio portion of
that clip. Pinnacle Studio is unusual in that when you change the speed of a
video clip, the audio portion of that clip is automatically discarded.
Adjusting playback speed in Apple iMovie
Changing playback speed in iMovie couldn’t be easier. If you look closely,
you can see a slider adjustment for playback speed right on the timeline. To
adjust the speed, follow these steps:
465

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
1. Switch to the timeline (if you aren’t there already) by clicking the
Timeline View button (refer to Figure 9-6).
2. Click the clip that you want to adjust to select it.
The clip should turn blue when it is selected.
3. Adjust the speed slider at the bottom of the timeline, as shown in
Figure 9-16.
To speed up the clip, move the slider toward the hare. Move the slider
toward the tortoise to (surprise) slow down the clip.
4. Play the clip to preview your changes.
5. Giggle at the way the audio sounds after you make your changes.
If you don’t want to include the audio portion of the clip after you’ve made
speed changes, choose Advanced➪Extract Audio to extract the audio and
then delete the audio clip after it is extracted.
Another neat thing that you can do to video clips in iMovie is to reverse the
playback direction. To do so, select the clip and choose Advanced➪Reverse
Clip Direction. The clip now plays backward in your movie. To change it
back to the normal direction, just choose Advanced➪Reverse Clip Direction
again.

3. Click the Vary Playback Speed tool on the left side of the Clip
Properties window (as shown in Figure 9-17).
The Vary Playback Speed controls appear, as shown in Figure 9-17.
4. Move the Speed slider left to slow down the clip, or move it to the
right to speed up the clip.
An adjustment factor appears above the slider. Normal speed is shown
as 1.0 X. Double speed would be 2.0 X, and so on. If you slow the play-
back speed, a fraction appears instead. For example, half speed is indi-
cated as 5⁄10 X.

8. Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Clip Properties
window when you’re done making changes.
The Clip Properties window closes. If you sped up the playback of the clip,
the clip now appears narrower on the timeline. If you slowed the playback
speed, the clip is wider on the timeline.
Fixing Color and Light Issues
Even if you follow all the best advice for shooting great video, you will prob-
ably wind up with some video that has ugly coloration or poor lighting.
Fortunately, modern editing programs give you some tools to correct some
image-quality issues.
Adjusting image qualities in Pinnacle Studio
Pinnacle Studio provides a pretty good selection of image controls. You can
use these controls to improve brightness and contrast, adjust colors, or
add a stylized appearance to a video image. To access the color controls,
double-click a clip that you want to improve or modify. When the Clip
Properties window appears, click the Adjust Color or Add Visual Effects tab
on the left side of the window. The Color Properties window appears, as
shown in Figure 9-18.
At the top of the Color Properties window is the Color Type menu. Here you
can choose a basic color mode for the clip. The normal mode is All Colors,
but you can also choose Black and White (shown in Figure 9-18), Single Hue,
or Sepia. Below that menu are eight controls that you manipulate using slid-
ers. These controls, listed in the order that they appear, are as follows:
✦Hue: Adjusts the color bias for the clip. Use this if skin tones or other
colors in the image don’t look right.
✦Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the color in the image.
✦Brightness: Makes the image brighter or darker.

Basic Video Editing
Fixing Color and Light Issues
✦Contrast: Adjusts the contrast between the light and dark parts of the
image. If the image appears too dark, use Brightness and Contrast
together to improve the way it looks.
✦Blur: Adds a blurry effect to the image.
✦Emboss: Simulates a carving or embossed effect. It looks cool but is of
limited use.
✦Mosaic: Makes the image look like a bunch of large colored blocks. This
is another control that you probably won’t use much.
✦Posterize: Reduces the number of different colors in an image. Play with
it; you may like it.
Most of your clips are probably fine just the way they are, but it’s good to
know that these controls are available if you need them. And if, after making
a bunch of changes, you decide that you liked the clip better the way it was,
just click the Default button to return the clip to its original settings.
Modifying light and color in Apple iMovie
Although Apple iMovie doesn’t have specific image controls (as does, say,
Studio), you can still modify color and light characteristics by using some of
the iMovie effects. Start by selecting a clip that you want to adjust, and then
click the Effects button in the upper-right portion of the timeline. In the
Effects window that appears (see Figure 9-19), you can use any of several
effects to improve the appearance of the clip.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Most effects have controls that you can adjust by moving sliders. You can
also control how the effect starts and finishes. Effects that can modify color
and lighting include the following:
✦Adjust Colors: Allows you to adjust hue, saturation (color), and lightness.
✦Aged Film: If the clip looks really bad, you can avoid blame by applying
this effect to make the clip look like it’s from a really old film. (“See, it’s
not my fault that the colors are all wrong — this was shot on 8mm film
40 years ago!”) Your secret is safe with me. The Aged Film effect gives
you the following tools:
• Exposure slider: Lets you make the aged effect appear lighter or
darker.
• Jitter slider: Controls how much the video image “jitters” up and
down. Jitter makes the clip look like film that is not passing smoothly
through a projector.
• Scratches filter: Lets you adjust how many film “scratches” appear
on the video image.
✦Black & White: Converts the clip to a black-and-white image.
✦Brightness & Contrast: Adjusts brightness and contrast in the image.
(In Figure 9-19, I have increased the brightness and contrast to improve
the appearance of a backlit video clip.) Separate sliders let you control
brightness and contrast independently.
✦Sepia Tone: Gives the clip an old-fashioned sepia look.
✦Sharpen: Sharpens an otherwise blurry image. A slider control lets you
fine-tune the level of sharpness that is applied.
✦Soft Focus: Gives the image a softer appearance, simulating the effect of
a soft-light filter on the camera. The following slider controls let you
customize the Soft Focus effect:
• Softness slider: Controls the level of softness. Move the Softness
control toward the Lots end of the slider for a dream-sequence look.
• Amount slider: Controls the overall level of the Soft Focus effect.
• Glow slider: Increases or decreases the soft glow of the effect.
Setting the Glow slider toward High tends to wash out the entire
video clip.
To see a full-screen preview of an effect, click the Preview button. If you are
happy with the effect, click the Apply button to apply the effect to the clip.
When you click the Apply button, you may see a red progress bar appear on
the clip. This shows the progress of the rendering, the process that applies
the effect to the clip. The rendering process creates a temporary file on
your hard drive that iMovie uses to show how the clip looks after the effect
has been applied.

Chapter 10: Adding 
Transitions and Titles
In This Chapter
 Using fades and transitions between video clips
 Using predefined title styles in Pinnacle Studio
 Creating your own title styles in Studio
 Working with titles in iMovie
A
nyone with two VCRs wired together can dub from tape to tape, copying
only the desirable scenes, and call it editing. But the results will be pretty
sloppy, especially compared to the high-quality movies that you can make
with your computer. Modern video-editing programs like Apple iMovie and
Pinnacle Studio give you powerful tools to help you add special elements to
your projects. For example, you can add a transition that allows one clip to
gracefully fade into the next, and you can add your own on-screen credits and
notations using titles.
This chapter shows you how to use transitions and titles in your movie
projects. These are two of the most popular tools that are offered by video-
editing programs. Unlike some other (more obscure) effects and tools, tran-
sitions and titles are things that you’ll probably actually use in every single
movie.
Using Fades and Transitions between Clips
One of the trickiest aspects of movie editing (for me, anyway) is making clean
transitions between clips. Often the best transition is a simple, straight cut
from one clip to the next. Other times, you want to fade gently from one
scene to the next. Or, you may want a more fancy transition — say, one that
makes it look like the outgoing scene is being rolled apart like drapes to
reveal the incoming scene behind it. Most transitions can be generally
divided into a few basic categories, as follows:
✦Straight cut: This is actually no transition at all. One clips ends and the
next begins. Poof! — just like that.
✦Fade: The outgoing clip fades out as the incoming clip fades in. Fades
are also sometimes called dissolves.
✦Wipe: The incoming clip wipes over the outgoing clip using one of many
possible patterns. Alternatively, the outgoing clip may wipe away to
reveal the incoming clip.
471

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
✦Push: The outgoing clip is pushed off the screen by the incoming clip.
✦3-D: Some advanced editing programs provide transitions that seem 
to work three-dimensionally. For example, the outgoing clip may wrap
itself up into a 3-D ball, which then spins and rolls off the screen.
Pinnacle’s Hollywood FX plug-ins for Studio provide many interesting 
3-D transitions.
Whatever style of transition you want to use, modern video-editing programs
like Apple iMovie and Pinnacle Studio make the process easy. But before
you can use transitions, you need a project that already has several clips on
its timeline. If you don’t yet feel comfortable with editing clips on the time-
line, check out Chapter 9 of Book II. The following sections show you how 
to select and use transitions in your movie projects.
Choosing the best transition
When Windows Movie Maker first came out in 2000, choosing what type of
transition to use between clips was easy because you had only two choices.
You could use either a straight-cut transition (which is actually no transition
at all) or a cross-fade/dissolve transition. If you wanted to use anything
fancier, you were out of luck.
Thankfully, most modern video-editing programs — including Windows
Movie Maker 2 — provide you with a pretty generous assortment of transi-
tions. Transitions are usually organized in their own window or palette.
Transition windows usually vary slightly from program to program, but the
basics are the same.
How do you decide which transition is the best? The fancy transitions may
look really cool, but I recommend restraint when choosing them. Remember
that the focus of your movie project is the actual video content, not show-
ing off your editing skills or the capabilities of your editing software. More
often than not, the best transition is a simple dissolve. If you do use a fancier
transition, I recommend using the same or a similar transition throughout
your project. This makes the transitions seem to fit more seamlessly into
the movie.
Reviewing iMovie’s transitions
Apple iMovie offers a selection of 13 transitions from which to choose. That
may not sound like a big number, but I think you’ll find that iMovie’s 13 tran-
sitions cover the styles that you’re most likely to use. To view the transitions
that are available in iMovie, click the Trans button above the timeline. A list
of transitions appears, as shown in Figure 10-1.
As you look at the list of transitions, most of the names probably look
pretty foreign to you. Names like “Circle Closing,” “Radial,” and “Warp Out”
are descriptive, but really the only way to know how each transition looks is
to preview it. To do so, click the name of a transition in the list. A small pre-
view of the transition briefly appears in the transition preview window.

Whoops! You missed it. Click the transition’s name again. Wow, it sure flashes
by quickly, doesn’t it? If you would like to see a larger preview, click the
Preview button. A full-size preview appears in iMovie’s main viewer screen.
If your transition preview window shows nothing but a black screen when
you click a transition, move the mouse pointer down and click a clip in the
timeline or on the storyboard to select it. The selected clip should now
appear when you preview a transition.
Previewing transitions in Pinnacle Studio
Pinnacle Studio comes with 142 (yes, 142) transitions. In fact, so many tran-
sitions are provided with Studio that they don’t all fit on one page. To see a
list of Studio’s transitions, click the Show Transitions tab on the left side of
the album, as shown in Figure 10-2. Several pages of transitions are available,
and you can view additional pages by clicking the arrows in the upper-right
corner of the album.
To preview a transition, simply click it in the album window. A preview of
the transition appears in the viewer window to the right of the album. A
blue screen labeled “A” represents the outgoing clip, whereas the incoming
clip is represented by the orange “B” clip. In Figure 10-2, I am previewing a
wipe that uses a heart pattern.

Adding a transition to the timeline
Adding a transition to a project is pretty easy and works the same way in
almost every available video-editing program. For now, add a simple dissolve
(also called a fade) transition to a project. If your editing program currently
shows the storyboard for your project, switch to the timeline (see Book II,
Chapter 9 for more on the timeline and basic editing). Next, click and drag the
Dissolve transition (in Pinnacle Studio) or the Cross Dissolve transition (in
iMovie) from the list of transitions and drop it between two clips on the time-
line. The transition now appears in the timeline between the clips.
The appearance of the transition can vary slightly, depending on the editing
program that you are using. As shown in Figure 10-3, Pinnacle Studio displays
the transition as a clip on the timeline. Apple iMovie, on the other hand,
uses a special transition icon that overlaps the adjacent clips, as shown in
Figure 10-4.
When you first apply a transition in iMovie, the program must render the
transition before it can be viewed. Basically, rendering is a process that
allows the computer to play back the transition at full speed and quality.
To preview the transition, simply play the timeline by clicking the Play
button under the preview window or by pressing the spacebar. If you don’t
like the style of the transition, you can delete it by clicking the transition to
select it and then pressing Delete. If you think the transition just needs
some fine-tuning, check out the next section.

Adjusting transitions
Video transitions usually have some features or attributes that can be
adjusted. Most important, perhaps, is the length of the transition. The
default length for most transitions is about 2 seconds.
Sometimes a 2-second transition is too long — or not long enough. Some-
times, for example, a 2-second dissolve really is too long because it obscures
a spectacular crash at the end of Scene 1. The next two sections show 
you how to adjust the length of transitions and make other changes, where
possible.
Modifying iMovie transitions
The iMovie transition window doesn’t just provide a place to store transi-
tions; it also allows you to control them. To adjust the length of a transition,
follow these steps:
1. Click the transition on the timeline to select it.
2. Adjust the Speed slider in the Transitions window.
The length of the transition is shown in the preview window, as shown
in Figure 10-5.

3. Click the Update button in the Transitions window to update the
length of the transition on the timeline.
4. Click the Play button under the preview window to preview your
results.
Some iMovie transitions, such as Push, allow you to control the direction of
travel for the transition. When you click the Push transition to select it in the
transition window, the directional control (shown in Figure 10-5) becomes
active. Then you simply click the arrows in the directional control to change
the direction in which the Push transition moves.
Adjusting transitions in Studio
Adjusting transitions in Pinnacle Studio works a lot like adjusting regular
video clips. To modify a transition, here’s the drill:
1. Double-click the transition on the timeline.
The Clip Properties window appears above the timeline.
2. Adjust the duration of the transition in the upper-right corner of the
window by clicking the up or down arrows next to the Duration field
at the top of the Clip Properties window.
3. Change the duration to the required number of frames (if necessary),
as shown in Figure 10-6.
You can also reverse the direction of some transitions (for example, the
Horizontal Snake Wipes on page 2 of the Standard Transitions) by
selecting the Reverse check box. (If this box is grayed out, the current
transition cannot be reversed.)
Giving Credit with Titles
In their rush to get to the pictures, folks who are new to video editing often
overlook the importance of titles. Titles — the words that appear on-screen
during a movie — are critically important in many different kinds of projects.
Titles tell your audience the name of your movie, who made it, who starred

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
in it, who paid for it, and who baked cookies for the cast. Titles can also clue
the audience in to vital details — where the story takes place, what time it is,
even what year it is — with minimum fuss. And of course, titles can reveal
what the characters are saying if they’re speaking a different language.
Virtually all video-editing programs include tools to help you create titles.
The following sections show you how to create and use effective titles in
your movie projects.
Creating titles for your movies
It’s easy to think of titles as just words on the screen. But think of the effects,
both forceful and subtle, that well-designed titles can have. Consider the Star
Wars movies, which all begin with a black screen and the phrase “A long time
ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . .” The simple title screen quickly and effec-
tively sets the tone and tells the audience that the story is beginning. And
then, of course, you get those scrolling words that float three-dimensionally
off into space, immediately after that first title screen. A story floating
through space is far more interesting than white text scrolling from the
bottom to top of the screen, don’t you think?
Titles can generally be put into two basic categories: full-screen and overlays.
Full-screen titles, like the one shown in Figure 10-7, are most often used at
the beginning and end of a movie, where the title appears over a background
image or a solid color (such as a plain black screen). The full-screen title func-
tions as its own element in the movie, as does any video clip. An overlay title
makes words appear right over a video image, as shown in Figure 10-8.

Making effective titles
When using titles in your movies, you should follow some basic guidelines
to make them more effective. After all, funny or informative titles don’t do
much good if your audience can’t read them. Follow these general rules
when creating titles for your movies:
✦Less is more. Try to keep your titles as brief and simple as possible.
✦White on black looks best. When you read words on paper, black letters
on white paper are easier to read. This rule does not carry over to video,
however. In video images, light characters over a dark background are
usually easier to read. An exception would be if you already have a rela-
tively light background. In Figure 10-8, the darker-colored title works well
over the snow-covered background. But what if I want to put that same
title near the top of the screen instead? The dark-colored title doesn’t
work as well at the top of the screen because trees in the background can
make it harder to read. As an alternative, I can create a small, dark back-
ground shape behind lighter-colored text, as shown in Figure 10-9. (I show
you how to control title colors and styles in the next couple of sections.)
Video displays such as TVs and computer monitors generate images
using light. (You can think of a TV screen as a big light bulb.) Because
TV displays emit light, full-screen titles almost never have black text on
a white screen. Most people find staring at a mostly white TV screen
about as unpleasant as staring at a lit light bulb: If you watch viewers
look at a white TV screen, you may even see them squint. Squinting is
bad, so stick to the convention of light words over a dark background
whenever possible.
✦Avoid very thin lines. In Chapter 2 of Book II, I describe the difference
between interlaced and noninterlaced video displays. In an interlaced dis-
play (such as a TV), every other horizontal resolution line of the video
image is drawn in a separate pass or field. If the video image includes
very thin lines — especially lines that are only 1 pixel thick — interlacing
could cause the lines to flicker noticeably, giving your viewers a migraine
headache in short order. To avoid this, choose fonts that have thicker
lines. For smaller characters, avoid serif fonts such as Times New Roman.
Serifs (the extra strokes at the ends of characters in some fonts, such as
the font that you’re reading right now) often have very thin lines that
flicker on an interlaced video display.

479

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
✦Think big. Remember that the resolution on your computer screen is a
lot finer than what you get on a typical TV screen. Also, TV viewers typi-
cally watch video from longer distances than do computer users — say,
across the room while plopped on the sofa, compared to sitting just a
few inches away in an office chair. This means that the words that look
pleasant and readable on your computer monitor may be tiny and unin-
telligible if your movie is output to tape for TV viewing. Never be afraid
to increase the size of your titles.
✦Think safety. Most TVs suffer from a malady called overscan, which is
what happens when some of the video image is cut off at the edges of
the screen. You can think of TVs as being kind of like most computer
printers. Most TVs can’t display the far edges of the video image, just as
most printers can’t print all the way to the very edges of the paper. When
you’re working on a word processing document, your page has margins
to account for the shortcomings of printers as well as to make the page
more readable. The same applies to video images, which have title-safe
margins. To ensure that your titles show up on-screen and are not cut
off at the edges, make sure that your titles remain within this margin
(also sometimes called the title-safe boundary).
Apple iMovie doesn’t show these margins on-screen; instead, it automat-
ically keeps your titles inside the margins. If you know that your movie
will be viewed only on computer screens, select the QT Margins check
box in the Titles window. This places the margins closer to the edge of
the screen.
Pinnacle Studio’s Title Editor works like most video-editing programs:
The margins are displayed on-screen, and you have to remember to keep
your titles inside them. The margins appear in the Title Editor window
as red dotted lines, as shown in Figure 10-10.

Adding Transitions 
and Titles
Using Studio’s Title Editor
✦Play, play, play. I cannot stress enough the importance of previewing
your titles, especially overlays. Play your timeline after adding titles to
see how they look. Make sure that the title is readable, positioned well
on-screen, and visible long enough to be read. If possible, preview the
titles on an external video monitor.
You can use transitions between full-screen titles and other video clips.
Dissolves (described in the section “Using Fades and Transitions between
Clips,” earlier in this chapter) often look nice when used to transition from
a full-screen title to the video.
Using Studio’s Title Editor
Pinnacle Studio comes with a remarkably advanced title designer, consid-
ering the price. Studio’s Title Editor is based on Pinnacle’s Title Deko, a
high-quality title designer that’s used by many professional video editors.
Studio also provides a selection of predesigned titles that are ready to drop
right into any video project. To access these titles, click the Show Titles
tab on the left side of the album. A selection of titles appears, as shown in
Figure 10-11. Click the arrow in the upper-right corner of the album to view
additional pages.
To see a preview of the title, click it once in the album. The title appears 
in the viewer window. To add a title to your project, simply drag the title
thumbnail from the album down to the timeline, just as if it were a video
clip. In Figure 10-11, I have dropped a “Snow Boarding” title at the begin-
ning of my timeline’s video track. If the title is dropped on the video track,
the title will be a full-screen title, which by default has a plain black 
background.
If you use a predesigned title, you’ll probably want to change some of the
text. For example, even though I like the style of the “Snow Boarding” title, 
I don’t want the words Snow Boarding to appear because that’s not what 
is happening in the video. To edit the title, double-click it after you have
added it to the timeline. The Studio Title Editor opens. You can also open
the Title Editor and create a new title by double-clicking any blank space in
the Title track (see Figure 10-11) of the timeline. The next section shows
you how to edit a title.
Editing titles
The Title Designer window is one of the most complex windows in the
Studio software. If you are working with a predesigned title, double-click it
in the timeline to change the text. The title opens in the title editor. To
change the text, click once on the title and start typing. Highlight unwanted
words, and press Delete to delete them.
481

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
You can change the font style or size for the title if you don’t like it. Select
the text that you want to change, and then choose a new font in the font
menu at the top of the Title Editor. In Figure 10-12, I’ve changed the font to
Trendy because I didn’t like the Pretext font that was used in the “Snow
Boarding” title. Figure 10-12 also shows the basic controls of the Title
Designer. Some of the most important controls are as follows:
✦Roll: Click this to make the title roll vertically up the screen. This is espe-
cially useful if you have a long list of credits that you want to roll at the
end of the movie. If you choose the Roll option, the Title Editor allows
you to scroll down the editing area to add more rows of titles. You can
make a roll title as long as you want. Each time you add a new line of text
to the bottom of a rolling title, the title screen gets a little longer.
✦Crawl: Click this to make the title crawl across the screen from right to
left. Crawl useful text, such as “Order now! Quantities are limited!” across
the bottom of the screen. Like rolling titles, you can make a crawling title
wider by simply adding more text to the right side of the title.
✦Text styling: Select some text in your title, and then click one of these
buttons to style the text. Just like in a word processor or almost any
other computer program, click B to make the text bold, click I to make it
italic, and click U to underline the text.
✦Text justification: Click this button to open a submenu of text justification
and alignment options. You can choose to align text left, right, or cen-
tered. If you click the Shrink to Fit button, the text automatically shrinks

to fit in the text box in case you make the box smaller. If you click the
Scale to Fit button, the text shrinks or grows to fill the entire text box 
if you make the box smaller or bigger. If you want long lines of text to
automatically wrap to the next line, click the Word Wrap On button. Other-
wise, click the Word Wrap Off button. Click the Close (X) button in the
upper-right corner of the Text justification menu to close the menu.
✦Add Text Field: Click this button and then click and drag a text box in
the editing area to create a new line of text from scratch.
✦Text styles: Use these predefined styles to quickly format text. To apply
a style to some existing text, select the text in the editing area and then
click a style in the list.
When you edit titles in Studio, make sure that the words stay inside the
title-safe boundaries, which are the red dotted lines around the edges of the
Title Editor window. Text that falls outside those boundaries may be cut off
when the movie is viewed on a TV screen.
To change the color of your text, click the Custom tab on the right side of the
Title Editor screen. As shown in Figure 10-13, this tab offers a variety of con-
trols for text. The controls are divided into three sections: Face, Edge, and
Shadow. Each section has a radio button for the following options: Color,
Gradient, or Transparent. If you want the element to be a solid color, select
the Color radio button, click the color box next to it to open a color picker
and choose a specific color. If you want the element to be a gradient (a color

color at the other side), select the Gradient radio button and then click the
gradient box next to it to specify the colors that are to be used in the gradi-
ent. If you want the element to be transparent, select the Transparent radio
button.
The three sections of the Custom tab control separate elements of the title
text, as follows:
✦Face: This section controls the basic face of the text. You can choose a
solid color, make the color a gradient, or make the text face transparent.
Only choose the Transparent radio button if the text has a thick, visible
edge. You can also blur the appearance of the face by using the slider
control at the bottom of the Face section.
✦Edge: Here you can change the color and also size the edges of charac-
ters. Like the text face, edges can be a solid color, a gradient, or trans-
parent. Choose the Transparent option if you simply don’t want the text
to have an edge.

Adjust the upper slider in the Edge section to change the size of the
edge. Move the slider to the right to make the edge thicker, or move it
to the left to make the edge thinner. Remember, very thin lines can
flicker when the movie is viewed on a TV screen, so try to make the
edge at least 3 pixels thick. An indicator to the right of the size slider
tells you the current thickness in pixels. To blur the appearance of the
text’s edge, adjust the lower slider in the Edge section.
✦Shadow: Add a shadow for your text, give that shadow a color, and con-
trol the direction of the shadow by using the Round direction control.
Shadows can help make text easier to read over some backgrounds.
Like other text elements, shadows can be a solid color, a gradient, or
transparent. The upper slider in the Shadow section changes the appar-
ent distance between the text and the shadow, and the lower slider
blurs the shadow slightly. Generally speaking, the farther a shadow is
beneath the text, the more you should blur the shadow. The radial 
control underneath the sliders lets you adjust the direction of the
shadow. Select a radio button around the A to change the direction of
the shadow.
When you’re done editing your title, click OK in the lower-right corner of
the Title Editor to close it and return to the Studio timeline.
As you play with the Title Editor a bit, you’ll probably find that creating
titles from scratch takes a while. That’s why I normally use one of the ready-
made text styles (on the Standard tab of the Title Editor) as a starting point.
Changing backgrounds
If you’ve read this chapter from the beginning, you’ve already heard me
preach about how white words over a black background are easier to read
than any other style of title. But face it: Plain black backgrounds are a little,
er, boring. To spice up the appearance of your full-screen titles a bit, use the
Title Editor to add a background. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Double-click a full-screen title in your timeline to open it.
2. Click the Backgrounds button to show the background controls.
3. To change the color of a solid background, select the Background
Color radio button and then click the color box to choose a new color.
You can also choose the Gradient or Transparent radio buttons.
4. To use a background image instead of a solid color or gradient, select
the Background Picture radio button and then click a picture in the list.
In Figure 10-14, I have chosen a winter-themed background for my full-screen
title. If you have a picture that you would like to place in the background,
click the Pictures button and then click the Folder icon in the pictures list to
browse to the picture file on your hard drive. You can then click and drag the
picture onto the title and position it anywhere you want.

Creating Titles in iMovie
Apple prides itself — and rightfully so — on providing computers and soft-
ware that are easy to use. Adding titles to your iMovie project could hardly
be easier. To create a title, follow these steps:
1. If you’re creating an overlay title, click the video clip in the timeline
that is to appear behind the title.
This operation ensures that the proper clip appears in the preview
window as you edit and preview your title. If you’re currently working in
Storyboard mode, I recommend that you switch over to the timeline by
clicking the Timeline button, which appears under the lower-left corner of
the iMovie preview window. If you’re creating a full-screen title (one that
is over a black background instead of superimposed over a clip), don’t
worry about selecting a clip in the timeline: Just go straight to Step 2.
2. Click the Titles button above the timeline.
The iMovie Title Designer appears.
3. Type the words for the title in the text boxes near the bottom of the
Title Designer (as shown in Figure 10-15).
4. Choose a style for your title from the Titles list (not to be confused
with the brand of golf ball).

Most of the listed titles are for moving titles. When you click one, a pre-
view of the motion appears in the preview window at the top of the Title
Designer. If you want a static title that doesn’t move, choose Centered,
Stripe Subtitle, or Subtitle.
5. If the movie is to be output to videotape or DVD for viewing on conven-
tional TVs, make sure that the QT Margins check box is deselected.
The QT Margins option allows titles in movies that are destined for the
Web to use a little more screen space, but this isn’t recommended for
movies that are to be shown on TVs. The problem is overscan, which I
describe in the section “Making effective titles,” earlier in this chapter.
6. To create a standalone title with a black background, select the Over
Black check box.
7. Click the Color box to choose a new color for the title.
8. Use the Font menu to choose a new font face, and adjust the size of
the title using the Size slider.
9. When you’re ready to add the title to the project, drag the title from
the Titles list and drop it into the timeline, just before the clip over
which you want the title to appear.

automatically superimposed on the video clip before which you placed
the title. If you chose the Over Black option in Step 6, the title is a stand-
alone clip in the timeline, with a black background.
If you decide to edit a title that you created earlier, select the title in the

Changing the Length of Titles
After you’ve added some titles to your movie proj-
ect and previewed them a couple of times, you’ll
probably find that you need to change how long
some of them appear. Does the title flash by so
quickly that you don’t have time to read it? Does
the title seem to linger a few seconds too long?
Changing the length of titles is pretty easy, but
you must be viewing the timeline in your editing
program, not on the storyboard. As I describe in
Book II, Chapter 9, the timeline is where you per-
form “fine-tuning” edits, such as changing the
length of a title.
Use one of the following methods to change the
length of a title.
In almost any video-editing program:
1.
Hold the mouse pointer over an edge of
the title in the timeline.
2.
Click and drag the edge back and forth to
make the title longer or shorter.
This method is quick and easy but not very
precise.
In Pinnacle Studio:
1.
Double-click the title to open the Title
Editor.
2.
Type a new number in the Duration field
or use the arrows next to the Duration
field to increase or decrease the duration.
In iMovie:
Simply move the Speed slider to the left or right
in the Title Designer window.
In addition to altering the duration of
your title, you can change which clip
your overlay titles appear over. Just
drag the titles left or right in the timeline
to change when they appear.

ave you ever watched a movie where it appeared that the hero was
hanging by fingertips from a ledge of a tall skyscraper, or a giant lizard
creature appeared to be chasing live humans through a jungle? Of course,
moviemakers don’t really risk the lives of big-name stars, and they don’t
breed giant lizard creatures to train them as harmless-yet-scary-looking
movie extras. Scenes like these are created by using a little bit of movie
magic called compositing.
Guess what? You don’t have to be a Hollywood movie mogul with a multi-
million-dollar budget to use compositing. With some simple videographic
tricks and Adobe Premiere Pro, you can create composite scenes with the
best of ’em. In this chapter, I show you how.
This chapter also shows you how to use Premiere Pro’s animation features
(which can move video scenes, titles, and other graphics across the screen),
and I demonstrate how to take advantage of iMovie’s built-in special effects.
Compositing Video
Over the years, we have come to expect sophisticated illusions in our
entertainment — starships flying into a space battle, lovers standing on
the bow of a long-gone ocean liner, or a weatherman standing in front of a
moving weather-satellite graphic — and if you ever wanted to create some
of your own, now you can: Adobe Premiere Pro is fully capable of creating
such effects.
One of the great spells you can cast in the magic of moviemaking involves
compositing. When you composite clips, you combine portions of two or
more clips to make a video image that would otherwise be difficult or impos-
sible to capture. Consider the scene I described in the introduction to this
chapter, where an actor appears to be hanging by his fingertips from the
50th floor of a skyscraper as cars move like ants on the streets far below.
Did the producers risk the actor’s life and force him to hang from a tall
489

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
building? Not likely — think of the insurance costs! They probably shot him
hanging from a prop in a studio and then superimposed that image over a
shot taken from an actual skyscraper.
Fundamental to the process of compositing is the careful layering of images.
Using Premiere Pro, you can superimpose up to 99 separate video tracks
upon one another. Each track contains part of the final image; by making
parts of each track either opaque or transparent, you can create a convinc-
ing illusion of three-dimensional space.
Adjusting the opacity of a clip
Video clips in Premiere Pro can vary between transparent and opaque. One of
the most basic superimposition effects is to make a clip less opaque — that
is, more transparent. The more transparent clip becomes a ghostlike image
superimposed over the more opaque image behind it. You can change the
opacity of an entire clip, or change it gradually throughout a clip. To adjust
the opacity of a clip, follow these steps:
1. Add a clip to the Video 1 track in a sequence.
Clips in the Video 1 track should not be made transparent, so you might
think of Video 1 as the background layer. When you layer additional clips
over it and make them transparent, the background clip on Video 1
should show through.
2. Add a clip to a superimpose track in the sequence.
Video 2 and any higher-numbered tracks are all considered superimpose
tracks because they’re the ones you superimpose over a primary or back-
ground image. You can think of the video tracks on the timeline as layers
on top of each other. If you superimposed 50 tracks on top of each other,
Track 50 would be the very top layer and opaque areas of that track
would cover all other tracks.
After you have added a clip to a superimpose track, the superimposed
clip should appear directly above the background clip in Video 1, as
shown in Figure 11-1.
3. Click the arrow to expand the track view, as shown in Figure 11-1.

4. Click the Show Keyframes button in the track header for the superim-
pose track and then choose Show Opacity Handles from the menu that
appears.
A yellow opacity rubberband appears on clips in the superimpose track.
5. Click the clip for which you want to adjust opacity (doing so selects it).
6. Place the CTI (short for Current Time Indicator) cursor somewhere in
the selected clip — this makes the selected clip the target of the next
action.
7. Press Page Up on your keyboard to move the CTI to the beginning of
the clip.
8. Click the Add/Remove Keyframe button on the track header to set a
key frame.
9. Move the CTI to a new place in the clip and click the Add/Remove
Keyframe button again to create another key frame.
10. Press Page Down on your keyboard to move the CTI to the end of the
selected clip, and click the Add/Remove Keyframe button again to set
another key frame.
11. Click and drag on the key frames you created to adjust the yellow
opacity rubberband.
As you drag the rubberband down, the clip becomes more transparent.
As you drag it up, the clip becomes more opaque.
If you find that the key frames are kind of hard to click and drag with the
mouse, carefully hover the mouse pointer over a key frame. When the
mouse pointer has a yellow dot next to it, you can click and drag the key
frame.
Using keys
In the preceding section, you adjust the opacity of a clip to make the entire
image transparent or semitransparent. But what if you want only parts of
the image to become transparent while other parts of the image remain
fully opaque?
You’ve probably heard of a video technique called bluescreening, often used
in special-effects shots in movies, or during the evening news when a mete-
orologist must appear in front of a moving weather map. In actuality, the
announcer is standing in front of a blue screen — usually wearing a color
that clashes with the blue. Why the clash? Because you’re not supposed to
see the blue.
Here’s how the blue screen becomes a weather map: Video-editing software
uses a key — a setting that recognizes the special shade of blue and defines
it as transparent. Because the wall behind the announcer is the only thing
painted that shade of blue, it “disappears.” In effect, the image of the mete-
orologist has been placed on a virtual glass slide and superimposed elec-
tronically over the image of the weather map. Pretty slick, eh?
491

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Of course, if the meteorologist happens to wear a tie or blouse that matches
the transparent color, you can see chunks of the weather map right through
the person. (Oops . . .) Editors can make only so much movie magic; some
careful videography is needed to make blue-screen-style effects work.
A blue screen key is one of many keys that work by recognizing a specific
color in an image. Some keys use an alpha channel instead of a color to
define transparent areas of an image. If you’ve worked with still graphics
in a program such as Adobe Photoshop, you’re probably familiar with
alpha channels. An alpha channel is basically a layer in the image that
defines transparency within the image. Generally speaking, the only time
you’ll use an alpha key is when you’re dealing with a still graphic that was
imported from a program like Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.
The following sections show you how to use different kinds of keys to
define transparent areas in your video image.
Understanding the key types
Although the example just given — a key that recognizes a blue screen
behind a meteorologist — is extremely common, it isn’t the only kind of
key available to you in Premiere. In fact, Premiere Pro provides 14 different
kinds of keys for you to use. To view a list of the keys, click the Effects tab
in the Project window (or choose Window➪Effects) and then expand the
Keying folder under Video Effects. Premiere Pro’s keys are
✦Alpha Adjust: This key works a lot like the opacity controls (described
earlier in this chapter); it’s for still graphics that have an alpha channel.
Use this key to adjust opacity of the whole graphic, ignore the alpha
channel, invert the alpha channel, or use the alpha channel as a mask.
✦Blue Screen: Use this key when you’ve shot video with the subject in
front of a blue screen. The blue screen must be well lit and brilliant for
this key to be effective. Any shadows that the subject casts on the
screen reduce the effectiveness of this key.
✦Chroma: This key enables you to key out (make disappear) a specific
color or range of similar colors. With some fine-tuning, you can use this
key with almost any clip. In Figure 11-2, I have applied a Chroma key to
the clip on the left to create the superimposition effect shown on the
right. (I show how to do this in the next section.)
✦Difference Matte: This matte enables you to key out the areas of two
images that match each other.
✦Garbage Matte: Use the Garbage Matte key to remove undesired objects
that won’t key out properly. When you apply a garbage matte to a super-
imposed clip, you can click and drag handles around the edge of the
screen to (in effect) crop out portions of the image.
✦Green Screen: This key works just like the Blue Screen key except it
uses (surprise) green instead of blue.
✦Image Matte: This key uses a second still image to create transparency.
When you use this key, you choose an image (such as a flower or a heart)
to provide the basic shape for the key.
492

✦Luma: Luma is short for luminance, which is just a fancy word for color.
This key eliminates darker colors from an image.
✦Multiply: With this key, transparency is based on bright areas on the
video track underneath the superimpose track.
✦Non-Red: This key works like the Blue Screen and Green Screen mattes,
but it keys out both blue and green screens. If you encounter rough
edges (called stair-stepping) around unkeyed objects with the Blue
Screen or Green Screen keys, try using the Non-Red key instead.
✦RGB Difference: This key is similar to the Chroma key, but with fewer
options. This key works best when the background and subject contrast
strongly.
✦Remove Matte: This matte keys out the alpha channel and either the
black or white background layers.
✦Screen: With this key, the transparency is based on dark areas on the
video track underneath the superimpose track.
✦Track Matte: Use this matte with a black-and-white image that moves
across the screen. Transparency moves with the image.
Applying a key
Applying a key to a clip is pretty easy. A key allows portions of one image
to be transparent when it is superimposed over another image. Remember,
you can apply a key only to a clip in a superimpose track — that is, Video 2
or higher. To apply a key, follow these steps:
1. Click a clip in a superimpose track to select it, and make sure that the
CTI on the timeline is somewhere over the clip.
2. Open the Effects tab in the Project window, or choose Window➪
Effects.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
3. Expand the Video Effects folder and then expand the Keying folder.
4. Drag and drop a key from the Effects tab to the selected clip in the
superimpose track.
5. Click the Effect Controls tab in the left pane of the Monitor window,
or choose Window➪Effect Controls.
The effect controls for the selected clip should appear. The key you
have applied should be listed under Video Effects.
6. Click the right-pointing arrow next to the key to expand its controls,
as shown in Figure 11-3.
If the key uses color information — for example, the Chroma key I’m
applying in Figure 11-3 — you may need to choose a base color for
transparency. Click and hold the eyedropper in the Effect Controls,
move the mouse pointer over the video image on the right side of the
Monitor, and release the mouse button over the color you want to
key out.
7. Adjust any other settings that may be available.
Each key is different, so experiment with the settings to achieve the
desired result.
Creating a matte
Some of the keys available in Premiere Pro use matte images to define trans-
parent areas. You can create your own mattes by using a graphics program
such as Adobe Photoshop, and you can create some mattes within Premiere
itself. You can create mattes for a variety of purposes:
Click to expand key controls.
Some keys have an eyedropper for choosing colors.

Animating Clips
✦A solid, brightly colored matte can help you key transparency on
another clip. To create a matte of a solid color, choose File➪New➪
Color Matte. Choose a color for the matte from the Color Picker. If you
see a warning that the picture is out of the color gamut for your video
format (“Whaddaya mean I can’t use fluorescent puce there?”), choose
another color. Then place this matte on a track that is under the clip to
which you’re trying to apply a key. The brightly colored matte shows
through to help you identify transparent areas and adjust as necessary.
When you’ve made all the necessary adjustments, just delete the color
matte.
✦To mask out specific areas of an image, create a “garbage” matte and
crop out the undesired object. To do this, first create a color matte (this
will be your “garbage” matte) or import a background image. Next, select
the image that has an object you want to crop out and add it to a super-
impose track above the color matte or background image. If the image
has an alpha channel, that channel automatically becomes transparent.
Otherwise, you can apply the Chroma key to the clip and select the color
in the image that you want to make transparent. Using a still graphic
as a garbage matte rather than the Garbage Matte key provided by
Premiere Pro allows you to create a matte with much more complex
shapes. Consider the matte in Figure 11-4, which creates the shape of
a snowflake. You would never be able to create a shape like this using
the Premiere Pro Garbage Matte key.
When preparing a still graphic for importation into a video project, remem-
ber the importance of sizing your image to fit properly in the video image.
Animating Clips
I know what you’re thinking when you read this heading — “Why do I need
to animate a video clip in which the subjects are already moving?” You may
not need to animate the actual subjects in the video, but you can move the
video image across the screen. For example, a small picture-in-picture image
Figure 11-4:
Create a

program if

to use
complex
shapes.
495

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
can sail across the screen to give a hint of action that will happen later in
the movie. You can move a clip across the screen along a fixed path or a
zigzag pattern, you can rotate clips, and you can distort them. To begin
animating a clip, follow these steps:
1. On the timeline, click the clip that you want to animate to select it,
and make sure that the CTI is somewhere over the clip.
Usually any clip that you animate should be in a superimpose track —
that is, one that occupies any track above Video 1.
2. Click the Effect Controls tab on the left side of the Monitor, or choose
Window➪Effect Controls.
3. Under Fixed Effects, click the right-pointing arrow next to Motion to
expand the Motion controls.
Adjusting Motion controls
You can adjust the Motion controls in a variety of ways. Perhaps the easiest
way to adjust a clip is to click the box next to Motion. You can then click
and drag corners of the video image to shrink it to a smaller size, as I’ve
done in Figure 11-5. To move the clip, click and drag the circle in the middle
of the clip. If you want more precise control, use the following controls
under Motion:
✦Position: The position of the clip is expressed in pixels along an X (hori-
zontal) and Y (vertical) axis. Zero for the X axis is the left edge of the
screen, and zero for the Y axis is the top of the screen. The default posi-
tion for any clip is right in the middle. For example, in NTSC-format DV
video, the default position is 360 by 240. You can change the position of
the clip by typing new numbers next to Position, or you can click and
drag left or right on either Position number.
✦Scale: The default scale for any clip is 100, which means its size is 100
percent of the screen size. Reduce the scale to shrink the clip image.
✦Scale Width: If you remove the check mark next to Uniform Scale,
you can adjust height and width independently. With Uniform Scale
unchecked, the Scale control adjusts height, and the Scale Width con-
trol adjusts width.
✦Rotation: Use this control to rotate the clip. Expand the Rotation con-
trol and click and drag left or right on the clock-style rotation control
to spin the image on its axis.
✦Anchor Point: All the other controls assume work off the clip’s anchor
point, which is usually in the center. If you want to rotate the clip around
a corner instead of the center, for example, just move the anchor point.
If you don’t like the changes you’ve made to the Motion controls, just click
the Reset button next to Motion in the Effect Controls tab. This resets the
clip back to the default settings.

Animating a clip
As you play with the Motion controls, you should see how easy it is to
change the on-screen position, size, and orientation of a clip. But what if
you want the clip to move across the screen after you’ve shrunk it? To do
this, you must use key frames. To control motion with key frames, follow
these steps:
1. Click the clip you want to animate on the timeline to select it.
2. Move the CTI to the beginning of the selected clip.
The easiest way to do this is to first position the CTI somewhere over
the clip and then press Page Up on your keyboard.
3. In the Motion controls for the selected clip, click the Toggle
Animation button next to the control you want to animate.
In Figure 11-6, I’m animating the Position control.

4. Adjust the Scale, Position, and any other Motion controls you want to
change.
These settings represent what the clip looks like and where it’s posi-
tioned at the start of the animation.
5. Click the Timeline window to make it active, and press Page Down to
move the CTI to the end of the clip.
6. Adjust the Scale, Position, and any other Motion controls for the clip.
These settings represent what the clip looks like and where it’s posi-
tioned at the end of the animation.
When you make the adjustments just described, Premiere Pro automatically
creates key frames at the beginning and end of the clip. Premiere then auto-
matically calculates how the clip should move and change to steadily go from
one key frame to the next. In Figure 11-6, I’ve started the clip off-screen to
the left and ended it off-screen to the right. As the clip plays, it appears to
move across the screen.
You can add additional key frames anywhere along the path of the clip to
make more dynamic changes. Just move the CTI to a position somewhere
in the middle of the clip and click the Add/Remove Keyframe button in the
Motion controls, and then adjust settings as needed.
Using Effects in Premiere Pro
Personal computers capable of editing video have been widely available for
several years now, and in the last couple of years, they’ve become downright
cheap. This — combined with continuing price drops on DV camcorders —
has led to an explosion in the number of video-editing programs available.
From mild to wild, entry-level to professional, there is a video editor for
every need and budget.
Not all video-editing programs are created equal, however. Many editors
offer special effects that you can apply to your video clips, but few offer the
quality and variety available with Adobe Premiere Pro. You can add even
more effects from third-party vendors.
Effects can help you clean up your video or add special touches that amaze
and astound your audience. What’s really cool about effects is that you can
add them to (or remove them from) any clip you want. Effects do not per-
manently change your clips, so if you aren’t happy with a result, you can
simply delete the offending effect. Although this book isn’t the place to
cover each of Premiere Pro’s effects in detail, this chapter shows you the
basics of using effects — including the brass-tacks specifics of using several
common effects.
Built-in effects
Adobe Premiere Pro comes with over 50 effects built right in. Some of these
effects may not seem immediately useful, but you may be surprised in a
future project when what seems like the most obscure effect comes in handy.
You can get a look at Premiere’s effects by choosing Window➪Effects, or

just click the Effects tab in the Project window. Expand the Video Effects
folder to reveal the following 14 categories:
✦Adjust: These seven effects let you tweak levels of color and light. They
can be useful for fixing color- and light-related problems in your video
clips.
✦Blur & Sharpen: These 11 effects run the gamut from blur to sharpen.
The blur effects allow you to soften the outlines of things to simulate
disorientation, or suggest speed by unfocusing parts of the video image.
The sharpen effects perform a variety of sharpening enhancements to
an image. Use these effects to sharpen images that appear too soft.
✦Channel: This category includes two effects. The Invert effect inverts
colors in a clip. The Blend effect enables you to blend the colors of
superimposed clips.
✦Distort: This folder contains 13 effects that bend, twist, or exaggerate
the shape and view of your video.
✦Image Control: These ten effects change the way color is viewed in your
clips. They can remove a color (or range of colors) from a clip, convert
a color image to black and white, or adjust the overall tint of the image
(useful if, for example, you want to transform an ordinary outdoor
scene into an alien landscape).
✦Keying: These effects allow you to control transparency in clips and
perform compositing effects such as bluescreening.
✦Noise: The Median effect — the only effect in the Noise category — can
be used to reduce noise in the video image. If more extreme settings are
applied, the image begins to look like a painting.
✦Perspective: These four effects add a three-dimensional feel to your
clips — for example, when you bevel the edges of the video image or
create shadows.
✦Pixelate: These three effects modify the pixels that make up your video
image to create some unusual visual coloration and appearances.
(Textures, anyone?)
✦Render: The three Render effects allow you to simulate various proper-
ties of real light. One of the effects simulates lens flares — momentary
bright circles that often occur in video footage when the sun reflects or
glares on the lens. Although you probably work hard to avoid real lens
flares when you shoot video, well-placed simulated lens flares can have
a dramatic effect, especially if you’re depicting a sunrise or sunset. The
Lightning effect is especially cool because you can create realistic light-
ning on-screen.
✦Stylize: These 12 effects create a variety of image modifications. With
the Stylize effects, you can simulate video noise (on-screen “snow”),
create clip mosaics, add texturized or windswept appearances to the
image, and more.
✦Time: The Echo effect creates visual echoes (or double-image) of a pic-
ture. The Posterize Time effect modifies the apparent frame rate of a
clip. Use this effect to make it look like you dropped frames during cap-
ture or output even if you really didn’t.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
✦Transform: These nine effects transform the view of your clip in a vari-
ety of ways. You can rotate the image in three dimensions, you can sim-
ulate a panning effect, or you can simulate a vertical-hold problem on a
TV (you can have a lot of fun with this one; just imagine your friends
banging on their TVs trying to figure out why the vertical hold is
messed up).
✦Video: These three effects help correct video problems or prepare
video for output to tape. You can apply the Broadcast Colors effect to
clips when you want to filter out colors that aren’t broadcast-legal, or
use the Field Interpolate effect to replace missing fields knocked off the
screen by interlacing. If you have a clip with many thin lines, the lines
may flicker when viewed on a regular TV. Use the Reduce Interlace
Flicker effect to soften the image and reduce the flickering problem. 
Applying effects
To apply an effect to a clip, you simply drag the effect from the Effects tab to
a clip on the timeline. (Choose Window➪Effects to open this tab, or click the
Effects tab in the Project window.) You can adjust attributes of an effect by
using the Effect Controls tab. To reveal this tab, click the clip on the timeline
to select it and then choose Window➪Effect Controls, or click the Effect
Controls in the left pane of the Monitor window. The Effect Controls tab
appears, as shown in Figure 11-7. Key features of the Effect Controls tab
include these:
✦Each effect applied to a clip has a separate listing under Video Effects.
Click the arrow to expand the view of options for each effect.
✦To disable an effect, click to remove the tiny circle next to the effect’s
title in the Effect Controls.
✦Each effect has its own unique controls. Click the right-pointing arrow
next to an effect control to view more specific controls. 
✦To enable keyframing so that the effect can be changed over time, click
the Toggle Animation button, shown in Figure 11-7. I show you how to
use key frames in the next section.
✦The Effect Controls tab includes a key frame viewer, which, as you can
see in Figure 11-7, looks like a miniature timeline, complete with its own
CTI (current time indicator).
✦To add a key frame for a control at the current location of the CTI, click
the Add/Remove Keyframe button. Use the arrows on either side of any
Add/Remove Keyframe button to move the CTI to the next (or previous)
key frame.
✦Some effects have Color Pickers. In Figure 11-7, I must use the Color
Picker to choose a fill color for the background after the camera view
has been modified. Some Color Pickers have eyedroppers next to them.
Eyedroppers are used to choose a color from the video image in the
Monitor. To use an eyedropper, click and hold on it, move the mouse
pointer over the desired color in the video image, and then release the
mouse button.
✦To quickly reset all settings back to their defaults, click the Reset button.
(I use this button a lot, especially when I’m working with key frames.)

Using Effects in Premiere Pro
Using key frames
Effects can have a variety of, er, effects on clips in Premiere Pro. Video clips
can be blurred, recolored, distorted, and more. You can apply an effect as
is to an entire clip, or you can set up the effect so it changes over time. To
do the latter, Premiere needs a way to determine exactly how and when to
make such changes. For this purpose, the program uses reference points
called key frames. If you want an effect to change over time, you use key
frames to specify when those changes occur. Premiere Pro automatically
extrapolates how the effect should progress from one key frame to the next.
The types of key frames I’m talking about in this section are effect key frames.
Video codecs (the compression/decompression schemes used to make video
files smaller) use another kind of key frame called a compression key frame.
Although the names sound familiar, these are entirely different things.
After you have applied an effect to a clip, you can adjust that effect by using
key frames. To set key frames, follow these steps:
1. On the timeline, locate the clip that has the effect you want to modify.
2. Select the clip and then open the Effect Controls for the clip (Window➪
Effect Controls) if they’re not already shown.
3. Click the Enable Animation button next to each control that you want
to be affected by key frames.
The Enable Animation button enables the use of key frames for the
effect. If the Enable Animation button is disabled, the effect will be
applied evenly across the entire clip.

4. Move the CTI in the key frames viewer (see Figure 11-7) to the exact
frame where you want to set a key frame.
You can move the CTI by using the playback controls in the Monitor, or
you can use the J, K, and L keys on your keyboard. Use the left- and right-
arrow keys to move a single frame at a time.
5. In the Effect Controls tab, click the Add/Remove Keyframe button
next to an effect control.
You need to add a key frame for each control that you want to change.
In Figure 11-7, I have applied the Camera View effect to a clip. However,
I want the camera view to change only after the clip has played for a few
seconds. Thus, at the first two key frames, I set all the controls to their
defaults. At the third key frame, I adjusted the Longitude, Focal Length,
Distance, and Zoom controls to the desired settings. At the last key frame,
which is at the very end of the clip, I set the exact same settings as at
the third key frame. The effect of these changes is that the clip plays
normally from the beginning until it reaches the second key frame. At
that point, the camera angle starts to morph until it gets to the settings
I specified at the third key frame. At that point, the camera angle remains
morphed until the end of the clip.
6. Set additional key frames as desired.
Don’t forget to use those Previous and Next Keyframe buttons. They
provide an easy way to move from key frame to key frame. If you want
to remove a key frame, simply move to the key frame and click the Add/
Delete Keyframe button to remove the check mark. When you remove
that check mark, you’ll notice that the key frame disappears from the clip.
If you apply multiple effects to a clip, each effect gets its own key frames.
Thus, if you set a key frame for one effect, don’t assume that it applies to
the other effects on that clip as well. To view the key frames for an effect,
click that effect in the Effect Controls tab to select it.
Removing effects
You’ll probably change your mind about some of the effects you apply to
your clips. Don’t feel bad; this is perfectly natural. In fact, you’ll spend a lot
of time in video editing on good ol’ trial and error. You’ll try an effect, you
won’t like it, so then you’ll try something else.
To get rid of an effect, click the clip on the timeline to select it and then
choose Window➪Effect Controls to reveal the Effect Controls tab. You have
two options for removing effects from a clip:
✦You can temporarily disable an effect by clicking the little circle next to
the effect’s listing in the Effect Controls tab. This can be handy because
any settings that you changed for the effect are preserved. With the circle
removed, the clip is disabled and is not applied to the clip when the
sequence is rendered or output.
✦You can delete an effect by clicking its title in the Effect Controls tab
and pressing Delete on your keyboard. Don’t worry! This doesn’t delete
the effect from Premiere Pro, it just removes the effect from the current
clip.

Using Other Video Effects
Lots of effects are available with Premiere Pro, and I couldn’t possibly
describe them all here. Rather than provide a brief overview of many effects,
the following sections show you a detailed approach to using a few common
effects. You can adapt the techniques described here when using other
effects.
Distorting video
Adobe Premiere Pro comes with a plethora of effects that you can use to
distort your video. You can find some of the best ones in the Distort and
Transform folders. Distortion effects range from mild to wild. You may find
that the best way to give your video a custom appearance is to apply multi-
ple effects. Consider the clip in Figure 11-8. I have applied the Pinch effect,
found in the Distort folder under Video Effects. The Pinch effect simulates a
pinching or pulling of a spot in the video image.
To apply the Pinch effect, drag it from the Effects tab and drop it on a clip
on the timeline. The Pinch settings dialog box then appears, as shown in
Figure 11-9. The bottom of this dialog box shows a representation of the
pinch that you’re about to apply. You can use the grid to move the pinch
point, and move the Amount slider to control the degree to which you pinch
the image. (I want an extreme pinch appearance, so I’ve set the slider as
high as it will go.)
You can open the Pinch Settings dialog box at any time by clicking the Setup
next to the Pinch effect in the Effect Controls tab. Use the plus (+) and
minus (–) signs in the Pinch Settings dialog box to zoom in or out on the
preview window.
A minor application of the Pinch effect can give the illusion that the footage
was shot using a very wide-angle lens, also called a fisheye lens.

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Now, to really make things tricky, several seconds into the clip, I want to
zoom in on the image and reduce the pinch effect. To do this, I first apply
the Camera View effect (located in the Transform folder) to the clip. The
Camera View effect contains, among other things, a zoom effect. Next, I add
two key frames to the clip. Between those key frames, the zoom level goes
from the default level (10) to a slightly more zoomed-in level (7). I also change
the key frames at the beginning and end of the clip to match these settings.
Finally, I also create key frames for the Pinch effect so it diminishes as the
camera view zooms in. Figure 11-10 shows the key frames that I created.
Disorienting your audience (on purpose)
Suppose a subject in a movie is sick or disoriented. What is the best way to
communicate this to the audience? You could have someone in the movie
say, “Hey, you don’t look well. Are you sick?” and then the unwell person
can stumble and fall down. That may be effective, but an even better way
to convey a feeling of illness or confusion is to let your audience see through
the subject’s blurry and distorted eyes.

Chapter 11

Using Other Video Effects
You can begin by shooting some footage as if it were from the subject’s
viewpoint. Handhold the camera and let it move slightly as you walk. You
probably don’t need to exaggerate the movement, but the camera shouldn’t
be tripod-stable either. As you shoot, pan across the scene — but not too
quickly — as if the subject were looking around the room. Occasionally you
may want to dip the camera slightly left or right so the video image appears
to tilt. A tilting video image has a strong disorienting effect on the viewer.
Now that you have some footage to work with, you can perform the real
magic in Premiere Pro. One effect that can provide a feeling of illness or
disorientation is Camera Blur (found in the Blur folder). Use key frames to
adjust camera blur throughout a clip, as if the subject’s vision were moving
in and out of focus. Another good one is Ghosting (also in the Blur folder).
Ghosting produces ghost images of moving objects. Similar to ghosting is
the Echo effect, found in the Time folder, which is used in Figure 11-11. Echo
gives you a bit more control over the number and timing of echoed images.
Working in the Golden Age of Cinema
Motion pictures have been around for well over a century now. You may
want to use some old (or at least old-looking) footage in your movie proj-
ects, but thankfully, creating footage that looks old doesn’t require a trip
to some dank film vault deep beneath a Hollywood movie studio. Here are
some ways you can simulate an old-fashioned look with your own video:
✦Pay attention to your subjects and the scene. Cowboys of the Old West
didn’t carry cell phones at their hips, for example, nor was the sky filled
with white condensation trails left by jet airplanes. Remove objects from
the scene that don’t fit the period you’re trying to simulate, and shoot
carefully so the background doesn’t depict modernity.
✦Remove color from the clip. Perhaps the easiest way to convert a color
image to grayscale is to use the Black & White filter in the Image Control
folder, although I prefer to use the Color Balance (HLS) effect. Adjust the
saturation level to –100, which (in effect) makes the clip grayscale. One
advantage of using the Color Balance (HLS) effect is that you can use
key frames to change the effect in the middle of a clip.
Figure 11-11:
The Echo
effect can

the viewer.
505

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Grayscale is just a fancy way of saying black and white. Grayscale is a
more technically accurate term because black-and-white video images
are actually made using various shades of gray.
✦“Weather” the video image. Film tends to deteriorate over time, so if
you’re trying to simulate old footage, you should simulate some of that
deterioration. Use the Noise effect under Stylize to add some graininess
to the video image.
✦Reduce audio quality and if possible use a mono setting. Audio record-
ings made 75 years ago did not use 16-bit stereo sound. To reduce qual-
ity, reduce the sampling rate of the audio when you export your movie.
Alternatively, you may want to go for the “silent movie” effect and not
record any audio at all. Just use an appropriate musical soundtrack and
title screens for dialogue.
✦Speed up the clip. Older film often plays back at a faster speed, so
speed up the clip by selecting it, choosing Clip➪Speed/Duration, and
increasing the Speed percentage in the Clip Speed/Duration dialog box
that appears.
Flipping video
Do you ever wish you could produce a mirror image of a video clip, or
maybe rotate it and change its orientation on the screen? Such modifica-
tions are easy to make with Premiere Pro. Effects that you can use to flip
video can be found in the Transform folder of Video Effects. These effects
include two classics:
✦Horizontal Flip: This effect flips the video left to right, as shown in
Figure 11-12.
✦Vertical Flip: This effect flips the video top to bottom.
When flipping video, watch out for letters and numbers that appear in the
frame. Backward letters stick out like sore thumbs (or rude gestures) when
your audience views the movie.

Adding Web links to movies
The term multimedia is used pretty loosely these days, although few types
of media are as multi as the movies you can create with Premiere Pro. Not
only can your movies contain audio, video, and still graphics, but they can
also include links to the World Wide Web. Of course, for the links to work,
your audience must be watching the movie on a computer that can connect
to the Internet. Also, the movie needs to be output in a format that supports
Web links, such as QuickTime. Web links can be handy if you want a specific
Web page to open during or after playback. To create a Web link, follow
these steps:
1. Move the CTI to the point in a sequence at which you want the link to
be activated.
2. Choose Marker➪Set Sequence Marker➪Unnumbered.
A marker appears on the Timeline ruler. Actually, you can make it a
numbered marker if you want.
3. Double-click the marker.
The Marker dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-13.
4. In the URL field, type the complete URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
for the link target.
The URL is the Web address for the site that you want to open. To be
safe, it should include the http:// part of the address. Consider the
URL that you enter here carefully. Does it point to a page that will still
be online several months (or even a year) from now? Consider how
long users might be viewing copies of your movie.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Test your Web link in the final output format! If it works, the desired Web
page should open in a Web browser. Some formats (such as QuickTime)
support Web links; others don’t.

507

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Be really, really careful when you type the address for your Web URL. Exact
spelling and syntax is crucial, or else your Web link is broken — and that
creates a bad impression with your audience. Furthermore, because most
Web servers run a UNIX-based operating system, everything after the .com
part of the Web address is probably case-sensitive. Watch that capitalization!
Using Effects in iMovie
Obi-Wan lifts his hand, presses a button, and a beam of light shoots out of
the handle of his lightsaber and he’s ready to do battle. Captain Kirk tells
Scotty to “Energize,” and his body turns to sparkles and slowly fades away
as he’s transported across space. Marty McFly climbs into the Delorean and
sits next to the Doc, as the car lifts up from its wheels and zooms off into
the future. The wonderful world of special effects makes the movies that
much more magical.
With iMovie, alas, you can do none of these things. No lightsabers, no trans-
porters, no all-aluminum sports-car time machines. (Am I the only one who
wishes they still made the Delorean?) iMovie’s special effects are a bit more
basic, but you can do some interesting things to the images, including chang-
ing the speed, running clips backward, adjusting the color, switching to black
and white, and introducing effects to make entire scenes look a bit more
artsy or more filmlike.
In this section, you look at all the special effects built into iMovie. You can
use some of these effects to change the colors, brightness, and contrast of
scenes. Others can be used to create interesting looks and effects, such as
black and white or sepia tone. Then you see how you can use the effects to
create transitions and even a few science-fiction-type effects for your film.
Finally, you take a quick look at iMovie’s simple controls for slow- and fast-
motion video.
Built-in effects
Most of the effects built into iMovie are there to give you some control over
how each frame of your clips looks in terms of its color, brightness, contrast,
and other settings. For instance, the Adjust Colors effect is powerful stuff,
making it possible to turn a color video into black and white or to change
the colors and brightness of a clip to emphasize something within the con-
text of your story.
Other effects are just simplifications of the Adjust Colors and Brightness/
Contrast effects. The Black and White effect, for example, makes it possible
to turn a clip into black and white for, perhaps, a Hitchcockian result. The
Sepia Tone effect is another one-button effect that changes colors so that
your images look more like old photographs or early film.
So, you can change the look of a particular clip. Sounds cool. But (in my
best infomercial voice) wait . . . there’s more! One trick of these effects is
that you don’t have to apply the effect to the entire clip in the same way. So,
for instance, a clip can start at one color level and then progress to another
color level. This color shift is an effect all to itself — the audience watches
the shift take place.

Using Effects in iMovie
The Effects panel
You accomplish all of your effects wizardry in the Effects panel, so I take a
look at what makes it different. To open the panel, click the Effects button at
the bottom of the Shelf pane. Now you see the Effects panel interface, most
likely with the Adjust Colors effect selected (see Figure 11-14).
The Effects panel is certainly familiar if you’ve worked with the transitions or
title panel, but it also offers some subtle differences. Select an effect in the list
of effects, and the controls at the bottom of the panel change. Some effects,
such as Adjust Colors, offer various sliders for changing the effect. Others,
such as Black and White, don’t have sliders. Every time you select a different
effect or change one of the settings, a preview appears in the Effects preview
area in the top-right corner — as long as a clip is selected on the timeline.
Above the list of effects are two more sliders; these determine the timing
of the effect. (Note that these sliders represent the amount of time from 
the beginning of the clip for Effect In and the amount of time from the end of
the clip for Effect Out.) If you want to affect the entire clip with the selected
effect, the Effect In time should be set to 00:00 (all the way left), and the Effect
Out time should also be set to 00:00 (all the way right). When you apply the
effect to the clip, the entire clip is affected. (For instance, the entire clip is
sepia tone if that’s the effect you selected.)
If you select different Effect In and Effect Out times, something else happens —
the effects happen more gradually. That is, if you set the Effect In time for a
few seconds after the clip has started and set the Effect Out time for later in
the clip, the effect takes place over time, as the audience watches. In this
case, if you had chosen Sepia Tone, the clip would become increasingly more
sepia tone-ish (that can’t be a word) as it plays. (We get back to this a bit more
in the section “Creating Special Looks.”)

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
After you set the sliders, you’re left with either two or three buttons in the
top-left corner of the Effects panel (depending on the effect and your previ-
ous action). This, frankly, is more thinking than we’ve been forced to do
with iMovie’s other panels so far. (And when I have to think more, I feel let
down.) The buttons are Preview, Update, and Apply. Here’s what the but-
tons do:
✦Preview: As with transitions and titles, the Preview button on the
Effects panel displays a frame-by-frame preview of the effect in the
Monitor.
✦Update: Apply any changes you’ve made to an existing effect (which
usually means that everything gets rendered all over again).
✦Apply: The button you click to begin the rendering process. (Go figure.)
So you see how to set effects: Just select a clip in the Clip Viewer or timeline,
make some selections in the Effects panel, and then click the Apply button.
iMovie places a tiny checkerboard square icon in the clip’s thumbnail to let
you know that an effect has been applied.
Interestingly, emptying the Trash in iMovie (File➪Empty Trash) does not
affect your ability to restore an effects clip to its original state, even though it
does affect any other sort of Undo command within iMovie. So, don’t worry
about being able to reverse your special effects even after emptying the
Trash.
You may notice that when effects are applied to clips, the clips aren’t split
into more than one clip, even if the effect doesn’t span the entire length of
the clip.
Like transitions and titles, effects have to render in iMovie after you’ve
selected a clip and an effect and clicked the Apply button. A small line
appears under the thumbnail, filling with red as the rendering progresses. As
with other rendering, you have to wait for the process to finish before you
can view the clip in the monitor, full screen, or through your camcorder.
Filtering and Fixing the Picture
Although lightsabers are no doubt cool, the fact remains that most of
iMovie’s effects simply help you change the hue, brightness, and contrast
of the image. That’s not to say that you can’t get a lot out of such changes.
You can, in fact, use color shifts and hue changes to create some interest-
ing transitions, as you see in the “Using active effects” section, later in the
chapter. But that still doesn’t make for Star Wars, eh? (Although you can still
pull off the cheapest Star Wars effect out there: Breathe loudly into the
microphone like Darth Vader. Put that behind your Halloween videos.)
The effects used to alter the look of the picture include Adjust Colors and
Brightness/Contrast. I take a look at each individually.

Filtering and Fixing the Picture
Adjusting colors
Select a clip in the Timeline, pop up the Effects panel, and select Adjust
Colors. Three sliders appear below the Effects scrolling list. The sliders
are Hue Shift, Color, and Lightness, as shown in Figure 11-15.
The sliders are self-explanatory to a certain extent, but I’m not earning my
keep if I don’t go behind the labels and tell you what’s going on here. (Sounds
like a VH-1 series, doesn’t it? “Behind the Labels.”) Cut to a bulleted list:
✦Hue Shift: Hue shift, at its simplest, changes the colors within your image.
The word hue itself suggests a gradation of color, so that moving the
slider shifts all the colors in the image toward one side or the other of
a certain spectrum. In iMovie, this shift is from Red/Yellow on the left
side to Blue/Green on the right side.
Although you don’t want to make shifts too dramatic (unless you’re
going for a particularly wacky, surreal color scheme), a little shifting
can make up for bad light, an incorrect white balance, or refraction
that affected the colors you were shooting. You may find that if a clip
is a little too green or blue in its natural state, sliding the hue a bit to
the left helps stabilize the colors. If something is too yellow, red, or
orange, shifting the hue to the right can help.
✦Color: The Color slider simply enables you to scale each pixel in your
images from their full color value toward an associated gray value.
Sliding the bar all the way to Vivid lightens things up slightly, almost
giving them a Ted Turner colorized effect. It’s okay, given a certain
music video quality. Sliding toward B&W (black and white), even slightly,
can create a more interesting effect. You can get the suggestion of black-
and-white images, but there really is color value there, which can be
useful for an audience. Woody Allen comes to mind: Any video that you’d
like to make look a little more like older film, a 1930s period piece, or
something similar could take a slight color shift toward black and white.
(You could go all the way to black and white, but a digital black-and-
white effect tends to look flat.)
✦Lightness: Again, lightness creates a pixel shift, but note that it’s not a
brightness control, which is different from lightness (even though they
rhyme). In this case, if you slide the slider toward Dark, all the pixels
shift toward black, which means the darker pixels (the blues, browns,
and grays) get there first, with the lighter pixels right behind. Slide
toward Bright, and all pixels start shifting toward white, with lighter
colors getting there first. At a full Bright setting, the entire image is
white. (In Figure 11-15, you can tell my Lightness setting is moving to
a full Bright.)
To apply any of these effects to the entire clip in a uniform way (no shift-
ing while the clip plays back), select 00:00 as the Effect In time and 00:00 as
the Effect Out time. Then click Apply. The clip is altered according to your
desires.
511

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Adjusting brightness and contrast
To specifically adjust the brightness and contrast of your images, select a
clip and then select Brightness & Contrast from the Effects list. Two sliders
appear in the preference area of the Effects panel: Brightness and Contrast.
Here’s what they do:
✦Brightness: Slide from Dark to Bright, and the image lightens up quite a
bit, with the lightest pixels becoming lighter very quickly as the darker
pixels become lighter much more slowly. If you slide all the way to Bright,
you get a fully white image. Slide all the way to dark, and you get a fully
black image.
✦Contrast: Contrast moves individual pixels, as much as it can, more
toward their closer dark or light value: Dark colors get darker and light
colors get lighter. This is useful for a clip that seems washed out, with
too many color values too close. In fact, contrast is often a more useful
tool than brightness, especially if you were filming in sunlight or good
artificial light but need a slightly more vivid clip.
Again, it’s not a great idea to compensate for bad lighting or bad footage
with these effects. Only very small value changes will work; larger changes
simply make it clear that you’ve been messing with the brightness or con-
trast. If there’s any trick to setting brightness and contrast, it’s to use the
values together to create a slightly more robust image. For instance, if you
need to brighten the overall image somewhat, nudge the Brightness slider
to the right a bit. Now, nudge up the contrast along with it, close to the
same amount. You should see that the image brightens but also maintains
Use these sliders to adjust colors.

a certain amount of depth, thanks to the contrast. Figures 11-16 and 11-17
show the difference a little contrast can make.
Creating special looks
The Adjust Colors and Brightness & Contrast effects are the intellectuals 
of the bunch, with all their sliders, options, controls, and . . . well . . . big
ideas. The others among the Effects crowd are the specialists. They do one
thing and do it well, and then they go home to their families and watch a
little TV. On the weekends, maybe they attend a meeting or play some pool
down at the union hall.
Black & White, Sepia Tone, and Water Ripple don’t even have options; you
just point and shoot, so to speak. With Sharpen and Soft Focus, you have one
slider for selecting more or less. Which you choose is more or less up to you.
Here’s a look at my favorite special effects:
✦Black & White: You can achieve the same look by using Adjust Colors
and going in yourself to switch to black and white, but this simple effect is
a bit easier. Note that you need images with a lot of contrast (bright lights
casting dark shadows) if you’re going to use black and white with digital
video. My suggestion is that unless the clip looks great in the preview
using the straight Black & White filter, consider cheating a little with the
Adjust Colors sliders, especially the Color slider, to give your clip a black-
and-white feel. (See the “Adjusting colors” section, earlier in the chapter.)

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
✦Sepia Tone: This is intended to make the clip look like an old silent film,
a daguerreotype from the Old West, or the like. It looks good in certain
situations, especially when the video shows young children wearing big
cowboy hats and stomping around like Bad Bart.
✦Sharpen: If you’ve ever used Photoshop or a similar program, this effect
will be familiar. Each pixel is quantized a bit (a fancy word for “perform
a little math on it to make it more uniform”) to make the overall appear-
ance seem like you’ve sharpened the focus of the image. It doesn’t work
very well because it’s a digital effect. The bottom line is that it looks like
you applied a sharpen filter to the image, not that you’ve corrected the
focus problem. But it’s an interesting effect to use for a night-vision
sequence or when you want the clip to look more digitized. (“Captain,
I’ve got them on the scope right now!”)
One place Sharpen might help is if you’ll be exporting to QuickTime
video, especially video that’s less than full screen. A slight sharpen
effect — coupled with compressing the video and changing the size
from 640 x 480 (full TV display) down to 320 x 240 or smaller — could
result in a slightly better image than you started with. You’re still better
off if the image starts in focus. You’re also much more likely to get that
call from Ron Howard you’ve been waiting for.
✦Soft Focus: This is the opposite of Sharpen, putting a slight blur on all
the pixels to make them seem a little softer and less focused. Again, it’s
a digital effect and something that’s better achieved with a special lens
for your camera. That said, this effect is a bit more useful in my opinion.
You can use soft focus to give your clips a filmlike quality — a very little
softening can make some of the harshness of video and the scenes a
little more pleasing to the eye. This is especially useful for close-up
shots of people in which you’d like to smooth their skin tones and give
them a warm, friendly feel. If you want to show your subject sweating,
stay away from soft focus.
Want to see soft focus in action? Watch pretty much any old movie with
a female star. It was very common with Hepburn movies (both Hepburns,
but a little more so with Audrey). It’s often pronounced in shots that
intercut between the male lead and the female one — the woman is
usually shot with a very soft lens, almost to the point (in some cases)
where it looks blurry. If you have someone on tape that you want the
camera to love and cuddle, consider a little soft focus if you aren’t
already using a soft lens filter on your camera.
Using active effects
Here’s another secret to great filmmaking: Most of these effects can look
great when they’re active or transitional, meaning the audience sees them
applied gradually. Sharpen is only so useful when applied to an entire clip
(although it certainly can be useful at times), but it can be an interesting
transitional effect when it happens over time. Using the right combinations
of settings, you can use Sharpen to take a clip from being in full focus to
gradually being sort of digitally enhanced by the end of the clip — an effec-
tive and interesting transition to the next scene or perhaps to a Sci-Fi effect.
The same thing can be true of gradually changing from color to the Black &
White effect or gradually changing from color to the Sepia Tone effect. All
these changes can be effective special effects and transitions.
514

Book II
Chapter 11

Filtering and Fixing the Picture
Plus, the change can go in either direction. You can start from sepia tone
and work back to regular colors or vice versa. Or you can have a clip go
from regular to effect and back again. The key is changing the Effect In and
Effect Out sliders.
Changing Effect In
How you set the Effect In time determines when the effect is first applied to
the clip and how gradually. The rule is: If you want the effect to be active at
a particular second, select that time as your Effect In time. If you want the
effect to take place gradually over the entire clip, select an Effect In time
somewhere close to the end of the clip. (You can even select a time that’s
beyond the end of the clip, if you don’t want the full effect to occur during
the length of the clip.)
Suppose you have a six-second clip and want it to go to sepia tone about
halfway through the clip and then stay there. Select the Sepia Tone effect
and move the Effect In slider to about 03:00, which is three seconds. Now
the preview shows you that the Sepia Tone effect ramps up gradually from
00:00 to 03:00 and then continues through to the end of the clip.
Note that these effects never begin abruptly if they’re planned for the middle
of a clip — they always take effect gradually. It’s simply a question of how
gradually. With the same sepia tone example, if you set the Effect In time to
the end of the clip, about 06:00, the entire clip is spent slowly changing from
regular colors to sepia tone.
515
When in doubt, split the clip
This far into your travels through the wonderful
world of iMovie’s special effects, you may have lit
on an interesting question: What do I do if I can’t
do what I want to do? As long as you’re still talking
about iMovie’s video effects (and not some issue
with your career ambitions), I probably have the
solution.
The most likely solution is to split the clip. The one
thing you can’t really do with an iMovie special
effect is make it immediately appear or disappear
within a single clip. For instance, you can’t cause a
clip to play for a few seconds, immediately turn
black and white, play for a few seconds, and imme-
diately turn back to color. Instead, iMovie transi-
tions those effects slowly.
If you split the clip, though, you can apply the effect
immediately to the new second half of the clip.
For this example, split the clip twice, into three
parts. On clip one, put no effect. On clip two, put a
black-and-white effect with no Effect In and Effect
Out times. For clip three, leave it color. When you
play back the video, the clips go from color, imme-
diately to black and white, and then to color again.
(Think of the flash transitions between black and
white and color in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill
Volume 1. Sassy.)
In any instance where you can’t figure out how
to make something happen — even outside the
realm of iMovie effects (transitions, titles, sound,
graphics) — think about whether it would work if
you split the clip. Often enough, that’s the answer.
(Now if only splitting my bank accounts would
somehow help.)

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
With this whole-clip transition possible, you have some intriguing potential.
For instance, you can select an exaggerated effect — a major color shift, full-
white brightness, full-black darkness, high soft focus, or high sharpen effects.
Now, set the Effect In slider to the end of the clip’s running time, and that
effect ramps up slowly. By the time you get to the end of the clip, it’s fully
black, white, fuzzy, sharpened, or taken over by wacky colors. In effect,
you’ve created a nice transition.
So what can you do with an Effect In transitional effect? Here are some of
my favorites:
✦Blow out! The blow out, or white out, effect makes a nice transition or a
good, basic sci-fi effect. You achieve the effect by selecting Brightness &
Contrast and sliding both sliders all the way to the right. Now, set an
Effect In time that’s pretty late in the clip and watch the magic unfold in
the preview area. As the clip moves on, it is filled with brightness and
contrast until the last frames, which are completely bright white. It’s
good for a Twilight Zone type plot twist: With scary music, a frightened-
looking actor, and enough tension in the story, this effect looks like a
nuclear flash, a time warp, or another type of major event. (It also looks
good over a still clip image for that “all time has stopped at the end of
the world” look.)
✦The Medeci effect. Another favorite is a gradual move from focused
to blurry using the soft focus controls. Select a clip, select Soft Focus,
and then slide the slider all the way to High. Now, set the Effect In time
for late in the clip. As the clip plays on, it becomes increasingly blurry.
What’s this good for? How about the point of view of a character in your
story who has just been poisoned by the bad guy and is going under?
Now you can do your own version of the effect made famous by pretty
much every James Bond movie.
✦Old West family portrait. You know that effect in which a full-color, 
full-action image slowly dissolves into a still image that looks like an
old photograph? You could do that with a gradual move to sepia tone
(with the next clip a still clip that’s also in sepia tone colors). Select
Sepia Tone as the effect and slide Effect In almost all the way to the
end of the clip. After the clip is rendered, tack on a still clip of that last
frame (Edit➪Create Still Clip) that’s also in sepia tone. Now, you have a
few seconds for a dramatic swell of music to end the voiceover (“And
that’s the story of the trip of ’62”) or to begin rolling credits.
✦Dream sequence. Okay, maybe there is a use for the Water Ripple effect.
Select it and choose an Effect In time. (In the selected clip, your actors
should be making that Wayne’s World dream sequence noise or scratch-
ing their chins while . . . wondering . . . what . . . if. . . .) By the end of the
clip, the image is rippling and you can move on to the next clip, which
shows the dream sequence playing out.
Changing Effect Out
Changing the Effect Out time does pretty much the opposite of what I’ve
just been discussing. The clip starts will a full-blown effect and then gradu-
ally changes to its regular colors, brightness, and texture. Start the clip with
a sepia tone and change back to regular colors or start at full bright white
516

Book II
Chapter 11
Using Special Effects
in iMovie and Adobe
Premiere Pro
Filtering and Fixing the Picture
and return to a regular brightness. You do this by setting Effect In to 00:00
(the effect starts with the beginning of the clip) and Effect Out to some
amount of time, in seconds, before the clip ends.
One major difference between the Effect In and Effect Out sliders is that the
latter counts from the end of the clip. If, for example, you have a ten-second
clip and want the effect to end after four seconds, you must set the Effect
Out slider to 06:00 — that four seconds is six seconds from the end of the
ten-second clip.
You saw how Effect In can work for transitions, but how can Effect Out work?
In a sense, Effect In settings let you transition out of a clip, whereas Effect Out
can let you transition into a clip. Here are a few ideas:
✦What time is it? Set Soft Focus to High and then set an Effect Out point
just a second or two into your clip. The clip comes gradually into focus,
giving you a sense that you’ve transitioned into the scene — sort of like
you just woke up (or that you’re watching from the point of view of a
character just waking up).
✦Yes, it’s World War I, but we’re shooting in color. You see this effect
used often to transition the beginning of an historical movie into a
modern color presentation, such as a black-and-white WWI dogfight
followed by a transition from black-and-white to color for the charac-
ters. Select the Black and White effect and then set an Effect Out time.
The image moves from black and white to full color in front of your
eyes. (Clearly, this one could be used also with the Sepia Tone effect
for similar reasons, especially if you’re transitioning from piano music
and an Old-West-style opening credit sequence into a story you’re
telling in color.)
✦Admiral, we have them on the satellite feed. Select the Sharpen effect
and set an Effect Out time. The image begins very sharp and then transi-
tions to a regularly focused shot, suggesting that the satellite operator/
hacker/spy has just successfully tweaked the digital image into full-
focused video.
Changing the In and Out
You can change the In, you can change the Out, and if you like, you can do
both. If you set an Effect In point and an Effect Out point, you can cause an
effect to happen within the clip and then return it to normal before the clip
ends.

s you rush to trim video clips, create transitions, and add some cool
special effects to your movies, overlooking the audio portion of the
project is an easy thing to do. But the audio portion of a movie is nearly as
important — or as important, depending on whom you ask — as the video
portion.
In Chapter 7 of Book II, I show you how to record better audio and import it
into your computer. This chapter shows you how to make good use of that
audio in your movie projects. Most movie-editing programs also come with
built-in sound effects and other audio tools, so I show you how to use those
as well. Finally, I help you choose effective musical soundtracks for your
movies.
Using Audio in a Project
Most movie-editing programs follow similar patterns. They all use story-
boards and timelines for assembling the project, and most programs have
similar windows for organizing and previewing clips. Many programs also
have a lot in common when it comes to editing audio. For example, even the
most affordable editing programs usually have separate audio tracks in the
timeline for background music, narration (or sound effects), and the audio
that accompanies the video clips that are on the timeline. (Audio tracks are
described in greater detail in the next section.)
Many movie-editing programs can also show audio waveforms. A waveform
is a line that graphically represents the rising and falling level of sound in an
audio clip. Figure 12-1 shows the waveform for some narration that I recorded
in Pinnacle Studio. Waveforms are useful because they allow you to edit your
audio visually, often with pinpoint accuracy. By looking at the waveform, you
can tell when loud sounds or extended periods of quiet occur.
519

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
Although many movie-editing programs use audio waveforms, Apple iMovie
isn’t one of them. Fortunately, plenty of other programs can display audio
waveforms — including Apple Final Cut (both the Express and Pro HD ver-
sions), Adobe Premiere Pro, Pinnacle Studio, and Windows Movie Maker.
Understanding audio tracks
A movie program can play several sources of audio at once. For example,
while you hear the audio that was recorded with a video clip, you may also
hear a musical soundtrack and some narration that was recorded later. When
you’re working on a movie project in your editing software, each of these
unique bits of audio would go on its own separate audio track in the timeline.
Most editing programs provide audio tracks for main audio (the audio that
was recorded with a video clip), music, and narration. More advanced edit-
ing programs offer you many more audio tracks that you can use any way
you see fit. Adobe Premiere, for example, can provide up to 99 separate
audio tracks on the timeline. Although it’s difficult to imagine anyone actu-
ally needing that many audio tracks, having too many is better than not
having enough.
Pinnacle Studio provides three separate audio tracks, as shown in Figure 12-2.
To lock a track in Studio, click the track header on the left side of the timeline.
Apple iMovie handles audio tracks a little differently, but you still have
essentially three audio tracks to work with. The main audio track is actually
hidden inside the video track. Two other audio tracks handle sound effects

and background music. You can extract audio from video clips (simply
select the clip on the timeline and choose Advanced➪Extract Audio), but
doing so causes the main audio to take up one of the other two audio tracks.
Figure 12-3 shows iMovie’s audio tracks. You can enable or disable audio
tracks by using the check boxes on the right side of the timeline. This is
helpful during editing when you want to hear just one or two audio tracks
at a time.
Adding audio to the timeline
Adding audio to the timeline is pretty easy. Record and import your audio
as described in Book II, Chapter 7, and then simply drag and drop it to an
audio track. You can move clips by dragging them to the left or right in their
respective tracks, and you can trim them by dragging on the edges. In fact,
you’ll find that editing audio tracks is a lot like editing video tracks — you
can use the same basic editing techniques that I describe in Chapter 9 of
Book II.
You may want to edit main audio independently of the video clip with which
it is associated. In iMovie, first extract main audio from the video clip by
selecting the clip and choosing Advanced➪Extract Audio. In Studio, click
the track header on the left side of the timeline to lock either the main
video or main audio track. When the main video track is locked, you can
edit the main audio track without affecting clips in the video track.
One nice feature of iMovie is that it allows you to link audio clips to video
clips. For example, suppose that you’ve recorded some narration to go along
with a video clip. If you decide to move that video clip to a different part of
the timeline, you have to move the narration clip as well. If the two clips are
linked, moving one also moves the other. To link an audio clip to a video clip
in iMovie, follow these steps:
1. Position the audio and video clips that you want to link on the timeline.
2. Move the play head to the beginning of the audio clip.
3. Click once on the audio clip to select it.
4. Choose Advanced➪Lock Audio Clip at Playhead.
A yellow pin appears on both the audio and video clips, as shown in Figure
12-4. If you move the video clip to a different place on the timeline, the linked
audio clip moves with it. To unlink the clips, select the audio clip and choose
Advanced➪Unlock Audio Clip.

Adjusting volume
Perhaps the most common thing anyone does to audio tracks is adjust the
volume. As you preview your project, you may notice that the background
music seems a little too loud or that the narration isn’t loud enough. You
may also have sounds in the main audio track that you want to eliminate,
without affecting the rest of the audio clip. Virtually all video-editing pro-
grams allow you to adjust volume in two different ways:
✦You can adjust the overall volume of an entire clip or track.
✦You can adjust volume dynamically within a clip, making some parts of
the same clip louder and some parts quieter.
To begin adjusting volume in iMovie, select the Edit Volume check box at
the bottom of the timeline. In Studio, click the clip that you want to modify
and then choose Toolbox➪Change Volume so that Studio’s audio toolbox
appears above the timeline.
Each program displays audio rubberbands across audio clips. Rubberbands
(see Figure 12-5) aren’t just for holding together rolled up newspapers or
your ponytail. In video programs, they show you the volume for an audio
clip, and they allow you to make dynamic adjustments to the volume
throughout the clip.
Adjusting overall volume
Modifying the overall volume for an audio clip or a whole track is pretty
simple, but the procedure varies a bit depending on which program you
are using.

Using Audio in a Project
In Apple iMovie, follow these steps to adjust the overall volume:
1. Click a clip to select it. ( To select and adjust multiple clips simultane-
ously, hold down Ô as you click each clip.)
Be careful not to click the purple rubberband line. If you accidentally
click the rubberband and a dot appears on the line, press Ô+Z to undo
the change.
2. With the desired clip(s) selected, adjust the Volume slider to the left
to reduce volume or to the right to increase volume.
As you adjust the slider (shown in Figure 12-5), you see the rubberband
lines move up or down.
Pinnacle Studio provides a variety of volume controls in the audio toolbox,
as shown in Figure 12-6. To open this toolbox, click an audio clip on the time-
line and choose Toolbox➪Change Volume. The toolbox contains a separate
set of controls for each of the three audio tracks, as follows:

To adjust the overall volume for an entire track, turn the knob at the top of
the track’s volume controls. As you turn the knob, you see the blue audio
rubberband line for the entire track move up or down on the timeline. To
adjust the volume for a specific clip, place the play head at the very begin-
ning of that clip on the timeline and move the volume slider for that track
up or down. Then place the play head at the end of the clip, and adjust the
volume slider back to the middle to restore the volume of subsequent clips
on the timeline.
You can also mute whole tracks on the timeline. In iMovie, simply remove
the check mark from the right side of the timeline next to the track that you
want to mute. In Studio, click the icon at the top of the volume controls (see
Figure 12-7) in the audio toolbox to mute a given track.
Adjusting volume dynamically
Believe it or not, I very seldom adjust the overall volume of an entire clip
or track. I usually prefer to adjust volume dynamically throughout the clip.
Adjusting volume dynamically allows me to fine-tune audio to better match
other things that are going on in the project. I adjust volume dynamically at
times like these:
✦When narration is about to begin: I may reduce the volume of back-
ground music a bit so that the spoken words are more easily heard.
✦When the sound changes between video clips: Such a change often
sounds abrupt or harsh. I can reduce that harshness by fading audio
in at the beginning of the clip and fading it out at the end. Studio has
handy Fade In and Fade Out buttons (see Figure 12-6), which automati-
cally make fade adjustments to the audio rubberbands for a clip.
✦When I can eliminate unwanted sounds from a clip: I can eliminate 
off-camera sounds by dynamically adjusting volume, as I’ve done in
Figure 12-7.
Dynamic volume adjustment is where audio rubberbands really come in
handy. Click once on a rubberband for one of your audio clips. When you
click the rubberband, you’ll notice that a little dot appears. You can click
and drag that dot up or down to adjust the volume of the clip. Not only can
you place as many dots as you can squeeze onto a rubberband, you can
also move those dots around on the rubberband to make constant adjust-
ments throughout the clip. Like real rubberbands, audio rubberbands are
stretchy and can be moved quite a bit, but unlike real rubberbands, they
don’t snap back when you stop moving them. Play around a bit with the
rubberbands to see just how much fun volume adjustments can be!
Those little dots on audio rubberbands act like pins to hold the bands in
place. To get rid of a dot, click and drag it off the top or bottom of the clip.
Twang! The dot disappears, and the rubberband snaps back into place.

Working with sound effects
Sound effects can really separate a good movie from a great movie. In Chap-
ter 7 of Book II, I suggest that if a picture is worth a thousand words, some-
times a sound is worth a thousand pictures. Consider how the following
sound effects can affect the mood of a scene:
✦A quiet room somehow seems even quieter if you can hear the subtle
ticking of a clock.
✦Applause, cheering, or laughter suggests how the viewer should feel
about an event in the movie.
✦Chirping birds suggest peace and serenity.
✦Footsteps make movement seem more real, even when the feet are not
shown in the video image.
Those are just a few examples, but you get the idea. You can create and
record your own sound effects, and in Book II, Chapter 17, I offer some tips
for doing exactly that. Fortunately, most video-editing programs now come
with ready-to-use libraries of common sound effects to enhance your movie
projects. The next two sections show you how to find and use the sound
effects in iMovie and Studio.

Using sound effects in Apple iMovie
To view a list of sound effects in iMovie, click the Audio button above the
timeline and choose iMovie Sound Effects from the menu at the top of the
audio pane. A list of sound effects appears (as shown in Figure 12-8), includ-
ing standard sound effects as well as special Skywalker Sound Effects that
were new with iMovie 3. Skywalker Sound, as you may know, is the brain-
child of George Lucas of Star Wars fame, and the sound effects that are
included with iMovie are very high-quality effects. (I’m told Mr. Lucas is
no slouch at filmmaking.)
To preview a sound effect, choose it from the list and click the Play button
in the audio pane. To use a sound effect in your project, simply click and drag
it to an audio track on the timeline. You can trim and adjust the volume of
sound effects just as you would any other audio clip.
Using sound effects in Pinnacle Studio
Pinnacle Studio comes with a diverse collection of sound effects. To view a
list of them, click the Show Sound Effects tab on the left side of the album
or choose Album➪Sound Effects. When you view the Sound Effects tab of
the album, you may not actually see a list of effects, particularly if you’ve
used this tab to import MP3 audio or other sounds that are not directly
connected with Pinnacle Studio. If sound effects aren’t shown, click the

Animals folder and then click the Open button. A list of animal sound effects
appears in the album (as shown in Figure 12-9). To preview a sound effect,
simply click it in the album. To use it in your movie project, click and drag it

Adding a Soundtrack to Your Project
Background music for movies is nothing new. Even before the day of “talkies,”
silent movies were traditionally accompanied by musicians who played in
the theater as the movie was shown. I’m sure that you’re eager to use music
in some of your movie projects as well. The next two sections show you
how to add soundtrack music to your movies.
Adding music from a CD
In Book II, Chapter 7, I show you how to import music from audio CDs or
MP3 files. After you have inserted an audio file into your editing program,
you can add the file to the music track on your timeline. The procedure
varies, depending on which editing program you are using, as follows:
✦In Apple iMovie, use iTunes (again, as described in Book II, Chapter 7)
to import music from audio CDs into your iTunes library. Then click
the Audio button in iMovie, choose iTunes from the menu at the top
of the audio pane, and click and drag a song from your iTunes library
to an audio track on the iMovie timeline.
✦In Pinnacle Studio, place a music CD in your CD-ROM drive and choose
Toolbox➪Add CD Music. The Add CD Music toolbox appears. Choose
the audio track that you want to use in the Track menu, and then click
the Add to Movie button. Close the Add CD Music toolbox, and then
click the Play button under the preview window to play your timeline.
The first time that you play the timeline, Studio imports the music from
the CD. After the music is imported, you can remove the CD from your
CD-ROM drive.
Generating background music with SmartSound
Pinnacle Studio comes with a tool called SmartSound, which can automati-
cally generate royalty-free music in a variety of styles to match your project.
To generate some music from SmartSound, open a project in Studio and

Part III: The Cutting Room Floor: Editing Your Video
choose Toolbox➪Generate Background Music. The audio toolbox appears,
as shown in Figure 12-10. (If you did not install the SmartSound files on your
hard drive during installation, you must insert the Studio program disc in
your CD-ROM drive.)
SmartSound offers music in a variety of styles. Each style includes several
songs; most have a few different styles available. Click the Preview button
to preview a style, song, and version. When generating background music,
figure out approximately how long you want the musical piece to play. For
example, when three 10-second clips are placed on the timeline, their total
length is a little more than 30 seconds. Adjust the duration of the music by
typing a new time in the Duration box (in the upper-right corner of the audio
toolbox). When you click the Add to Movie button, SmartSound automati-
cally generates a piece of music in the chosen style, song, and version, and
it plays for approximately the duration that you chose. You can also name
the selection if you want, using the Name field at the top of the toolbox.
One advantage of SmartSound’s automatically generated music is that you
can use it without paying royalties every time someone views your movie.
Even so, remember that SmartSound does have some licensing restrictions.
They’re worth reviewing before you use the music in a movie that you plan
to show to the public. For SmartSound license details, click the SmartSound
button in the Studio audio toolbox.

Chapter 13: Exporting 
Digital Video to Tape
In This Chapter
 Preparing your movie for TV playback
 Setting up your hardware for export
 Exporting your movie
I
don’t think I’m going out on a limb by suggesting that almost everyone
you know owns a TV and a VCR. These ubiquitous bits of home entertain-
ment gear are all that anyone needs to view your latest movie production —
because exporting your movie to videotape is pretty simple. Well, it’s usually
simple, especially if you have the right hardware. But even if all you have is
a digital camcorder, sending your movie to videotape isn’t very difficult.
This chapter shows you how to get your movie ready for videotape and
helps you prepare the movie project and your export hardware. Then I
show you how to export the movie to tape.
Prepping Your Movie for TV Playback
Throughout this book, I harp on the fact that televisions and computer moni-
tors are very different. This means that the video that looks just peachy in
the preview window of your editing software may not look all that great when
it’s viewed on a regular TV. Computer monitors and TVs differ in the follow-
ing important ways:
✦Color: Computer monitors and television screens generate colors differ-
ently. This means that colors that look fine on your computer may not
look so hot when viewed on a TV.
✦Pixel shape: Video images are made up of a grid of tiny little blocks
called pixels. Pixels on computer monitors are square, but the pixels
in TV images are slightly rectangular. Basically this means that some
images that look okay on your computer may appear slightly stretched
or squeezed on a TV. This usually isn’t a problem for video that’s cap-
tured from your camcorder, but still images and graphics that are gener-
ated on your computer could be a problem.
✦Interlacing: TV video images are usually interlaced, whereas computer
monitors draw images by using progressive scanning. The main problem
that you encounter when you export a project to tape is that the very thin
lines that show up on the screen may flicker or appear to crawl. Pay spe-
cial attention to titles, where thin lines are likely to appear in some let-
ters. See Book II, Chapter 2 for an in-depth discussion of interlacing and
progressive scanning.
529

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
In view (so to speak) of these issues, I strongly recommend that you try to
preview your movie on an external monitor before burning it to a DVD or
exporting it to tape.
If you use the LCD on your camcorder to preview your movie, keep in mind
that the LCD panel probably isn’t interlaced. However, the camcorder’s view-
finder probably is interlaced. This means that flickering thin lines (for exam-
ple) may show up in the viewfinder but not on the LCD panel. Preview the
movie using both the LCD and the viewfinder before you export it.
Setting Up Your Hardware
Getting your hardware ready for exporting a movie to tape isn’t that difficult.
The easiest thing to do is connect your digital camcorder to your FireWire
port and turn on your camcorder to VTR or Player mode. Oh yeah — be
sure to insert a blank tape into the camcorder. After your movie is recorded
onto the tape in your camcorder, you can connect the camcorder to a regu-
lar VCR and dub your movie onto a regular VHS tape.
I strongly urge you to use a fresh tape that has black video recorded on its
entire length. This prevents errors in communication between your digital
camcorder and your computer. See the sidebar “Blacking and coding your
tapes” in Book II, Chapter 5 for instructions on how to prepare a digital
videotape for use.
If your master plan is to eventually record your movie on a VHS tape, you
may want to skip the middleman — that would be your digital camcorder —
and record straight from your computer to a regular VCR. To do so, you
have the following three basic options:
✦Use an analog video-capture card. Analog capture cards (such as the
Pinnacle AV/DV board) can usually export to an analog source as well as
import from one. When you export video using an analog card, I strongly
recommend that you use the software that came with that card. Most
analog capture cards come with special utilities to help you import and
export video. The Pinnacle AV/DV board uses Pinnacle Studio to capture
and export video. To get Studio ready for analog export, follow these
steps:
1. Connect the analog outputs for the card to the video inputs on
your VCR.
2. Make sure that the software that came with the capture card is set
to export to the correct ports.
The Pinnacle AV/DV, for example, uses the Pinnacle Studio software.
In Studio, choose Setup➪Make Tape. The Pinnacle Studio Setup
Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-1. On the Make
Tape tab, choose Studio AV/DV analog in the Video drop-down list.
3. Make sure that the right analog output ports are selected.
The Pinnacle AV/DV board has both composite and S-Video outputs,
so choose the one to which you have connected your VCR.
530

Book II
Chapter 13
Exporting Digital
Video to Tape
Exporting the Movie
Composite and S-Video connectors are described in Chapter 6 of Book II.
✦Use a video converter. Book II, Chapter 6 also describes how to capture
analog video using a converter that connects to your computer’s
FireWire port. The converters that I list in Chapter 6 also have analog
outputs to which you can connect a VCR.
✦Use your digital camcorder as a converter. I know, I said I was going to
show you how to avoid using your camcorder as the middleman when
you export to VHS tape. But if you don’t have an analog-capture card or
a video converter, you may be able to connect your digital camcorder to
your FireWire port and then connect a VCR to the camcorder’s analog
outputs. If nothing else, this arrangement reduces wear and tear on
your camcorder’s expensive tape-drive mechanism. Some digital cam-
corders don’t allow you to make this connection because some models
can’t send video out the analog ports at the same time they are taking
video in through the FireWire cable. Experiment with your own cam-
corder and VCR, and see whether this arrangement will work for you.
If you are exporting to a VCR, make sure that a new, blank tape is inserted
and ready to use and make sure that the VCR is set to the right channel.
(Many VCRs have to be set to a special “AV” channel to accept video from
composite video cables.) As a last step before you begin your export, pre-
view your movie on a TV that’s connected to the VCR to make sure that the
VCR is picking up the signal.
Exporting the Movie
After your hardware is set up properly and you’re sure that your movie will
look good on a regular TV, you’re ready to export the movie. Regardless of
what software you are using, keep in mind that — like video capture —
video export uses a lot of memory and computer resources. To make sure
that your system is ready for export, follow these tips:

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
✦Turn off unnecessary programs. If you’re like I am, you probably feel
like you can’t live without your e-mail program, Internet messaging pro-
gram, Web browser, and music jukebox all running at once. Maybe you
can’t live without these things, but your video-editing software can get
along just fine without them. In fact, the export process works much
better if these programs are closed, and you’re less likely to have
dropped frames or other quality problems during export.
✦Disable power-management settings. If you’re exporting a movie that’s
30 minutes long and your hard drive is set to go into power-saving mode
after 15 minutes, you could have a problem during export because the
computer may mistakenly decide that exporting a movie is the same
thing as inactivity. Power management is usually a good thing, but if
your hard drive or other system components go into sleep mode during
export, the video export will fail. Pay special attention to this if you’re
working on a laptop, which probably has pretty aggressive power-
management settings. Check the following settings:
• On a Mac running Mac OS X Panther, click the Energy Saver icon in
System Preferences to adjust power settings. Crank up both the slid-
ers in the Energy Saver window to Never, and deselect the Put the
Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible check box before you export
your movie.
• In Windows, open the Control Panel, double-click the Performance
and Maintenance icon, and then double-click the Power Options
icon. Set all the pull-down menus to Never before exporting your
movie.
✦Disable screen savers. Screen savers aren’t quite as likely to ruin a
movie export as power-management settings, but it’s better to be safe
than sorry. Follow these guides to disable screen savers:
• On a Mac running Mac OS X Panther, open the Desktop & Screen
Saver icon in System Preferences and drag the Start screen saver
slider to Never in the Screen Saver dialog box.
• In Windows, right-click a blank area of the Windows desktop and
choose Properties from the menu that appears. Click the Screen
Saver tab of the Display Properties dialog box, and choose the
screen saver None. (That’s my favorite one, personally.)
Whenever you export a movie to tape, you should place some black video
at the beginning and end of the movie. Black video at the beginning of the
tape gives your audience some time to sit down and relax between the time
they push the Play button and the time the movie starts. Black video at the
end of the movie also gives your viewers some time to press Stop before
that loud, bright static comes on and puts out someone’s eye.
Some editing programs — like Apple iMovie — have tools that allow you
to automatically insert black video during the export process. I show you
how to insert black video using iMovie in the next section. But if you’re
using some other software that doesn’t have this feature — like Pinnacle
Studio or Windows Movie Maker — you need to add a clip of black video

Exporting the Movie
to the beginning and end of the project’s timeline. You can usually do this
by creating a blank full-screen title. I show you how to do this in the section
“Adding black video to your timeline,” later in this chapter.
Exporting to tape in Apple iMovie
Like most Apple software , iMovie is entirely functional and to the point.
And at no time is this more evident than when you want to export your
movie to tape. iMovie cannot export directly to an analog capture card,
but it can export video at full quality to your digital camcorder. To export
your finished movie to tape, follow these steps:
1. Connect your digital camcorder to the FireWire port on your com-
puter, and turn the camera on to VTR or Player mode.
Make sure that you have a new, blank videotape cued up and ready in
the camcorder.
2. In iMovie, choose File➪Export.
The iMovie Export dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-2.
3. Choose To Camera from the Export drop-down list.
4. Adjust the Wait field if necessary.
The Wait field controls how long iMovie waits for the camera to get
ready before it begins to export. I recommend leaving the Wait field set
at 5 seconds unless you’re exporting to a video converter (such as the
Dazzle Hollywood DV Bridge) that’s connected to your FireWire port.
In that case, you may want to increase the wait to about 10 seconds
to ensure that you have enough time to press the Record button on
your VCR.
Whatever you do, don’t reduce the Wait field to less than 5 seconds.
Virtually all camcorders need some time to bring their tape-drive
mechanisms up to the proper speed, and the Wait field gives the
camcorder time to get ready.

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
5. Adjust the two Add fields to determine the amount of black video that
will be recorded at the beginning and end of the tape.
I recommend putting at least 30 seconds of black video at the beginning
and end of the movie.
6. Click the Export button.
iMovie automatically exports your movie to the tape in your camcorder.
If you’re exporting directly to a digital camcorder, iMovie automatically
controls the camera for you; you don’t have to press the Record button
on the camcorder. But if you are exporting through a video converter,
you must press the Record button on your analog VCR.
Exporting to tape in Pinnacle Studio
Exporting movies to tape from Pinnacle Studio is a slightly more complex
process than what is found in, say, Apple iMovie or Windows Movie Maker.
But one of the main reasons for this complexity is that Studio gives you more
export options than iMovie — and it exports better-quality video than Movie
Maker by far. The next two sections show you how to export your movie to
tape from Pinnacle Studio.
Adding black video to your timeline
In the section “Exporting the Movie,” earlier in this chapter, I describe the
importance of placing black video at the beginning and end of a movie that
will be recorded onto tape. If you plan to export your Pinnacle Studio movie
project to tape in a digital camcorder, you need to add some black video
clips to the beginning and end of the timeline. To add a black video clip to
the beginning of your project, follow these steps:
1. In the Edit mode, click the Titles tab on the left side of the album.
A selection of titles appears in the album.
2. If any tracks on the timeline are currently locked, click the track
headers on the left side of the timeline to unlock them.
When a track is locked, a tiny lock icon appears on the track header and
a zebra-stripe pattern appears across the track. Unlocking all tracks is
an important step because you’re going to insert a title clip at the begin-
ning of the timeline. If all tracks are unlocked, they all shift over auto-
matically when you insert the title. This keeps all your narration, music,
and title overlays properly synchronized with your video.
3. Click and drag any title to the beginning of the video track on your
timeline.
4. Double-click the title to open the title editor, as shown in Figure 13-3.
5. Select the text in the title, and press Delete to delete all the title text.
6. Adjust the duration of the title by using the Duration field in the
upper-right corner of the title editor.
I recommend a duration of 30 seconds.

7. Close the title editor.
The blank title appears at the beginning of the timeline.
8. Click the blank title once to select it, and then choose Edit➪Copy.
9. Move the play head to the end of the timeline.
10. Choose Edit➪Paste.
A copy of the blank title now appears at the end of the movie as well.
I also like to add a Dissolve transition between the initial black video clip
and the first clip of the movie. This technique makes the beginning of the
movie a little easier on the eyes as it fades in. In Figure 13-4, I have done this
by dragging a Dissolve transition to the timeline from the Transitions tab of
the Studio album. See Chapter 10 of Book II for more on using transitions.
Exporting the movie
Pinnacle Studio provides the Make Movie mode as your central location for
exporting a finished movie project, whether you’re exporting to tape, DVD,
the Internet, or a carrier pigeon. (Just kidding — Export to Carrier Pigeon
won’t be available until the next version of Studio, if not later.) To open the
Make Movie mode, choose View➪Make Movie.
Adjust duration.

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
If any of the clips in your movie were captured at Preview quality (see Book II,
Chapter 6 for details on Preview quality capture), you are prompted to insert
the tapes that contain the original source clips at full quality. Make sure that
you have those tapes handy, and follow the on-screen instructions to recap-
ture the footage.
You’re ready to start exporting your movie to tape. Follow these steps to
do so:
1. In the Make Movie mode, click the Tape button at the left side of the
Make Movie window.
Basic video settings appear in the Make Movie window, as well as the
estimated file size for the exported file. Studio needs to export the movie
as a file before it can be recorded onto tape, and that file is probably
going to be big. As shown in Figure 13-5, I have a movie that is only
about 50 seconds long, and yet it will create a file that is over 157MB
in size. This is why I always recommend that you buy the biggest hard
drive that you can afford.
2. Click the Settings button.
The Make Tape tab of the Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box
appears. As I describe in the section “Setting Up Your Hardware,” earlier
in this chapter, make sure that the correct output source is selected in
the Video menu. In Figure 13-6, I am preparing to export to a DV cam-
corder that’s connected to my FireWire (IEEE 1394) port.

3. If you’re exporting to a DV camcorder, select the Automatically Start
and Stop Recording check box. 
With this option enabled, Studio automatically controls your camcorder
for you, meaning that you won’t have to press the Record button on the
camcorder. If you’re exporting to a video converter such as the Dazzle
Hollywood DV Bridge, deselect this check box.

If you enable automatic control of your DV camera, you should set the
Record Delay Time to 5 seconds, as shown in Figure 13-6. This gives the
camcorder’s tape mechanism enough time to spool up to the proper
speed for recording.
4. Click OK to close the Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box.
5. Back in the Make Movie window, click the Create button at the
bottom of the export control.
Studio creates a file for your movie. The process may take several min-
utes, especially if your movie is long and has a lot of effects and transi-
tions. When the file is created, the export control tells you that your
project is ready for output, as shown in Figure 13-7.
6. Click the Play button under the preview window.
If you chose to give Studio automatic control of your DV camcorder (in
Step 3), Studio automatically starts the recording feature on your cam-
corder, stopping when the movie has been exported.
If you’re exporting through an analog output (such as a Pinnacle AV/DV
card), you must press the Record button on your analog VCR a few sec-
onds before you click the Play button in the Studio preview window.
One nice thing about Studio is that while it’s waiting for you to click
the Play button, the software sends out a black video signal through
the analog outputs. This means that you can press the Record button
on your analog VCR and let it record that black video for 30 seconds
or so before you play your movie in the export process. Presto! — you
eliminate the need to add black video clips to the beginning and end of
the timeline. When the movie has been exported, Studio reverts to out-
putting black video through the analog outputs. You should record 20
to 30 seconds of this black video on the VHS tape before you press the
Stop button.

In This Chapter
 Choosing a video format
 Exporting your movie
 Optimizing your movie’s export settings for the Internet
 Finding an online home for your movies
 Putting your movies on the Web
S
ince the first home movie cameras became popular about 50 years ago,
friends, family, and neighbors have taken part in a vaunted tradition:
falling asleep in front of someone else’s home movies. Until recently, this
tradition required that you, the moviemaker, lure your unsuspecting audi-
ence to your house, baiting them with the promise of good food and drink.
But now thanks to the Internet, you can bore, er, I mean, entertain many
more people with your movies without ever having to prepare a single hors
d’oeuvre tray.
Software companies have tried to make it easier to place your movies online.
Nearly all video-editing programs — including Apple iMovie, Pinnacle Studio,
and Windows Movie Maker — provide tools to help make your movies ready
for sharing online. (For the lowdown on editing your movies, see Chapters 8
through 12 of Book II.)
When you want to share movies on the Internet, the most important consid-
eration is file size. Movie files are usually really big, and a majority of Internet
users still have slow dialup modem connections. This means that big movie
files take a long time to download, and the long download time may discour-
age your audience members from viewing the movies.
This chapter helps you prepare your movies for online use. I show you how
to use the most efficient file formats so that your video files aren’t too big,
and I also show you how to find an online home for your movies once
they’re ready to share.
Choosing a Video Format
Many different video formats are available for the movies that you edit 
on your computer. Each format uses a different codec. (A codec, short for 
compressor/decompressor, is a software tool that is used to make multimedia
files smaller.) Common video file formats include MPEG and AVI, but these
539

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
two formats are usually not suitable for movies that you plan to share
online because they have big file sizes. Three other popular formats, how-
ever, are perfectly suited to the online world. These formats are as follows:
✦QuickTime (.QT): Many Windows users and virtually all Macintosh users
have the QuickTime Player program from Apple. QuickTime is the only
export format that’s available with iMovie. Pinnacle Studio cannot export
QuickTime movies, but some more advanced Windows programs like
Adobe Premiere can.
✦RealMedia (.RM): This is the format that is used by the popular
RealPlayer, which is available for Windows and Macintosh systems,
among others. Pinnacle Studio can export RealMedia-format video.
✦Windows Media Video (.WMV): This format requires Windows Media
Player. Almost all Windows users and some Macintosh users already
have it. Both Pinnacle Studio and Windows Movie Maker can export
Windows Media Video.
Each of these three video formats has strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately,
the format that you choose depends mainly on the editing software that
you’re using. For example, if you’re using iMovie on a Mac, QuickTime is
probably your only option. In the section “Comparing player programs,”
later in this chapter, I introduce you to the various software programs that
are used to play these Web-friendly video formats.
Streaming your video
Doing stuff on the Internet usually means downloading files. For example,
when you visit a Web page, files that contain all the text and pictures on
that Web page are first downloaded to your computer and then your Web-
browser program opens them. Likewise, if someone e-mails you a picture
or a document with yucky work stuff, your e-mail program must download
the file before you can open it.
Downloading files takes time, especially if they are big video files. You sit
there and you wait. And wait. And wait. Finally the movie file is finished
downloading and starts to play, but by then you’ve left the room for a cup
of coffee again. But software designers are crafty folk, and they’ve devised
methods of getting around the problem of waiting a long time for down-
loads. They have come up with the following basic solutions:
✦Streaming media: Rather than downloading a file to your hard drive,
streaming files can be played as the data streams through your modem.
It works kind of like a radio, where “data” streams through in the form
of radio waves, and that data is immediately played through the radio’s
speakers as it is received.
With streaming audio or video, no file is saved on your hard drive. To
truly stream your movies to other people, your movie files need to be
on a special streaming server on the Web. There is a remote possibility
that your Internet service provider offers a streaming media server, but
most service providers do not.
540

Book II
Chapter 14
Putting Your Movies
on the Internet
Choosing a Video Format
✦Progressive download: Newer video-player programs can “fake” stream-
ing pretty effectively. Rather than receiving a movie signal that’s broad-
cast over the Internet like a radio wave, viewers simply click a link to
open the movie as if they were downloading the file. In fact, they are
downloading the file. But as soon as enough of the file has been received,
the player program can start to play it. The program doesn’t need to wait
for the whole file to download before it starts to play. Current versions
of QuickTime, RealPlayer, and Windows Media Player all support pro-
gressive download.
The really cool thing about progressive download is that you don’t need
any special kind of server to host the files. Just upload the video file to
any server that has enough room to fit it in.
I’m being kind of picky about terminology here. Many people now refer to
progressive download video files as “streaming video,” and because the two
formats basically function the same way, why not? The good news is that
you don’t need to do anything special to stream (or progressively download,
or whatever you want to call it) your movies to your audience. Just output
your movie in QuickTime, RealVideo, or Windows Media Video format, and
let the player programs do the rest.
Comparing player programs
When you share your movie over the Internet, you’re actually sharing a file.
Make sure that your intended audience can open that file. Different movie-
file formats require different programs for playback. The following sections
introduce you to the three most common programs that are used for play-
ing movies from the Internet.
QuickTime
Apple QuickTime (see Figure 14-1) is perhaps the most ubiquitous media
player in the personal computer world today, which makes it a good overall
choice for your audience. QuickTime is available for Macintosh and Windows
systems and is included with Mac OS 9 and higher. QuickTime can play MPEG
and QuickTime media. The QuickTime Player also supports progressive
download, where files begin playing as soon as enough has been down-
loaded to allow continuous playback. The free QuickTime Player is avail-
able for download at the following Web site:
www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
Apple also offers an upgraded version of QuickTime called QuickTime Pro.
QuickTime Pro costs about $30 (the regular QuickTime Player is free). Key
features of QuickTime Pro are as follows:
✦Full-screen playback
✦Additional media-management features
✦Simple audio and video creation and export tools
✦Advanced import/export options
541

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
If you already have iMovie (and therefore the regular QuickTime), you
don’t need the extra features of QuickTime Pro. Your audience doesn’t
need QuickTime Pro either (unless, of course, they want to watch movies
in full-screen mode). In most cases, the standard QuickTime Player should
suffice. Apple iMovie exports QuickTime-format files. If you’re a Windows
user, QuickTime Pro allows you to convert MPEG files to QuickTime format.
Some advanced Windows editing programs (such as Adobe Premiere) can
also export files in QuickTime format.
RealPlayer
Another very popular media player is RealPlayer from RealNetworks.
RealPlayer is available for Macintosh, Windows, and even UNIX-based
systems. The free RealPlayer software is most often used for RealMedia
streaming media over the Internet, although it can also play MPEG-format
media. Pinnacle Studio allows you to export movies in the RealMedia format
using the Streaming option in the Make Movie window. I show you how to
export a RealMedia movie in the section “Exporting Movies for the Online
World,” later in this chapter. To download the RealPlayer in its various
incarnations, visit www.real.com/.
Although RealNetworks offers a free version of the RealPlayer (as shown in
Figure 14-2), you have to search its Web site carefully for the Free RealOne
Player link before you can download it. RealNetworks offers other pro-
grams as well, and although they’re not free, they offer additional features.
RealNetworks has specialized in the delivery of streaming content, and it
offers a variety of delivery options. You can use RealNetworks software to
run your own RealMedia streaming server, or you can outsource such
“broadcast” duties to RealNetworks.
A complaint that’s often heard about RealPlayer is that the software tends to
be intrusive and resource-hungry once installed. Some people also complain
that the program collects information about your media-usage habits and
sends that information to RealNetworks. Although RealPlayer is extremely

ware on their computers. RealMedia is an excellent format, but I recommend
that you offer your audience a choice of formats if you plan to use it; include
(for example) QuickTime or Windows Media Video.
Windows Media Player
Microsoft Windows Media Player (version 7 or newer) can play many
common media formats. I like to abbreviate the program’s name as WMP
because, well, it’s easier to type than Windows Media Player. WMP comes
preinstalled on computers that run Windows Me or Windows XP. Although
the name says “Windows,” versions of WMP are also available for Macintosh
computers that run OS 8 or higher. Figure 14-3 shows Windows Media Player
running in Mac OS X. WMP is even available for Pocket PCs and countless
other devices! WMP is available for free download at the following Web site:

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
Windows Media Player can play video in MPEG and AVI formats. Although
Pinnacle Studio can output both of these formats, they’re not terribly useful
for online applications because they create big files and have an appetite
for resources. Windows Media Player can also play the Windows Media
Video (WMV) format, and Studio can output that as well (by using the
Streaming option in the Make Movie window — I show you how in the sec-
tion “Exporting Internet movies from Studio,” later in this chapter). I like
the WMV format because it provides decent quality (for Web movies) with
remarkably small file sizes.
What are the compelling reasons for choosing WMP (the Macintosh version
is shown in Figure 14-3) over other players? Choose Windows Media Player
as your format for one or more of the following reasons:
✦Most or all of your audience members use Windows. Most Windows
users already have WMP installed on their systems, so they won’t have
to download or install new software before viewing your Windows
Media–format movie.
✦You want the look, but not the expense and complexity, of streaming
media. If you don’t want to deal with the hassle of setting up and main-
taining a streaming-media server, Windows Media format files can pro-
vide a workable compromise. WMP does a decent simulation of streaming
media with progressive downloadable video: When downloading files,
WMP begins playing the movie as soon as enough of it is downloaded
to ensure uninterrupted playback.
✦You’re distributing your movie online, and an extremely small file
size is more important than quality. The Windows Media format can
offer some very small file sizes, which is good if your audience will be
downloading your movie over slow dialup Internet connections. I
recently placed a 3:23-long movie online in Windows Media format,
and the file size was only 5.5MB. Of course, the movie was not broad-
cast quality, but because most of my friends and family still have slow
dialup connections to the Internet, they appreciated the relatively
small download size.
Exporting Movies for the Online World
When you output a movie from Pinnacle Studio in MPEG or AVI format, you
run into a familiar trade-off: Although those two formats can offer high qual-
ity, they’re usually too big to use on the Internet, regardless of whether you
plan to place your movie on a Web page or e-mail it to some friends. For
online use, the QuickTime, RealMedia, and Windows Media Video formats
are much better. The following sections show you how to export Web-
friendly movies from Apple iMovie and Pinnacle Studio.
Making QuickTime movies with iMovie
If you’re using Apple iMovie and you want to make movies in QuickTime
format, you’re in luck. QuickTime is the only movie file format that iMovie
can produce. QuickTime movies can be played using the QuickTime Player
program, which is available for free for Windows and Macintosh systems.
To output in a different format, such as RealMedia, you must use more
advanced software, such as Final Cut Express.

Exporting Movies for the Online World
Pinnacle Studio can export movies in RealMedia or Windows Media Video
format, but not in QuickTime format. To create QuickTime movies in
Windows, you need QuickTime Pro or a more advanced editing program
such as Adobe Premiere.
Exporting a QuickTime movie from iMovie is pretty simple. The QuickTime
format offers a variety of quality and output settings that you can adjust,
and iMovie provides several easy-to-use presets. You can also customize
export settings. Follow these steps to export a QuickTime movie:
1. When you’re done editing your movie in iMovie, choose File➪Export.
The iMovie: Export dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-4.
2. Choose To QuickTime from the Export menu.
3. Choose the best preset for the way that you plan to distribute your
movie from the Formats menu.
iMovie provides three preset formats for export: Email, Web, and Web
Streaming. Table 14-1 (at the end of these steps) lists the specifications
for each preset as well as the CD-ROM and Full Quality DV presets. Unless

E-mailing your movies
The World Wide Web seems to get all the attention
these days, but I think that e-mail, more than any-
thing else, revolutionized the way that we commu-
nicated during the last decade. Most of your
friends, relatives, and business associates prob-
ably have e-mail addresses, and you probably
exchange e-mail messages with those folks on a
regular basis.
E-mail is already a great way to quickly share sto-
ries and pictures with others, and now that you’re
making your own movies, it seems only natural to
start e-mailing your movie projects to friends as
well. Before you do, keep in mind that movie files
tend to be really big. Most e-mail accounts have
file-size limitations for e-mail attachments, some-
times as low as 2MB. Other e-mail accounts don’t
allow file attachments. And of course, many people
still have slow dialup connections to the Internet,
which means that it will take them a long time to
download a movie that you send them.
To e-mail a movie to someone, first ask the person
whether it’s okay to do so. Send an initial e-mail that
says something like, “Hi there! I just finished a
really awesome movie and I want to send it to you.
The movie is in QuickTime format, and the file size
is 1.3MB. Can I e-mail it to you?” Most people will
probably say yes, and they’ll appreciate that you
took the time to ask them first.

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
your movie is very short, the CD-ROM and Full Quality DV presets gener-
ally produce files that are too big for online use. To fine-tune your set-
tings, choose Formats➪Expert Settings.
4. Click the Export button.
A Save Exported File As dialog box appears.
5. If you chose a preset format, give your movie a filename, choose a
folder in which to save it, and click the Save button to save your
movie to a file and finish the export process.
If you chose a preset format in Step 3, you’re done! For more informa-
tion about getting your movie online, see the “Putting Your Movie on
the Web” section, later in this chapter.
If you chose Formats➪Expert Settings, you still have a few more steps
to complete in the export process. Your Save Exported File As dialog
box looks like that shown in Figure 14-5, and you have some additional
settings to adjust. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can either choose
Presets from the Use menu or click the Options button. If you click
Options, the Movie Settings dialog box appears.
6. (Optional) In the Movie Settings dialog box, select the Video and
Sound check boxes to include both in your movie.
7. (Optional) In the Movie Settings dialog box, click the Settings button
under Video and adjust the video settings.
The Compression Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-6.
Start by choosing a codec from the menu at the top of the dialog box.
The Sorenson or H.263 codecs are pretty good for most movies, and the
Motion JPEG A codec works well for movies that will be played on older
computers. MPEG-4 — which I’ve chosen in Figure 14-6 — provides a
superior balance of quality and compression, but viewers must have
QuickTime 6 (or later) to play it.

Adjust the Quality slider, and preview your video image. The Best qual-
ity setting provides better picture quality, but it increases the file size.
In the Frames Per Second drop-down list, choose a frame rate (in Figure
14-6, I’ve chosen 15 frames per second), or just choose Best from the
menu to let iMovie automatically determine a good frame rate. More
frames per second increase the file size.
I recommend that you do not change the Key Frame Every x setting.
(The default value is 24 — that is, a key frame occurs once every 24
frames — and a smaller number means more key frames.) Key frames
help QuickTime compress and decompress the movie. More key frames
provide better quality, but they also increase the file size.
Click OK when you’re done adjusting the compression settings. You’re
returned to the Movie Settings dialog box.
8. (Optional) In the Movie Settings dialog box, click the Filter button.
The Choose Video Filter dialog box appears. Here you can apply filters
to your video image that can blur, sharpen, recolor, brighten, and perform
a variety of other changes to the picture. Most filters also have adjust-
ments that you can make by using slider controls. A preview of your
video image appears in the Choose Video Filter dialog box so that you
can see the affects of the various filters. I don’t usually find these filters
very useful because I normally apply filters or effects to my video during
the editing process. After making your selections, click OK to close the
Choose Video Filter dialog box.
9. (Optional) In the Movie Settings dialog box, click the Size button to
adjust those settings.
In the Export Size Settings dialog box that appears, choose Use Current
Size or choose Use Custom Size, and enter a custom width and height in
pixels. As shown in Table 14-1, a common frame size for Web movies is
240 pixels wide by 180 pixels high. Click OK to close the Export Size
Settings dialog box.

10. (Optional) Back in the Movie Settings dialog box, click the Settings
button under Sound.
The Sound Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-7. For
online movies, choose QDesign Music 2 from the Compressor drop-
down list. Reduce the sampling rate in the Rate field (for online use,
I recommend 22.05 kHz or lower). Switching from Stereo to Mono also
reduces the file size. Click OK to close the Sound Settings dialog box.
11. (Optional) In the Movie Settings dialog box, select the Prepare for
Internet Streaming check box to take advantage of streaming or pro-
gressive download for this movie, and select the Fast Start option in
the Streaming menu.
12. Click OK to close the Movie Settings dialog box, and then click Save
in the Save Exported File As dialog box.
The movie is exported with the settings that you provided.
13. Preview your movie in QuickTime, and check the file size of the
movie.
If the movie file is too big, re-export it with lower quality settings (such
as a smaller frame size, lower frame rate, or lower sample rate for the
audio). If the movie is smaller than you expected, you may want to 
re-export it with slightly higher quality settings. When you’re done, you
can share your QuickTime movie file online by attaching it to an e-mail
or by placing it on a Web site. (In the section “Putting Your Movie on the
Web,” later in this chapter, I show you how to find and establish an
online screening room for your movie.)

Exporting Internet movies from Studio
Pinnacle Studio provides you with a number of different export options.
Two Web-friendly formats available in Studio are RealVideo and Windows
Media. To begin exporting your finished movie by using either of these for-
mats, follow these steps:
1. Launch Pinnacle Studio, and choose View➪Make Movie.
2. In the Make Movie window that appears, click the Stream button on
the left.
As shown in Figure 14-8, the export controls now include radio buttons
for Windows Media or RealVideo.
3. Choose a format, and then click the Settings button.
The Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box appears. In the next two
sections, I describe the settings that are available on the Make RealVideo
and Make Windows Media tabs. Make your adjustments to these settings,
and then complete Steps 4 and 5.
4. Adjust the settings to your liking, and then, back in the export con-
trols, click the Create Web File button.
5. Choose a location for your movie, and name it in the Save As dialog
box that appears.
Your movie is ready for viewing. See the section “Putting Your Movie on
the Web,” later in this chapter, for more details.

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
Using the RealVideo format
RealVideo is a popular format for online videos, and making RealVideo
movies in Pinnacle Studio is pretty easy. In the Make Movie window, click
the Stream button and then select the RealVideo radio button. Next, click
the Settings button. The Make RealVideo tab of the Pinnacle Studio Setup
Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-9.
Review the following settings, adjusting them as needed:
✦Title: Enter a title for your movie. This title will appear in the program
window when people view your movie, so it should be written in plain
English.
✦Author: That’s you! Enter your name here.
✦Copyright: Enter the year. You can enter the month and day, but that’s
not necessary.
✦Keywords: Enter some keywords that relate to your movie. This can
help people who are searching for your movie using the keywords that
you list.
✦Video Quality: Choose a video quality option here. Most of the time, the
safest choice in this menu is Normal Motion Video. The Smoothest
Motion Video option works well with video that doesn’t have a lot of
action, whereas the Sharpest Image Video option is best for video that
does have a lot of action. The Slide Show option shows a series of still
images, which obviously isn’t ideal for most video. If you choose the No
Video option, no video is included in the file.
✦Audio Quality: Choose an option from this menu that matches the
majority of the audio in your project. Choices include No Audio, Voice
Only, Voice with Background Music, Music, and Stereo Music.
✦Video Size: Select a frame size for your video image here.
✦Web Server: If you know that your movie will be placed on a RealServer
streaming media server, choose the RealServer option. Otherwise,
choose HTTP.
Figure 14-9:

550

Book II
Chapter 14
Putting Your Movies
on the Internet
Exporting Movies for the Online World
✦Target Audience: If your movie will be placed on a RealServer, you can
choose multiple options here. The server automatically detects the con-
nection speed of each person who accesses your movie, and a movie of
the appropriate quality level is sent. Movie quality settings are automat-
ically tailored to the target audience that you choose.
If you’re placing your movie on a regular Web server (HTTP), you may want
to output two different versions of the same movie for people with different
connection speeds. Output a lower-quality movie with the Dial-up Modem
setting, and then output a higher-quality version of the same movie with one
of the DSL/Cable settings. Give each file a unique name, and provide sepa-
rate descriptive links to each one on your Web page.
Using the Windows Media format
Although Microsoft was late to the online multimedia game, Windows Media
Video is quickly becoming one of the most popular video formats on the
Web. Pinnacle Studio can export directly to Windows Media format. To do
so, choose View➪Make Movie, click the Stream button on the left side of the
Make Movie window, and then select the Windows Media radio button. You
can review and adjust those settings by clicking the (surprise!) Settings
button in the Make Movie window. The Make Windows Media tab of the
Pinnacle Studio Setup Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-10.
When you adjust settings for a Windows Media export, check the following
items:
✦Title: Enter a plain-English title for your movie here. This title will appear
at the bottom of the Windows Media Player window when your movie is
played.
✦Author: They can’t give out awards if they don’t know who made the
movie! Enter your name here to give yourself proper credit.
✦Copyright: Enter a year (and month and day if you like) here.
✦Description: Type a brief description of your movie. This description
will scroll across the bottom of the Windows Media Player window as
the movie plays.
Figure 14-10:

551

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
✦Rating: Give your movie a rating if you want.
✦Markers: If you include markers in your Windows Media movie, viewers
can jump from clip to clip by pressing the Next and Previous buttons in
their Windows Media Player programs. I have added a marker for every
clip (refer to Figure 14-10). If you select the Markers for Named Clips
Only option, only clips that you manually named while you were editing
your project will have markers.
✦Playback Quality: Choose the Low, Medium, or High presets in the menu
on the left. If you choose Custom, a second menu appears to the right,
displaying a wider selection of presets. A summary of movie settings for
each preset is shown under the Playback Quality menus.
Putting Your Movie on the Web
After your movies are exported in a Web-friendly format, it’s time to make
those movies available on the Web. This means that you have to upload
your movies to a Web server (basically a big hard drive that is connected to
the Internet, set up so that anyone with a Web browser can access files kept
on it). The next two sections help you find a Web server on which to store
your movie files, and I show you how to make a simple Web page that can
serve as your online theater.
Finding an online home for your movies
If you want other people to be able to download and watch your movies, you
must place the movie files on a Web server. Your Internet service provider
(ISP) may provide some free Web-server space with your Internet account.
This free space is usually limited to 5 to 15MB, but the exact amount can
vary. You can use your Web-server space to publish pictures, movies, and
Web pages that anyone on the Internet can see. Check with your ISP to find
out whether you have some available Web server space, and if you do, get
instructions for uploading your files to its Web server.
If your ISP doesn’t provide Web-server space or if you can’t get enough space
to hold all your movie files, don’t worry. Plenty of other resources are avail-
able. Several companies specialize in selling server space that you can use
to store your movies. Three services are as follows:
✦.Mac (www.mac.com): This service from Apple includes e-mail tools, an
address book, antivirus service, and most importantly, 100MB of stor-
age space on its Web server. Uploading movie files to .Mac is just as easy
as copying files to different drives on your computer. The .Mac service
costs approximately $100 per year and provides many more features
than I can list here.
✦HugeHost.com (www.hugehost.com): As the name implies, HugeHost.com
lets you put huge files online. The service is quite affordable, as well.
For example, 1000MB (yes, that’s 1GB) is just $5 per month, or $55 per
year. See the HugeHost Web site for other pricing plans.
552

Book II
Chapter 14
Putting Your Movies
on the Internet
Putting Your Movie on the Web
✦Neptune Mediashare (www.neptune.com): This service is partnered with
Microsoft so that you can easily access the Neptune Web site directly
from within Windows Movie Maker. When you export a movie for the
Web from Movie Maker, you are given the opportunity to log on to your
Neptune Mediashare account and upload files instantly. The Mediashare
Pro service provides 100MB of storage space for $39 per year.
Regardless of what you use as a Web server for your movie files, make sure
that you get specific instructions for uploading. You also need to know what
the Web address is for the files that you upload. You can then send that
address to other people so that they can find and download your movie.
Creating a (very) simple Web page
Yes, you read that heading correctly: I’m going to show you how to create a
simple little Web page. No, I’m not going to tell you everything you need to
know about designing and managing a Web site (so you can start breathing
again), but making a simple Web page is pretty, um, simple. To make a Web
page, open a text-editing program, as follows:
✦Macintosh: Open the Applications folder, and then double-click the
TextEdit icon.
✦Windows: Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad.
After you have your text-editing program open, type the following text,
exactly as shown here:
<html>
<head>
<title>My Online Theater</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h1>My Online Theater</h1>
<p>
<a href=”Newport.wmv”>Newport By the Sea</a> 1.03 MB,
Windows Media Video</p>
</center>
</body>
</html>
Notice that the line that starts with <a href=> refers to the name of a movie
that I created. The text between the quotation marks (Newport.wmv in my
example) is the filename of the movie file. Change that text to match the file-
name of your own movie. Filenames on Web sites are usually case sensitive,
so make sure that you use uppercase and lowercase letters exactly as they’re
used by the movie file. Also change the descriptive text (Newport By the Sea
in my example) part to match your own movie. I’ve also listed the file size and
format, just so people who visit the page will know what to expect. You can
change that information on your own file as well. When you’re done typing all
these lines, save the file and give it the following filename:
index.html
553

Part IV: Outputting Your Movies
Upload this file to the same directory on your Web server that contains your
movie file. (You should get upload instructions from your ISP or Web-server
provider.) Make sure that both this index.html file and your movie file are
in the same directory on the Web server. If the address to your movie file is
as follows:
www.webserver.com/myaccount/Newport.wmv
simply provide your audience with this address instead:
www.webserver.com/myaccount/
When people visit that page, they’ll see something similar to Figure 14-11. If
you have several movies on your Web server, you can list them all on a
single page. Just copy the line that starts with <p>, and then enter the file-
name and other information for each movie in each respective line.
Web-page creation and management involve a lot more than what I have
described here. Web design is a big subject, and if you’re interested in creat-
ing more-complex Web pages, I recommend that you obtain a book that
covers the subject more thoroughly, such as HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th
Edition, by Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts, or Creating Web Pages For Dummies,
by Bud Smith and Arthur Bebak (both published by Wiley).

Chapter 15: Video Preproduction:
Planning, Storyboarding, 
and Scripting
In This Chapter
 Engaging your viewer with well-crafted shots
 Using storyboarding and scripting to plan your video
I
’m going to make a big assumption: You intend to use your digital video
camcorder for more than just shooting video. Perhaps you want to impress
an individual or group of people with an idea that you would like to translate
into film. Maybe you want to motivate people to do, support, or buy some-
thing by showing them a touching or powerful film. Or, you may want to teach
someone a step-by-step process through a training video. Then again, you
may want to document an event, such as a wedding or a football game.
With few exceptions, you can’t expect to record video that, unedited, will
meet your goals and expectations. Unedited video is usually boring beyond
belief. You’ve probably sat through some of it (a friend’s family vacation, for
example) at one time or another, so I won’t bother to prove my point. The
best way to get good video is to know how to use your camcorder as a per-
suasion tool and to plan (or script) the intended outcome.
Preparing to Shoot Digital Video
You need to become familiar with the vocabulary that’s associated with film-
making to understand how things are done and how to communicate your
ideas effectively. I always want to be helpful, so, in this section, I describe and
illustrate some of the terms that are associated with the different kinds of
video shots.
Using the right angle for the right situation
The following words are associated with different types of video shots:
✦Extra long shot (ELS): Shows a person within the fullness of the sur-
rounding area. For example, you tell the viewer what is going on with
the person in the video by showing her and the big picture around her.
Use this shot to effectively establish the environment for opening and
closing shots.
✦Long shot (LS): The character in this shot occupies one-half to three-
quarters of the screen height. This shot clarifies the relationship
between the character and the overall place by showing what’s in the
subject’s immediate proximity. This shot usually shows people from
their feet to their head.
Part V
Filmography Tips
555

Part V: Filmography Tips
✦Medium long shot (MLS): Shows the subject’s body plus a little above
and below the body. This shot is often used when the subject is moving.
✦Knee shot: Shows a three-quarter shot from the head to the knee. Use
this shot to re-establish the relationship of the character to a location
or to another character. That is, after using a close-up shot, you need to
show the subject’s surroundings again.
✦Medium shot (MS): Shows the top of the head to just below the waist. Use
this shot to develop a comfort zone for the viewer: a comfortable, conver-
sational distance between the viewer and character. Overuse this tech-
nique, however, and you risk boring the viewer. A basic rule of creating
video is to provide timely visual stimulation through changing views. Too
much of a comfortable shot can cause the viewer to lose attention.
✦Medium close-up (MCU): Often called a bust shot, it cuts from the top 
of the head to just above the diaphragm. Use the MCU as an attention-
getting shot because it violates the comfort zone, thus making the view-
ers slightly uncomfortable and thereby getting their attention. The shot
also implies that the character is significant or has something important
to say. For this reason, the MCU, mixed with an occasional knee shot, is
the favorite of the evening news.
✦Close-up (CU): Shows the upper forehead to the upper chest. Use this
shot for emphasis, but use it sparingly to hit the important phrase in a
statement or to establish strong feeling. It is also used frequently in
interviews.
✦Big close-up (BCU): A full-head shot. Use this shot to elicit a laugh or
cynicism, but be careful because the shot can appear bizarre.
✦Very close-up (VCU): This face shot shows the middle of the forehead
to above the chin. This shot exposes the character’s emotions. Reserve
it for dramatic moments.
✦Extreme close-up (ECU): Use this shot for a very tight face shot or iso-
lated details, such as a person’s eyes widening in fear. This shot is at 
the edge of the lens’s capability to focus. Use the ECU for objects more
often than characters.
Figure 15-1 is made up of ten stills that are named according to the type of
shot shown. These names indicate the proximity of the lens to the subject
(the person, item, or event being recorded).
Selecting the length of shot
Even though you can use your camcorder to establish environment, bring a
character closer to the viewer, or show movement, you need to use good
judgment in selecting the correct mixture of shots. The following are two of
the main reasons for changing the perspective of a shot:
✦Storytelling: The viewer needs to know relationships as well as details.
A wide-angle shot establishes the place and the proximity of other char-
acters. A close-up provides necessary visual details, such as a raised
eyebrow, a shaking hand, or a flashing smile. Changes of perspective are
often as important to a story as spoken words.
556

Chapter 15
Video Preproduction:
Planning, Storyboarding,
and Scripting
Preparing to Shoot Digital Video
✦Editing: Changes of perspective are essential to good editing. Transitions
are much easier to edit when the character’s perspective changes. A
good filmmaker provides the editor (even when the two are the same
person) with both wide-angle shots and close-ups of the same sequence;
this enables the editor to decide when to use the wide shot or the close-
up. For example, in an infomercial, the spokesperson talks about the
importance of a product’s new features. If you have a wide-angle shot of
the narrator talking about the feature and close-ups showing the feature’s
details, you can edit the segment from the wide shot to the close-up as
necessary, to allow the viewer to visually comprehend the significance
of the feature.

Be sure to use the right shot at the right moment; otherwise, you may mis-
inform your viewers or make them uncomfortable. At the opening of a scene,
the viewer wants to know where the action is taking place. A close-up would
not communicate the setting to the viewer. In a scene with an intimate con-
versation between characters, the viewer wants to be up close, with alternat-
ing close-ups of one character and then the other. Using a wide-angle shot
makes the viewer feel left out or like an eavesdropper. But in conversations
that aren’t intimate, say, between two businesspeople, the viewer likes alter-
nating medium close-ups of the two. Extreme close-ups in this situation make
the viewer uncomfortable.
Off-camera action is something that occurs outside the viewing area that is
brought to the attention of the viewer. You want to use dramatic action off-
camera (such as a foot snapping a twig when the subject is sitting alone by
a campfire) if your intent is to create tension. Off-camera action needs to be
used carefully. Off-camera action is counterproductive if the viewer needs
the action to understand the story (such as the emergence of the twig snap-
per from the edge of the woods).
Using focus as a technique
You may have noticed that while using your camcorder, you use the focus
mechanism on your lens more than any other camcorder feature. Focusing
is about the most basic function that is performed by your camcorder (either
automatically or manually). With just a little knowledge and practice, you
can turn focusing into a powerful technique for getting the most out of every
shot. The first thing that you should practice is controlling the depth of
focus (the amount of focused space in front and behind your subject). You
adjust the f-stop to achieve depth of focus.
Aperture equals focal length divided by the diameter of your lens. The set-
ting of the aperture is referred to as the f-stop.
The depth of focus directly relates to the f-stop. The higher the f-stop, the
greater the depth of focus. At higher f-stops, therefore, the perception of
being in focus exists for a substantial distance on either side of the actual
plane of focus (the focal plane). By perception of focus, I mean that only a
very thin plane is ever actually in focus. The larger the depth of focus, the
more the objects in front and behind the focal plane look like they are in
focus. Higher f-stops mean that more of the shot appears to be in focus, but
the shot also requires more light.
The opposite is true for depth of focus at lower f-stops. The lower the 
f-stop, the lower (or shallower) the depth of focus. This means that at lower 
f-stops, the perception of a shot being in focus is nearly nonexistent on
either side of the focal plane. A typical situation in which you use a lower 
f-stop (for a shallower depth of focus) is when you want to blur out a back-
ground for some reason. Using lower f-stops requires less light for the shot.
Take a look at Figure 15-2, which shows two stills. The still on the left was
shot at f/11. The still on the right was shot at f/2.8. In the left still, objects in
the background are in focus. In the right still, the background is blurred and
rendered irrelevant.

Setting camera height
You can also use the vertical angle of a shot to influence a viewer’s percep-
tion of a character. Take a look at the three stills in Figure 15-3. The first still
illustrates the use of a neutral camera height, in which the camera’s lens is
set at chest to eye height. Such shots are objective, that is, they don’t influ-
ence a viewer’s perception of the subject.
In the second shot, the camera height is set above the character’s eye height.
This angle, which looks down at the character, generally suggests inferiority,
weakness, or submission of the character to the viewer or to other charac-
ters in the video.
In the third shot, the camera height is set waist-high to the character, which
is a subjective shot. This shot suggests strength and dominance of the char-
acter over the viewer or over other characters in the video. In Citizen Kane,
the main character was often shot this way. Orson Welles intentionally did
this to establish superiority. The setting of camera height as I’ve described
here applies to a stationary camera.
Moving the camera
You can create energy in an otherwise static shot simply by moving your
camera. As with the various perspective shots, videographers bestow spe-
cific names on each of these camera movements.
Panning and tilting
Panning and tilting are performed with a camcorder that’s resting on the
head of a tripod. I further discuss each of these concepts in Chapter 5 of
Book II.
Panning is moving the camera from left to right. The two basic kinds of pan-
ning are following pan and surveying pan. In the following pan, the camera
operator pans (moves the camera left or right) to follow a character, for
example, from one spot to another. The surveying pan is used to locate a
character or an object, for example, a character searching for and finding
another character on a crowded street.

Part V: Filmography Tips
Tilting is moving it up and down on the tripod’s head. Tilting is often done
simply as a matter of course, such as tilting down to follow an action. How-
ever, you can also tilt to achieve a particular effect, such as tilting up or
down to denote height or depth. The classic tilt is when someone shoots
video at the base of a tall building and moves the camera by tilting up to
establish that the building is tall.

Craning, dollying, and trucking
In addition to moving the camera from side to side or up and down, you can
create even greater dynamic energy by moving the camera over, into, out of,
or across the scene. Although moving the camera over a scene, called cran-
ing, may be too elaborate for your purposes, at least you now know the term
if and when you hear it. The other two movements — dollying and trucking —
are quite easy and effective.
Dollying refers to moving the camera forward or backward in a scene (see
Figure 15-4). Although, at first glance, dollying may seem similar to zooming,
the two are used differently. You dolly by moving the camera forward (toward
the subject) or backward (away from the subject), whereas you zoom in and
out by adjusting the lens. Dollying changes the relationship of the character
to his surroundings. When you dolly in, you isolate the character from every-
thing on the left or right. When you dolly out, you introduce the character
to her surroundings. Zooming doesn’t give the effect of deleting or adding
surroundings. Zooming just includes more or fewer details in the picture.
Dollying causes the relationship between the character and the overall
scene to change. Generally, you must adjust the focus and tilt the camera
while you dolly because you are changing the focal depth by moving the
camera toward or away from the subject. Foreground objects disappear or
appear as the camera moves in or out. Zooming, on the other hand, does
not change the spatial relationship between the character and the scene.
Trucking refers to moving the camera to the left or right in relationship to a
scene, as shown in Figure 15-5. When you truck your camcorder, you change
the character’s background. This movement makes a dull scene interesting.

Part V: Filmography Tips
Trucking is used a lot in commercials where the character stands still, telling
you the importance of a product. The camera trucks (moves right or left),
keeping the character in the center — the background moves while the
character remains stationary. Trucking keeps the viewer visually engaged.
Although trucking can make a scene interesting, it can also cause major
changes to the lighting of a character. Sometimes these changes are detri-
mental, especially when filming indoors. Lighting is usually set based on
camera position. To properly light a trucking move, you need to set lights
for both ends of the trucking movement. If you don’t have enough lights,
you may want to reconsider your trucking move.
Composing the picture
One of the fundamental requirements in shooting stimulating video is com-
posing your picture, which is preparing the environment where the shoot-
ing takes place. For example, assume that you’re shooting on location at
someone’s office. You can either make the picture look humdrum (like the
workday world) or make it look special. You make the normal special by
composing a picture.
Consider the following points when preparing the environment:
✦Shoot for light. Lighting has the most obvious impact on the quality of
your shot, specifically the location and intensity of the light in relation-
ship to your character. Whether natural or artificial, the light should give
primary significance to your character’s face and secondary significance
to the scene. If you can’t get the sun to cooperate, close the blinds and
use artificial light. Don’t forget to white-balance your camcorder!

Preparing to Shoot Digital Video
✦Position the character. Set the character, sitting or standing, in a digni-
fied manner and location. For example, if the character is sitting, secure
a posture for the character that is neither stiff nor sloppy. Avoid embar-
rassing the character by paying attention to how his or her lap is posi-
tioned. Also, always check the background. Don’t place the character in
front of something that inadvertently looks comical. For example, don’t
let the character sit so that horizontal bookshelves seem to be sprout-
ing out of his or her ears. (This may seem silly, but it’s a real problem.)
Believe me, many problems of this kind are avoidable; you simply have
to be attentive to your shooting environment and use good judgment to
prevent them.
✦Dress the shot. This takes only a moment, but in the rush of the moment,
you may forget or ignore details of the shot. Not only does this step
help ensure a good shot, but it’s also an act of kindness to your charac-
ter. For example, if a desk is in the shot, clean the desk and make it look
“professional” (unless, of course, a messy desk is important to the scene).
Avoid ultra-white or shiny objects in the foreground. Ask the character
whether he or she wants family photos in the shot. Also, if possible, dress
up the background with a vase of flowers or a book arrangement — 
anything to avoid a flat background. If you brought along a light kit, throw
a colored slash of light across the background (but only after you white-
balance). If the person is wearing glasses, be sure to check that the
glasses don’t cause a reflection of the light. Be aware, however, that a
lot of people don’t like to take off their glasses for a video shot.
I further discuss composition in Book II, Chapter 5.
Framing the shot
Framing the shot is simply a matter of placing the subject properly in the
picture. You don’t have much to remember to frame a shot correctly. Keep
these three things in mind when framing: safety margins, offset versus sym-
metrical, and proper headroom.
Safety margins
Safety margins are two imaginary rectangles on the outer edges of your pic-
ture, as shown in Figure 15-6. Some camcorders actually show these rectan-
gles in their viewfinders. The outer rectangle warns you that any images or
characters outside the rectangle’s boundaries may not appear on some
monitors. Obviously, vital parts of a scene, including titles and credits, must
be kept inside the outer rectangle. The inner rectangle is the safe area.
Within this rectangle, you can safely add images or characters at any time
during the editing process.
Be sure to keep safety margins in mind while shooting. You don’t want to
use a shot that’s too tight, thereby creating the risk of an editor later put-
ting images or characters on someone’s chin or neck rather than across his
or her chest. Although you may not have safety margins in your camcorder’s
viewfinder, you can teach yourself to remember where they are.
563

Part V: Filmography Tips
Offset versus symmetrical
One of the simplest things that you can do to add appeal to a shot is to
offset the frame — that is, center the character on the third of the frame that
is opposite the direction that he or she is facing, as shown in Figure 15-7.
For example, if the character’s shoulders are turned toward the viewer’s
right, frame the character on the viewer’s left. If the character’s shoulders
are turned toward the viewer’s left, frame the character on the viewer’s
right. If the character’s shoulders are square with the camera, use symme-
try by centering the character in the screen.
But just how far offset should the subject be? Imagine for a moment that the
video you see in your viewfinder is divided into thirds vertically and hori-
zontally. Envision a grid that’s similar to a tic-tac-toe board, where the
screen area is divided into nine blocks. This is called the Rule of Nines, and
you can fill the blocks of this imaginary grid to determine where your sub-
jects should be offset.
Proper headroom
Establishing proper headroom is one of the simplest techniques to under-
stand, and after you know the basic idea, you’ll set proper headroom without
thinking about it. Simply remember that a person should not look as though
he or she has slipped toward the bottom of the screen (too much headroom).
Also, a person shouldn’t appear crowded into the frame as though his or her
head might scrape the top of the screen (too little headroom).
After you start practicing these techniques, you’ll probably like the look that
you achieve. They are especially helpful if you plan to layer text later on to
allow room. Figure 15-7 illustrates the use of offset framing with a graphic
added later in the editing process.

Preproducing Your Digital Video
Preproducing Your Digital Video
Preproduction refers to the planning and implementation of the many details
that can help you produce a successful video. You may find it odd that I bring
up the matter of preproducing your video after telling you how to shoot it. But
trust me, this order is logical. Why? Because of the language. For you to pre-
produce your video, first you need to understand some of the technical
vocabulary of creating video. If you haven’t read the section “Preparing to
Shoot Digital Video,” earlier in this chapter, put a pencil in the margin right
here, read through that material, and then come back to this section.
Preproducing a video is literally sitting down and writing out the details of
how scenes will look and what people will say in those scenes. The three
main elements of preproduction are as follows:
✦Storyboarding: The process of brainstorming an idea into existence.
✦Scripting: Deciding in advance what characters will say and what the
camcorder will do in each scene — such as a wide-angle shot followed
by a close-up.
✦Planning the shoot: Putting all the necessary plans on paper so that when
the time for shooting arrives, everything and everyone are prepared.
Storyboarding
Storyboarding is the process of planning each scene of your movie on paper
(or poster board, chalkboard, or just about anything else you can write on).
Most modern films are planned this way. An artist or producer sketches a
picture of each scene, and then those scenes are laid out in order on a board
or on paper. The crew consults the storyboard to see how each scene relates
to the overall story.

565

Part V: Filmography Tips
If you’re making a home movie of your family vacation or even a wedding,
creating a storyboard may seem like overkill. Still, you may find it useful to
sit down with pen and paper before filming and plan what you want to shoot.
You don’t even have to sketch drawings; just create a basic outline of the
planned shoot.
In the preproduction stage, one of the most exciting parts of storyboarding
is visualizing the finished product. In your mind’s eye, you follow your char-
acter’s action from scene to scene. You can almost hear the music playing
and see the special graphics and animation that you will include during 
the editing process. Within all this excitement, though, you need to ask this
question, “Does this storyboard realistically provide the editor (who just
may be you) with enough video opportunities to get the job done?” What if
a review of your footage during editing reveals that the shot you took didn’t
turn out very well? Going back and reconstructing the scene for another
shot is difficult, if not impossible.
If anything, err toward excess. You may add 15 minutes or an hour to the
shooting schedule by taking another shot from a different angle, but by doing
so, you may save yourself a lot of time and headache in the postproduction
stage.
So how do you do it? Create your storyboard as quickly and simply as pos-
sible. The storyboard is just a set of visual notes that you work from while
you are filming your video.
Whatever you use to draw or sketch your storyboards, the storyboards
should be drawn dark enough to be photocopied because you usually need
more than one set. To create a storyboard, follow these steps:
1. On individual sheets, draw the key events and the scene where the
events will take place.
Don’t worry about your artistic abilities (or lack thereof) as long as the
drawing illustrates the most important elements of the scene.
2. On each sheet, include some basic ideas of what is happening and
what is being said.
Write notes and labels if necessary.
3. Play with the order of the key events by moving them around and
adding and deleting the sheets as needed, until you are satisfied with
the order of the key events in the story line.
4. Name the scenes or segments of scenes for each of the key events.
Use the scene names to develop lists of the elements that need to be pre-
pared prior to video shooting, such as costumes or props.
Scripting
Scripting is a textual plan of all that will be said and performed in a scene. 
A shooting script usually includes camera instructions, locations in the
scene for sound effects, and general instructions to the editor for editing.
For people like myself, scripting is as much fun as the actual filming. For

other people, just using a word processor is nearly impossible — let alone
writing creatively. I don’t claim that writing a script is easy, but I quake to
think what may happen in some videos without one.
To understand how a script can help you, you first need to distinguish
between the following two approaches to scriptwriting:
✦Subjective: Subjective scripting is storytelling. (See Figure 15-8 for an
example of a subjective script.) The subjective script depends largely
on video to establish the environment. (Note the video instructions in
the left column in Figure 15-8.) Subjective scripting has characters, a
plot, and some kind of dramatic development. In a video where you’re
primarily communicating a feeling (such as a music video), you present
a combination of movements and sounds to elicit an emotional
response in your viewer.

Part V: Filmography Tips
✦Objective: Objective scripting is goal-oriented information or instruc-
tions (see Figure 15-9). You want to influence or train your viewer to do
or believe what you’re presenting. Objective scripts are need-oriented:
They exist to resolve a problem or to influence the viewer to agree with
you or to buy something.
Subjective scripts are much more complicated than objective scripts. Con-
versely, objective scripts are subject to a tough test — namely, the success
or failure of achieving the objective.
Planning the shoot
After you develop your storyboard and script (if your story is complicated
or involves a lot of speaking), you’re ready to plan the shoot. You need to
assign camera instructions, such as shots and close-ups for the various key
events. Of course, you may modify your plans when the time comes to do
the actual shooting. But to prevent chaos during shooting, you’re wise to
have a shooting plan. And be sure that you plan more than enough shots for
each key event.
One of the most important steps in preproduction is planning your shooting
order. Shooting order refers to a chronological list of the segments to be
shot. By the way, you don’t necessarily want to shoot your video in the
order of the plot. Doing so can be a waste of time and resources.

 Working with people
O
ne of my favorite moments in creating a video is the deep feeling of 
satisfaction I get at the end of a good day of shooting. Using a day pro-
ductively and safely to tuck away video clips for later editing are my basic
goals — and some days you accomplish these things, while other days
don’t quite measure up.
What makes some video projects go well and others poorly? What can you do
to ensure success? What problems lurk out there just waiting to grab you
when you least suspect them? Answers to these questions aren’t always easy
or foolproof, and nothing about creating quality video is inherently easy. But
you can have a satisfying experience. A large part of the enjoyment you
derive from successful video cinematography comes from preventing, facing,
and overcoming obstacles.
The breakthrough technology of digital video provides you with the oppor-
tunity to produce professional-quality video. The emphasis here is on the
word opportunity. You can make beautiful video. Digital video provides you
this opportunity, but you still have to do the work. This chapter is filled with
advice for creating a successful video. Some of my suggestions are always
true in every kind of project. Others are the good-to-know variety for those
times when you face special challenges.
Planning for Success and Preparing 
for Survival On Location
I tend to be overly optimistic. Life’s more fun that way — you know, thinking
that I’m just one light lunch away from losing those extra pounds. Optimists
like me have to work hard at being realists. The same is true in creating a
video. Optimism is great. Preparing for the unforeseen is even better. By
knowing and doing certain things, you and others will enjoy the results of
your efforts.
You don’t have to go far to be on location. It may simply be an office on
another floor of the building you’re already in. Or it may be out in the park-
ing lot. And, of course, it can be on someone else’s property. So what is the
569

Part V: Filmography Tips
difficulty of shooting on location? When you’re on location, you’re on some-
one else’s turf, subject to someone else’s schedule, and using someone else’s
resources to get your job done. These variables can often prevent you from
getting your job done to your satisfaction.
Dangers of on-location filming
On-location shooting is tough — especially on your equipment. Lenses can
be ruined from exposure to the sun and camcorders damaged when they are
dropped while working in rough terrain. Accidents like these often happen
to responsible people making careless mistakes.
Protecting equipment
Of course, sometimes you can’t avoid shooting video in places where equip-
ment can be damaged or lost. But you can increase the survival rate of your
equipment by insisting that you and others develop some simple habits.
The number one culprit of on-location shooting is grime, so make sure that
you do the following:
✦Protect your equipment to and from a shoot by keeping the equipment
in cases.
✦Keep plastic covering available for protection against windblown debris.
✦Carry a lens cleaning cloth for your lens and canned air (available at
electronics stores) for blowing dust off your equipment.
✦Always wipe your equipment at the conclusion of a shoot. If you have
used electrical wiring, take special care to remove grime before storing
the wiring with your other equipment.
The number two culprit is theft. I’ve been victimized a number of times, so I
know how it feels. A friend of mine had a very expensive camcorder stolen
from the lobby of a hotel. The camcorder was at his side on the floor — and
then it was gone! Expensive toys attract attention. Don’t ever leave your
equipment unguarded — even in seemingly safe locations.
570
Knowing your legal and safety limitations
Shooting on location is supposed to be fun and
interesting. To keep it enjoyable, I suggest refrain-
ing from doing things that may put you in jeopardy.
Here are a couple of basic rules about using a
camcorder on someone else’s turf:
 Don’t take your camcorder anywhere you have
to hide it to get it in. For example, don’t take
your camcorder where signs are posted for-
bidding the use of cameras and recording
devices, such as inside art museums or at con-
certs. You risk the possibility of your equipment
being confiscated or worse.
 Don’t record people on your camcorder with-
out their permission. People can get very upset
about this — even to the point of wanting to
punch you in the nose. As a basic courtesy, I
always ask for permission before I record.

Planning for Success and Preparing for Survival On Location
Be aware that your gear is not the only target — purses and bags are tar-
gets, too.
The third culprit is breakage. Breakage happens two ways. The most obvi-
ous way is by dropping equipment. But, more often, breakage happens when
untrained people use equipment. Very few pieces of equipment can with-
stand forceful abuse. The most common damage occurs when people try to
force a piece of equipment to do something that it’s not meant to do.
Be sure to follow these two basic rules:
✦If you don’t know how to use the equipment, ask.
✦If the equipment doesn’t want to do what you’re attempting to do, stop.
You’re probably doing something wrong.
Effects of weather
Weather and temperature can drastically affect video equipment. Simple
things can cause big problems. For example, taking a camcorder from a warm
environment to a cold one can cause condensation within the equipment —
rendering the camcorder unusable for an hour or two. Leaving equipment in
the cold can be a problem, too. For example, if you have a fluid-damped
tripod, the fluid can become thick in cold temperatures, which can make
the tripod unusable until it’s warmed.
Here are some suggestions for dealing with weather:
✦Don’t take electronic equipment from hot to cold environments (or vice
versa) without allowing time for the temperature of the equipment to
adjust.
✦Don’t leave equipment in your car (including the trunk) overnight in cold
climates.
✦Avoid exposing your equipment to extreme heat.
✦Avoid using your equipment in extremely high humidity.
Power
Electrical demands on location are always more complicated than shooting
in a studio. The problem is not so much your camcorder, which actually
draws a low amount of current, but lighting and other items that use a lot of
power. To avoid power catastrophes, keep the following points in mind:
✦AC outlets: When using electricity on location, always, always, always ask
for permission before plugging in. I have witnessed two occasions when
people’s computers went down while I was plugged into their electrical
outlets. In both instances, they immediately blamed me for the outage
and lost files! Imagine that. Come to think of it, remind computer users in
the building to save their work before you plug in, just in case.
✦Circuit breakers: If you plan to use lighting on location, always be pre-
pared to restore a tripped circuit breaker. Find out where the electrical
panel is located and, if possible, identify the circuit you’ll use. Again, ask 571

Part V: Filmography Tips
whether you may use the circuit and explain that you might possibly
cause an outage. And if you’re using your own lighting, avoid doing any-
thing that could cause burns to people or equipment.
✦Batteries: Using batteries on location can be a shocking experience. 
Not literally, but almost. The typical problem with batteries is that they
run out of power. Many batteries take longer to charge than they do to
expend. Bottom line — have two hours of charged batteries for every
hour you plan to shoot. And if you expect a lot of shooting time, recharge
the batteries on location if possible.
If you plan to take your camcorder out of the country, find out in advance
what kind of converter you’ll need for running your equipment and for
recharging your batteries.
Shipping and travel
Shipping video equipment can cause you anguish because you must trust
your equipment to people who have no idea what they’re handling. Unless
your camcorder case is designed for shipping, be sure to take extra precau-
tions when shipping your camcorder. An inexpensive way to ship your cam-
corder is to wrap it in oodles of bubble packing and put it in oversized boxes.
Even so, insure your shipment for its total value. If you’re taking your cam-
corder on a plane, you may want to put the case in cargo but carry the
camcorder on the plane.
If you plan to take your camcorder across international borders, beware!
You may not be allowed to take it from one country to another without prior
arrangement. I was once prohibited from taking a camcorder into Canada!
Before leaving the country, contact your local customs service office a few
weeks in advance to find out what you might have to do to take your camera
across international borders.
Types of on-location shoots
You typically engage in four kinds of on-location shooting (all these terms
are coined by yours truly, but methinks they’ll do fine for the purposes of
this little discussion):
✦Spontaneous
✦Event style
✦Formal events
✦Made-for-video creation
Spontaneous
Spontaneous shooting is the simplest and chanciest form of on-location
shooting. As the name implies, you turn on your camcorder, point, and shoot.
In spontaneous shooting, you have little or no way of predicting how your
camera’s settings and capabilities will match up with the challenges of the
circumstances or the environment. Most people with camcorders are experts
at spontaneous shooting because that’s all they ever do.

Planning for Success and Preparing for Survival On Location
Of course, you can do a few basic things to make your spontaneous shoots
more effective. If possible, take a few seconds before pressing the record
button to look through the viewfinder and check the lighting and background.
If you’re shooting a dolphin show at the local aquarium, you may not have
any control over the lighting and background, but in other situations, you
might be able to reposition your subject for better lighting, or pick up that
clutter sitting in the background.
Event style
Event style shooting is different from spontaneous shooting in subtle but
significant ways. Like spontaneous shooting, event style allows you little or
no control of the environment. But in event style shooting, you can manipu-
late some of the circumstances.
Say that you’re asked to videotape a high school football game. Being the
“official” videographer gives you license to go places and do things others
might not have the freedom to do or explore. Although you have no control
over time and events, you do have control over the circumstances.
For example, because you are the videographer, you ask to attend the after-
noon pep rally to get some introductory shots for the video. At the rally, you
decide to sit across the gym from the students, where you can use your zoom
to capture groups of students as they do the berserk things teenagers do at
pep rallies.
You could also arrive early to the game and explain to one of the coaches that
you’re shooting a video for the parents’ club. Ask whether you can move
about the sidelines during the game. Again, you’re controlling the circum-
stances, as follows:
✦You make conscious decisions about the location of the camera.
✦You position yourself early to wait for shot opportunities.
✦You ensure that your settings are correct.
✦You wear headphones to hear the events as they unfold because after
the game starts, the crowd noise makes it difficult to know whether
you’re recording the sounds of the game or not.
In an event style shoot, you have numerous, seemingly unrelated ways to
control what is being recorded on tape. You can’t tell people what they
should wear, and you aren’t able to control the elements of the environment,
such as the weather or time of day. But you do have some control over the
subject matter (such as going to the pep rally) and the circumstances (such
as selecting where you stand at the rally and the game). Your chances for
getting good footage are better with event style shootings than with sponta-
neous shootings.
Formal events
When shooting formal events, such as weddings and lectures, you have some
control over the environment as well as the circumstances. The distinguish-
ing factor of a formal event is that you’re expected to provide a relatively
573

Part V: Filmography Tips
high-quality finished product. You may be doing this for free — for example,
for relatives or your church. Or you may be shooting the formal event as an
employee or a freelance videographer. Whether you’re working for free or for
hire, it doesn’t matter. You have a customer, and the customer is expecting
the video. Though the expectations are higher in formal events, so are the
opportunities to deliver a quality video.
In formal events, your customer usually allows you to prepare for the event.
Quite often, the customer even allows you to alter event planning in some
little ways to accommodate your shooting needs. Prior to a formal event,
you usually do the following:
✦Negotiate with the customer about the location and operation of your
video and sound equipment.
✦Resolve your electrical needs (especially if you’re planning to provide
lights).
✦Plan a list of shots with the customer.
Formal events are often more controllable than spontaneous and event style
videos. Though the action is unstoppable and occurs for reasons totally unre-
lated to your project’s needs, you still have some leverage in planning the
environment and the circumstances.
A simple example of environmental control occurs at a lecture. For example,
the lecturer (your customer) stands in front of a live audience and makes a
PowerPoint presentation by using a projector and a screen. Normally, the
lecturer will want to lower the room lights to enhance the image on the
screen. You will need to do some advance negotiation with the lecturer and
figure out a lighting compromise that’s best for the screen and the camcorder.
Made-for-video creation
The fourth type of on-location shooting is a made-for-video creation. In this
scenario, you’re shooting events that wouldn’t be occurring if you weren’t
holding a camcorder and recording it all. For instance, if you want to shoot
a science fiction epic or a dramatic masterpiece starring kids from around
the neighborhood, you’re producing a made-for-video creation. When shoot-
ing a video like this, you have the greatest opportunity for producing qual-
ity video because you have ultimate control of
✦Costumes worn by the cast
✦Set design and background
✦Camera positioning
✦Lighting
Of course, there is no such thing as unlimited control. The weather may turn
bad, your cast may become unhappy, and budgetary constraints can get in
the way of your creative vision.

Using Time to Your Advantage
Using Time to Your Advantage
Time is the single most precious resource in creating a video and the hard-
est to control. So time management is important in order to strike a balance
between the amount of time you need and want and the amount of time you
actually have.
When all the dust has cleared, the failure or success of your project’s time
management efforts hinges on whether you created appropriate and suffi-
cient materials for editing. During editing, your video is cropped, embel-
lished, and assembled into a coherent and useful message. But if you left
something out or created confusing unrelated video clips, your video will
suffer, and you’ll add many unpleasant hours to the editing process.
Following are some hints for making your editor (even if that editor will
eventually be you) a grateful fan and not causing him or her an appreciable
loss or graying of hair.
Logging your shots
I’m sure at one time or another you’ve seen a re-enactment of a film or video
shoot in which someone holds up a strange looking board with a little board
on top of it that says something such as “Scene 14, shot 7, take one. Action.”
Then the person slams down the little board, making a large clacking sound.
What was that person doing? Sending a message to the editor using a take
board.
Take a look at Figure 16-1, which illustrates what’s often referred to as a take
board. Though it may look different from one video to the next, the take
board usually includes the name of the video, the date, the scene number,
and the take number. The term scene refers to a series of shots that, when
edited, complete a dramatic action or a portion of a message, such as the
famous shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s movie Psycho.
Figure 16-1:

all the

a given
segment of

575

Part V: Filmography Tips
A shot is a specific segment of a scene. A take is a taping of one of the shots
in that segment. Frequently, even in simple videos, a shot is taped many
times because a word is misstated by the speaker, the camera is out of focus,
a noise occurs on the set, and so on. The tape board is clacked to create a
sound that’s easy for the editor to hear later while he or she shuttles the
video back and forth. While editing, the editor hears the clack and realizes
the take has begun. She stops the tape, backs it up, or goes forward until
she can read the message on the take board. The take board is only one-
fourth of the conventional record-keeping process.
The other three parts are 
✦The script: The actual plan of the video, including descriptions of action,
camera instructions, instructions to the actors, and any dialogue in the
scene.
✦The time code: A particular kind of identifying information recorded by
the camcorder onto the videotape. The time code makes frame-accurate
editing possible. It is the frame-by-frame permanent identification of the
video information on the tape. You can usually see the current time code
in the camcorder’s viewfinder.
✦The log: Someone logs information about each take, as shown in Fig-
ure 16-2. If you have comments about a specific take or scene, this is
where you record them. For example, if you have taken several different
shots of your child posing in front of trees in the neighborhood park,
keeping a log of where you shot the film helps you later when you find
that the light wasn’t right at that time of day, but the location was per-
fect. The log provides the perfect way to remember.
Figure 16-2:

576

Book II

Production Tips
Using Time to Your Advantage
Figure 16-2 shows the number of the scene and take, and information about
the take. By keeping an accurate log during shooting, you ensure that all the
planned shots have been taped and that you’ve written all the information
the editor will need to find the good footage. One of the important functions
of logging details is to ensure continuity.
Continuity
One time-consuming problem editors face is reconciling missing or visually
unrelated sequences. Figure 16-3 illustrates a common mistake. Say that in
one of your scenes, the presenter points to an object, requiring a close-up.
After pointing, the presenter goes on with the narration. According to the
script, you need to shoot a close-up of that object. You do the wide shot
showing the presenter and the object, and then reposition the camera to set
up for the close-up. While shooting the close-up of the object, you have the
presenter’s hand come into the picture and out again. Later on, the editor
puts the wide shot of the pointing hand and the close-up of the pointing
hand together — only to discover that the hand in the wide shot is the left
hand and the hand in the close-up is the right hand.
Aaargh! This little situation is called a break in continuity. Basically you have
the following two options to fix it:
✦Assemble the movie without correcting the break in continuity and
hope that your audience doesn’t notice.
✦Go back and reshoot the scene.
Neither of these options is very desirable, and reshooting the scene will
waste a lot of time. It could even result in further continuity breaks if some-
thing about the original shooting location has changed since your first
shoot.
The very best solution is to maintain continuity in the first place. Pay atten-
tion to even the minor details of your shot and don’t be afraid to shoot
extra takes if those details aren’t exactly right.
Creating editing options
One of the simplest ways to cover yourself in the event of unnoticed goofs
(and you will have many) is to give your editor lots of alternatives.
Here are a couple of tips that will help you avoid video goofs:
✦When a person is looking directly into the camera: What do you do if
you discover while editing that you need to take something out of the
speech? A straight cut of video footage will look apparent and bad. You
can anticipate this problem and give yourself more editing options by
shooting the speech twice from different angles or zoom perspectives.
Then, if some of the speech must be cut, the editor can switch between
takes at the editing point. To the viewer, this will look like a simple
changing of camera angles, similar to what you often see during the
evening news on TV.
577

Part V: Filmography Tips
✦When a person is looking directly at someone off camera: Imagine
that you’re shooting an ordinary interview in which the interviewer is
sitting off camera and directly next to it. The person on camera isn’t
looking into the lens, but is looking directly at the interviewer. This may
be disorienting to the audience unless you also record some reaction
shots of the interviewer. After the interview, shoot the interviewer asking
questions, nodding, shaking his or her head, or otherwise reacting to
things the interviewee said during the interview. The editor can splice
these reaction shots periodically with the video of the interviewee so
that it looks like there were two cameras in the room during the inter-
view, and the video simply switches back and forth between the cam-
eras as questions are asked and answered.

Production Tips
Working with People On and Off Camera
Record a long track of some ambient sound. Ambient sound is silence in the
environment where you’re shooting. Silence is very different from one loca-
tion to the next. For example, ambient sound at a computer workstation is
filled with the sound of the computer’s fan motor. Outdoor ambient sound
may include as background the sound of cars on a nearby street. An editor
needs a continuous track of ambient sound to play in the background of the
interview to cover up the inconsistent, broken ambient sound that will
occur as the editor splices interview and reaction shots. Don’t forget to
note ambient sound in your log.
Working with People On and Off Camera
Creating a video on location can involve as few as one crew member (that
would be you) or as many as a dozen or so. But no matter the number, if
you have a crew at all, two of the most important principles of successful
on-location shooting are knowing that the director is the boss and that the
director allows the crew members to do their jobs. In order for a crew to
work efficiently, everyone should be clear about his or her role.
The following section provides descriptions of crew roles. These roles are not
necessarily held by one person. And one person can have more than one role.
The director needs to make sure that people understand their roles.
Take a few minutes to indoctrinate whomever you enlist for your video crew
on the finer points of moviemaking, and provide some do’s and don’ts to
follow while they’re on the set. Helpers should be trained on any equipment
they’re going to use, and they should know where they can (and cannot)
stand to avoid showing up in the picture. Anyone who is holding a micro-
phone must be told that little hand movements may cause loud thumps and
other noise; anyone who is holding a light reflector should be reminded to
sit still, lest strange shadows pan wildly back and forth on the scene, and be
sure to remind all helpers that silence is golden. A camera lens may be lim-
ited to a specific field of vision, but a microphone isn’t.
Roles that people play
First, an important clarification: A video shoot is not a democracy. Clear-cut
roles are as essential in video as they are on a football team or in an army
platoon. Second, pecking orders don’t exist in creating a video. There isn’t a
concept of greatest and least. Everyone simply has a job to do. Following is
a formal description of roles. In real life, the interaction is probably much
looser than I describe here.
Producer
The producer (probably you) is the person responsible for the overall com-
pletion of the project. Frequently, the producer gets involved before anyone
else on the crew. The producer negotiates with the customer, sets the budget,
signs the contracts (if this a commercial project), and stays involved with
the project long after the crew dissolves. The producer also works with the
editor, arranges for distribution, oversees general administration, and sees
579

Part V: Filmography Tips
the project to its conclusion. Additionally, if a representative of the customer
is at the shoot, the producer is responsible for interacting with the customer
and communicating concerns to the director.
On location, the producer does all that is necessary to keep the director
focused on the video.
Director
The director is the leader and must understand everyone’s role and guide the
overall movement of the video. But even more important, the director is the
person with the vision. The director knows what the project is supposed to
be like and what it is intended to accomplish. The director’s first and fore-
most job is to hold the vision together throughout the video. A good crew
keeps the director focused on leading, not problem solving.
Customer/technical consultant
In some videos, especially training videos, the customer will provide a tech-
nical consultant, also known as a subject matter expert (SME). The SME is
often ultimately responsible for the technical accuracy of what is said and
done in front of the camera. The director and the producer frequently depend
on the instructions of the SME, but the SME instructs the crew only at the
request of the director and only in the specific instances where such action
is needed. Otherwise, the video can become a chaotic mess. Also, the SME
cannot appear on camera. If he or she does, you need another SME —
because after a person appears on camera, you can’t depend on his or her
objectivity.
Subject matter experts are often present even in your spontaneous home
videos. For example, if you’re shooting a video of your infant granddaughter
taking her first steps, her parents may be off camera giving you instructions
on when to start recording. Or if you’re filming your child’s soccer game,
the coach may be able to tell you what part of the field your child will be
playing in most.
Videographer (camera operator)
In the world of television news, such people are called photographers. A
good videographer is a humble but confident person. The videographer must
follow the director’s orders but must also be able to tell the director if there’s
a better way to do the job. Usually, directors and videographers develop
close professional relationships and learn to read each other’s subtle or
implied meanings and moods. One important rule that’s seldom, if ever,
broken is that no one other than the director ever directs the videographer.
Sometimes the videographer, depending strictly on the preference of the
director, is a kind of assistant director, giving instructions to the other crew
members. A director may choose this route when he or she has to give full
attention to the person in front of the camera.

Sound technician
Sound technicians have a bit of an odd role: They listen to the audio with
earphones without actually watching the action that is being filmed. I’ve
never been able to figure out whether they’re sleeping or concentrating on
the sound. Sound technicians keep their fingers poised on a field mixer,
anticipating fluctuations of volume in order to maximize the recorder’s
dynamic range. The sound technician must call for a retake whenever an
alien sound or a speaking glitch is heard through the earphones. The sound
tech usually works with the videographer.
Gaffer
The gaffer is the crew member responsible for anything having to do with
light and electricity. Typically, the gaffer works directly with the videogra-
pher in framing the shot and setting light levels.
Grip
On a small crew, a grip is primarily an assistant to the gaffer. The grip is
responsible for setting up lighting for a shot. Normally, the grip also helps
move the camera and tripod and any other gear.
Production assistant
The production assistant, affectionately referred to as the PA, is the do-
everything-else person on the crew. Usually, PAs are the ones who keep the
shooting log up-to-date and typically handle the take board. PAs also assist
in moving equipment as needed. On your own crew, the PA might simply be
one of your kids who keeps you supplied with Diet Coke. (Hey, this is impor-
tant stuff!) One important note about PAs: They are usually eager to help —
sometimes to a fault. Be sure that they know how to use the equipment
before allowing them to handle it.
Professionals and amateurs
Two kinds of people appear on camera in videos: professionals and amateurs.
Professionals have usually logged many hours in front of a camera. They are
(usually) fun to direct because they (usually) know exactly how to do what-
ever you ask them. But, unfortunately, there’s a cost for such skill. If you have
something important to shoot and the video is message heavy, try to find
the money to hire professionals. Because they are so good at what they do,
you can cut your shooting time in half.
In videography, amateurs are not trained to speak or perform in front of a
camera. Some amateurs are astonishingly effective — most aren’t. The
director’s biggest job with amateurs is to set them at ease during filming. If
an amateur is not nervous, he or she will usually look good in front of the
camera. The viewers of video aren’t turned off by people who lack beauty.
They’re turned off by people who act incompetently in front of the camera.
581

Part V: Filmography Tips
Choosing effective clothing
Whether you’re making a video of a story filled with fictional characters or
you’re shooting your family’s summer vacation, you should carefully con-
sider what the people on camera are wearing. The following are a few basic
tips for choosing effective clothing:
✦Avoid dark clothing, particularly in dark rooms or locations. The audi-
ence will get a better view of subjects who wear light-colored clothing.
✦Avoid patterned dresses that may blend into backgrounds.
✦Avoid low necklines in close-ups because they make it look like the
person isn’t wearing anything at all.
✦Avoid white and red clothing. White interferes with your aperture settings
(the light that reaches the focal plane in your camcorder). Red duplicates
poorly on film and in video and tends to bleed into adjacent, non-red por-
tions of the video.
✦Avoid tight stripes and herringbone patterns because camera and video
player technologies can’t handle these designs. The result on-screen is
called moiré — an unpleasant wavy or shimmering effect on the fabric.

o understand the world of music online, you may want to think of it in
terms of the growth of the World Wide Web. Before the Web, the Internet
was just a bunch of scattered text and images that only academics, hardcore
techies, and dogged research scientists really knew how to navigate. Then
along came a snazzy little program called a Web browser, which provided a
user-friendly, magazine-style way to travel across the Internet. Instead of
looking at messy lines of disorganized text, Web surfers could zoom through
a multimedia landscape of images, pictures, and, yes, sounds. The Net was
no longer just a place to do research; it could entertain you. It was ready
for music.
Ah, but the Web wasn’t the only musical transformation to arrive with the
Internet. Today’s digital music aficionado needs a storage solution that can
squeeze large digital audio files into one-tenth of their normal size. Enter MP3,
one of the most familiar and popular data file formats ever introduced to the
world’s computer owners. You can record your MP3 files on an audio CD or
jauntily transport them to your personal MP3 player — heck, you can even
store them like other files on your computer’s hard drive.
How can you join in on this musical revolution? Never fear, in this chapter,
I show you the advantages of online music and MP3 digital audio, and how
you can enjoy both with your computer.

The Art of Being a Music Fan
The best way to begin exploring music online is to think about how you oper-
ate offline. Whether you’re aware of it or not, you probably have a pretty
ritualized way of enjoying music. Almost everyone does. The better you
understand your likes, dislikes, needs, and wants as a music fan offline, the
better prepared you are to tackle the online world of music.
Take me, for example. I’m a typical music fan for a guy in his early 30s. Like
most guys, I had a fairly intense obsession with my chosen rock gods, Styx
and DEVO. Yes, I’m a little embarrassed to admit it, but back then my bed-
room was plastered with, at highest count, 13 posters, and I had DEVO 
t-shirts, flowerpot hats, Styx birthday cakes, and even my own stylish
black Velcro DEVO wallet.
Now, if I were a teenager in the year 2004, being an obsessive music fan
would be much easier. Instead of schlepping out to the magazine store
to rifle through racks of rock magazines, I could just search for DEVO on
any Internet search engine, such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) or Google
(www.google.com). Instead of biking from record store to record store, I
could surf shopping sites like Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) or Tower
Records (www.towerrecords.com) for available Styx recordings.
Instead of rummaging through flea markets and music stores for the com-
plete Grand Illusions songbook, I could just call up a site like the On-Line
Guitar Archive (www.olga.net) and find all kinds of files to show me how
to play just like Styx guitarist extraordinaire, Tommy Shaw. Well, almost
like him anyway.
You can also find tablature for other instruments as well, such as drums,
keyboards, and bass guitar. Just type in the kind of tablature you’re looking
for in your favorite search engine to see a list of tablature sites. By the way,
in case you don’t already know, tablature is simply a transcription of a cer-
tain instrument’s part in a song. For example, a guitar tablature of a song
tells you which chords to play and when to play them. Think sheet music.
If you can tap into the passion that got you interested in music in the first
place, you can have all the more success and fulfillment when you venture
out onto the Net.
The Seven Wonders of the Online Music World
For the sake of your day-to-day explorations, you’re most likely to deal in
one of these seven areas:
✦Audio
✦Video
✦Merchandise

Sounds kind of like the stuff you play around with offline, right? It is, and
more.
Audio
Music isn’t much without audio. It’s like the sky without air, the sea without
water, the . . . um, help me out here, will you? Despite all the trimmings that
go along with music — shirts, posters, magazines, and so on — the most
important thing is the sound.
To exist online, music audio — or any audio for that matter — must be in
a form that you can access and listen to on your computer. And that form
would be . . . digital, baby!
If you really want to know, digital music is nothing much more than binary
code, which essentially means strings of 1s and 0s. When strung together 
in their own unique ways, the numbers can be decoded into, say, the love
theme from Titanic or “Number of the Beast” by Iron Maiden — though, for-
tunately, never an accidental mix of the two.
For almost as long as people have been using computers, they’ve been
coming up with different software programs that let you record and listen
to music through these machines. You may have heard of MIDI or WAV files,
which were among the first formats for digital audio.
These days, music online takes one of two audio formats:
✦Streaming audio
✦Nonstreaming audio
Streaming audio
Streaming audio does exactly that — it streams fluidly, and almost instantly,
onto your computer. Click a button, and the music flows — that is, as soon
as it can make its way over the often-congested Net wires and into your
machine.
But you pay a price for the instant access. Streaming audio is not stored on
your hard drive; instead, music plays from the hosting site — the Web site
that stores the music file — and stops when the music’s done. Basically,
streaming audio is like a radio broadcast. You tune in and listen, and then
the music fades away.
587

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
To listen to streaming audio — or any online audio, for that matter — you
need to use special programs. Currently, the most popular program for
streaming audio is RealPlayer from RealNetworks (www.real.com), which is
available for both the PC and Macintosh. Microsoft Windows and the Mac
OS also come with their own audio players that can handle streaming audio.
On the PC side, you can use the Windows Media Player or Apple iTunes
(shown in Figure 3-1); Mac owners can use either iTunes or the Apple
QuickTime Player.
Nonstreaming audio
Nonstreaming audio does not play instantly on your computer, as streaming
audio does. Instead, you must download the music file to your hard drive and
play the file later. The bad news is that you have to wait to hear the music.
And how long you wait depends on the speed of your Internet connection and
the size of the music file. The good news is that after you download the music
file, it’s yours to play again and again.
The most popular format for nonstreaming audio today is MP3, a conven-
ient acronym for a format with the unseemly name, MPEG Audio Layer 3.
To enjoy MP3, you simply download your chosen MP3 file and play it by
using an MP3 player. If you already have RealPlayer, the Windows Media
Player, or iTunes (as mentioned previously for playing streaming audio),
then you’re set. You can also find dozens of other MP3 players on the
Internet. I dive into more detail on MP3 later in this chapter.

The Seven Wonders of the Online Music World
Video
Long before the Internet killed the radio star, music video was already digging
the grave. Ever since MTV came on to the culture scene back in the early ’80s,
it’s hard to imagine a new pop song without an accompanying video. You can
find plenty of music videos online, ranging from digital versions of the same
fare you catch on MTV or VH1 to indie (or independent) footage these net-
works would never air.
The Internet is truly the most democratic medium around these days, which
means that anyone with the time and the will can participate. This situation
means that bands, even small garage groups, can use their camcorders to
shoot a video and put it online.
Most online music video comes in the streaming variety, which means 
you need a special player, such as RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, or 
QuickTime Player. Also, with streaming video, just like with streaming
audio, you can’t save the video file to your hard drive for later viewing.
To view the video again, you have to restream it to your computer.
Merchandise
As any music fan knows, there’s nothing like some good stuff to go along
with the tunes. Here’s just a smattering of the music-related stuff you can
get on the Internet:
T-shirts
Banners
Books/magazines
Wallets
Instruments
Figurines
Posters
Songbooks
Computer games
You name it — the stuff is out there.
And, of course, you can find plenty of people who want to sell you the stuff —
and not just at eBay. Web-based stores are filled with all kinds of music-
related merchandise. Instead of having to wait for the next local concert to
buy that latest Shania Twain jersey, you can just boot up a country music
Web store.
Even better for some are the many sites offering concert tickets. Major ticket
companies, such as Ticketmaster (www.ticketmaster.com) and Tickets.com
(www.tickets.com), offer the option of purchasing concert tickets over the
Net. Buying tickets online is a fast way to get good seats while avoiding those
annoying busy signals and long lines.
Radio
Music wouldn’t be much without radio. Radio is how we tune in to hear the
latest artists, pass the time while we jog, and stay sane during endless
morning commutes.
589

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Though not nearly as portable as its offline counterpart, Net radio has a lot
to offer. Unlike offline radio, Net radio isn’t limited by any broadcasting range.
With literally thousands of radio stations broadcasting their shows over the
Internet, you can tune in to a pop music show from Korea while sitting on the
California coast. Plus, all kinds of radio shows are made exclusively for broad-
cast over the Internet. These programs, such as those developed by Pseudo.
com (www.pseudo.com) in New York, often offer more experimental or cutting-
edge content than you find on your local FM station.
Sometimes, these programs throw in a live video feed so that radio seems a
lot more like television. You may find interviews with your favorite bands or
even impromptu studio performances.
Net radio usually comes in streaming format because it emulates the offline
listening experience. So to tune in, you can use the same software you use
for any other streaming audio (see “Streaming audio” earlier in this chapter).
Concerts
The crowds. The sweat. The butane lighters waving precipitously in the air.
Nothing quite captures the group hug that is a live concert, not even the
Internet. But it comes close. These days, artists from the Rolling Stones to
Justin Timberlake have netcasted their concerts to the online audience.
Because the events are live, the audio and, occasionally, the video are gen-
erally streamed over the Net, which means that you tune in with your pre-
ferred streaming audio player, kick back, and enjoy the show.
Bear in mind: Netcasts are sometimes hard to receive because of overly busy
servers and net congestion. Go figure.
To add that all-powerful human element, some sites offer live chat simulta-
neously with the netcast so that you can commune with other like-minded
fans. Waving a lighter at your desktop, however, can be dangerous.
News and information
Every music fan has to stay informed. The Net, of course, is perfectly catered
to keeping you pumped with news and information. If you want to know
something about your favorite band or style of music, you can find something
out there to keep you clued in. Just explore the following sources:
✦Newsgroups are sprawling, usually unedited message boards where
surfers write (or post in Netspeak) their views and rants about their
favorite bands. The alt.music.rush newsgroup is for old diehards
like me.
✦Mailing lists — sometimes called LISTSERVs — are e-mail discussion
and information services that you must subscribe to. You can join, for
example, a George Thorogood mailing list to get all the latest updates
and info on his whereabouts and recordings.
✦Music news sites are the music equivalents of CNN. Sites like MTV
(www.mtv.com) feature daily updates of news and information.

The Background of Music Online
And don’t forget to check out the bevy of personal homepages devoted to
bands for the latest gossip and information. Like all homespun products,
though, the reliability of the info may be a little suspect.
Community
It’s one thing to be, say, a John Denver fan, but it’s a whole different experi-
ence to be among a group of people who share your passion. The community
for music online is sprawling and seemingly endless. And it’s no surprise.
After all, music fans, particularly fans of the Grateful Dead, were among the
first pioneers on the Net.
Today, fans mingle in newsgroups, mailing lists, or live chats. They run their
own Web sites, events, and even offline gatherings. Some sites such as iMusic
(www.imusic.com) are run by companies that empower fans with the tools to
create their own special interest groups.
The Background of Music Online
Like intrepid explorers, people looking for music and music-related stuff
online have to be armed with the right knowledge. Throughout your jour-
neys, you’re sure to run across some references to original manifestations
of music online. Most are still around in some form or another. So if you’re
going to venture out on the wires, you’d better be prepared to know what’s
around the corner.
Here’s a little primer on the background of music online. If you know about
these basics of Net surfing, feel free to skip ahead. 
BBS blues
Long before college students were burning up their Net connections looking
for the latest MP3s, they were hanging out in Bulletin Board Services
(BBSes).
Launched extensively in the late 1980s and early 1990s, BBSes are text-based,
online community centers where people with special interests gather to leave
messages for each other, trade software, or chat in real-time. These sites,
which still exist today, were the foundation for music community online —
places where fans and musicians could stay in touch and share information
even if they lived across the country from each other.
Unsurprisingly, music fans were some of the first to stake their flags in these
new electronic frontiers. Acid rock legends The Grateful Dead inspired one
of the most dedicated legions of music fans. As one of the oldest BBSes 
still in business, The WELL (www.thewell.com) remains a buzzing hive for
Deadheads.
Tommy, can you FTP me?
For a while, the Internet wasn’t as easy as point ’n’ click. It was more like fetch
’n’ get. Finding information took a lot more work and effort than it does today.
591

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Dedicated online music surfers still trade files the old way by using the File
Transfer Protocol (FTP). Simply put, FTP means that you can put a file on to or
get a file off of someone else’s computer. But rather than use a disk to transfer
a file, your computer dials up the other person’s computer and transfers the
file over your Internet connection. Because the owner of the other computer
probably doesn’t want every Joe or Jill Schmoe rummaging through his or
her stuff, he or she probably gives you a secret password that lets you in.
Today, FTPing is most commonly used with MP3s. Cute FTP (www.cuteftp.
com) is among the more popular FTP programs. To get MP3 songs, the
owners may require you to access the files from their computer servers —
the hardware that stores files for Internet access. If they say, “Hey, dude
or dudette, you gotta FTP my server,” you’ll know what they mean.
E-zines
Way back when, someone got the bright idea that people may be compelled
not only to search for information online but also to actually take the time
to read it. Electronic magazines, or e-zines, quickly began filling the demand.
Zines have a long and important history in popular music. Offline, so-called
fan zines date back to the birth of rock ’n’ roll, when intrepid kiddies literally
cut and pasted together their own fan papers and distributed them at con-
certs. With the advent of photocopying technologies, fan zines became more
accessible. Any fans could type out their own fan zines, devoted to a favorite
band, and copy them for others to buy, hopefully.
Electronic zines are made very much in the same spirit. You can find three
basic types of e-zines on the Web:
✦Fan e-zines are created by and for other fans.
✦Professional e-zines look to entertain, inform, and make a buck. The
quality may be better, but you have to endure the advertising.
✦Cross-media e-zines appear in both print and electronic formats. Many
of these, such as Rolling Stone (www.rollingstone.com), combine arti-
cles and information that appear in the regular newsstand version with
new features made specifically for the Web site.
Netcasts
Netcasts. Cybercasts. Webcasts. All these terms mean basically the same
thing — live or previously recorded events that are broadcast over the
Internet. Concerts are obviously perfect for netcasts, as are interviews
and special events like the MTV Video Music Awards.
Joining the Pack of MP3 Users
Technically speaking, zillions of people use MP3 technology today. MP3 tunes
are blasted from home stereos, cars, portable players, some cellular phones,
necklaces, and wristwatches. Here’s how people are using MP3 today. You’re
probably familiar with some of these uses; others may give you some ideas.

Joining the Pack of MP3 Users
Music lovers
The majority of MP3 users love music. Although some MP3 files contain
speeches or narrated books, most contain music. Why? Because converting
music to MP3 makes the following tasks easier:
✦Collecting and trading songs: Many MP3 enthusiasts head for the
Internet’s musical buffet trays, like LimeWire. Those programs enable 
visitors to copy MP3 songs from each others’ hard drives, although the
legality of the process falls in and out of question. In its heyday, Napster
offered more than a million songs from today’s most popular albums, all
up for grabs; today, Napster’s wares are strictly legal. (See Chapter 7 of
Book III for the lowdown on Napster.)
✦Creating personal radio stations: MP3 “radio stations” allow people to
listen to or create their own radio stations. Anybody with an Internet
account can broadcast his or her MP3 collection to listeners anywhere
in the world.
Musicmatch Jukebox (see Figure 3-2) lets you personalize an Internet
radio station so it’s based on your musical tastes. Type in the name of
your favorite artist, and Jukebox creates a station for playing that artist’s
music, as well as music from similar musicians you may enjoy. Type
Beatles, for example, and Jukebox begins playing Beatles songs, as well
as songs from similar artists that you would enjoy.
✦Finding rare songs: Can’t find an old, out-of-print song that’s in the
public domain? Chances are, someone has converted it to MP3 and
uploaded it to the Internet for free downloading. The Internet’s under-
popularized newsgroups contain a wealth of older MP3 tunes, sorted
by decade and genre.
✦Making greatest hits CDs: The latest batch of inexpensive CD-RW drives
read from and write to CDs. Software like Roxio’s Easy Media Creator
and Musicmatch Jukebox convert MP3 files and copy them to a CD that
can play on your home or car stereo.
✦Organizing songs: Computers organize huge numbers of songs much
better than those tall, black CD racks. No more fiddling with plastic CD
cases or home stereo knobs when you want to hear an old favorite. You
can double-click that MP3 file’s name and hear the song play for immedi-
ate satisfaction. Plus, a CD usually holds about ten songs, whereas hard
drives hold thousands.
✦Listening to music on-the-go: Get out of the way, Sony Discman. Most
portable MP3 players don’t have any moving parts. That means skate-
boarders won’t hear any sound skips or bumps, even when rail-sliding
down the stairs at City Hall. I highly recommend the Apple iPod and
iPod mini, which can hold a whopping 10,000 or 1,000 songs, respec-
tively. That, my friends, is the definition of sassy!
✦Finding new bands: Today’s record company agents don’t seek musical
talent as much as they look for music that sells, which leads to waves
of newly signed bands with the same sound. Using MP3, undiscovered
bands post their songs inexpensively on the Internet, giving the public
the first chance to hear new talent.
593

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Musicians
For every band riding the Billboard charts, hundreds of thousands of undis-
covered bands still play their Stratocasters in the garage. Most bands can
barely afford beer. Without gobs of money, bands can’t distribute their CDs
through the music store chains or pay the marketing and advertising costs
to expose people to their music. (And who do you have to know to get your
tune on a TV show like The O.C.?)
MP3 lowers the costs of a chance at success. Any musician with a PC and
some microphones can record a song. The computer then creates an MP3
version and uploads the tune to dozens of Internet sites showcasing new
talent. Many bands — both signed and unsigned — now bypass the record
labels and retail chains and use MP3 technology to let millions of people
hear their songs, with these potential results:
✦If listeners like what they hear on a band’s MP3, they may buy the
band’s homemade CD through the mail.
✦The listeners are happy because they’re hearing fresh, new talent that
they’ve discovered themselves. The band’s happy because it can com-
pete on merit, not cash.
✦In fact, everybody’s happy except the recording industry and music
stores.

Those darn companies
A few savvy record companies have finally realized that they can embrace
MP3 technology rather than battle it. Some labels release a few of their
artists’ tunes in MP3 format and then offer to sell the entire CD through mail
order. The record industry keeps resisting the digital era, however, fearing
that it’ll lose money. (Maybe record industry executives should talk to the
companies who stuff free product samples into our newspapers, magazines,
and mailboxes.)
On the other hand, companies like Apple, Wal-Mart, and the newly reborn
Napster are making money hand over fist selling both individual tracks and
entire albums online. I think that Apple’s iTunes Music Store is the best of
these offerings by far, and I buy at least half of my music these days through
this service.
As more record companies view MP3 as a cost-effective marketing tool, you’ll
hear even more mainstream MP3 songs released legally on the Internet.
Disc jockeys
Your average disc jockey hates toting around turntables, CD players, and
boxes of records. Today’s ultra-fashionable DJ carries a laptop to work. It’s
easier to mix MP3 songs on a laptop and pump the results out to the dance
floor.
Using MP3, DJs create and store an evening’s worth of music on the com-
puter. As the songs play back, the DJ blends them into each other, subtly
speeding them up or slowing them down so they play at the same beat. DJs
can add special effects and incorporate digital tricks unavailable on the
turntable. Software replaces expensive equipment with an on-screen multi-
channel mixer board, complete with fading, backspin, scratching, and bal-
ance adjustment:
✦Some programs are available in several versions. The Home version
of a program will likely work fine for creating simple mixes, while the
Professional version is sure to offer every audio bell and whistle. (Sorry,
I couldn’t help it.)
✦Some MP3 DJ programs mechanically overlap songs by a set number
of seconds, leaving an evening of boring mixes. OtsDJ (www.otsjuke.
com) analyzes the beginnings and ends of songs and varies its mixes
accordingly.
✦Visiosonic (www.visiosonic.com) produces MP3 DJ software with point-
and-click control knobs, sliders, and other gizmos that keep DJs and
broadcasters happy. Upgrade to more elaborate versions that record
your most inspired on-the-fly mixes for later use.
New MP3 disc jockey programs pop up all the time. To find the most current,
search for disc jockey and MP3 using Google.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Print media
MP3 files aren’t just filled with tunes. Check out Audible (www.audible.com)
for the latest spoken word files. Authors often narrate their own works, or you
can even pick up an MP3 file narrating The New York Times, updated daily.
The Audible site also carries MP3-format audiobooks with lectures, read-
ings, and business/technology news.
Comedy lovers
Comedians quickly jumped on the MP3 stage. They’re converting sets into
MP3 format, distributing them on the Net for free, and hoping that chuckling
listeners may laugh their way to the music store and buy their latest CD.
The Internet has carried authorized stand-up comedy MP3s from George
Carlin, Red Foxx, and Maryellen Hooper.
Students
Aside from listening to tunes while running to class (or sitting in class),
students use MP3 technology in another important way: Some portable
MP3 players also serve as digital tape recorders, letting you record notes or
even classroom lectures (if you have the professor’s permission, of course).
Taking a literature class? The Audible Web site carries poems by Emily
Dickinson and study guides to works like The Great Gatsby. Audible lets you
download hundreds of lectures and courses from Harvard and Stanford.
Some are free; others require payment.
Studying Martin Luther King Jr. or Winston Churchill? Download their free
speeches to hear what they really sounded like. You can also find foreign
language tutorials to get a flavor of what you’re trying to speak.
Understanding the Legalities (And Illegalities) of MP3
The technology behind MP3 is perfectly legal. So are baseball bats, automo-
biles, and laser pointers. All of these things can be used illegally, however.
Standard disclaimer: Digital music issues are still being tossed around in the
courts. But let’s start with what’s generally assumed to be legal:
✦Downloading MP3 songs from the Internet if the artist has authorized
those songs for distribution is legal.
✦Nobody will press charges if you make MP3 copies of your CDs, albums,
and soundtracks for your own personal use.
Now, for the illegal parts. Giving away or selling any of the MP3 copies you’ve
made from your CDs, albums, or video sound tracks is illegal. Some Web sites
say downloading a bootleg MP3 is okay “if you only keep it 24 hours.” That’s
not true. It’s still illegal. Just keep in mind the following points:
596

Book III
Chapter 1
Digital Music
Hath Charms
Playing and Creating MP3 Songs
✦In short, MP3 technology is legal, and you’re encouraged to download,
copy, and trade authorized MP3s. Authorized means that the MP3 files
have been approved for distribution by the artist who created them. (As
the bumper sticker reads on the back of my Jeep, “MP3 Is Not a Crime.”)
✦Feel free to make your own MP3 copies from your own CD collection. You
can even copy those MP3 songs onto another CD with your computer’s
CD-RW or DVD drive — as long as you don’t give away or sell either the
original CD or the copy you’ve made. If you give away the copy, you must
destroy the original, or vice versa.
✦To be perfectly clear, any time you make unauthorized copies and
give them away, sell them, or post them on a Web site, you’re breaking
the law.
✦Trading unauthorized MP3 songs means the record company doesn’t
make any money. Many consumers won’t cry over that. But illegal MP3s
also take money from the artists who created the works — no matter
how little the record company might be paying them.
Finding the Best MP3 Files
Millions of MP3 files are scattered around the Internet. The key is to know
where to look:
✦Use Google! Search engines automatically scour the Internet to locate
MP3 sites and songs.
✦Visit Internet newsgroups. These groups are a separate world from the
Web, yet they provide some of the easiest places to find MP3 files and
information.
✦Use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) — one of the fastest and most com-
plicated ways to find MP3 files. You need special software, but when
the switches are set correctly, it’s a rocket.
Many Web sites now review authorized MP3s uploaded by bands. By read-
ing the reviews, you can narrow your downloads to the bands you think
you’ll enjoy the most.
Playing and Creating MP3 Songs
You can listen to MP3 files on your computer, provided it has a sound card
and speakers. For the best sound, however, connect the computer’s sound
card to your home stereo, or invest in the best in computer speaker systems.
Away from home? Portable MP3 players are the latest toys for taking your
music with you. Some PDAs already play MP3s. Most Windows CE palmtops
and many Palm units play MP3 files as well (although you may need a clip-
on audio device).
597

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Creating MP3 files from your own CDs
Creating an MP3 file is a two-step process: ripping and encoding.
✦Ripping means placing your musical CD — the latest by John Mayer, for
example — into your computer’s CD or DVD-ROM drive and telling the
software to copy a song or songs into huge files onto your hard drive.
✦Encoder software then compresses those huge files (known as WAV files
on the PC and AIF files on the MAC) into the much smaller MP3 format,
letting you delete the original recording.
Most all-in-one MP3 players, such as Musicmatch Jukebox or Apple’s iTunes,
rip and encode in one step. Just insert the CD, and, after a few minutes, your
MP3 files appear on the hard drive.
MP3 files aren’t always created from CDs, although that’s the easiest method.
You can turn any recording into an MP3 file by connecting a few wires from
the back of your home stereo’s amplifier to your computer’s sound card.
Copying MP3 files onto CDs
If your computer has a CD-RW drive or DVD recorder, you can free up your
hard drive by storing your MP3 files onto CDs.
Because songs on a CD that you buy in a record store are stored in a special
file format that’s much larger than MP3, those CDs usually hold less than a
dozen songs. By compressing those songs with MP3 and storing the result-
ing MP3 files onto a blank CD, you can usually fit hundreds of MP3 files onto
a single CD (usually called an MP3 disc). Just insert your newly created MP3
disc into your computer, load up your MP3 player, and start listening to the
tunes. Remember, though, MP3 is a different format than the one used for
standard, record store CDs. These MP3 CDs will play on most of the latest
audio CD players, DVD players, boom boxes, and standard home stereos —
check the manual that came with your audio and video equipment to find
out whether it supports MP3 discs.
The songs on a CD purchased at a record store are known simply as audio
CDs. These songs are stored in a format different from MP3. They play in
both your computer and your home stereo’s CD player, but their bloated
file format means only ten or so songs fit onto the CD. A CD with MP3 files
plays on your computer, but it may not play on your home stereo’s CD
player, but on the plus side, MP3’s compressed file format lets you store
hundreds of songs on the CD.

omputers weren’t made for music. They were made, more or less, for
word processing, calculations, spreadsheets, and a bunch of other stuff
that you’d look really silly dancing to.
For anyone who wants to explore the world of music online, this challenge
of turning a computer into a music machine is considerable. Though most
new computers can play back music, they’re not meant to be stereos.
So whether you listen to Bette Midler or Nine Inch Nails, you want to get
the full oomph of the music experience through an awesome-sounding
machine — not some lame background music squeezing through your
computer’s speakers. So roll up your sleeves, whip out that credit card,
and prepare to turn your computer into a lean, mean music machine. In
this chapter, you find out how to transform your hardware into rockware.
Listening to CDs on Your Computer
If you’re like me, you enjoy playing music in the background while you
work. (In case you’re wondering, I’m listening to George Thorogood’s clas-
sic album Bad to the Bone right now). Virtually all computers in use today
can play music CDs!
What you need
To play music CDs on your computer, make sure you have the following stuff:
✦A computer. (Go figure.)
✦A CD-ROM drive.
✦External computer speakers that plug into your machine.
599

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
✦If you have a Windows PC, a sound card, which is a piece of computer
hardware that lets your computer play sounds. It probably came with
your machine.
If you have a Macintosh, you don’t have to worry about a sound card.
All Macs come equipped with built-in sound. Isn’t that nice?
✦A CD player application, which comes with either Windows or the Mac
OS. Other programs can also play CDs on your computer.
Don’t worry if you don’t know what all this stuff is. You will know by the end
of this chapter.
Play it, Sam
To fire up your favorite CD, follow these steps:
1. Get a music CD.
Pick a CD, any CD. . . .
2. Press the Open/Close button of the CD-ROM drive, place the disc in
the tray, and then press the Open/Close button again.
3. If your CD player application doesn’t automatically start up, launch
the program.
In Windows XP, choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪
Entertainment➪Windows Media Player.
In Mac OS X, click the iTunes icon in the Dock.
If you’re using another program for playing MP3 songs and audio CDs,
go right ahead and launch it.
4. Click the Play button.
The buttons on the controller are similar to those you find on any car or
home stereo. You can also stop, pause, move from track to track, move
forward or backward in a track, and adjust the volume.
How’s that sound? Music to your ears, I hope.
Creating a Dream Music Machine
Think of a computer as a stereo. Audiophiles seldom go out and buy just one
complete stereo. Instead, they carefully select each component separately —
for example, a receiver, a tape deck, a CD player, speakers, an equalizer, an
amplifier, and so on. If they listen to more albums than CDs, they invest more
in a killer turntable.
If these audiophiles are into DVDs — short for digital versatile discs, which
can hold both audio and video — they may get a DVD player as well. Virtually
all PCs and Macs can play DVDs if they come with a DVD-ROM drive.
You can modify and customize your computer in a similar fashion. You can
start out with the basics — a monitor, a hard drive, a keyboard, and so on —
and then add different peripherals, or additional hardware devices, as you
see fit.

Book III
Chapter 2
Using Your Computer
as a Music Platform
Creating a Dream Music Machine
You can also customize your computer internally. You can add memory, dif-
ferent sound capabilities — whatever you desire. The following subsections
show you how you can put together your dream machine.
Choosing a computer
Because any new desktop computer or laptop can play music, you don’t
need to worry too much about what you get. In general, like I always tell my
friends, get the best one you can afford. However, keep in mind that with all
the technological innovations happening, the computer you buy now may
be out of date in just a few months. But that shouldn’t stop you from con-
structing a killer computer system to satisfy your online music cravings.
Here are some things to consider if you’re starting completely from scratch:
✦Macintosh or PC? If that’s the question, the answer is probably among
the most personal in the high-tech world. Mac and PC users are equally
dedicated to their machine of choice. My sister-in-law bought a candy-
colored Mac because it matched her sofa. My friend bought a PC because
he likes playing all the latest computer games. For music purposes, you
can find more goodies available for PC than Mac, but the Mac is home
to the exceptional iTunes player and iTunes Music Store. I’ll be honest:
The average online music fan can be happy with either one. Therefore,
don’t buy a computer just for music. Think about the other things you
want to use it for, too.
Music-loving programmers have been busy. In addition to the standard
Windows and Mac OS–based MP3 players, programmers have written
players for DOS, Macintosh, Amiga, Atari, OS/2, BeOS, FreeBSD, Solaris,
Linux, SunOS, IRIX, HP-UX, AIX, and other UNIX platforms.
✦Computing power. A computer’s performance is dictated by its
processor — the device inside your computer that does all that com-
plicated thinking — and the amount of RAM installed in the computer.
Processors are measured by the speed at which they make calculations;
such measurements come in units called megahertz. If you’re using a
PC, I suggest getting at least a Pentium III processor. For a Macintosh,
don’t get anything less than a G3. For each platform, anything less than
500 MHz won’t do you much good. On the RAM side, your computer
should have at least 128MB (megabytes) of memory to fully enjoy
today’s audio player applications.
✦Monitor. The bigger, the better. Though you’re tweaking your computer
for music, you’re going to be viewing a lot of Web pages along the way.
The more screen space you have to see what you’re surfing, the more
pleasurable the ride will be.
✦Keyboard. An ergonomic keyboard can save your wrist from the dreaded
wrist-crunch condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. (If you don’t think
carpal tunnel can happen to you, don’t be so sure; for a while, I had to
sleep with wrist splints.) Unlike normal keyboards, an ergonomic key-
board is split and angled in such a way to line up more comfortably
with the natural position of your hands.
✦Mouse. You can get by just fine with the mouse that comes with your
computer, but you may want to invest in a mouse (or trackball) that has
several buttons that you can program to do different things. Not bad for
late nights of MP3 trolling.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
What about upgrading my PC’s processor?
Upgrading a computer’s central processing unit, or CPU, seems easy enough.
You remove the case, pull out the old chip, push in a compatible replace-
ment, and screw the case back on. The problem is dealing with the disap-
pointment when you first turn on the computer. Unfortunately, doubling
your computer’s processing speed rarely makes it run twice as fast.
Your computer’s speed depends on many things, including its amount of
memory, motherboard speed (known as bus speed), and hard drive speed
(particularly the amount of free space left on it). Even a slow graphics card
can hold back your computer’s performance.
Don’t be surprised if that new CPU speeds up your computer by only 25 per-
cent. And if that new CPU doesn’t increase the speed by at least 200 MHz or
so, the results probably won’t even be noticeable enough to warrant the
upgrade.
Several companies make upgrades for your CPU; they keep releasing
upgrades faster than I can type them into a book. Table 2-1 shows some
of the most popular upgrade makers and their Web sites.
Table 2-1
CPU Upgrade Makers
This Company . . .
. . . Found Here . . .
. . . Does This
Evergreen
www.evertech.com
Evergreen’s products upgrade every-
thing from a 486 to a Pentium 4.
Kingston
www.kingston.com
The world’s largest independent
memory manufacturer, Kingston also
carries an impressive array of inex-
pensive CPU upgrades.
AMD
www.amd.com
Behind Intel, AMD is the second most
popular PC CPU on the market (and the
basis for many an upgrade).
PowerLeap
www.powerleap.com
PowerLeap helps simplify the upgrade
process by mounting its replacement
chips on a tiny circuit board. Flip the
tiny switches on the board to make it
compatible with the CPU that you’re
replacing.
If your computer is more than four years old — or if the chipmaker recom-
mends it — make sure that your computer is running the most current
BIOS available before adding the new CPU. The Web site of your computer’s
manufacturer usually carries a program to update a computer’s BIOS. The
upgrade chip manufacturer can usually help you here. In fact, many PC
owners opt to replace both the motherboard and the CPU at once, which
greatly improves performance; however, you may have to buy new memory
modules because the older, slower RAM chips aren’t compatible with your
new motherboard.

When upgrading your computer’s CPU, keep in mind the following:
✦Tools: One hand, a screwdriver, and the replacement CPU manual
✦Cost: Anywhere from $75 to $600, depending on the power
✦Time: Anywhere from an afternoon to a weekend, depending on your
technical experience within the bowels of your PC
Static electricity can zap a CPU. Tap your computer’s case to ground your-
self before touching the CPU. If you live in a particularly dry, static-prone
area, wear rubber gloves (the kind that doctors and dentists wear these
days) or a grounding wrist strap (to fasten between your wrist and the com-
puter’s case).
Here are the general steps to upgrade your computer’s CPU to a faster
model (of course, if the manual for your new upgrade chip describes the
installation process differently, follow those instructions instead!):
1. Check the manual or the upgrade manufacturer’s Web site to make
sure your upgrade chip is compatible with your computer.
Installing an incompatible CPU into your computer can destroy it. Check
the manufacturer’s guarantees and compatibility list very carefully before
ordering and installing the chip.
While you’re looking around in the manual and on the Web site, check to
see whether you need a BIOS upgrade as well.
2. Unplug your computer and remove the cover.
If you live in a dry area with static, wear a grounding wrist strap or
rubber gloves. No static problem? Then just touch the case to ground
yourself before starting.
3. Find your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) on the
motherboard.
Your computer’s processor is usually the largest black square thing on
the motherboard — the largest socket. The processor is usually covered
with a heat sink and fan unit as well.
4. Remove the original processor.
After you unplug the fan and remove the heat sink, take a second to
examine the processor. Some chips come with a little lever. Pull the
lever, and the old processor pops out, ready for replacement. Other
chips need to be pried out with a little metal tool. (The cheap tools
usually come inside the new CPU’s box.)
A socket with a little lever is called a Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) socket.
A lever-less socket is a Low Insertion Force (LIF) socket.
5. Examine the holes in the socket and the pins in the CPU.
Make sure that you’re putting the right CPU into the socket. The pins and
holes should line up exactly. (Look for a notch in the corner of the CPU
and socket and match them up.) Check the replacement CPU’s instruc-
tions; chips requiring a socket with a lever won’t work if there’s no lever.
603

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
6. Line up the chip’s pins over the socket’s holes; then gently push the
processor into the socket.
Don’t bend any pins. Please. And don’t push too hard; sometimes a
motherboard can crack, making you head back to the computer store
and frown while buying a new one.
7. If your new processor came with a cooling fan, install it per the instal-
lation instructions.
The more powerful your processor, the more it heats up. (Just ask the
guy at the airport with a laptop on his lap.) Some upgrade chips need a
tiny fan to keep them cool. In fact, some chips come with a fan mounted
right on their backs.
8. Close the socket handle, if necessary, screw the cover back on your
computer, plug it in, and see whether it runs more quickly.
Hopefully, you’ll notice a difference in computer speed, especially when
converting CDs to MP3s.
Picking a sound card
Attention Mac users: You can skip this subsection. Your Mac comes with
built-in sound capability that can knock your socks off. 
For PC users, the sound card is the core of your computer’s audio power.
The sound card processes audio information and then sends it out through
your speakers. Whether you know it or not, you almost certainly have a 
16-bit sound card already inside your computer. The only reasons you may
need to install a new sound card are as follows:
✦You want a better card with more features.
✦You need to replace the card.
✦You’re adding a sound card to an older PC.
✦You’re building your own PC.
A basic sound card, like the popular series of Sound Blaster cards from
Creative Labs (www.creativelabs.com), can do you fine.
Some companies offer 3-D audio sound cards; these sound cards are
made especially for computer games. With them, you get all the magical
sounds of flying bullets and whooshing phasers — obviously not the stuff
of your favorite bands. But if you should choose a 3-D sound card, it can
handle your music as well. You can also pick up a card that’s capable of
Dolby Surround sound, but you’ll need the corresponding surround sound
speaker system to take full advantage of your music. (More on this in the
next section.)
Installing a card
Whether you’re installing a new whiz-bang sound card or a FireWire port
card, the steps are the same. And they’re surprisingly easy. This section
shows how to install a new card, whatever species it may be.
604

Book III
Chapter 2
Using Your Computer
as a Music Platform
Creating a Dream Music Machine
Many multimedia computers come with four to six speakers, ready to play
back surround sound. Although four speakers may sound cool for a while,
surround sound was really designed for DVD players that play back movies
recorded with surround sound technology. Although it’s great for computer
games, the technology doesn’t really make the current generation of MP3
songs sound any better.
To install a new card, keep in mind the following:
✦Tools: One hand and a screwdriver
✦Cost: Anywhere from $50 to $300 and more
✦Time: An afternoon should be plenty of time
Cards are particularly susceptible to static electricity. Tap your computer’s
case to ground yourself before touching the card. Also, be careful not to
bend the card while installing it. Doing so can damage its circuitry.
Cards are pretty easy to install. They’re self-contained little units. For exam-
ple, they suck electricity right out of that little slot that they plug into. You
don’t need to plug special power cables into them. (A wire from some CD
players connects to some sound cards, however, to route the sound directly
to the card.)
Cards come in several different lengths and standards. Be sure that you buy
the right type of card for your computer. Usually the choice runs between
PCI and ISA cards. (PCI slots are always shorter than ISA slots and usually
white; ISA slots are always longer than PCI slots and usually black. Check
your computer’s manual to be sure.)
Cards are delicate. Handle them only by their edges. Even the oil from your
fingers can damage their circuitry.
Some cards are longer and fatter than others. You may need to rearrange
some of your existing cards to accommodate new cards of different lengths
and thicknesses.
To install a card, follow these steps:
1. Turn off your computer, unplug it, and remove the cover.
2. Find the slot that’s the right size for your card.
See the row of slots along the inside of your computer? Some are already
filled with cards. And see the row of slots along the back of your com-
puter, where cables plug into the backs of the cards? Your new card
plugs into a slot adjacent to the other cards. A sound card’s plugs and
ports are then accessible from outside the PC.
Examine the slots closely; then examine the slots along the bottom of
your card. Slots vary in size; you need one that will fit your card exactly.
Don’t confuse your computer’s expansion slots — the ones where the
cards plug in — with its much-smaller memory slots, where the RAM
chips slide in.
605

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
If you have a lot of room, keep your cards spaced as far apart as possi-
ble. Doing so keeps them a little cooler.
3. Remove the slot’s cover.
Unused slots usually have a little cover to keep dust from flying in
through the back of your computer. With a small screwdriver, remove
the screw that holds the cover in place. Don’t lose the screw! You need
it to secure the card in place.
Dropped the screw in there “somewhere”? Turn the computer on its side
and shake it gently until the screw falls out. You can’t leave it inside there,
or it may short-circuit something important.
Removed the dropped screw? Keep it handy, as well as the little cover
bracket. You’ll want to replace the cover if you ever remove the card.
4. Push the card into its slot.
To spare yourself some possible aggravation, first check your card’s
manual to see whether you need to flip any of the card’s switches or
move any of its jumpers — little prongs with a movable bar. Then you
won’t have to take the card back out if it’s not working right.
Holding the card by its edges, position it over the slot, as shown in
Figure 2-1. The shiny silver edge with the ports and plugs in it should
face toward the back of your computer.
Slots come in several sizes. Modern computers come with PCI (Peripheral
Component Interface) slots for the Pentium’s Plug and Play technology,
and an occasional ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) slot to stay com-
patible with older cards. PCI slots are shorter; ISA slots are longer. Your
card can only fit into one of the slots, so compare the tabs on the card’s
bottom with the holes in the slots.
There’s also a special slot, called an AGP slot, which only holds video
cards. Because all sound cards these days are PCI cards, you can safely
ignore your AGP slot.
Push the card slowly into the slot. You may need to rock it back and
forth gently. When it pops in, you can feel it come to rest. Don’t force it!
Don’t leave any cards resting against any other cards. Doing so can cause
electrical problems, and neither the card nor the computer will work.

two tabs

into one

computer’s
slots.
606

Chapter 2

5. Secure the card in the slot with the screw.
Yep, each of those expensive cards is held in place by a single screw.
Make sure that you use a screw; don’t just leave the card sitting there.
Cards should be grounded to the computer’s case. Without a secure
connection, they may not work.
6. Plug the computer back in and turn it on. The Windows fancy Plug
and Play feature recognizes and installs the card.
Windows XP should recognize your new sound card and set it up to
work correctly.
7. If everything works, carefully put the cover back on — you’re done!
If the card still doesn’t work, you probably have to run the card’s installa-
tion software. Still doesn’t work? Then try the following:
✦Check the manual to make sure that the card’s switches and jumpers
are set correctly.
✦You may have to run the card’s software and restart your computer
before it will work. That’s because the software puts a driver in one
of your computer’s special areas. Your computer reads that file only
when it’s first turned on or when it’s restarted.
✦Make sure that the card is seated securely in its slot and screwed in
reasonably tight.
✦Make sure that the card is in the right slot and that each of its copper-
colored tabs fits firmly into a slot.
✦It can take some fiddling to get a card working right. The key is not to
get frustrated.
✦Nine times out of ten, the problem lies with the software. The card is sit-
ting in the slot correctly, but the software is conflicting with some other
software or not talking with the card. Check the manual that accompa-
nied the card for possible software troubleshooting information, or visit
the manufacturer’s Web site to read online documentation like FAQ files
or a knowledge database.
✦If the card still doesn’t work, root around in its box for the manual. Most
manuals list a technical support phone number or Web site that offers
help.
Selecting speakers
Until recently, computer speakers were pretty much an afterthought. After
all, who really needed to listen to those system startup tones in stereo? But
with the increased popularity of computer games, DVDs, and online music,
a good set of speakers is becoming essential.
You may be surprised at how good computer speakers can sound these
days. Part of the reason is that some major stereo speaker manufacturers,
such as Boston Acoustics and Altec Lansing, are now knee-deep in the busi-
ness as well.
607

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
The major speaker manufacturers understand that the future of the music
listening experience will rely more and more on digital distribution, and
consumers are going to demand better ways to enjoy the sounds.
Here are some features you can look for when selecting your computer
speakers:
✦Price: You can get a decent pair of speakers for about $100. Like any-
thing else, you can spend more, depending on your passion. High-end
speakers can cost as much as $500.
✦Subwoofer: A subwoofer is an additional component to a computer
speaker system that specifically handles the sound system’s bass.
Subwoofers usually sit on the floor, while the two stereo speakers are
angled toward the listener from higher up. Using a subwoofer isn’t nec-
essary, but doing so gives you a richer, fuller bass sound — something
especially nice when you use some tiny computer speakers for every-
thing else.
✦Dolby Surround: Dolby Surround is a feature you use when listening to
DVD concert movies that were shot with this special sound technology,
or to DVD audio discs. For more on Dolby Surround, check out Dolby’s
Web site at www.dolby.com.
✦Rear speakers: These speakers are for the true audiophiles; you place
them behind you for that theater surround sound experience. You use
these speakers for listening mainly to DVD movie audio.
Adding memory
Online, it’s nice to be an elephant. In a nutshell, the more random access
memory, or RAM, your computer has, the more programs your computer
can run at a time. After you sink yourself in the playfield of music online,
you may find yourself giving new meaning to the idea of multitasking —
that is, doing a lot of things at once.
If you have 128MB of RAM and use Windows 98 or Mac OS 9, you should be
fine. But if you’re running Windows XP or Mac OS X (or you plan on watch-
ing DVDs and getting into MIDI or any kind of music production), you really
need 256 or 512MB. And if you can afford even more, by all means, splurge.
Need help adding RAM to your PC? I can highly recommend the comprehen-
sive Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Mark L. Chambers (and pub-
lished by Wiley, if you hadn’t guessed already). The book is a great guide 
to help you make sense out of all the memory craziness . . . plus, you get
step-by-step instructions on how to install hardware like memory modules
and sound cards.
Exploring bandwidth
Unlike the regular roads, speeding on the information superhighway is not
only acceptable, but also the only way to ride. 
Your on-ramp to the superhighway is your Internet service provider (ISP) —
the company that provides you online access — which is available for a
variable monthly subscription.
608

Book III
Chapter 2
Using Your Computer

Creating a Dream Music Machine
Bandwidth, which measures how much data can flow through the telephone
lines to and from your modem, is the golden ring. The more bandwidth, the
faster the connection, and the quicker you can download your favorite MP3s.
Here’s a look at the different options for playing with the bandwidth:
✦Dialup access means that your computer sends and receives data over
the Internet through a modem. The speed of data through a modem is
measured in bits per second (bps). When I downloaded my first song
online, I was using a 2400 bps modem, which took about an hour to get
one song. These days, most computers come with modems that can
handle 56,000 bits per second (sometimes abbreviated 56Kbps).
Not bad, but not lightning-fast by any means. We’re still in an era when
we actually have time to kill during long downloads. And if you’re using
dialup, you’d better get used to heading off for a snack while your MP3s
download.
✦Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) was the first technology
that provided faster bandwidth than a basic dialup modem, but it has
been practically rendered extinct by DSL and cable modem services.
Unlike DSL and cable connections, an ISDN connection isn’t “always on”
either. You actually have to dial your ISP, just like an older dialup modem.
How primitive! I recommend that you give ISDN a wide berth and let it
finish fading away into archaic Internet history.
✦Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) are now offered by the majority of
Internet providers and phone companies. DSL not only gives you high-
speed access (30 times faster than a 56K modem), but also gives you
fast access for sending data upstream yourself — especially important
for bands who want to post a lot of MP3s.
✦Cable modems are being enjoyed by a growing group of home surfers.
Cable companies offer this service. If your neighborhood is wired for
this, you can get it; if not, you have to wait. Right now, cable modems
deliver data at about 500 times faster than a 56K modem.
✦T1 connections, common in the workplace and some newfangled apart-
ment buildings, offer high speed, broadband connections at around 1.5
megabits per second (Mbps). That’s cruising nice and fast. No wonder
so many bosses are banning access to MP3 sites from the workplace.
Storing stuff
In a scene from the film Diner, the 1950s coming-of-age film, one guy chas-
tises his girlfriend for messing up his meticulously organized record collec-
tion. How dated, indeed. With music online, storing songs, sites, graphics,
or whatever else suits your fancy is a nice, clean digital affair.
Your hard drive will probably suffice for most of your storage needs. My
motto, as always, is to get the biggest one you can afford. You can easily fill
up the space — especially if you get addicted to games. An 80 to 120 giga-
byte (GB) drive is pretty spacious, but — like RAM — you’ll never have too
much hard drive space.
Floppy disks are a problem. One MP3 song, for example, can weigh in at
about 4.5MB. A floppy can hold only about 1.4MB. That’s a squeeze.
609

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Though you may try to compress a song, floppies don’t really make a lot of
sense for these kinds of things.
If you really start getting on a roll, you probably want to take your tunes on
the road. For more general, transportable storage needs, a portable storage
device like a USB flash drive is a nice way to travel. These solid-state won-
ders have no moving parts to wear out, and can store anywhere from 128MB
to a whopping 1GB in a form factor that’s about the size of a keychain. Plus,
a USB 2.0 model can transfer an entire album’s worth of songs in under 15
seconds!
Another medium for storing your MP3 and other computer sound files is
the tried-and-true recordable CD or DVD. You can get yourself a CD or DVD
recorder and, with the right software, burn audio CDs that you can play in
most conventional CD players. You’re limited to putting up to 80 minutes of
audio on each disc. If you store the MP3 files as data files, you can get tons
of songs (up to 700MB worth) on a single CD. However, if you go that route,
you can’t play the discs in older CD players (though more and more new CD
and DVD players have the ability to play MP3 files).
Installing a larger hard drive
It happened ever so slowly. But suddenly, your 20GB hard drive has
only 500MB of free space. And you still need to convert your new Trance
Factory CD.
It’s no secret why your hard drive suddenly shrunk. MP3 files are huge. Sure,
they’re compressed files, but that doesn’t mean they’ll fit on a floppy. The
Beatles’ “I Am the Walrus” eats up 4MB (and that’s only at the standard
sampling rate).
If you’re turning your computer into a music player, it’s time for a second
hard drive. Huge, fast hard drives now cost less than ever. Best yet, today’s
large drives come with much-appreciated installation software to start the
drive spinning.
The problem comes when figuring out which type of drive to buy. Over the
years, manufacturers have created drives according to more than a dozen
different standards. Today, three standards prevail: Serial ATA, SCSI, and
EIDE. Being less expensive, EIDE currently rules the market. Unless you
already have a Serial ATA or SCSI drive, buy EIDE.
Another expansion solution that’s become quite popular these days is the
external FireWire or USB 2.0 drives. Although they’re naturally more expen-
sive than a “bare” internal drive, portable drives are as simple to install as
plugging the cable from the drive to the corresponding port on your com-
puter! Also, you can haul your MP3 files around with you from place to place
with a portable drive — just make sure that the computers you plan to visit
have the same ports onboard. (There’s nothing more embarrassing than
showing up to jam with your friend and finding out that he doesn’t have a
USB 2.0 port on his PC.)
EIDE stands for Enhanced Integrated Device (or Drive) Electronics. Yawn.
SCSI stands for Small Computer System Interface.

Also keep in mind the following tips:
✦When buying a second drive, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of
PowerQuest’s PartitionMagic software at the same time. The software
makes it easy to install your new hard drive as your C drive, change
your existing hard drive to your D drive, and then copy all the informa-
tion from D to C. (That sounds boring, but it’s very handy.)
✦It takes more hard drive space to create an MP3 than to merely listen to
it. Converting an entire CD at once can require 500MB of space or more.
Find the largest hard drive you can afford. Then buy one a little bit
bigger.
✦Before installing a second hard drive, do these chores: Back up your
first hard drive and dig around for your original Windows CD. (You may
need the CD’s serial code for installation; it’s often on a sticker on the
CD case, as well as with your manual.)
Installing or replacing an EIDE hard drive
Don’t like fiddling around inside computers? Most computer shops will
install your new drive for around $50 in labor costs. (Or, as I mention in
the previous section, you can pick up an external drive instead.)
If you’re bravely tackling this beast yourself, keep the following in mind:
✦Tools you need: One hand, a screwdriver, and a Windows install disc.
✦Cost: Roughly $50 to $200.
✦Time: No more than an afternoon.
✦Stuff to watch out for: If you’re replacing your current hard drive, make
sure that you have your Windows install CD on hand. You’ll need some
of the programs on that disc.
When installing a new drive, make it your C (or master) drive. The master
drive is the one that the computer looks at first and boots from. The new
drive will probably be faster, making Windows run faster, as well. Your 
old drive then becomes your secondary drive, or slave. You need to move 
a little jumper on the second drive to make that drive work as the slave 
(see Figure 2-2).
Some hard drives automatically set themselves up for one hard drive if
they’re set up as the master. You may have to check the drive’s manual on
this one. (Your manufacturer may also have been nice enough to print the
master/slave jumper positions on the top of the drive.)
You may need rails to mount your hard drive inside your computer. Some
drives come with mounting rails; others don’t. If you’re replacing an old
drive, you can often unscrew its old rails and swipe them. Otherwise, you
may need to head back to the store to buy some. (They’re usually pretty
cheap.)
611

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
The following steps show you how to install a second hard drive or replace
your existing drive:
1. Make sure that your current hard drive is error-free; then back up its
data.
Start by running the Windows ScanDisk program to ensure that your
hard drive is error-free. Under Windows XP, double-click My Computer,
right-click the drive you want to replace, and choose Properties. Click
the Tools tab, and click the Check Now button. Doing so finds and
repairs errors.
Next, back up your hard drive before removing it. You don’t want to lose
any of your data.
2. Turn off and unplug your computer and remove the case.
Before removing your computer’s case, turn it off and unplug it. Then
remove the computer’s case by removing the screws holding it on.
3. If you’re replacing your hard drive, remove the cables from the old
drive; if you’re adding a second hard drive, don’t remove the cables.
If you’re adding a second drive, check out the flat ribbon cable connected
to the first drive. Do you see a second, unused plug on it? If not, head
back to the store for a new ribbon cable. It needs to have two connec-
tors. (Most already do, luckily.) You second-drive installers can now
jump ahead to Step 6.
Hard drives have several cables plugged into them, including the
following:
• Ribbon cable: The ribbon cable leads from the hard drive to its con-
troller card or the motherboard. The cable pulls straight off the drive
pretty easily.
Power supply

Chapter 2

Creating a Dream Music Machine
• Power cable: The smaller cable is made of four wires that head
for the power supply. Power cables come in two sizes, as shown
in Figure 2-3. Like the ribbon cable, the power cable pulls straight
off the drive’s socket; it usually takes a lot more pulling, though.
Don’t pull on the wires themselves; pull on the cable’s plastic con-
nector. Sometimes a gentle back-and-forth jiggle can loosen it.
4. Remove the mounting screws holding the drive in place.
Hard drives are held in place by screws in their sides. The screws on
one side may be hidden from view by a particularly long card, or even
another drive mounted on its side. That means you have to pull out the
card or remove the obstructing drive just to get at the screws. Such a
bother.
5. Slide the old drive out of the computer.
After you remove the old drive’s cables and screws, you can slide the
old drive out of the computer. Give it a gentle tug. Some drives slide out
toward the computer’s center; be sure not to gouge your motherboard
while pulling out the drive.
6. Slide the new drive in where the old one came out.
Adding a second drive? Slide it into a vacant bay, which usually is next
to the first drive. Check your computer’s manual; you may be able to
mount the drive on its side in a special spot inside your computer.
If you’re replacing drives, your new drive should slide in place right
where the old one came out. Doesn’t fit? If the new drive is smaller than
the old one, you need to add rails or mounting brackets to make it fit.
When handling drives, be careful not to damage their exposed circuitry
by bumping it into other parts of your computer. Also, be sure to touch
your computer’s metal case to get rid of any static electricity before
picking up your drive.
7. Attach two cables to the hard drive.
Try sliding the drive out a little bit to connect the two cables more
easily. (Refer to the drive’s manual to see where each cable connects
to the drive.)
Figure 2-3:
EIDE
devices use

two sizes for

Ribbon cable: The plug on the ribbon cable should push onto little pins
on the end of the drive, and it should fit only one way. The other end of
the cable goes to a socket on the motherboard. (The edge of the cable
with the red stripe connects to pin number one.)
If you’re installing a second hard drive, the ribbon cable should have a
spare connector on it. (If not, head back to the store.) It doesn’t matter
which connector goes onto which drive; the computer looks at the
drives’ master/slave jumpers to figure out which one is drive C.
Adding a second drive: If this is your second drive, look for its master/
slave jumper. Make this second drive the master drive. The hard drive’s
label (or the manual) will tell you where to put the jumper. Make your
old drive the slave drive.
EIDE drives usually come configured as master drives. If you’re installing
just a single EIDE drive in your computer, you usually don’t need to mess
with any of the jumpers.
Power supply: The power supply cable fits into the drive’s socket only
one way. Even so, check the ends to make sure that you’re not forcing
it in the wrong way. Refer to Figure 2-2 to make sure that you’ve found
the right power cable socket.
Power supply cables come with both large and small connectors. The
connectors are supposed to fit only one way, but the small ones often
fit either way. The trick? Look for the number 1 somewhere near the
drive’s little socket. The power supply connector’s red wire fastens
onto the number 1 prong.
8. Replace the screws.
Cables attached? Master/slave jumper set? Then fasten the drive in place
with those little screws. Make sure that they are short screws to prevent
damage to the inside of the hard drive.
9. Replace the cover, plug in the computer, and turn it on.
Chances are, your hard drive won’t work right off the bat. Hard drives
must be prepared before they start to work, unfortunately. Take a deep
breath before worrying about that task. Exhale. Now move on; it’s time
to break in that new hard drive.
Today’s hard drives come with installation software that takes care of the
rest automatically, so rejoice! If you have any questions about your specific
drive, check the manual; if you installed a used drive and you didn’t get a
manual, visit the manufacturer’s Web site. (Most drive manufacturers have
the entire manual in PDF [Adobe Acrobat] format for each drive, ready and
waiting for you to download.)
Hooking Up the Stereo
So if you’re turning a computer into a music machine, why not just do the
obvious: Hook it up to the stereo? If you want to make audiotapes of your
MP3s (or even streaming audio concerts) for your car’s tape deck, this is
probably a good idea. Also, if your band wants to convert a demo tape

Chapter 2
Using Your Computer
as a Music Platform
Adding Groovy Extras
into MP3 format for posting on the Web, you can reverse the hookup —
that is, run the sound out from your stereo into the microphone jack of
your computer.
If you just want to listen to music you find on the Web, you may find it easier
to just invest in some high-end computer speakers. A basic computer can
do the essential functions of your stereo:
✦Play compact discs.
✦Play high-quality sound through high-end computer speakers.
The main reason most people seem to want to connect the two beasts is to
crank their MP3s out of their stereo system. For a rundown on this proce-
dure, head to Chapter 3 of Book III.
Stereo speakers are not magnetized in the same way as computer speakers.
If you place your stereo speakers too close to your computer, they could
damage your hard drive. Play it safe and keep at least a few feet of space
between the two. Or, better yet, shell out some cash for a good set of com-
puter speakers with a subwoofer.
Adding Groovy Extras
After you get started, you can easily get carried away with accessorizing your
computer. Ultimately, a computer is a tool, and the more tools you have, the
more stuff you can do. So if you want a breakdown of the possible extras (or
peripherals) and how you can use them for music online, here’s a nice birth-
day gift wish list.
Scanners
A scanner is much like a digital copy machine. It connects to your computer
and creates digital images of any object that’s scanned — photos, newspa-
per clippings, even the back of your hand. (If you’re into that sort of thing.)
For music fans, a scanner is definitely a plus. If, say, you end up running
your own fan e-zine for your favorite band, you may want to scan all kinds
of accumulated art for your site (watch out for copyright violations, of
course). But even if you want to upload some old-fashioned film photos
of you and your buds outside the Marilyn Manson show, you can’t beat a
scanner. And with scanner prices falling as low as $50, investing in a scan-
ner is a sure thing.
You can get three types of scanners:
✦Flatbed scanners are just that — flat. These make the most sense. You
can lay out clippings nice and easy and get smooth clean copies.
✦Sheetfed scanners are ideal if you’re trying to save desk space. For
these scanners, you manually feed whatever you want to be digitized
into the machine. This is not ideal, though, for scanning little scraps
of concert set lists or whatever else you may want to archive.
615

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
✦Handheld scanners put the power of digitization in the palm of your
hand, and they may be perfect for scanning your old ticket stub collec-
tion. However, you have to make multiple swipes over anything larger
and “stitch” the images together in an image editor, so most folks eschew
handheld scanners unless they’re on the road with a laptop.
Unfortunately, there’s not enough room in this section to even begin to
explore today’s scanners — however, if you need all the details, you can
always find ’em in Scanners For Dummies, 2nd Edition by Mark L. Chambers
(published by your friends at Wiley). The entire book is dedicated to describ-
ing all aspects of scanning on a PC or Mac, as well as plenty of step-by-step
instruction. Check it out!
Cameras
Digital cameras, which take digital pictures that you can post and trade on
the Web, are becoming indispensable for the serious surfer. For musicians,
a digital camera is the best way to snap shots of yourself — practicing, per-
forming, posing — and spread them on the Net alongside your latest MP3s.
For fans, digital cameras provide another cool way to let the world see you
and all your obsessions.
We’re primarily here to enjoy music, so I won’t go into minute detail here.
Suffice it to say that you may want to consider three kinds of digital cameras:
✦Web cams: This nifty little eyeball plugs right into the back of your com-
puter and beams an image of your pretty mug on-screen. If you have the
gumption, you can hook up a live Web cam to your Internet home page
and let people check you out 24/7 (24 hours a day, seven days a week).
Plenty of bands are now doing this for a little DIY — Do-It-Yourself —
promotion.
✦Digital cameras: These devices take still images in digital form. Instead
of using film, the pictures are stored on a memory card, miniature hard
drive, or CD-ROM. You don’t have anything to rewind, develop, or —
oops! — accidentally expose to the light. Plus, you can zap the images
right up on to a Web page — just the thing for showing pictures of you
worshipping in your combination Courtney Love/Slim Whitman shrine.
(Now there’s an unusual visual image for you.)
✦Digital camcorders: You can use a digital (or DV) camcorder to film
your band performing or to make your own music video — then you can
post the results on your Web site. Most of these camcorders come with
optional accessories that make it pretty easy to plug the machine into
the back of your computer and upload your goods. Virtually all DV cam-
corders can also pretend that they’re digital still cameras, so you can
take still images as well.
For the lowdown on digital cameras and digital photography, check out
Book I. Book II, Chapter 2, has more information about digital camcorders.
CD and DVD burners
A CD burner is the common slang for a CD-RW drive, which enables you to
record and rerecord data (including audio) onto your own CDs. With these
devices, you can do the following:
616

Book III
Chapter 2
Using Your Computer
as a Music Platform
Adding Groovy Extras
✦Store about 80 minutes of audio per disc
✦Store 700MB of computer data per disc
✦Play audio CDs and CD-ROMs
Of course, a DVD burner can store many more songs on a DVD-RW or
DVD+RW disc, and any DVD recorder can also record audio CDs or MP3
discs. (A DVD burner also is pretty doggone handy for watching DVD
movies.)
Installing a new CD or DVD burner
If your PC came with a read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, you can’t
burn your own audio CDs; for that, you need a CD-RW, DVD-RW, or DVD+RW
recorder. Again, these drives are available as internal units, or you can take
the easy route and buy an external USB 2.0 or FireWire recorder.
Here’s the rundown on what’s required:
✦Tools: One hand and a screwdriver
✦Cost: Anywhere from $50 to $300
✦Time: Yet another afternoon job
When you install an internal CD or DVD burner, it’ll use either an EIDE or
SCSI connection. Because EIDE is practically standard equipment, I cover
the installation of an EIDE drive in this section.
The master/slave jumpers on your new recorder will be set to slave if the
drive will share a cable with an existing hard drive. If the drive is the only
device connected to your secondary EIDE cable, it should remain set to
master. As with the hard drive settings that I describe earlier in the chapter,
you must move the jumper on the recorder to make that drive work as the
slave.
To install an internal EIDE CD or DVD recorder, follow these steps:
1. Turn off your computer, unplug it, and remove its case.
2. Slide the CD drive into the front of your computer.
You need a vacant drive bay, which is an opening where your disk
drives normally live. The drive should slide in through the front.
3. Connect the cables.
a. Connect the cable between the new drive and the motherboard —
it should fit only one way.
Remember, a CD or DVD drive can coexist with a hard drive (both
are EIDE devices), so another connector on the same cable may
already be connected to a hard drive.
b. Rummage around the tentacles of wires leading from your power
supply until you find a spare power connector and plug it into
your new drive.
617

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
c. Connect the thin audio cable from the drive to the tiny CD Input
pins marked on your system’s sound card. 
Nothing marked CD Input? Try Line Input pins, or a different type of
Input pins.
4. Screw the drive in place.
Most drives screw in from the sides, just like a hard drive.
5. Replace your computer’s cover, plug the computer in, and turn it on.
When Windows boots up, it should recognize the new drive and auto-
matically install it for you.
Headphones
Take my advice: Invest in a good pair of headphones.
Unfortunately, a lot of computer speakers don’t come with headphone
jacks; instead, you have to plug your headphones directly into your com-
puter. Most computers nowadays come with a standard headphone jack. In
fact, iMacs come with two headphone jacks so that both you and a friend
can enjoy the music!
Also, a pair of headphones with its own separate volume control is nice, in
case you want to adjust the volume while you’re crashed out on the floor.
Remote controls for computer audio are still fairly rare.
Enjoying digital music on portable MP3 players
You can find all kinds of devices now that let you listen to digital audio on
the go: walking, driving, flying, you name it. For more information, see
Chapter 11 of Book III.
Getting Away with the Minimum
Can you get away without all these goodies? Fortunately, you can. The mini-
mum requirements are worth repeating:
✦Computer
✦External speakers
✦Sound card
✦Internet access
And if you’re not sure about what else you need, you can always wait. Hang
out a little bit online. Get a feel for what kind of online music fan you are.
Then take it from there. As you do with a car, a house, or a stereo, you can
always add some finishing touches and extra features later.

B
y now, your computer is stuffed with MP3 songs. It’s time to sit back,
pop open a Pellegrino, and give your music a good listen. But what MP3
software works best to play them all? Choosing among home stereos at a
music store is easy; you walk in a room, and the salesperson flips the buttons.
But who has time to try out all the MP3 software that’s out there?
This chapter describes the major contenders, focuses on one of the most
popular, and wraps things up with tips on wringing out the best possible
sound: hooking your computer up to your home stereo.
Using the Winamp MP3 Player
Hundreds of MP3 players float around the Internet, but one player has broken
rank as the clear leader among the hip crowd: Winamp. Shown in Figure 3-1,
Winamp (www.winamp.com) stuffs an incredible amount of power into a rela-
tively small package, earning millions of downloads in the past five years.
Winamp has plenty of chops, playing MP3, CDs, MIDI, WAV, AAC, and even
WMA — the format that’s used for Microsoft Windows Media Audio files.
The basic version is free to use, while the Pro version (which includes the
ability to rip MP3 files and burn audio CDs at the full speed of your drive)
is a mere $15. What a bargain!
The program’s built-in ten-band equalizer adjusts the sound; a minibrowser
pops up Web pages when necessary. Winamp tunes in Internet broadcasts
from MP3 radio stations around the world. More than 150 special software
enhancements, called plug-ins, allow fiddling with the sound — for example,
eliminating a singer’s voice, storing the files in different formats, or adding
3-D sound effects.
619

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Goofier plug-ins create animated dancers, oozing lava lamps, and light shows
to squirm across the screen. More than 20,000 utilities, called skins, deco-
rate the look of Winamp, making it as fashionable as you prefer. Savvy users
create their own skins and upload them for sharing.
This section shows you how to wring the best sound quality from Winamp.
Mac users should check out iTunes, which offers many of the same configu-
ration settings.
Installing and running Winamp
Compared to many programs, Winamp is a breeze to install. Make sure that
you download the latest version at www.winamp.com. (The programmers issue
new versions almost monthly.)
Winamp comes in several versions. Unless you’re pressed for hard drive
space, download the full version, which includes video support and the
ability to rip and burn. Besides, the Winamp installer lets you choose what
parts to install, so you can change your mind at the last minute.
Follow these instructions to install your copy of Winamp:
1. Double-click the Winamp installation program’s name, and read the
standard legalese.
2. Click the I Agree button when you finish reading the License
Agreement.
3. Choose the components of Winamp that you want to install, and click
the Next button.

Using the Winamp MP3 Player
You’ll probably want the full version so that you get all the goodies.
If not, click the Type of Install drop-down list box and choose Full,
Standard, Lite, Minimal, or Custom, depending on your computer’s
space limitations. (If you choose Custom, you can pick and choose
the functionality you want to add — naturally, the fewer features you
install, the less space the program takes up on your hard drive.)
4. Choose where to install Winamp, and click the Next button.
Winamp asks you to install itself into your Program Files folder with
your other programs. Unless this offends you, click the Next button.
5. Choose your icons and associations, and click the Next button.
Winamp now asks you how it should act. Typically, you should leave all
the check boxes selected (as shown in Figure 3-2). You want Winamp to
play your CDs and other sounds, and you want its icons to be easily
accessible.
6. Choose the correct Internet connection settings, and click the Next
button.
Be sure to choose whether your Internet connection is “always on”
(through a network, cable modem, or DSL line) or through the phone
lines. (If you don’t have an Internet connection on this computer, you
can also disable the program’s Internet services.) A working Internet
connection lets Winamp identify songs from inserted CDs.
7. Choose your language and program skin.
Although it sounds a tad creepy, a skin simply controls how the program
looks when it’s running!
8. Click the Install button.
Time to get another Diet Coke while you wait!

9. Visit the Winamp Walkthrough if you’re a new user.
Winamp calls up its Web page for a demo of its many features.
10. Click the Run Winamp button.
Winamp appears on-screen, ready to play your CDs, MP3s, and just about
anything else that relates to sound. If you’re using the Classic skin, you
get the same features, but the Winamp window looks different from what
is shown in Figure 3-1. Don’t panic — I tell you more about skins in the
section “Customizing Winamp with add-ons,” later in this chapter.
Keep the following points about Winamp in mind:
✦Winamp resembles a wall where other people hang their signs. Winamp
is the framework, and users write software to add features — plug-ins
and skins — to Winamp.
✦Not too proud to embrace this grassroots group support, Winamp’s Web
page offers a wealth of add-on programs, plug-ins, and skins. You can also
find documentation, the most current version, and forums for online
discussion.
✦Like a wine club, the Winamp community often praises the virtues of
past versions. Some versions run better on certain computers or sport
different features. To sample past vintages, head for Winamp Heaven at
www.winampheaven.com, where you can find about 100 versions for down-
load, dating back to computing’s Precambrian days of April 21, 1997.
✦To start running Winamp, choose its icon from your Start menu, desktop,
or Quick Launch toolbar (that row of little icons by your Start button).
Adjusting Winamp’s main controls
Winamp consists of four separable windows, but it keeps most of them under
wraps. In fact, Winamp works fine when shrunken to the pencil-thin waif
that’s shown in Figure 3-3. The main window, shown in Figure 3-4, serves as
the control panel for the others; it works like the front panel of a CD player.
Anyone with a CD player is already familiar with the controls for moving
from song to song or for skipping parts of songs. Some of the other controls
aren’t as apparent. Some controls to remember are as follows (check out
the dissected parts in Figure 3-4 for reference):
✦To toggle Winamp between full size and miniscule, click the word
WINAMP on the bar that’s along the program’s top. (Check it out —
you’ll end up using that feature a lot.)

Chapter 3
Playing MP3 Files on

Using the Winamp MP3 Player
✦Slide the bottommost bar in the Winamp section back and forth to skip
forward or backward within the song. The second-longest bar, right
above it, changes volume. (It also turns from cool green to fiery orange
as the volume increases.) The smallest bar adjusts the sound’s position-
ing between the two speakers. It’s lime green when the balance is right.
✦In Figure 3-4, you can tell that Winamp is currently playing back music
in stereo because the Stereo button is illuminated; some older songs or
live recordings light up the adjacent Mono button.
✦The song in Figure 3-4 was recorded at 256 Kbps and 44 kHz. That’s much
higher than the standard MP3 sampling rate of 128 Kbps (which sounds
nearly as good as a CD), so this is a very high-quality MP3 song.
✦Click the tiny EQ and PL buttons to bring up the Equalizer and Playlist
windows, respectively. I cover them next.
Adjusting the equalizer
Winamp’s equalizer adjusts the volume of various frequencies in a song,
making it sound better according to your physical location, your mood, or
the song’s particular sound. Tweak the controls yourself, moving the bars
up or down to increase or decrease the volume in certain ways. Slide up the
bars on the left end to increase the bass, for example; move down the bars
on the right to decrease the treble.
Click the Presets button to load custom-made sound settings, as shown in
Figure 3-5. Choose the Jazz setting and close your eyes, and the band sounds
as if it were playing in a smoky jazz club. Another setting puts that same
band in a church or stadium.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Here are a few pointers I recommend you keep in mind as you fiddle with
the Winamp equalizer:
✦If the Equalizer isn’t working, turn it on by clicking the EQ button in the
upper-left corner. (It lights up when turned on.)
✦The ten-band equalizer controls frequency ranges from 60 Hz to 16 kHz.
✦Don’t be impatient when switching from different preset frequency set-
tings. It takes a few seconds for the changes to be heard in the song.
✦A Preamp bar on the left side increases or decreases the sound’s volume
before it reaches the equalizer. This not only affects the overall sound
but also the overall volume.
✦When playing through your computer’s speakers, the sound may not
change much — no matter how much you tweak the equalizer. When
you hook up your computer to your stereo, as I discuss in the section
“Connecting Your Computer to Your Home Stereo,” later in this chapter,
you can hear more subtleties in the sound.
Creating playlists
Want to hear the blues all night? Or a mixture of your Miles Davis and Frank
Zappa MP3s? (Man, you do have eclectic taste!) Anyway, Winamp lets you
create customized MP3 playlists for playback randomly, in alphabetical
order, or in any order that you choose.
Creating a playlist is easy enough; click the PL button to bring up Winamp’s
Playlist window. Then drag and drop the files that you want to play into the
Playlist window, as shown in Figure 3-6. As the songs drop into the window,
their names and lengths appear.
Not into dragging and dropping? Each of the buttons along the bottom of
the Winamp window help manage your playlist. Click the Add button, for
example, to reveal the Add Dir button. Clicking the Add Dir button reveals
a standard Windows file-browser box. Choose the directory where you store
your MP3 files, and click the Open button to add them to the Playlist.

Chapter 3
Playing MP3 Files on
Your Computer and

Using the Winamp MP3 Player
As you create playlists in Winamp, remember these hints:
✦After you load files into Winamp, click the Misc button to sort them
alphabetically.
✦To save a playlist, hold down your mouse button on the List Opts button
in the playlist’s lower-right corner. A menu pops up. Without releasing
the mouse button, slide your cursor up to the pop-up menu’s Save List
option. Release the mouse button, and a window pops up in which you
type the file’s name.
✦To load a playlist, repeat this process, but slide the mouse pointer up
to the Load List option and then choose your playlist.
✦As opposed to MP3 files, a Winamp playlist file merely contains text.
Each line consists of a file’s name, its path on the computer, and the
artist’s name and song that are listed on the ID tag. Winamp uses the
playlist as a map when pulling files from different directories. Playlist
files end with an M3U extension; MP3s end with an MP3 extension.
✦The Misc button allows you to sort the list, create an HTML version of
the list, and do other goodies. Feel free to experiment.
✦To select all the songs that are loaded on Winamp’s current playlist,
double-click the Sel button. Press Delete or click the Rem button, and
Winamp removes all those songs from the playlist. It doesn’t erase any
files, it just removes the songs from the current list.
✦Click the Sel button once, and a menu appears. Choose Sel Zero from
that menu, and Winamp deselects any songs that you’ve currently
selected (but it leaves the songs on the playlist). Choose Inv Sel from
Figure 3-6:
Drag and
drop sound
files into
Winamp’s

queue.
625

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
the Sel menu, and Winamp deselects any songs that you’ve currently
selected and instead selects the songs that you hadn’t selected. Yes,
you have to play with these playlist buttons a few times before you
figure them out completely. Just remember that they never delete any
files; they just alter your playlist.
Using the minibrowser
Winamp’s minibrowser is a tiny Internet browser — a little window for grunt-
level Web chores. Hold down Alt and press T to bring up the Minibrowser
window, as shown in Figure 3-7. From there, a single click leads you to the
Winamp Web site to grab skins, plug-ins, and other goodies. Another click
brings up an online store for MP3-inspired CD purchases.
Be sure to check out SHOUTcast Radio, Nullsoft’s collection of Internet radio
stations. A list appears, showing the hour’s most popular Internet radio sta-
tions. Click something interesting, and you join others who are listening
through Winamp to hear an MP3 Internet radio station.
Customizing Winamp with add-ons
Although Winamp works great “out of the box,” its users have made it even
better by creating thousands of add-ons — from decorative skins to plug-ins
for altering an MP3 sound. This section shows you how to find and install
Winamp skins, plug-ins, and MP3 utilities.

Adding skins
Skins are just that — wraparounds for Winamp’s face, giving it a new look.
Thousands of skins are available, and if you have an Internet connection,
Winamp automatically lets you check out the latest in skins. Found some eye-
pleasers? Follow these steps to wrap them around your copy of Winamp:
1. Right-click the lightning bolt in the lower-right corner of the Winamp
main window — the window with the play control buttons.
2. On the menu that appears, choose Skins and select Get More Skins!
Your Internet browser appears and opens the Winamp site to the Skins
page.
3. Pick and choose from the available skins, and download the file(s)
directly into Winamp’s Skins folder.
Winamp automatically begins wearing the skin.
Skins are pretty cool things, folks, so I expect you’ll be experimenting with
them a lot; remember the following as you do so:
✦To load a different skin, right-click the lightning bolt again and choose
Skins; a window pops up to reveal all your installed skins. Click a skin’s
name, and Winamp quickly slips it on.
✦Want Winamp’s normal, default skin? Then choose Base Skin from the
list of skins.
✦Skins come in a wide variety of themes, including Anime, Cars, Futuristic,
Games, Music, People, Retro, Sports, TV, and a bunch of others.
✦When adding things to Winamp, start with skins. They’re an easy way to
introduce yourself to the program’s fun. Just remember to choose Base
Skin to return to normal if something looks too wild.
627
Where is Winamp’s Easter egg?
Computer history buffs point back to the late ’70s
for the origins of “Easter eggs.” Back then, savvy
players of Atari’s 2600 game console discovered a
secret room with the programmer’s initials hidden
in the Adventure game cartridge.
Just as painters sign their paintings, programmers
often place their own digital signature in their work.
Dubbed an Easter egg, this signature requires you
to enter a predetermined sequence of keystrokes
in a precise order before it reveals itself.
After Winamp is installed and loaded, it plays back
its “trademark” logo sound (the one about the
llama). When you take the following steps, the logo
appears across the top of Winamp, on its title bar:
1. Open Winamp.
2. In this order, press N, U, and L.
3. Press Esc.
4. Press L.
5. Press Esc again.
6. Press S, O, F, and T.
Winamp’s logo appears on the title bar. Special key-
strokes in older versions revealed the age of
Winamp programmer Justin — calculated to the
second — as well as a picture of him and his cat.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Using plug-ins
Skins merely change how Winamp looks. Plug-ins change what Winamp
does and how it sounds. Check out Table 3-1 for a description of some of
Winamp’s built-in battalion of plug-ins. Figure 3-8 shows an example of a
plug-in from WildTangent.
Table 3-1 only describes the plug-ins that currently come built in to the full
version of Winamp. Winamp’s Web site carries hundreds of additional plug-
ins that were written and submitted by users to perform different and often
more esoteric functions.

Remember the following things about plug-ins:
✦For years, only well-heeled “hi-fi” enthusiasts could afford to collect
the latest equipment, always testing their sound with the latest gadget.
Winamp lets users play with more gadgets than they have time for. And
for the most part, everything’s free.
✦To load an effect, right-click the lightning-bolt symbol in the lower-right
corner of the Winamp window, choose Select Preferences from the
Options menu, and click the desired category of plug-in. Choose 
a plug-in from within that category, and click the Start, Stop, or
Configure button to stir things up.
✦You can configure most plug-ins to your taste. Highlight your plug-in,
and click the Configure button. The About button reveals the plug-in
version number and author.
Other MP3 Players and Encoders
Of course, Winamp isn’t the only program that encodes MP3s. Other top
player/encoder applications are as follows:
✦iTunes (www.apple.com): Don’t get me started on how thoroughly Apple
has energized the digital music scene — and iTunes has been a big part
of it. This program does it all with aplomb . . . and it plays, rips, and
records for absolutely free. It also provides Windows users access to
the Apple iTunes Music Store. Read all about it in Chapter 8 of Book III.
✦Musicmatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com): This application plays,
organizes, and creates MP3s — for free. An extra $20 gets you the pro-
fessional version, which rips CDs into MP3s and burns CDs much faster,
automatically tags your new MP3 files with information from the Internet,
and does other goodies. I delve into Jukebox in Chapter 7 of Book III.
✦RealPlayer Jukebox: Although not as fully featured as Musicmatch,
RealPlayer Jukebox (www.real.com) does the job, playing and ripping
MP3s from your CDs and burning new audio discs.
The Other MP3 Players
Hundreds of programs play MP3 files. If you’re not enamored with Winamp,
head to www.cnet.com and visit the MP3 Players section. You can find plenty
of players to sample for just about every variety of operating system.
Here’s a brief look at two of the more popular MP3 players that you may run
across. They don’t create MP3s; they just play them back.
Windows Media Player
When Microsoft entered the MP3 player race, the corporate giant simply
added MP3-playback capabilities to the sound arsenal of Windows Media
Player. The result plays MP3s and a wide variety of other audio and video
formats.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Microsoft also whipped up a new music-compression format to compete
with MP3. Dubbed WMA, or Windows Media Audio, by Microsoft creative
titans, the new version is half the size of MP3 files, reducing download time.
The WMA format is incompatible with MP3, however, and sometimes you
can’t freely copy it because it contains a rights-management system for
copyright holders.
The version of Media Player that’s bundled with Windows 98 sometimes
can’t play MP3s. If this is the case, you need to download a newer version
of Media Player. (The free program is available at www.microsoft.com —
head to the Downloads section.)
✦Media Player is a convenient, albeit awkward, freebie, but it isn’t nearly
as configurable as Winamp or Musicmatch.
✦Owners of portable MP3 players sometimes use the WMA format because
the files are usually half the size of an MP3 file. That’s because MP3 must
generally be formatted at 128 Kbps for near-CD quality sound, whereas
WMA sounds nearly the same when formatted at 64 Kbps. That makes
the files half the size, so twice as many files can be stuffed into a portable
MP3 player. However, keep in mind that not all players can handle the
WMA format.
Sonique
Sonique (www.sonique.com) breathes cool. This free program changes shapes,
supports skins and plug-ins, handles Internet radio, and plays MP3s. Fig-
ure 3-9 shows one configuration of the interface; other faceplates blink and
swirl like Las Vegas neon. The program features attractive skins, an equal-
izer, and user playlists, and best of all, it sounds great.
Sonique plays them all, including MP3 files, Microsoft Windows Media files,
music CDs, and other formats. Check it out for kicks, and see if you don’t get
hooked. Beware, though: Sonique has a rather bizarre user interface. Instead
of Winamp’s buttons and menus, Sonique uses an odd collection of knobs
and widgets that take some time to figure out.

Assigning an MP3 Player to Your MP3 Files (The Hard Way)
Changing Your Default MP3 Player
MP3 players have big egos. As soon as you install one, it assumes that you
want it to automatically play all your sound files, including MP3s, CDs, and
any other piece of sound that’s on your hard drive.
And that’s the problem. What if you don’t like this newcomer and want to
switch back to your old player? If you’re lucky, it’s as easy as clicking a
button.
For example, to reassign MP3-playing rights to Winamp, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the lightning bolt symbol in the lower-right corner of the
Winamp window, select Options, and choose Preferences.
2. Choose File Types, and click the All button.
When you click the Select All button, Winamp highlights all the file
types that it supports.
To ensure that you don’t lose Winamp as your default player in the future,
select the Restore File Associations at Winamp Start-Up check box.
3. Click the Close button, and Winamp grabs back its abilities.
Most MP3 players come with a similar method for reassigning their MP3-
playing rights. If you spot it, use it — it’s much simpler than the Windows
method that follows in the next section.
Assigning an MP3 Player to Your 
MP3 Files (The Hard Way)
If the wrong MP3 player leaps into action when you double-click a song —
and you can’t fix the file associations from within the correct program —
follow these steps to change the MP3 player that is assigned to MP3 files
under Windows XP:
1. Right-click any MP3 file in Windows Explorer and choose Open With.
Windows displays the Open With dialog box.
2. When the list of programs pops up, select Choose Program.
3. In the Recommended Programs list, choose the program that you
want to play your songs by clicking the program’s name.
If a specific player you’ve installed doesn’t appear in the list, click the
Browse button, navigate to the program on your system, click to select
it, and then click the Open button.
4. Select the Always Use the Selected Program to Open This Kind of File
check box.
5. Click OK to save your changes.
Now, whenever you click an MP3 file, your newly selected MP3 player
should pop into action to play it.
631

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
If you experiment with several different MP3 players, each player tries to
set itself up as the default player. Following this procedure lets you choose
the player that should automatically jump up and begin playing MP3 files.
When you first listen to an MP3 file being played back from download.com
or amazon.com, a dialog box will probably appear. Select the Open This File
from Its Current Location check box. Then deselect the Always Ask Before
Opening This Type of File check box.
Playing Songs on Your iPod with Your Mac
Naturally, Apple is overjoyed if you play your iPod music on your Mac
through your Mac’s speakers. (And on other Macs, too — see the Check
It Out section, “Playing Songs on Your iPod with Another Mac.”) Depending
on your Mac model, you may already have excellent speakers, but you can
also connect high-quality speakers to your Mac using the Mac’s lineout con-
nection (if you have one) or headphone connection (every Mac has one of
those). When you play music in iTunes, it plays through those speakers.
Okay, you uber-technowizards in the audience may be on to me, but it’s
really no big deal. Here’s the scoop: iTunes can play both MP3 and AAC files
(the latter type is short for Advanced Audio Coding, Apple’s latest digital
audio format). Unless you choose File➪Get Info while a song is highlighted
in the iTunes list, I’ll bet you can’t tell whether you’re listening to a song
in MP3 or AAC format. Therefore, although this chapter is supposed to be
about MP3 songs, the stuff in this section applies equally to AAC files. Now,
don’t we all feel better?
If you’re short on hard drive space, use the iPod to hold all your music. For
example, I use a laptop on the road as a portable stereo, but the iTunes music
library is essentially empty to save the laptop’s hard drive space for other
things. I therefore have access to one or more iPods using my laptop version
of iTunes, and I can leave my music library on my home computer. Sassy!
You can play the songs on the iPod using iTunes. When you set your iPod
to manually update and connect the iPod to your Mac (any iPod, not just
yours), the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source list. When you select an
iPod name from the list, that iPod’s songs appear in the iTunes window.
To play music on your iPod in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your Mac, holding down the Ô and Option keys
to prevent automatic updating.
2. Set your iPod to update manually.
To set your iPod to update manually, see Chapter 12 of Book III.
3. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source list.
After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source list, the list of songs on the
iPod appears, as shown in Figure 3-10. You can scroll or browse through
the iPod songs just as you would in any iTunes library.

After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source list, you can click the trian-
gle next to its name to view the iPod’s playlists, as shown in Figure 3-11.
5. Click a song in the iPod song list, and click the iTunes Play button.
When you play an iPod song in iTunes, it’s just like playing a song from the
iTunes library or a track on a CD. The status display that’s above the list of
songs tells you the name of the artist and the song (if known) as well as the
elapsed time.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Connecting Your Computer to Your Home Stereo
The speakers that are connected to many computers sound like squawking
menus at drive-up fast-food joints. To improve the sound, ditch the tinny
speakers and connect your computer to your home stereo. Just run the
right-sized wires between the right places to turn your computer into a
mighty combination MP3/audio CD player. These two points will speed
you on your way:
✦Tools you need: A Y-cable (a 1⁄8-inch stereo plug with two RCA phono
plugs, usually red and green; see Figure 3-12) and an extension cable
that’s long enough to connect your computer and stereo.
✦Cost: $5 to $10, if the sound card didn’t already come with the correct
cable.
Keep the volume turned down on the stereo and also on the sound card
while connecting the cables — you don’t want to pop anything.
To connect your computer to your home stereo, follow these steps:
1. Turn down the volume on your stereo and sound card.
Turn down the stereo’s volume knob, which is usually pretty easy to find.
If you can’t find your sound card’s volume knob — which is either some-
where on the back of the card or through its software program — simply
turn off your computer (after saving any open files, of course).
2. Find the correct cable.
You need a shielded Y-adapter cable (refer to Figure 3-12). This cable
has a stereo 1⁄8-inch plug on one end and two RCA phono plugs on the
other end. You can find the cable at Radio Shack. Other electronics
stores and some computer stores carry the cord as well.
The package of a stereo Y-adapter cable refers to it as “a male stereo 
1⁄8-inch plug to two male RCA plugs.” That sounds confusing, but that’s
often what the package says.

Book III
Chapter 3
Playing MP3 Files on
Your Computer and
Home Stereo
Connecting Your Computer to Your Home Stereo
The best sound card manufacturers throw the cord in for free; others
make you head to Radio Shack. If your computer and stereo aren’t very
close together, pick up a 12-foot stereo cable. A 20-foot stereo cable pro-
vides even more room. If your computer and stereo are more than 20 feet
away, ask the Radio Shack salesperson how to buy the right cable and
plugs to make your own extension cable.
3. Plug the 1⁄8-inch stereo plug into your sound card’s speaker jack.
Hopefully your sound card has all its little jacks labeled so that you
know which hole does what. If it doesn’t, you have to open the card’s
manual. Then run the extension cord between your computer and your
stereo system.
If you have a carpet, push the cord into the crack between the carpet
and the edge of the wall. Use the right tool for the job: A spoon handle
works well. No carpet? One alternative is to buy a rug . . . but whatever
you do, don’t leave the cord laying across the floor. If somebody trips
over it, he will pull out the plug — and the music will stop.
4. Plug the cable’s two RCA phono plugs into the stereo’s Aux Input or
Tape Input jacks.
Check the back of your stereo for some unused input jacks; you should
see several pairs of stubby little metal heads. Use the Aux Input or the
Tape Input jacks — whichever ones aren’t being used.
One jack of the pair is probably red or labeled “Right” — push the cord’s
red plug into that jack. The other jack is probably black, white, or
green — this jack is for your other plug, no matter what color it is.
Don’t plug your sound card’s output into your home stereo’s Phono
Input jack. Your stereo doesn’t expect such a strong signal from that
jack. (If you throw caution to the wind and plug the cord in there
anyway, keep the card’s volume very low.)
5. Turn on the stereo, and switch it to Tape Input or Aux Input.
Turn the stereo’s input select switch to the jack that you’ve used, either
Tape Input or Aux Input.
6. Play an MP3 file on the sound card, and adjust the volume.
Gradually turn up the volume on your stereo and sound card. If every-
thing is hooked up right, the sound should start filling the room.
If the sound doesn’t start filling the room, make sure that the stereo
is turned to Aux Input or Tape Input — or whatever input jack you
plugged the sound card into. If the stereo isn’t turned to the correct
input switch, your sound card won’t come through. (Oh, is the stereo
plugged in and turned on?)
Unfortunately, your home stereo isn’t always a friend. It reveals the short-
comings of a cheapie sound card, for instance, as well as an MP3 encoder
that’s not quite pulling its weight.

Playing Songs on Your iPod with Another Mac
To connect your iPod to a Mac other than your own
and play your iPod songs, follow these steps:
1.
Follow the steps in the “Playing Songs on
Your iPod with Your Mac” section.
However, after connecting your iPod to
the other Mac in Step 1, iTunes starts up
and displays the following message:
This iPod is linked to another
iTunes music library. Do you want
to change the link to this iTunes
music library and replace all
existing songs and playlists on
this iPod with those from this
library?
2.
Click the No button.
By clicking the No button, you change 
that computer’s iTunes setting to update
manually. You can then play songs on your
iPod, add songs from that computer to
your iPod, and even edit your iPod
playlists and song list using that computer.
Unless you want to change the contents
of your iPod to reflect this computer’s
music library, don’t click the Yes button.
If you click the Yes button, iTunes
erases the contents of your iPod and
then updates the iPod with the library
on this computer. If you’re using a
public computer with no music in its
iTunes library, you end up with an
empty iPod . . . this is considered the
quintessential definition of A Bad
Thing. If you’re using a friend’s com-
puter, your friend’s library copies to
your iPod, erasing what was in your
iPod.

f you’ve perused Chapters 2 and 3 of Book III, you’re well aware of how
MP3 technology turns PCs into jukeboxes packed with music. Portable
MP3 players let you listen to “Stairway to Heaven” during the next Perseids
meteor shower.
But wait, there’s more: MP3 technology lets anybody tune in to the thousands
of MP3 radio stations now heard through the Internet.
This chapter shows you how to tune in to those stations and create your
own personalized stations that play your favorite songs. Or, if you’re han-
kering to be a DJ and willing to spend an hour or two configuring your com-
puter’s software, check out SHOUTcast, which gives you the chops to create
your own radio station, capable of sharing your favorite music with listen-
ers worldwide.
What’s an Internet Radio Station?
Some people fill up their garages with stuff they just know they’re going to
use someday. They might not use it, but hey, it’s there if they ever want it.
The same goes for MP3 files. Some people grab every MP3 they can find and
stuff them onto their hard drives. These folks may not play the songs very
often — if at all — but they’ve created one heck of a library. (If only MP3s
didn’t take up quite so much hard drive space. . . .)
To combat the MP3 storage problem, many MP3 fans are eyeing an increas-
ingly popular alternative, and that’s Internet radio. Because MP3 files are so
small, they can be broadcast — Webcast — across the Internet. And because
the Internet allows for two-way communication, it’s easier than ever to find
or even create a radio station that plays your favorite music.
637

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
The more you think about it, the better those Webcasts sound, huh?
Following are some of the benefits of Internet radio:
✦Internet radio stations don’t fill up your hard drive with MP3 songs.
Instead of saving the songs, you simply listen to them, just like any
other radio. Depending on how you set up your software, you can also
view the current song’s name and creator.
✦Musicmatch, Rolling Stone, Napster, Winamp, and hundreds of other
Internet sites now broadcast music directly from their Web sites. (If you
don’t like corporate stuff, head for SHOUTcast, which I describe in the
next section. Many of those stations are run directly from the comput-
ers of music fans like yourself.)
✦Luckily, most Webcasting radio stations don’t have commercials (thank
goodness).
✦The Internet carries an incredible variety of music, much more than
what you’d hear within your local radio’s reception area. Instead, you
can listen to Korean pop, Indian sitars, African rhythms, or ’60s rock,
or stations that match your music mood for the day.
✦The Internet lets you create personalized radio stations. Musicmatch
Jukebox, for instance, lets you choose your favorite artist, click a button,
and hear a station playing music by that artist, as well as other musi-
cians playing that type of music. If you allow it to do so, Jukebox will
638
If I Webcast, am I gonna get busted?
Like everything else associated with MP3s, the
legalities of Webcasting are currently in a state
of flux. Parts of the law are spelled out in vivid
detail, especially the details of how to pay $20 for a
“statutory license” that handles the royalty pay-
ments. To qualify for the statutory license, however,
Webcasters must meet a healthy list of require-
ments. Here are just a few:
 In any three-hour period, you can’t play more
than three songs from a particular album or
more than two consecutively, and you can’t
play four songs by a particular artist or boxed
set, including no more than three songs
consecutively.
 You can’t say in advance what particular song
you’ll play or when you’ll play it.
 If you’re continuously playing a recorded pro-
gram, the show must be longer than three
hours long.
 You must identify the song, the album, and the
artist when Webcasting. (SHOUTcast handles
this, so you’re safe.)
 You can’t encourage listeners to copy your
transmissions, nor allow them to make copies,
if possible.
 You must pay royalties.
As of this writing, nobody’s decided on a scheme
for calculating royalty payments. The easiest way,
however, is to operate under a statutory license by
filing an Initial Notice with the U.S. Copyright Office
before Webcasting.
For the most current information on Webcasting
legalities, contact the RIAA at www.riaa.com,
or read up on it on the SHOUTcast site at www.
shoutcast.com. Finally, to read the law your-
self, head to lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/

Adobe Acrobat Reader — I warn you, however,
that this is not light reading.

Internet Radio on

What’s a SHOUTcast Radio Station?
even keep track of the MP3s you listen to and create a personalized
radio station based on your musical tastes. (I cover Musicmatch
Jukebox in Chapter 7 of Book III.)
The better your modem connection, the better your Webcast music sounds.
Cable and DSL users have near-CD quality music. Stations don’t sound nearly
as good with a dialup modem, but the music may still sound as good or
better than your FM radio.
What’s a SHOUTcast Radio Station?
Nullsoft, the corporate arm of the folks who created Winamp, created the
popular SHOUTcast radio to let Winamp users share their musical tastes
with the world. (Good news, Mac owners: SHOUTcast is now available for
Mac OS X as well as Linux!)
Tuning in to a SHOUTcast radio station is pretty easy. First, make sure that
you’ve installed a copy of Winamp. (Grab a copy at www.winamp.com.) Next,
log on to SHOUTcast at www.shoutcast.com, and you’re ready to start 
listening.
The last time I signed on, SHOUTcast had 67,505 listeners tuned in to 6,397
different Internet radio stations. Click a station from the list, and Winamp
begins playing the station’s music. In the “Listening to SHOUTcast” section,
later in this chapter, I describe the process in more detail, but in the follow-
ing list, I give you the highlights:
✦Radio stations aren’t broadcast through the Internet. The term broadcast
refers to airwave transmissions. No, Internet radio stations are being
Webcast. (Some Internet radio DJs are picky about that.)
✦A SHOUTcast radio station is essentially an Internet feed from a copy
of Winamp running on somebody’s computer. Basically, you’re listening
to what’s playing on the Webcaster’s copy of Winamp. When you tune
in, you start listening in the middle of the stream — a song won’t start
at the beginning.
✦By adding additional software and tweaking your settings, you can con-
figure your own copy of Winamp to Webcast over SHOUTcast. Depending
on the speed of your Internet connection, you’re limited to anywhere
from one listener to several hundred.
✦It’s much more complicated to Webcast your own station than it is to
listen to an existing station. You can still do it, though, as you find out
in an upcoming section.
✦The faster your Internet connection, the better the stations will sound
when listening. The same goes for Webcasting: Faster connections let
more people listen.
✦Yes, it’s completely legal to listen to Internet radio, and it’s free. If you’re
Webcasting your own station, however, head for the Recording Industry
Association of America Web site (www.riaa.com) to see its recommended
procedures.
639

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
What Equipment Do I Need for SHOUTcast?
Forget about the transmission towers, stacks of paperwork, huge legal fees,
or even an expensive radio. To listen or broadcast on SHOUTcast, you need
the following equipment:
✦A computer that’s powerful enough to play MP3s through Winamp:
I talk about Winamp extensively in Chapter 3 of Book III.
✦A copy of Winamp: If you’re running Windows, any version above 2.5
will do. Download the latest version from www.winamp.com — the Basic
version is free. (Computers running Mac and Linux will have different
requirements — for more information, visit the SHOUTcast Web site
and take advantage of the online instructions and documentation.)
✦An Internet connection: You can listen with a 56K modem, although the
sound improves considerably as your connection speed increases. And,
theoretically, you can broadcast with a 56K modem, but you can reach only
one listener. A 56K modem simply isn’t fast enough. Bummer. To reach
more listeners, you need DSL, a cable modem, or something even faster.
✦SHOUTcast software: To set up your own station, download the required
software on the SHOUTcast Web site at www.shoutcast.com.
Listening to SHOUTcast
After you install your copy of Winamp, follow these instructions to tune in
to a station:
1. Make sure that Winamp has registered the PLS file extension.
After installation, Winamp is automatically configured to play MP3s and
most other sound file types. But make sure that Windows knows to send
the SHOUTcast Webcast to Winamp. Open Winamp and press Ctrl+P.
Then, as shown in Figure 4-1, make sure that PLS is highlighted in the
Associated Extensions list along with MP3 and other optional file types.
2. Head to SHOUTcast at www.shoutcast.com with your Internet browser.
You can start listening right from the main page.

3. Choose a station matched for your connection speed.
First, examine the stations’ descriptions until you find one that you like.
When you first log on, SHOUTcast displays stations sorted by popularity.
Don’t like the popular stations? Choose your favorite genre from the
Jump To drop-down list box. Or you can type a word describing your
musical tastes in the Search For box and click Go. Either way, SHOUTcast
dishes up currently broadcasting stations that meet your needs.
Next, look in the column on the far right to find the bit rate for the stations
you’re interested in. Be careful to choose a station that your modem can
handle. If you have a modem with a 56K dialup connection, choose sta-
tions transmitting at less than 56; for example, all the stations shown in
Figure 4-2 have bit rates of 48. If you start hearing skips or gaps in the
sound, choose a station that’s Webcasting at a lower bit rate.
4. Click the station’s Tune In button.
Winamp begins playing the station (see Figure 4-3).
5. Configure your browser, if necessary.
Depending on how your browser is configured, this step might take place
when you tune in to a station.
Internet Explorer: When you tune in to a SHOUTcast station, Internet
Explorer sometimes sends a message, asking whether it should open
this file from its current location or save this file to disk (see Figure 4-4).
Select the first option — Open This File from Its Current Location. If pos-
sible, deselect the Always Ask Before Opening This Type of File check
box. Without this option checked, Internet Explorer will always begin
playing playlists when you click them.

6. If that station turns out to be less than ideal, click a different one.
After a few moments, Winamp begins playing the new station’s songs. 
That’s it — unless you want some more information, which appears in the
following list:
✦The next time you load Winamp, the program remembers which station
it previously played. Click the Winamp Play button — the same button
that starts playing MP3 files — and, if the station is still Webcasting,
Winamp will begin playing the station.
✦Can’t find a cool station you heard a few days back? Load Winamp and
press Ctrl+L to see the Open Location window. Click the downward-
pointing arrow, and Winamp lists all the locations of the last few dozen
stations you’ve listened to. Click each one until you find your favorite.
✦When listening with a low-speed, dialup modem connection, any sort of
Web surfing or page flipping often causes skips in the sound. The solu-
tion? Don’t Web surf while listening, or get a cable or DSL connection.
✦Using a proxy server on a network? You can still listen, if you tell Winamp
about it. Load Winamp, press Ctrl+P, and click Setup. Under Internet Set-
tings, click the Using LAN Internet Connection button. Then type your
proxy into the HTTP Proxy text box.
✦Modems rarely receive information at their labeled speed. A 56K modem
usually can’t keep up with a 56 Kbps SHOUTcast Webcast. That’s because
56K modems usually receive at around 40K to 48K per second, depend-
ing on their brand and the quality of the Internet connection. Luckily,
SHOUTcast carries stations that Webcast at a variety of rates to support
many modems.
✦To find out more information about a particular station, slide your mouse
over the words in the site’s Genre (Description) column and look for
underlined words. The underlined words usually link to the station’s
Web site, which often displays the information you’re looking for about
the station.
✦When you connect your computer to a home stereo and use a cable
modem, some Webcasts sound just as good or better than an FM radio
station.
Setting Up Your Own SHOUTcast Radio Station
When you’ve grown familiar with listening to Webcasts, and you’re ready to
set up your own station, these instructions will put your tunes on the Net.
The good part is that it’s free. The unfortunate part is that it’s dreadfully
complicated and generally accompanied by much gnashing of teeth.
First, don’t try Webcasting unless you’re running a reasonably fast (300 MHz)
or faster PC running Windows XP, NT, or 2000. (Okay, you can use Windows 98
or Me, but remember that they’re nowhere as stable as The Big Three.) You
also need Winamp 2.65 or better, plus a whole lotta MP3s.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
You need to have an Internet service provider, which you probably already
have or you couldn’t have downloaded these goodies. Make sure that you’re
using a decent ISP that keeps everything flowing smoothly.
I’ll be honest with you — aren’t I always? The SHOUTcast server has a ton of
highly configurable features, settings, and other advanced hoo-hah, and I
just don’t have the room to give it a full description here. However, the pro-
cedure coming up should get you started with the default settings, and you
can eventually graduate to the professional stuff after you become familiar
with how things work. (Luckily, you’ll find plenty of online documentation
on the SHOUTcast Web site, ready for your perusal. More on this at the end
of this chapter.)
Finally, many ISPs will shut you down if you’re caught running a server from
your computer — take care.
Follow these steps to get started with SHOUTcast:
1. Log on to the SHOUTcast home page (www.shoutcast.com) with your
Internet browser and click the Download button.
The Download SHOUTcast button is part of a string of options listed
across the top of the page.
When you click the Download button, the SHOUTcast download page
appears. Three buttons appear on the page:
• Be a Listener
• Be a D.J.
• Be a Server
2. Click the Be a D.J. button.
A new page appears, containing all the necessary enhancements for
Webcasting needed for Winamp. The rest of these steps walk you through
each enhancement.
3. Make sure that you’re using the latest 2.x version of Winamp.
A shortcut link is thoughtfully provided at the top of the Everyone Wants
to Be a D.J. page.
Already have a copy of Winamp? I strongly recommend that you update
to the latest 2.x version.
4. Download and install the DSP Plug-In for Winamp.
When you click the link entitled Download the Latest Version of the
SHOUTcast Broadcasting Tools for Winamp 2.x at the top of the page,
the page jumps to the section about downloading the SHOUTcast DSP.
Find the line mentioning the SHOUTcast DSP Plug-in for Winamp 2.x
and click the Click Here link to begin the download. Your browser
downloads the file to whatever directory you choose.
Make sure Winamp isn’t running; then install the downloaded DSP Plug-
in program, following its instructions.

Setting Up Your Own SHOUTcast Radio Station
This particular plug-in sends the music currently played by Winamp
to the SHOUTcast server, where it can be Webcast. It’s considered the
source.
5. Open Winamp and press Ctrl+P to begin configuring the software.
This is the beginning of the hard part, although the folks at Winamp
have made it easier over the years.
6. Click the DSP/Effect area and choose SHOUTcast Source for Winamp.
A new dialog box pops up, as shown in Figure 4-6. (I told you this was
complicated.)
7. Click the Encoder tab.
Make sure that MPEG Layer-3 is chosen under Encoder type. (It’s proba-
bly already selected.) Also, if you have an older PC or you’re sharing a
single cable or DSL Internet connection among multiple computers, I
recommend that you choose a lower sound quality and mono Webcasting
in the Encoder Settings drop-down list. It will likely take some experi-
mentation before your system and your broadcast run smoothly, but
56 Kbps is a good place to start.
Alternately, you can use a speed of 24 Kbps Mono while you’re testing
and then gradually increase the rate (and switch to stereo if possible).
8. Click the Output tab.
Type a password into the Password field — keep it between five and
seven characters, and make sure that you remember the case. (You’ll
need it later.)
The default values for the other settings should work for most folks, so
click OK to close the window.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
At this point, you’ve set up Winamp, and your source is ready. Now it’s
time to download and set up the SHOUTcast server software on your
computer.
9. Log on to SHOUTcast’s home page with your Internet browser and
click the Download button.
The Download button is part of a string of options listed across the top
of the page. Feeling a sense of déjà vu? Yep — you were here before in
Step 1.
10. Click the Be a Server button.
Last time you were here, you clicked the Be a D.J. button. That led you to
configure Winamp as the source for your tunes. Now, it’s time to set up
the SHOUTcast server software to send those tunes out onto the Internet.
Setting up the server requires three steps. Here goes.
11. Download the latest version of SHOUTcast Server.
Click the Proceed to License Agreement to Download SHOUTcast DNAS
link. After accepting the legalities, download the version for your oper-
ating system. You’ll probably choose Windows, but versions are available
for Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD as well.
Save the file to a spot on your computer where you can remember to
find it in the next step.
12. Unzip and run the downloaded SHOUTcast Server installer.
After the program installs itself into a SHOUTcast folder in your C drive’s
Programs folder, its ReadMe file pops up.
13. Read the ReadMe file.
Yes, it’s complicated, but you must read it in order to figure out what’s
going on. The biggest problem is your Internet connection. If you want
to broadcast to 100 listeners at a mere 24 Kbps, you need 2,400 Kbps,
or 2.4 Mbps of bandwidth. An average cable modem has only around
750 Kbps — barely enough to dish up a half-dozen listeners.
Also, you want a clear connection: no proxies, firewalls, networks shar-
ing modems, and other conveniences.
When you installed the program, it installed the SHOUTcast Distributed
Network Audio Server (DNAS). The DNAS accepts the broadcast feed
from your newly configured Winamp; it then broadcasts that sound
over the Internet to your listeners. It also lists your broadcast on the
SHOUTcast Web site.
14. Edit the SHOUTcast DNAS configuration file.
Click the Windows Start button, choose Programs, and click SHOUTcast
DNAS. From there, choose Edit SHOUTcast DNAS configuration. An odd-
looking file then appears on-screen, as shown in Figure 4-7.
Most of this file consists of comments and instructions. (Any line
beginning with a semicolon or the [ symbol is a comment or label

and shouldn’t be changed.) Only the following lines need an ogle
(at least, until you want to perform advanced tweaks):
• MaxUser=: Choose a conservative number of maximum users for
your server. Multiply your modem’s speed by 0.9 and divide that by
your bit rate. For example, if you have a bit rate of 24, a 56K modem’s
dialup connection would reliably support a single listener.
Best yet, start with a MaxUser of 1, just to get the thing up and run-
ning. Then you can increase your users as you fine-tune everything.
• Password=: This must be the same password that you entered in
Step 8.
Again, you can begin Webcasting with everything else left at the defaults
for now, so click the Close button in Notepad to save the file.
15. Load the SHOUTcast Server.
Click Start, choose All Programs, and click SHOUTcast DNAS. From
there, choose SHOUTcast DNAS GUI. The server leaps to the screen,
waiting for you to run Winamp (see Figure 4-8). It places its tiny icon
next to the clock on the Windows system tray.
16. Load Winamp and click the Connect button to start Webcasting.
Watch the words next to the Connect window; they should say Connecting
to Host. Finally, list the number of bytes of music you’ve Webcast. If
everything has worked out the way it should, you’re sharing your tunes
with the world. If not, you’ll probably see some sort of an error message.

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
And what do you do if you see an error message? Your first step is to read the
ReadMe files that came with the Winamp plug-in and the SHOUTcast server
program. There’s some complicated stuff in there, and a single mistake can
ruin everything. Still having problems after perusing the ReadMe files? Here
are some other troubleshooting tips (although I hope you don’t need ’em!):
✦Head to the SHOUTcast Online Documentation at www.shoutcast.com/
support/docs. You’ll find excellent descriptions of how to fix problems.
✦Remember that firewalls of all sorts can interfere with your Webcasting
(including the built-in firewall in Windows XP). Therefore, you may have
to allow connections to your machine at address 8000 so that others can
access your music. Again, check the online SHOUTcast documentation
and consult your firewall settings.
✦Read the SHOUTcast Web site forums. If something is confusing to you,
it will have already confused somebody else. Chances are, you’ll find an
answer there.
✦Before posting on the SHOUTcast Web site forum, be sure to pour over
the ReadMe files and the Online Documentation. Although forum mem-
bers are willing to help people with problems, they’re often irritated by
people who haven’t taken the time to grasp the basics of Internet
Webcasting.
✦SHOUTcast offers some promos that do play along with your playlists —
things like, “Milking our bandwidth for all it’s worth with SHOUTcast
streaming audio!”

Internet Concerts
In This Chapter
 Finding netcasts of concerts
 Listening to concerts
 Chatting with the stars backstage
N
othing beats seeing your favorite artist in concert. And nothing’s worse
than not being able to see anything. Oftentimes, a concert tour incon-
veniently bypasses your hometown. Or maybe the show comes when you
have other — unbreakable — plans.
That’s where concert netcasts come in.
With a few clicks, you can tune into live and archived online broadcasts of
musical events and concerts from around the world. All kinds of artists
have been cybercast online, including the following hit-makers:
✦Maroon 5
✦Paul McCartney
✦Alanis Morissette
✦Jet
This chapter shows you how to get set up, where to find the shows, and
what you can do along the way, including chatting with the band backstage.
Getting Ready
Tuning into concerts online is a lot less labor-intensive than going to a real
show. No driving. No parking. No tickets to buy. No crowds.
The necessary hardware and software
To see and listen to online concerts, you need to have the following items
(odds are, you already do):
✦A computer (preferably a Pentium III or higher or a Macintosh G3 or
higher)
✦A modem (the faster, the better — ideally a 56-Kbps unit)
✦External computer speakers (or a line out to your stereo)
✦An Internet connection
✦Streaming audio software, such as RealPlayer (shown in Figure 5-1),
Windows Media Player, or QuickTime Player

A quick word about speed
Broadband — you hear about it all the time. The term means broad band-
width or, in simpler terms, really fat streams of data or, in yet other words,
fast Internet downloads.

On the downside . . .
Unfortunately, those who were performing and dis-
tributing live online music have encountered a
number of setbacks in the recent past, including the
following:
 Problems with copyrights and digital music
protection groups
 Royalty payments (which have forced many
Webcasters out of business)
 Competing streaming media formats
Due to these complications, online concerts are
harder to find than they were just a couple of
years ago. But take heart, good citizens: It may
take a Google search or two, and some of the
larger Webcasting sites may have dried up and
blown away, but you can still find a wide variety of
concert performances online. I give you a few tips
for doing so in the section “Finding Concerts
Online.”

Book III
Chapter 5
Attending Internet
Concerts
Finding Concerts Online
Most of us still live in the B.B. (that is, before broadband) era of the Internet
evolution, using pitifully slow modems to access the Internet. A lucky minor-
ity (and you know who you are) live in the A.B. (after broadband) era; you
operate in the world of T1 lines, DSL service, and cable modems. These folks
can access the Internet at speeds many times that of a 56-Kbps modem.
Alas, you may run into some frustration when tuning into a live concert with
your regular modem. Here’s why: Streaming audio and video is not saved
to your hard drive as it downloads, so you can’t download it and play it
later. You basically just connect and let the music play — much like a typi-
cal live radio program.
This means that you have to queue up while thousands — if not millions — of
other listeners are tuning in. And the more listeners, the more crowded the
data pipeline. The more data that’s in the pipeline, the slower the download.
The slower the download, the choppier the sound. Hence the frustration.
Concert netcasts can be really cool and fun. But ultimately, they are still
somewhat of a novelty. If you want perfect sound, go to the show.
Finding Concerts Online
With so many events happening in so many places at so many times, you
may find that you can’t find everything.
But you can come close.
You can find online concerts in the following ways:
✦Surf specialty sites. These sites regularly netcast live events.
✦Visit the home pages of concert halls and nightclubs. Many clubs and
halls netcast their own events.
✦Search streaming-audio guides. These guides list countless live netcasts.
✦Join communities that hover around your favorite artist. Check out
Web pages or subscribe to mailing lists. The best way to keep up on a
band, of course, is through the fans.
These days, not only can you listen to concerts online, but you can also
watch them. More sites are beginning to carry live video netcasts of con-
certs. Unfortunately, if you’re using a dialup connection, that data still has
to squeeze through tiny phone lines — therefore, video quality may be
pretty lousy. It may skip, hop, jump, cut, and putter out in the middle of
your favorite song.
Specialty sites
The easiest way to find live concerts is to visit the sites that have made it
their business to bring live events to the Web on a regular basis.
These sites are serious about letting you rock out at home. They send their
own crews to every show, wire up the club, and then pump the music — in
the form of 1s and 0s — to your PC.
651

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Netcasting concerts is not a perfect science — even broadcasting live shows
on TV is not without its potential mishaps. But netcasts, just like TV broad-
casts, are the next best thing to being there.
The following sections give you some of the sites that specialize in bringing
you online concerts.
RollingStone.com
In addition to providing their fill of news, reviews, and music culture reports,
the Web site for Rolling Stone magazine (www.rollingstone.com) often
streams live concert events. Naturally, you can also find interviews, all sorts
of downloads, and video archives.
Virtue TV
Based in London, Virtue TV (www.virtuetv.com) has offered live Internet
video broadcasts since 1998. In addition to interviews with film directors
and media personalities, the site offers streaming video concerts — live and
archived — from venues around England (and sometimes, even faraway
places like Tokyo).
BBC Radio 3
For some of the best in classical, jazz, and world concerts online, visit the
hallowed halls of the BBC — specifically, BBC Radio 3 — at www.bbc.co.uk/
radio3. The weekly live broadcast schedule is available, and if you miss an
event, you can listen to the archived RealAudio stream later.
Wired sites
Some concert halls are taking matters into their own hands. Instead of rely-
ing on another Web site to netcast an event, these venues do the work on
their own.
Of course, tuning into a wired club means that you’re not going to hear music
from the place down the street. But you do get a prime seat for anything —
and sometimes everything — that plays from the home page’s home stage.
Check out the sites in the following sections.
Jazz From Lincoln Center
Jazz From Lincoln Center in New York City (www.jazzatlincolncenter.org/
radio) has become a highlight concert series for jazz lovers around the
world. Now, you can tune in online without having to make the trip to the
big city.
The site carries Lincoln Center’s award-winning productions, such as trib-
utes to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. You can also check out other
productions that you may have missed in the sound archives.

Going Backstage: Chatting with Bands Online
Prairie Home Companion
If you’re interested in live performances from all sorts of artists, the weekly
online broadcast of Garrison Keillor’s popular Prairie Home Companion
(prairiehome.publicradio.org) always includes fine music mixed in with
the humor. The diverse list of performers includes Randy Newman and
bands like BeauSoleil. (Has Lake Wobegon really been around for 30 years?)
Guides for online concerts
If you want a larger view of the concerts that are taking place online, you can
check out the following TV Guide–style sites to help you through the fray:
✦The Windows Media Guide (www.windowsmedia.com) details live music
events that are available in the Windows Media format. This site includes
daily listings of major concert events and even in-studio radio station
performances.
✦Real.com Guide (music.guide.real.com/concerts) has a special subsec-
tion that’s devoted to live concerts from sites across the Net. The types
of performers are incredibly varied, ranging from chamber musicians to
hip-hop artists.
Fan pages
Although fan pages may have plenty of information about a band, they’re
unlikely to netcast a concert themselves.
However, if you’re wondering when a band is going to be performing online,
checking in with other fans is a great place to start.
Going Backstage: Chatting with Bands Online
Of course, the ultimate concert experience is going backstage to meet your
favorite artist in person. The problem is that backstage passes aren’t easy
to come by.
Many sites that netcast concerts now offer the opportunity for fans to chat
live with the bands, using chat programs that do not require a download.
(Just follow the links with your browser to get things going.)
Often, these services convince a band to spend time at the keyboard before
or after a show. After you log on, the artist takes your questions (which
often go through a chat host first).
Some sites that offer chat are as follows:
✦VH1 (www.vh1.com)
✦MTV (www.mtv.com)
✦Rolling Stone.com (www.rollingstone.com)
✦Spin (www.spin.com)
653

Part I: Transforming Your Computer into a Music Machine
Want to get your questions answered? If you’re in an unmoderated chat room
(that is, without a host), try addressing the artist by name before you ask
your question (for example, “SHIN FAT: What’s your favorite album?”). That’s
a great way to get someone’s attention during the flood of questions.
If a moderator is screening the questions, state your question as succinctly
and eloquently as possible. The more you stand out, the better your
chances of getting a response.
Finding Shows That You Missed
The great thing about concerts on the Internet is that they never fade away.
Long after the show hits the wires, you can surf around and listen to what
you missed. Each of the following sites offers archives of shows for your lis-
tening pleasure:
✦MTV (www.mtv.com)
✦VH1 (www.vh1.com)
✦Virtue TV (www.virtuetv.com)
Although you may have a favorite format and player for your streaming
Internet urges, installing all of the Big Three players is always a good idea:
RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, and QuickTime Player. That way, you’re
covered regardless of what format a concert takes.
Just because you can play back an archived show doesn’t mean that it’s
yours to save. Because these netcasts are stored in streaming format, you
can listen to them while you’re connected, but not after the fact (that is,
unless you have your computer connected to your stereo and you decide to
tape the show).
Getting Concert Information
While you’re kicking back and listening to your favorite artist perform live
online, you may want to find out when that band is coming to town.
The following sites enable you to search for and get information about inter-
national tours:
✦Pollstar (www.pollstar.com)
✦JamBase (www.jambase.com)
✦Mojam (www.mojam.com)
Of course, because you probably want to buy tickets for these events, you
can also check the home pages of major ticket vendors, such as Ticketmaster
(www.ticketmaster.com).

Chapter 6: Ripping CDs into MP3s
In This Chapter
 Ripping songs from a CD
 Recording songs from albums
 Recording sound from TV or tape
 Recording sound from a microphone
 Editing recorded music or sound
 Quickly creating MP3s from CDs
 Organizing your growing MP3 collection

T
he term ripping basically means copying sounds from a CD onto your
hard drive. MP3 aficionados use the word ripping because they’re tear-
ing the digital sound from CDs and copying those numbers onto their hard
drives. Besides, ripping sounds more cool than copying.
This chapter shows how to rip songs from your own CDs into your computer,
where you convert them into MP3 files. It also shows you how to record
albums, camcorder soundtracks, TV shows, videotapes, or any other noise-
makers onto your hard drive. Once there, you can clean up the sounds so
they’re ready to be converted into MP3s.
If you’re creating MP3s from something besides CDs or if you’re looking for
tips to make the cleanest rips possible, stick around.
Why Use Ripping Software?
Creating an MP3 used to require two steps. First, you had to rip the CD’s con-
tents onto the hard drive; then you encoded the contents into MP3 files. The
tracks from the CD were stored as files in a WAV format on your hard drive,
but WAV files are huge. We’re talking uncompressed files of 40MB to 50MB or,
in the case of a rocking Rolling Stones live jam, 200MB. Hence the need to put
those digital audio files on a diet by converting the WAV files into MP3 files, a
process called encoding. Here’s the lowdown on creating MP3s:
✦In the early days, people needed two pieces of software to create MP3s.
The first software ripped the sounds from the CD; the second piece
encoded the sounds into MP3 files. Today, all-in-one programs, such as
Musicmatch and Winamp, perform both chores at the same time: You
insert the CD and click a button, and the software automatically trans-
forms the songs directly into MP3 files.
Part II
Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
655

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
✦Some MP3 purists dislike all-in-one software because they lose control
over the sound quality. When the software automatically turns the CD’s
songs into MP3s, it bypasses the WAV file step, which leaves you no way
to edit the WAV file to correct any flaws in the rips.
✦Plus, not everybody rips CDs exclusively. Some people convert their
aging album collection into MP3s for easier storage and to get rid of that
stinky mildew smell. They need that extra step of cleaning up the sounds
before encoding them into MP3s.
✦Despite the rather nasty connotation, ripping doesn’t hurt CDs.
✦Popular sound-editing programs like Adobe Audition (www.adobe.com)
and Roxio’s Sound Editor (part of Easy Media Creator) can enhance,
filter, mix, and clean up dirty WAV files. They remove pops from an
album, for example, or fix CD rips that don’t sound right.
How Do I Rip Songs from a CD?
Start the ripping application of your choice, insert the CD, choose the songs,
and click the software’s Copy or Record option. The software grabs the
Compact Disc Audio (CDA) straight from the CD as a WAV file and then
encodes it as an MP3 file and saves the sound on your hard drive. Note that
ripping (technically known as digital audio extraction) doesn’t work on the
oldest of CD-ROM drives. If your drive can’t perform digital audio extraction,
it’s time to buy a new one.
You don’t even need a sound card; the CD’s music (which is already stored
on the CD using numbers to represent the sounds) becomes numbers on
your hard drive.
As you wander into the wonderful world of ripping songs from a CD, keep
these points in mind:
✦Some ripping programs need lots of room to work. If your hard drive
lacks at least 600MB of free space, rip the songs one at a time.
✦Hard drive not big enough? Chapter 2 of Book III contains tips on
installing a second drive.
✦Bought a blazingly fast 52x speed drive? It’ll never rip audio that quickly.
That rating indicates how fast the drive reads a CD’s information. Rippers
need a CD to send data.
✦Immediately after ripping a CD, listen to the MP3 files in Musicmatch
Jukebox or Winamp. If the sound has skips, pops, unwanted noise, or
other distortion, set the software to rip at a lower speed.
Recording from Sources besides CDs
If you want to create MP3s from something besides CDs — records, tapes,
radios, TVs, camcorders, or similar sounds — the next few sections are the
ones you want. Rippers really earn their due here.
656

Book III
Chapter 6
Ripping CDs into MP3s
Recording from Sources besides CDs
Connecting sound cables to your computer
Whereas ripping refers to copying sound off a CD — and bypassing the sound
card in the process — you need the sound card when creating MP3s from a
turntable, TV set, VCR, camcorder, or microphone.
Sounds are stored as numbers on the CD, which the ripper merely copies
onto your hard drive. When copying sound from other sources, you need
the sound card to convert audible sound into numbers.
To grab audio from those sources, record the sound through your sound card.
You can set up your computer to capture audio by connecting the output
cables from your sound source into the Line In jack on your sound card.
This section shows you how to connect the appropriate cables for record-
ing the sound onto your hard drive.
Tools you need: The appropriate cable (see Table 6-1) to connect from the
sound source to the computer’s sound card.
Cost: About $5 to $10, if the sound card doesn’t already include the correct
cable.
Stuff to watch out for: Sound cards rarely label their jacks well. Instead of
using big letters, they use bizarre pictures or weird circles. If the jacks on
the back of your sound card aren’t marked, you’ll have to dig around for the
manual.
Follow these steps to connect a cable from your album, tape, VCR, cam-
corder, or TV set to your sound card’s input jack for recording:
1. Turn down the volume on your sound card and sound source.
You don’t want to hear any speaker-shattering pops when pushing
cables into jacks.
2. Find the correct cables for your sound device and your sound card.
Different components use different cables; Table 6-1 shows what cable
to use. Although most stereo stores carry these cables, Radio Shack is
always a good last resort.
An 1⁄8-inch jack is often called a “mini-jack” at electronics stores.

3. Connect one end of the cable to your sound device.
Check the back of your VCR, camcorder, turntable, stereo, or TV for
output jacks. You should see a pair of stubby little metal heads (RCA
jacks) along one side. If it’s not stereo, you’ll see only one little stub. If
you’re lucky, they’re labeled.
Take the Y-cable adapter, like the one shown in Figure 6-1, and plug the
cable’s two RCA jacks into those output jacks, making sure that the red
jack goes into the red plug. (That’s for the right speaker.)
If your camcorder has an 1⁄8-inch stereo jack (or headphone jack), plug
your cable into it.
4. Connect the cable’s 1⁄8-inch plug into your sound card’s Line In jack.
Make extra sure the cable doesn’t mistakenly push into the other nearby
jacks.
5. Adjust the mixer levels.
Now, start playing your turntable, camcorder, or whatever else you’re
trying to record. This is where recording becomes an art: You carefully
adjust the volume level through the Windows mixing board while watch-
ing the recording software’s volume level to make sure the incoming
sound is not too loud or soft.
To see the Windows built-in mixing board, double-click the speaker icon
in the screen’s bottom-right corner. When the mixing board appears,
choose Options➪Properties from the menu bar, as shown in Figure 6-2.

Recording from Sources besides CDs
Because you want to record the incoming sounds, choose Recording
from the Properties window. Click in any empty box to put a check mark
inside it; doing so shows all the options of what you’re able to record.
Click OK, and the Recording Control window appears. Because you’re
recording from the sound card’s Line In jack, select the Line In Balance
box (as shown in Figure 6-3) and slide the meter up or down until the
recording level looks right in your recording software’s meter.
Now turn on the volume meter — sometimes called a VU meter — on
your recording software, which is Cool Edit 2000, in this case. Slide the
mixing window’s Line In bar up or down until the sound level in its adja-
cent meter looks just right: The Windows meter should stay below the
red levels, and the recording software’s meter should come close to —
but not reach or surpass — 0 on the control bar.
See how the mouse pointer slides the bar up or down in Figure 6-4?
When you slide the bar to adjust the volume coming in through the Line
In jack, the volume meter along the bottom of Cool Edit 2000 moves
back and forth accordingly.

If you don’t hear anything, try these troubleshooting tips:
✦Check the sound card’s mixer software. Make sure that the Line In or
Line box is checked and that the controller is slid up about halfway.
✦Keep checking your cable connections as well. You’re always aiming for
the sound card’s Line In jack. Don’t use the Mic jack for anything but
microphones, or the sound will be awful.
✦Experiment a few times by recording at different levels. Sooner or later,
you’ll find one that sounds right. You might have to change the level for
everything you record.
✦To listen to your computer through your home stereo’s speakers, flip
back to Chapter 3 of Book III. That chapter shows you how to connect
cables in the proper direction.
Recording songs from albums
Albums may be a joy for listening, but they’re a pain to store. Plus, you
always worry about when it’s time to change the needle. Playing any rare
singles? Don’t they deteriorate each time they’re played?
Converting albums to MP3 combats these problems and adds an advantage:
Because the sounds originated from an album, the MP3 still holds some of
that warm vinyl feel — none of that sterile CD feeling. Any of today’s portable
MP3 players will easily hold a full album — some, like Apple’s iPod mini, can
store 1,000 songs.

Chapter 6
Ripping CDs into MP3s
Recording from Sources besides CDs
Most all-in-one MP3 ripping software records albums and converts them 
to MP3s on the fly, but that skips the WAV stage. Without this intermediate
stage, you have no way to remove any recording flaws before the final
encoding.
These steps show how to record songs from an album and save them as WAV
files (where you can touch them up before turning them into MP3s):
1. Clean the album.
The cleaner the album, the cleaner the sound. Try these cleaning tips:
• Wash both sides of the album with a lint-free cloth. Most music stores
sell record-cleaning brushes designed expressly for removing dust.
• To remove extra-stubborn goo from the grooves, try a mixture of
50/50 rubbing alcohol and distilled water. Lacking that, small amounts
of baby shampoo can do the trick. Be sure to rinse well.
• Always wash the record with a circular motion; don’t scrub “across
grain” because it might scratch the grooves. When you finish clean-
ing, dry the album and touch it only by the edges.
• If it’s an important album — a rare import, or an old 78 — check the
phone directory for professional record-cleaning services found in
many big cities. They can often remove any extra-persistent grunge
from the vinyl.
2. Clean the turntable’s needle.
Wipe it off with the little brush that comes with the turntable. Lost yours?
Pick one up at the music or stereo store. They’re cheap.
3. Connect the turntable’s output cables to your sound card.
See the “Connecting sound cables to your computer” section, earlier in
this chapter.
4. Adjust your recording level.
Your recording program will have a recording monitor display, which
flashes according to the incoming volume levels.
Start playing your album and watch the monitor. If it flashes too close to
the right end (or the red), turn down the volume going into the sound
card, or use the sound card’s mixer program to turn down the incoming
sound. (I cover how in “Connecting sound cables to your computer,”
earlier in this chapter.)
If the level’s too high, it will distort; if it’s too low, you’ll hear background
noise. Take your time to find the right level before recording. Be patient.
5. Start the recording software.
Begin recording using Adobe Audition, Roxio Capture, or another
recording-and-editing package.
6. Play the album.
Be sure to press the Record button on your recording software before
playing the album. Don’t worry about the initial plop when the needle
661

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
falls onto the record or the empty space before the first song. You can
easily edit out those sounds later, as I describe in “Editing Recorded
Music or Sounds,” later in this chapter.
As you convert album songs into WAV files, keep the following points in mind:
✦Hear a persistent humming sound in the background? Plug your turntable
into the “unswitched AC adapter” on your receiver or amplifier. If you
can’t find the unswitched adapter, try plugging your computer and
turntable into the same wall outlet. (Use an adapter, if needed.) The two
devices then share a common ground.
✦Remember to record at a level that’s very close to the 0 on the record-
ing level — but never too close. Otherwise, the recording won’t sound
loud compared to others, like MP3s created from CDs.
✦Recording an old mono album? You might only hear the sound on one
speaker. You can correct this with sound-editing software, however, as I
explain later in the “Editing Recorded Music or Sounds” section.
✦Record the entire album’s first side and save that as a single WAV file.
Then do the same with the flip side. You can easily separate the tracks
into separate files later with sound-editing software.
✦In the eyes of the law, converting albums to MP3 files isn’t any different
from copying CDs. You can keep the file for your own personal use, but
don’t give it away or sell it, or you might be violating copyrights.
Recording from tapes, camcorders, 
a microphone, or TVs
Recording from TVs, audio tapes, or videotapes works the same as record-
ing from an album. Why would you want to? Well, perhaps you want an MP3
file of that hot new band playing on The Late Show with David Letterman in
the wee hours.
Or maybe you videotaped a Hawaiian luau last summer, complete with fire-
walkers and mystic drumbeats. (You would be surprised at the sound quality
from today’s DV camcorders.)
Here’s how to copy those sounds to your hard drive (where you can clean
them up and convert them to MP3 files):
1. Connect the sound source’s output cables to your sound card.
I describe how in the “Connecting sound cables to your computer” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter. Basically, you connect the Output cables of
your sound source to your sound card’s 1⁄8-inch Line In jack. Table 6-1
shows the required cables.
Remember that everything plugs into the sound card’s Line In jack except
a microphone. Microphones must plug into the sound card’s Mic jack.
2. Adjust your recording levels and start recording.
Check out Steps 4 and 5 in the preceding section, “Recording songs from
albums”; everything’s the same. Make sure that you begin recording
before your sound begins playing. You can always edit out any unwanted
662

Book III
Chapter 6
Ripping CDs into MP3s
Editing Recorded Music or Sounds
garbage later, but if the ukulele starts playing before you push the record-
ing software’s Record button, you’ll need to start over.
3. Click the Stop button when you’re finished.
Grabbed the sound? Hit the Stop button on the recording software; then
stop the sound source. It’s now time to clean up the sound, as I describe
in the next section.
Just because you can grab a TV performance off the air doesn’t mean you
own it. The same goes for a band playing at a local street fair. You can keep
the soundtrack for your own personal use, but don’t give it away or sell it,
or you might be violating copyrights.
Editing Recorded Music or Sounds
After you record the music or sounds and save them as immense WAV files
on your hard drive, you can convert them straight to MP3s using an encoder
program. But while the file is still in WAV format, there’s no excuse not to
touch it up a little bit. Remove those clicks and pops from the album. Edit
the TV recording so it starts the moment David Letterman says, “And now,
here’s. . . .”
The following sections describe some tips for editing WAV files down to the
best possible recording.
Making mono recordings play on both speakers
When recording from a mono source — a single microphone or a TV with
only one speaker — the computer fills only one side of its stereo signal with
the sound. You can’t get true stereo from a mono recording, but you can
fake it.
Tell your sound-editing software to copy the recorded track onto the other,
empty track. For instance, if the sound is recorded on only the right side,
duplicate it to the left side, too.
The sound-editing software can match up the two tracks so that they’re
identically positioned. Save the resulting file, and your mono sound will
now play over both speakers. It’s still not stereo, but it’s much better than
only one speaker.
663
Ripping audio from the Internet
Saving audio or music sent in a “live stream” from
the Internet is a copyright violation. That’s why
most sound programs won’t let you save incoming
RealAudio programs and other streams. (You can
always bypass copy-protection schemes by stick-
ing a microphone next to your PC’s speakers, but
that rarely sounds good.)
Versions of Winamp before Version 2.10 could save
streamed MP3 files, but that function is disabled in
the current versions. (Head for the Web site www.
winampheaven.net to check out every version
of Winamp ever released.) Older versions of
Windows Media Player save streamed MP3 files in
your Windows Temporary folder, if you take a peek.

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
Cutting out the bad parts
When you record something through a sound editor like Roxio’s Sound Editor
(part of Roxio’s Easy Media Creator suite), the software shows pictures of the
sound waves, like in Figure 6-5.
Sound-editing software works much like word processing software. You posi-
tion the cursor in different places to choose sections for cutting and copying,
or to move highlighted segments to different locations.
The first editing step is to find the beginning and end of your recorded
sounds so you can trim off the unnecessary sounds. Use the software’s Zoom
or Magnify commands (those little magnifying glass icons on the toolbar) to
magnify your view of the sound. That gives you a better picture of when
sounds start and stop.
A tall wave means a loud sound; very small waves (or no waves) mean no
sound.
Figure 6-6 shows a live recording saved in Sound Editor. You’ll note how the
sound wave comes to an abrupt stop — that’s the end of the song, and you
can delete anything past that point. Double-check by clicking at the ending
point and the clicking the Play button. The software plays any sounds past
that point, letting you make sure they’re not needed.
Highlight all the sound waves past your chosen ending point and press the
Delete key, and Sound Editor chops them out.

Introducing Musicmatch Jukebox
Here are some more editing tips:
✦Listen to your file from the beginning to see when it starts. Click at the
actual starting point, highlight the material in front of it, and delete it,
too. Your resulting file is now trimmed to its exact size.
✦Having trouble finding the exact spot to trim? Use the magnify command
to zoom in until you can spot individual sound waves. That makes it
easy to choose the exact spot.
✦Prefer a nice fade out on a recording? Choose where you want the fade
out to begin, highlight the sound from that spot onward, and choose the
software’s fade option. The software will make the sound fade away, like
the ending of many songs.
✦When dealing with a noisy recording, check your sound-editing software’s
filter and noise reduction menus. Many of them can reduce the pops of
a crackling album and cut out some hiss from tapes.
✦The more money you spend on your sound-editing software, the more
tricks it has for manipulating sound. Adobe Audition may be expensive,
but it has features not found on less-expensive software. Look for a mul-
tiple Undo command so that you can go back to normal if an auditory
experiment goes awry.
Introducing Musicmatch Jukebox
Some software performs a single task, stops, and lets another program take
over. CD rippers, for example, copy music from your CD onto your hard drive.
The encoders then go to work, converting the extracted WAV files into MP3s.

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
Musicmatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com), by contrast, plans the menu,
cooks the meal, and delivers it to the table. When you insert the CD and
click a button, a window appears, listing the song titles. Click the songs you
want encoded, and the software automatically converts them into MP3s.
The program can even record files from albums, stopping to separate record
tracks into separate songs. It converts MP3s into WAV files and then burns
them onto a CD for you to play in your car or home stereo. It can even
download MP3s into your portable MP3 player.
Looking for Internet radio stations? Musicmatch not only tunes them in, but
also creates them based on your personal tastes. To sample the best that
MP3 has to offer, you needn’t go further than Musicmatch.
Musicmatch Jukebox works on any version of Windows from Windows 98
through Windows XP, but you need a Pentium III or Pentium 4 processor
and at least 128MB of RAM. If your system doesn’t meet these specifica-
tions, the software will probably give up during the installation process.
Finally, some older CD-ROM drives can’t handle ripping. If your drive has
trouble, it may need an upgrade.
Two different versions of Musicmatch are available: The Basic version is
free, and the Plus version sets you back $20. (Of course, the Plus version
offers all sorts of enhanced features, like faster ripping and CD burning, the
ability to print labels, and even a built-in slideshow mode that displays
images with your music.)
Putting Musicmatch to Work
Musicmatch Jukebox handles just about every aspect of the MP3 world. In
fact, it can do so much that completing a simple task may sometimes seem
confusing. The next few sections show how to make Musicmatch automate
those tasks that once took hours of work.
Making MP3 files from a CD
Musicmatch can convert an entire CD all at once, or just convert the songs
you choose. Either way, follow these steps to rev up the Musicmatch MP3
creator and start creating MP3s:
1. Start Musicmatch by double-clicking its icon on your desktop.
Or start Musicmatch from your Start button, depending on where you
told the program to lodge itself during the installation process. The pro-
gram leaps into action, accompanied by its oft-bothersome Welcome
Tips window.
Just like Winamp, Musicmatch consists of several detachable windows.
The Recorder window, necessary only while creating MP3s, lists a CD’s
songs. The My Library window, in the middle, is where the MP3s stay
organized by CD for easy access.
666

Don’t see Musicmatch’s Recorder window? Choose Options➪View➪
Show Recorder from the Musicmatch menu bar. You can also toggle the
display of the Playlist window and the My Library window as well.
Finally, Musicmatch Jukebox’s control window sits on top, ready to play
any selected CDs or MP3s.
Windows always needs to know which player should play your MP3 files
when you double-click them. If you have more than one MP3 player, the
players often fight for that privilege. That’s why Musicmatch sometimes
says Another application has associated file types playable by
the Musicmatch Jukebox. It then asks if Musicmatch should be your
default player. I choose No, leaving Winamp as my default player —
it loads more quickly. Besides, even when it’s not the default player,
Musicmatch still plays any MP3s that you load into the program.
2. Insert a music CD into your CD-ROM drive and click the Record button
in the Playlist window.
When a CD is inserted into the drive, Musicmatch uses your Internet
account to dial up CDDB (www.cddb.com), a vast database of CD titles
and their accompanying songs. Figure 6-7 shows how Musicmatch cor-
rectly identified my beloved copy of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s Couldn’t Stand
the Weather and automatically entered all the CD’s song titles in the
Recorder window.
No Internet connection? Jukebox can sometimes pull in the information
from a disc’s CD-TEXT data, but if that doesn’t work either, it’s time to
start typing in the titles yourself.

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
Although Gracenote’s CDDB database holds an enormous amount of CDs,
it occasionally misses a few releases from smaller labels. Instead, it lists
the songs as Track 01, Track 02, and so on. To add them yourself, click
each track name as shown on the right side of the Recorder window (see
Figure 6-8) and type the correct name. Then click the window’s left side
to enter the Artist and Album names.
3. In the Recorder window, select the check boxes for the songs you want
to convert or click Select All to select them all.
Normally, the Recorder window pops up with all the titles checked. If you
don’t want to convert all the songs to MP3, click to remove check marks
from the titles that you don’t want.
Be sure to stop the CD from playing. Although Jukebox can convert a CD
while it’s playing, it’s much slower and more prone to error.
4. Click the Recorder window’s Record button (which looks like a big
red circle) to begin converting songs to MP3 files.
By default, the new files are stored in the My Music folder inside your
My Documents folder.

Ripping CDs into MP3s
Putting Musicmatch to Work
When creating MP3s with the Musicmatch MP3 creator, remember these tips:
✦As the program encodes your CD’s songs, it lists the newly created MP3s
in the My Library window (which I discuss in the next section) for easy
access later. They’re sorted by artist, album, and genre.
✦If your new MP3 file sounds weird, you may be pushing your processor
too hard. Musicmatch Jukebox rips and encodes in a single step, so it
requires more processing power than plain encoders.
✦Some people intentionally encode files at 96 Kbps or lower or use the
Windows Media Audio (WMA) format instead of MP3. The files will be
smaller, letting you squeeze more of them onto your portable MP3
player. Actually, you probably can’t tell that much sound difference
between the two when you’re on a skateboard doing a one-footed, nose-
boned tailgrab. (Make sure that your portable player can handle the
WMA format before using it, though.)
Playing MP3 files
Musicmatch displays your MP3s in a list in the My Library window, just like
books stacked on a shelf. But the files are a lot easier to organize than CDs
or albums. Here’s how to find a song or group of songs and play them:
1. Click the My Library button (shown on the left side of Figure 6-9) to
display the My Library window.
Figure 6-9:
You can
view your

669

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
2. Find the songs you want to play.
First, notice the column names View by Album, Artist, Genre, and Time
along the top of the My Library window. Click one of those names to
sort the MP3s in the list by that category. Clicking Artist, for instance,
sorts the songs by the musicians who created them. Click View by
Album, and the songs are sorted alphabetically by their CD’s name.
There’s more, though. Click the View Library By drop-down list box, as
shown in Figure 6-9, and Musicmatch offers to display your music in
other ways, sorting them by Moods, Preferences, Tempos, and Year. Or,
choose All Tracks to see every song in the collection (see Figure 6-10).
3. Select the songs to play.
Select songs the same way you select files in Windows. Hold down Ctrl
and click files to select them one by one. Alternatively, you can click one
file, hold down Shift, and click another file to highlight all the files
between the two you clicked. Or, you can lasso a bunch of files by hold-
ing down the mouse button and circling the files with the mouse
pointer.
4. Place the songs into the Playlist window.
After you select your files and they’re highlighted in the My Library
window, right-click the selection and choose Add Track(s) to Playlist
Window. (Or, just drag and drop the songs into the Playlist window.)
The songs appear in the Playlist window, as shown in Figure 6-11, and
automatically begin playing.

Here’s how to get the most out of your playlists:
✦In a mood for jazz? View your My Library list by Genre. Then drag the
word Jazz to the playlist. All your songs categorized under Jazz appear
in your playlist.
✦Using a network? Feel free to drag and drop songs from networked
computers into your Playlist window. They’re often a little slow to load,
but they’ll play just fine. Make sure that you’re not dragging from net-
worked drives that have passwords, however, or Musicmatch might
freeze up.
✦Not sure what a button does in Musicmatch? Rest your mouse pointer
over the confusing item, and a helpful message usually explains its 
function.
✦Want to play random selections from your entire music library? Drag
your entire library to the Playlist window; or right-click anywhere in the
Playlist window, choose Select All, and then choose Add Track(s) to
Playlist. The entire list appears in the Playlist window. Then click Shuffle
at the bottom of the Playlist window. Jukebox plays your entire collec-
tion, shifting randomly from song to song like a radio station.
✦Want to easily add tracks to your playlist? You don’t need to use the
My Library window to add tracks. Just click the Playlist window’s Open
button. From there, you can add all your tracks, certain albums, certain
genres or artists, tunes from your CD player, or even tunes that aren’t in
your My Library area.

Adding tag information and CD art
Here’s a little trick. Every MP3 file contains a special built-in storage space for
the song’s title, CD, recording date, genre, and other information. Musicmatch
Jukebox automatically fills out most of that information, known as an ID tag,
as soon as you encode the CD.
But here’s how to grab the CD’s cover art, as well. You don’t need a scanner,
and you don’t even have to use your CD’s original art. Just follow these steps,
and Musicmatch automatically displays your CD’s cover art whenever it
plays a song from that CD:
1. Drag any MP3 song to the Musicmatch Playlist window.
The song begins to play.
2. Open your Web browser and connect to Amazon.com.
When Amazon comes up, look for its Search area in the upper-left
corner. In the drop-down menu, choose Popular Music. Then in the
second box, type the name of your CD and artist. Amazon should dis-
play the cover of your CD.
3. Right-click the CD cover (either from within the Now Playing panel or
within your Internet browser), choose Copy from the menu, and close
your browser.
Right-click your CD’s cover from the Web page and choose Copy (as
shown in Figure 6-12) to copy the CD’s cover to the Windows Clipboard.
Close your browser; you don’t need it anymore.
4. From the Musicmatch menu bar, choose Edit➪Paste/Tag Art from

Creating MP3s from Albums or Other Sources
If you don’t need to do any sound editing of your albums, camcorders, or
other sound sources, Musicmatch creates MP3s from them just as easily as
it does from CDs.
Connect a Y cable from your audio source and plug it into your sound card’s
Line In jack, as I describe earlier in this chapter. Then perform the following
steps:
1. Choose Options➪Recorder➪Source➪Line In from the Musicmatch

2. Start playing your sound source to adjust the mixer settings.
3. Open your Windows Mixer.
Double-click the little speaker icon by your clock in the Windows system

That whole Napster thing
Napster took digital audio to a rather revolutionary
next step: user-friendliness. Napster enabled its
members to search for specific artists and songs on
the hard drives of other Napster users and then
download those songs from their hard drives.
Unless you denied access to your computer, other
Napster users could search your hard drive for
songs and then download them from your computer.
Most of us already know the ending to the Napster
story. The controversy that surrounded the original
Napster program stemmed from the fact that many
(if not most) users were unlawfully distributing
music copyrighted by the artists and record labels.
For example, heavy metal rockers Metallica and
rap star Dr. Dre were the first groups to file suit
against Napster because the program allowed
users to distribute illegal copies of their songs.
Theoretically, you could download MP3 versions of
every Metallica song ever recorded without
shelling out a single penny for a CD. You can under-
stand why the group and its label were up in arms.
After the courts stepped in, Napster was shut
down. Today, Napster has resurfaced with a new
legal face, providing online music both as a stand-
alone program (www.napster.com) and as a
built-in music store within Roxio’s Easy Media
Creator. I briefly describe the new Napster in
Chapter 7 of Book III.

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
4. Turn on your sound source — start playing the album, turn on the
camcorder, or whatever else you’re recording — and quickly click
the Record button in Musicmatch’s Recorder window.
The program automatically transfers the incoming sound into MP3 format,
skipping the WAV file in the process.
Creating CDs from MP3s
Musicmatch uses your computer’s CD or DVD burner to create two types 
of CDs. Why two? It creates one type of CD for playing on your home or car
stereo, and another type that’s packed with hundreds of MP3 files for play-
ing on your computer. It creates both types of CDs from any of the MP3 files
in your collection. Feel free to mix and match your favorite MP3s to create
your own greatest hits CDs.
Before you can create any type of CD, you need a CD-RW drive, DVD-RW 
or DVD+RW drive, and a pile of blank CDs. (A growing number of audio CD
players now support CD-RW discs, which means you can erase the disc and
burn a new set of songs — check your audio player’s specs to see if it sup-
ports CD-RW media.)
To create either type of CD in Musicmatch, follow these steps:
1. Create a playlist of the songs you want to store on the CD.
Follow the steps in the section “Playing MP3 files,” earlier in this chap-
ter. Basically, you want to fill your Playlist window with the songs you
want to copy to a CD.
If you’re creating a CD for your home stereo, start with about ten MP3s.
You probably won’t be able to fit many more songs, although you’ll be
given that chance later.
2. Click the Burn button beneath the playlist.
The Create CD from Playlist window pops up, as shown in Figure 6-14.
3. Choose the type of CD you want to create from the window.
To choose the type of CD you want, click one of the following buttons
(shown in Figure 6-14):
• Audio: Click this button to create a CD for playing in your home and
car CD player. This is the default selection.
• MP3: Click this button to create an MP3 disc, which stores a huge
number of MP3s to play back on your computer, boombox, or on a
portable MP3 player that can handle those CDs.
• Data: Click this button if you want to simply burn the MP3 files as
data files on a standard CD-ROM.

Book III
Chapter 6
Ripping CDs into MP3s
Creating CDs from MP3s
Clicking one of the three buttons shows how much space you have left
on the CD. In Figure 6-14, for instance, the seven MP3s listed in the Create
CD from Playlist window have consumed 49 percent of the audio CD,
leaving room for several more songs.
When I click the MP3 button, however, those same seven songs consume
only 11 percent of the CD, leaving much more room. (That shows you
how much MP3 compresses songs.)
4. Add or remove songs until the CD is filled.
Keep dragging or removing songs from the Playlist window until you’re
satisfied with the amount of songs stuffed onto the CD.
5. Place a blank CD or CD-RW disc into your CD or DVD recorder and
click the Burn button.
Musicmatch converts the MP3 songs into audio format, if necessary,
and copies them to the CD.
If you purchase the upgrade version of Musicmatch, you can print CD
covers and jewel box inserts to go with your newly created CDs. It can print
any artwork you’d like on the cover, or it can tile the covers from the works
you’ve placed on the CD (see Figure 6-15).

Listening to Internet Radio through Musicmatch
Among its other duties, Musicmatch picks up Internet radio stations. It plays
the stations in three different ways, as I describe in the following sections.
Listening to Musicmatch Radio
Musicmatch contains a list of stations broadcasting in certain genres, from
Adult Alternative to Rap & Hip-Hop. The songs coming from these stations
are from top-name artists in their fields. To tune one in, follow these steps:
1. Run Musicmatch Jukebox and click the Radio button.
The Radio window appears, as shown in Figure 6-16.
2. Choose your connection speed from the Radio Quality drop-down list
box in the upper-right corner of the Radio window.
If you have a dial-up modem, you should choose Low from the list box.
If you’re one of the lucky ones who has a faster modem (cable, DSL, T1,
and their cousins), you receive better sound when you choose CD from
the list.
3. Choose the type of station you want to hear by clicking a genre link.
Click the type of music that moves you — remember, you can switch
stations at any time. Alternative Rock, for instance, plays artists such as
Green Day, Jet, and Maroon 5. (Coincidentally, so do I.)
The music begins playing — at the beginning of a song, unlike many other
stations. To hear a different type of music, click a different genre of music.

Listening to Internet Radio through Musicmatch
Creating a personalized station
Musicmatch offers radio stations customized to your particular interest.
First, you can simply choose your favorite type of music, and Musicmatch
begins playing those types of songs. (Yawn.)
But wait, there’s more! You can create a station based on your favorite artists.
Click the Create/Edit Station button from the Radio window and then type
your favorite artist into the Search field — The Doors, for example — and
click Go. If that artist is included in the list, click the Add button to add the
music to your station’s list (see Figure 6-17). (Alternately, leave the Search
field blank and go choosing bands willy-nilly, with the joy of a 5 year old.)
When you find the artist list of your dreams, type a name for your station,
and click the Play This Station button to hear your new station. You’ll hear
a mixture of songs by your favorite artist, as well as other songs by musi-
cians similar to that artist . . . on your own station! When a song comes up
in the Musicmatch radio station, the album cover also appears.
When you’re playing a bunch of songs, either through Musicmatch Radio or
your own playlist, click the Now Playing button. If you’re connected to the
Internet, Musicmatch brings up a page displaying information about the
currently playing artist — as well as a way to buy more music by that artist.
When you base a station on a favorite artist, Musicmatch checks to see what
other artists that fans of the selected artist like to listen to. Then it bases
your radio station on your artist, as well as songs by those additional artists.

How Do I Change an Entire CD’s Tags Simultaneously?
Keeping a song’s tag correct is important, but
changing the tag can be awfully tedious. For
instance, when you copy a CD’s cover art from
the Web, you want every song on the CD to have
that cover art. And, if you decide to add the CD’s
recording year to the tag, do you really want to
edit the tags for all the songs individually?
Luckily, Musicmatch does the work for you,
changing the tags of many songs simultaneously.
Here’s what you need to do:
1.
In the My Library window, right-click the
album you want to change — or high-
light all the songs you want to change 
simultaneously — and choose Edit Track
Tag(s) from the pop-up menu.
The Edit Track Tag(s) window appears,
listing all the songs you selected.
2.
Click the Select All button to highlight all
the songs.
Notice how all the fields are grayed out.
3.
Click the little white box next to the item
you want to change for all the highlighted
songs.
For example, click the little white box next
to where the CD’s cover art should appear.
4.
Update the field that you selected in Step
3 (by pasting in the cover art, for example)
and click the OK button.
Musicmatch updates the tags of all the
highlighted songs simultaneously. If you
updated the art, for example, all the songs
now have the CD cover in their tags.

Chapter 7: Choosing an 
Online Music Vendor
In This Chapter
 Considering the pros and cons of online music
 Recognizing what counts in a music source
 Comparing what’s out there
O
kay, I’ll be blunt: You may not need this chapter. (How’s that for an open-
ing sentence?)
You see, there’s really no single reason to settle on just one source of online
music — after all, variety is the spice of life, right? If you have the time to
visit six or seven Web sites and compare all those different vendors, you
can probably find the ones that offer Afternoon Delight by the Starland Vocal
Band — and then you can begin worrying about locating the best price.
Should you spend 89 cents or 99 cents on this timeless ’70s classic? And
which of those sites provides you with downloads in MP3 format? If you’re
that much of a music fan and you don’t mind the hassle of all that compari-
son shopping, then skip this chapter and move on.
Still with me? Good. You see, I personally don’t like wading through the
morass of multiple online music services available these days. I like conven-
ience, and I like low prices. I like a large selection of songs, and I like ’em in
a format I can actually use. (Otherwise, why not just buy the CD and save
yourself the trouble?)
If you’re with me, then this chapter is for you. I introduce you to what’s out
there and give you the facts that can help you decide on the one (or perhaps
two) online music vendors that fit you best.
So How Do You Rate a Vendor?
I think we can safely agree that most music lovers are tolerant, caring individ-
uals who provide shelter for animals and contribute to all sorts of charitable
causes . . . and they also care about the following five criteria:
✦Price: How much am I paying for a track, or for an entire album? Is there
free music on hand? Do I have to pay a membership fee?
✦Format: I prefer MP3, but other formats can offer better sound. For exam-
ple, Apple’s iTunes Music Store offers downloads in Apple’s higher-quality
AAC format — however, those files have a certain amount of copy protec-
tion built-in. Finally, I should mention Windows Media Audio (or WMA),
679

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
which delivers quality equal to (and often better than) MP3. While the
WMA format is supported by a number of MP3 players, it’s also saddled
with an extreme level of digital “copy protection.” (More on this later.)
✦Library size: Although Afternoon Delight may not be on your hit list,
everyone wants a large selection to choose from, and many vendors
offer a surprisingly limited library.
✦Search features: How simple and straightforward is it to search for the
music you want to hear?
✦Convenience: How easy is it to navigate a vendor’s site? Can you hear a
decent preview before you buy? Are your login ID and password saved
for future visits?
Think broadband — no, on second thought, demand broadband — before
devoting yourself to online music. With a cable modem or DSL connection,
downloading a typical 4 to 6MB song takes less than a minute. That same
song can take 10 to 15 minutes to download on a 56 Kbps dialup connection.
You have been warned — severe boredom and loss of musical enthusiasm
can result if you try downloading an entire album with your dialup modem.
I review four of today’s most popular online vendors in the following sec-
tions, covering the points in my list. Don’t worry; you won’t be tested on
this, but keep a highlighter handy to help you pick the right music source
for you. Better yet, use one of the handy stickers from the front of this book
to tag the page for you!
680
I fought the law and the law won: Sharing and piracy
Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave personal demonstra-
tions of the iTunes Music Store and the iPod to Paul
McCartney and Mick Jagger. According to Steven
Levy at Newsweek (May 12, 2003), Jobs said, “They
both totally get it.” The former Beatle and the
Stones frontman are no slouches — both conduct
music-business affairs personally, and both have
extensive back catalogs of music. They know all
about the free music-swapping services on the
Internet, but they agree with Jobs that most people
are willing to pay for high-quality music rather than
download free copies of questionable quality.
I agree with the idea, also promoted by Jobs, that
treating technology as the culprit with regard to vio-
lations of copyright law is wrong. Conversely, the
solution to piracy is not technology because deter-
mined pirates always circumvent it with newer tech-
nology, and only consumers are inconvenienced.
I’m certainly not a lawyer, but I think the law
already covers the type of piracy that involves
counterfeiting CDs. The fact that you aren’t allowed
to copy a commercial CD and sell the copy to some-
one else makes sense. You also can’t sell the indi-
vidual songs of a commercial CD.
Giving music away is, of course, the subject of much
controversy, with services such as the original
incarnation of Napster closed by court order while
others flourish in countries that don’t have copyright
laws as strict as the United States. Nothing in the
Apple realm of technology enables the sharing of
music at this level, so I don’t need to go into it,
except to provide one observation: The songs I hear
from free sharing services such as Kazaa have, for
the most part, been low in quality — on a par with
FM radio broadcasts. That’s nice for listening to new
songs to see if you like them, but it’s not useful for
acquiring as part of your real music collection. The
iTunes Music Store is clearly superior in quality and
convenience, and I prefer the original, authorized
version of a song, not some knock-off that may have
been copied from a radio broadcast.

Music Vendor
Apple’s iTunes Music Store
Apple’s iTunes Music Store
Although not the first vendor to appear on the scene, Apple’s iTunes Music
Store (shown in Figure 7-1) has made quite a splash among both PC and
Macintosh owners. To access the store, you have to install and use iTunes —
which is not a disadvantage in my book because I rate iTunes as one of the
best digital audio players available. (Oh, did I mention that it’s a free down-
load for both Mac OS X and Windows XP/2000? Or that it can rip MP3 files
from your audio CDs and burn your own compilation CDs? Anyway, I talk
about iTunes in depth elsewhere in this minibook, so I’ll stop there and get
to the music.)
Here’s how the iTunes Music Store scores on the list:
✦Price: At the time of this writing, individual tracks were selling for $0.99,
and an entire album set you back $9.99. No membership fee is required.
✦Format: The songs you download to your music library from the iTunes
Music Store are in AAC format, which is somewhat of a disadvantage for
those who like to transport their music on something besides an iPod.
Also, each track can be played only on a maximum of five individual
Macs or PCs, so the copy protection is there. (On the positive side, you
can burn as many audio CDs from your iTunes tracks as you like, no
questions asked. Apple feels you should own the music you buy, and I
agree wholeheartedly.)
Figure 7-1:

Music Store

don’t you
think?
681

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
✦Library size: A big plus for this vendor because you have over 700,000
individual tracks to choose from — including audio books, prerelease
singles, and exclusive-release singles.
✦Search features: You can search for a specific album, artist, track name,
or genre by using the application’s Power Search (shown in Figure 7-2).
Check out the new iMix feature, which allows you to share your playlist
data with others (and rate their playlists in return). If you like a specific
artist, see what other folks who favor the same artist are listening to.
Everything’s integrated into iTunes, so there’s no switching from
window to window. Sassy.
✦Convenience: Another highlight for the iTunes Music Store: It’s easy to
browse because the Music Store window includes a nifty navigation
system that will remind you of your Web browser (only faster). You can
enjoy a full 30 seconds of any track before you buy, and the reviews and
artist histories are quite good. After you create an Apple ID, iTunes
remembers it for future visits, and your credit card is automatically
billed as you purchase your music.
Don’t forget to check out the Free Download track, which changes every
week. The free song is often a prerelease or exclusive-release track, so you’ll
find some real jewels here!

Napster
For a dabbling of iTunes information, head to Chapters 8 and 10 of Book III.
For an in-depth look at iTunes, don’t miss iPod & iTunes For Dummies, writ-
ten by Tony Bove and Cheryl Rhodes (published by Wiley). That book tells
you all about what’s under the hood.
Walmart.com
Yes, that’s right, your friendly neighborhood mega-discount store also has an
online music vending business. You may be thinking that the sheer mammoth
presence of the Wal-Mart name will spell the eventual doom of other vendors,
but the service has some problems that currently make it a tough sell.
Time for the details:
✦Price: The bright spot for this vendor — individual tracks are only $0.88
each, and a full album is $9.44. No membership is necessary to buy music.
✦Format: I am no big fan of Microsoft’s WMA files, and unfortunately,
Walmart.com is a proponent of this format, which means that you’re
limited to playing your downloaded music using Microsoft’s Windows
Media Player 9. Why? Walmart.com tracks include encrypted DRM sig-
natures (that’s short for Digital Rights Management), so you’re forced to
use Windows Media Player 9 to play these songs. Although Windows
Media Player is available for Mac OS X and most flavors of UNIX and
Linux, I personally rate the program as a distant second to iTunes in
ease-of-use. Because of the DRM protection, you can burn a single song
to CD no more than ten times, and you can play the songs only on up to
three PCs. At least Walmart.com’s WMA files are 128 bit, so the quality is
actually better than a typical MP3 file.
✦Library size: Less than 300,000 tracks at the time of this writing, but
Walmart.com does offer exclusive tracks on a regular basis.
✦Search features: Limited to album, artist, and song name.
✦Convenience: Walmart.com provides a 30-second preview, but you won’t
find supplemental reviews or artist history on the site. After you sign in
with your online customer ID, you can elect to pay with a credit card,
online check, or — my personal favorite — a Wal-Mart shopping card.
Napster
It’s certainly a name you recognize, right? Ah, but this is the new, improved,
even-fresher-smelling legal Napster.com — no more illicit music swapping.
The feline still wears earphones, but only time will tell if the service will
succeed.
Like with the iTunes Music Store, you have to install a program to browse
and buy music; the Napster program is free and doesn’t take up a tremen-
dous amount of space on your hard drive. Figure 7-3 illustrates Napster in
action. If you like, you can use it as your default music player as well, and it
can rip tracks from your existing audio CDs.
683

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
Now for the tale of the tape:
✦Price: Napster is now a subscription service, charging about $10 a
month for all the music you want to hear — note that I said “hear” and
not “own.” The price includes access to commercial-free Napster radio
stations as well. On the downside, you still have to buy tracks at $0.99 a
pop if you want to burn them to CD or transfer them to your portable
player. (Ouch.) 
✦Format: Here we go again: It’s Windows WMA, so you’re limited to lis-
tening to the tracks you download on a maximum of three computers.
Computers running Macintosh and Linux have to run Windows Media
Player 9 to play these songs. Oh, and the Napster player itself runs only
under Windows. (Sigh.)
✦Library size: An impressive 700,000 tracks are on tap, with exclusive
tracks and live recordings included.
✦Search features: Search fields include hunt for a specific album, artist,
and song name, or you can search for another member’s playlists.
✦Convenience: You’ll get 30-second previews of each song, with extensive
music reviews and artist history. (Like the iTunes Music Store, Napster
also recommends music based on what you’ve listened to and bought in
the past.) You pay by credit card, and the Napster software takes care of
logging in and maintaining your music collection.
You can give Napster gift certificates to friends and family, which gives
them free downloads or a number of subscription months. Napster Cards
are also available in many grocery stores and discount stores — they work
the same way. Instant gratification is a good thing.

eMusic.com
Napster is now integrated within Roxio’s Easy Media Creator. In fact, a link
to it appears within the Easy Media Creator Home window, as shown in
Figure 7-4. If you decide on Napster as your primary music vendor, you can
buy, organize, and burn from within one window!
eMusic.com
A relative newcomer on the online music vendor scene, eMusic (www.emusic.
com) has an interesting storefront, a simple subscription pricing setup, and a
bright future — and, according to the site’s home page, it’s all “100% Legal”
with “No guilt here!” Hey, that’s a slogan for the new digital millennium if I’ve
ever heard one. 
Here’s the rundown:
✦Price: After a two-week free trial period, you must subscribe to eMusic.
Ten dollars per month gets you 40 song downloads, $15 brings in 65
downloads, and the Premium service delivers 90 song downloads in a
month for $20. Album downloads simply count towards your monthly
limit.
✦Format: Now we’re in happy territory! eMusic delivers songs in good
old-fashioned MP3 format, with no DRM tagging along. In fact, the serv-
ice uses VBR (variable bit rate) encoding, which delivers the smallest
possible MP3 files with CD quality.
✦Library size: eMusic recently passed the 400,000 mark in individual
tracks — most are from independent labels, and alternative bands have
the focus.
✦Search features: You can hunt for a specific album, artist, song name, or
record label.
✦Convenience: Dialup visitors will appreciate the high- and low-fidelity
30-second previews. The reviews and artist history are terse at one or
two sentences, but they’re well-written. Payment is by credit card, and
you create a login account when you join the site.

In This Chapter
 Logging into the iTunes Music Store

 Handling authorization
 Setting preferences
W
hen Apple announced its new music service, Apple chairman Steve 
Jobs remarked that other services put forward by the music industry
tend to treat consumers like criminals. Steve had a point. Many of these
services cost more and add a level of copy protection that prevents con-
sumers from burning CDs or using the music that they bought on other
computers or portable MP3 players.
Apple did the research on how to make a service that worked better and
was easier to use, and it forged ahead with the iTunes Music Store. By all
accounts, Apple has succeeded in offering the easiest, fastest, and most
cost-effective service for buying music for your computer and your iPod.
(And yes, Virginia, the iTunes Music Store is available to both Mac and PC
owners.) In this chapter, I show you how to log on and take advantage of
what the iTunes Music Store has to offer.
Setting Up an iTunes Music Store Account
As of this writing, the iTunes Music Store offers more than 200,000 songs,
with most songs priced at $0.99 each and entire albums available at far less
than what you would pay for the CD. You can play the songs on up to three
different computers, burn your own CDs, and use them on players such as
the iPod.
You can preview any song for up to 30 seconds, and if you already established
your account, you can buy and download the song immediately. I don’t know
of a faster way to add a song to your music collection.
To open the iTunes Music Store, follow these steps:
1. Run iTunes and click the Music Store option in the Source list.
The Music Store’s front page appears (see Figure 8-1), replacing the
iTunes song list. You can check out artists and songs to your heart’s con-
tent, although you can’t buy songs until you open a Music Store account.
You can use the Choose Genre pop-up menu to specify music genres, or
you can click links for new releases, exclusive tracks, and so on — just
like with any music service on the Web.
687

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
2. Click the Sign In button on the right to create an account, or sign in to
an existing account.
You need an account (with a credit card) to buy music. iTunes displays
the account sign-in dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-2.
If you already set up an account in the Apple Store in the .Mac service,
you’re halfway there. Skip Step 3 through Step 6 and type in your Apple
ID and password. Apple remembers the personal information that you
previously entered, so you don’t have to reenter it. If you forgot your
password, click the Forgot Password button, and iTunes provides a
dialog box that gives you a test question. If you answer the question
correctly, your password is then e-mailed to you.
3. To create an account, click the Create Account button.
iTunes displays a new page, replacing the iTunes front page, with an
explanation of the steps to create an account and the Terms of Use.

4. Click the Agree button, and fill in your personal account information.
iTunes displays the next page of the setup procedure, which requires
you to type in your e-mail address, password, test question and answer
(in case you forget your password), and birth date, and select privacy
options.
5. Click the Continue button.
The next page of the account setup procedure opens. On this page, you
enter your credit card information.
The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The Music
Store keeps your personal information — including your credit card
information — on file, and you don’t have to type it again.
6. Click the Done button to finish the procedure.
Previewing a Song
You may want to listen to a song before buying it, or you can just browse the
store listening to song previews. When you select an artist or a special offer-
ing, the browser window divides and gives you a list of songs that you can
select to play, as shown in Figure 8-3. Click the Play button to play a preview.
The previews play on your computer off the Internet in a stream, so a few
hiccups may occur in the playback. Each preview lasts about 30 seconds.
You don’t have to open an account just to preview songs!

Part II: Getting Music on Your Hard Drive
Buying and Playing Songs
With an account set up, you can purchase songs and download them to your
computer. Select a song and click the Buy button at the far right of the song
(you may have to scroll your iTunes window horizontally). The store displays
a warning to make sure that you want to buy the song; you can either go
through with the purchase or cancel it. The song downloads automatically
and shows up in your iTunes song list. Purchased songs also appear in a
special Purchased Music playlist under the Music Store heading as well as
in the iTunes Library song list.
If, for some reason, your computer crashes or your Internet connection is
lost before the download finishes, iTunes remembers to continue the down-
load when you return to iTunes. If the download doesn’t continue, choose
Advanced➪Check for Purchased Music to continue the download.
You don’t have to use the 1-Click technology. You can instead add songs to a
shopping cart in the store, which delays purchasing and downloading until
you’re ready. If you decide to use the shopping-cart method, the Buy button
for each song changes to an Add Song button. When you’re ready to purchase
everything in your cart, click the Buy Now button to finish the sale and down-
load all the songs at once. To switch from 1-Click to a shopping cart, check
out the section “Setting the Music Store Preferences,” later in this chapter.
All sales are final. If your computer’s hard drive crashes and you lose your
information, you also lose your songs — you have to purchase and down-
load them again. But you can mitigate this kind of disaster by backing up
your hard drive. You can also “back up” by burning your purchased songs
onto an audio CD.
Handling Authorization
The computer that you use to set up your account is automatically author-
ized by Apple to play the songs that you buy. Fortunately, the songs aren’t
locked to that computer — you can copy them to another computer and play
them from within the other computer’s iTunes program. When you first play
them, iTunes asks for your Apple Music Store ID and password to authorize
that computer. You can authorize up to three computers at a time.
To add a fourth computer, deauthorize a computer by choosing Advanced➪
Deauthorize Account.
After you set up an account, you can sign in to the Music Store at any time
to buy music, view or change the information in your account, and see your
purchase history. To see your account information and purchase history,
click the View Account link in the store after signing in with your ID and pass-
word. Every time you buy music, you get an e-mail from the iTunes Music
Store with the purchase information. If you use the 1-Click option, the Music
Store keeps track of your purchases over a 24-hour period so that you are
charged one total rather than a bunch of single purchases.

Setting the Music Store Preferences
Your decision to download each song immediately or to add songs to a shop-
ping cart for a later batch download is probably based on how your com-
puter connects to the Internet. If you have a slow connection, you should
use the shopping-cart method.
You can change your preferences with the iTunes Music Store by choosing
iTunes➪Preferences. In the Preferences window, click the Store button. In
the Store Preferences window that appears (shown in Figure 8-4), you can
enable the following options:
✦Change from 1-Click to Shopping Cart or vice versa. 1-Click is the
default.
✦Play songs after downloading. You can choose whether songs automat-
ically play after purchase.
✦Load a complete song preview before playing the preview. The default
is Streaming. This option provides better playing performance (fewer
hiccups) with previews over slow Internet connections.
If you use more than one computer with your account, you can set the pref-
erences for each computer differently while still using the same account.
For example, your store-authorized home computer may have a faster con-
nection than your authorized PowerBook on the road, and you can set your
iTunes preferences accordingly.

O
rganization depends on information. You expect the computer to do a 
lot more than just store music with “Untitled Disc” and “Track 1” as the
only identifiers. Adding all the song information seems like a lot of trouble,
but your computer will come through for you. You can get most of this
information automatically, without typing.
This chapter shows you how to add and edit song information using iTunes
and Winamp.
Filling in the Blanks in iTunes
Why type song information if someone else has typed it? You can get infor-
mation about most commercial CDs from the Internet. However, you need to
check your Internet connection first.
Retrieving information automatically
During the iTunes setup process, you specify whether iTunes connects auto-
matically or manually to the Internet. But you can also change the setup of
your Internet connection to connect automatically at any time; just follow
these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
The Preferences window appears.
2. Click the General button.
The General Preferences window appears.
3. Select the Connect to Internet When Needed option.
iTunes triggers your modem automatically (like a Web browser), calls
your service provider, and completes the connection process before
retrieving the track information. 
693

Part III: Organizing Your Music
You can stop an automatic modem connection as quickly as possible — a
good idea if your service provider or phone service charges extra fees
based on timed usage. When iTunes finishes importing, switch to your
remote connection program without quitting iTunes, terminate the Internet
connection, and then switch back to iTunes.
Retrieving information manually
You can connect to the Internet at any time and get the song information
when you need it. After you connect, choose Advanced➪Get CD Track
Names from the iTunes menu bar.
Even if you automatically connect to the Internet, the song information
database on the Internet (known as CDDB) may be momentarily unavail-
able, or you can have a delayed response. If at first you don’t succeed,
choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names again.
After connecting and retrieving track information using a modem, your
Internet service may still be connected until the service hangs up on you.
You may want to switch to a browser, without quitting iTunes, and surf the
Web to make use of the connection — iTunes continues to import or play
the music while you surf.
Typing the song information
You can type a song’s information in either Browse view or the song list view.
Click directly in the information field, such as Artist, and click again so that
the mouse pointer turns into an editing cursor. You can then type text into
the field. 
Editing artist and band names
Just like when typing the song information into iTunes, you can edit a song’s
information in either Browse view or the song list view. Edit a song’s track
information by clicking directly in the field, and clicking again so that the
mouse pointer turns into an editing cursor. You can then select the text and
type over it, or use Ô+C (copy), Ô+X (cut), and Ô+V (paste) to move tiny
bits of text around within the field. (Music-lovers using the Windows ver-
sion of iTunes should press Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, and Ctrl+V instead.) As shown in
Figure 9-1, I changed the Artist field to Beck, Jeff.
You can edit the Song Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and My Ratings fields
right in the song list. Editing this information with File➪Get Info is easier.
Keep reading to find out.
Speed editing multiple songs
Editing in the song list is fine if you’re editing the information for one song,
but typically you need to change all the tracks of an audio CD. For example,
if a CD of songs by Bob Dylan is listed with the artist as Bob Dylan, you may
want to change all the songs at once to Dylan, Bob. Changing all the song
information in one fell swoop, of course, is fast and clean, but like most
powerful shortcuts, you need to be careful because it can be dangerous.

Long distance information: Using the CDDB database
The first time I popped an audio CD into the Mac
was like magic. iTunes, after thinking for less than
a minute, displayed the song names, album title,
and artist name automatically. How did it know?
This information isn’t stored on a standard music
CD — you have to either recognize the disc some-
how or read the liner notes.
The magic is that the software knows how to reach
out and find the information on the Internet — in 
the Gracenote CDDB service (CDDB stands for, 
you guessed it, CD Database). The site (www.
gracenote.com) hosts CDDB on the Web and
enables you to search for music CDs by artist, song
title, and other methods (see the following figure).
The iTunes software already knows how to use this
database, so you don’t have to!
iTunes finds the track information by first looking up
a key identifying number on the audio CD — a
number stored on every publicly released music
CD, not for spying on listeners but simply to identify
the CD and manufacturer. iTunes uses this number
to find the information within the CDDB database.
The CDDB database keeps track information for
most of the music CDs you find on the market.
Although the database doesn’t contain any infor-
mation about personal or custom CDs, people can
submit information to the database about CDs that
the database doesn’t know about. You can even do
this from within iTunes: Type the information for
each track while the audio CD is in your CD drive
and then choose Advanced➪Submit CD Track
Names. The information you typed is sent to the
CDDB site, where the good people who work tire-
lessly on the database check out your information
before including it. In fact, if you spot a typo or
something erroneous in the information you receive
from CDDB, you can correct it and then use the
Submit CD Track Names command to send the cor-
rected version back to the CDDB site. The good
folks at Gracenote appreciate the effort.

Part III: Organizing Your Music
You can change a group of songs in either Browse view or the song list view.
Follow these steps to change a group of songs at once:
1. Select a group of songs by clicking the first song and holding down
the Shift key while you click the last song.
The last song, and all the songs between the first and last, are highlighted
at once. You can add to a selection by Shift-clicking other songs, and you
can remove songs from the selection by holding down the Ô key when
clicking (command-click in Mac jargon). Under Windows, hold down the
Ctrl key while you click.
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô+I (sorry, PC users — there’s no
Windows shortcut here).
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to edit 
information for multiple items?
On a highway, speed can kill. Speed editing in iTunes can also be danger-
ous for your song information. If, for example, you change the song name,
the entire selection then has that song name. You must be careful about
what you edit when doing this. We recommend leaving the Do Not Ask Me
Again check box unselected so that the warning appears whenever you
try this.
3. Click the Yes button to edit information for multiple items.
The Multiple Song Information window appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
4. Edit the field you want to change (typically the Artist field) for the
multiple songs.
When you edit a field, a check mark appears automatically in the box
next to the field. iTunes assumes you want that field to be changed
throughout the song selection. Make sure that no other box is checked
except the field you want, which is typically the Artist field (or perhaps
the Genre field).

5. Click OK to make the change. 
iTunes changes the field for the entire selection of songs.
You can edit the song information before importing the audio tracks from a
CD. The edited track information for the CD imports with the music. (What’s
interesting is that when you access the library without the audio CD, the
edited version of the track information is still there — iTunes remembers
CD information from the CDs you inserted before. Even if you don’t import
the CD tracks, iTunes remembers the edited song information until the next
time you insert that audio CD.)
Adding liner notes and ratings
While the track information grabbed from the Internet is enough for identify-
ing songs in your iTunes library, some facts, such as composer credits, are
not included. Composer information is important for iPod users because the
iPod allows you to scroll music by composer as well as by artist, album, and
song. Adding composer credits is usually worth your while because you can
then search and sort by composer and create playlists.
After your songs import into the music library, locate a single song and
choose File➪Get Info (or Ô+I). You see the Song Information window, shown
in Figure 9-3.
When you select one song, the Song Information window appears; when you
select multiple songs, the Multiple Song Information window appears. Be
careful when selecting multiple songs and using the Get Info command.
The Song Information window offers the following tabs to click for different
panes:
✦Summary: The Summary tab (shown in Figure 9-3) offers useful informa-
tion about the music file’s format and location on your hard disk, and its
file size, as well as information about the digital compression method
(bit rate, sample rate, and so on).

✦Info: The Info tab allows you to change the song name, artist, composer,
album, genre, and year, and comments, as shown in Figure 9-4.
✦Options: The Options tab enables you to adjust the volume, select an
equalizer preset, assign ratings, and choose start and stop times for
each song. You can assign up to five stars to a song (your own rating
system, equivalent to the Top 40 charts).
✦Artwork: The Artwork tab allows you to add or delete artwork for the
song (the iTunes Music Store supplies artwork with most songs).

Adding MP3 Tag Data in Winamp
Adding MP3 Tag Data in Winamp
After you’ve encoded your file in Winamp, there’s one last step: Filling out
the song’s ID tag. MP3 files contain more than just music. There’s room inside
the file to store information about the song itself: its name, composer, artist,
album, length, and other pertinent information.
To fill out an ID tag of a newly created MP3 file — or any MP3 file — load it
into Winamp and double-click its name to display the dialog box shown in
Figure 9-5.
By the way, ID tags sometimes aren’t called ID tags. They’re often called ID3
tags. And, like most other bits of computer unpleasantness, ID3 tags have
moved through several versions, each confusing things a little bit more. So
some programs, like Winamp, display the information stored in both tag for-
mats. The first version of the ID3 tag, known as ID3v1, included space for
the song’s track number (its order on the CD), title, artist, album, recording
year, genre, and a tiny comment.
MP3 users quickly tired of the restrictive format, so the tag engineers
released the ID3v2 tag. That tag includes more space for each description, a
lengthy comment area, and additional spaces for more detailed information.
Why should anybody care about ID tags when the file’s name usually already
contains the artist’s name and song title? Because the larger your collection
grows, the more difficult it becomes to keep track of your songs. With prop-
erly filled-out ID tags, players can find songs more easily and play them on
demand.

Part III: Organizing Your Music
The following list highlights tidbits about tags that you may find useful:
✦Some programs like Musicmatch Jukebox automatically fill out every
song’s tag as they create the MP3, using the number on the CD and dial-
ing the Internet’s Gracenote CDDB database (as I describe earlier in this
chapter).
✦Many MP3 songs downloaded from the Internet lack any tag informa-
tion. Luckily, some programs can read a file’s name to find the artist and
song information and then fill out the tag automatically.
You’ll find many tagging programs — as well as tag information — at
www.id3.org.
✦Napster, which I briefly describe in Chapter 7 of Book III, can actually
search through an MP3 file’s ID tag information as well as its filename
when looking for songs.

iTunes Music Library
In This Chapter
 Browsing your music library
 Changing viewing options
 Sorting the song list
 Searching for songs or artists
 Creating a playlist of multiple songs
 Creating a playlist of albums
 Creating a smart playlist
 Viewing and changing a smart playlist
 Playing a playlist on your iPod
You rip a few CDs and buy some tunes from the iTunes Music Store, and
watch as your music library fills up with songs. That song list is getting
longer and longer, and as a result, your library is getting harder to navigate.
The iTunes library is awesome even by jukebox standards — it can hold 
up to 32,000 songs depending on your disk space. Finding Chuck Berry’s
“Maybelline” is a challenge using a rotating dial of 32,000 songs. The 40GB
iPod holds about 10,000 songs — enough music to last four weeks if played
24 hours a day! Therefore, even if you keep your iTunes library down to the
size of what you can fit on your iPod, you still have a formidable collection
at your fingertips. If you’re a music lover, you’ll want to organize this collec-
tion to make finding songs easier.
In this chapter, I show you how to search, browse, and sort your music
library in iTunes. You can find any song in seconds and display songs sorted
by artist, album, genre of music, or other attributes. You can change the view-
ing options to make your library’s display more useful. I also discuss playlists
and how you can use them to organize your iTunes library.
Browsing by Artist and Album
You can switch to Browse view to find songs more easily. The Browse view
is useful as long as you track information for the songs. You aren’t over-
whelmed by a long list of songs, because when you select an album, iTunes
displays only the songs for that album.
701

Part III: Organizing Your Music
To view albums in Browse view, click the Browse button in the upper-right
corner. iTunes organizes your music library by artist and album, which makes
finding just the right tunes easier, as shown in Figure 10-1. Click the Browse
button again to return to the default view — the Browse button toggles
between Browse view and the default song list view.
The Browse view sorts by artist, and within each artist, by album. It displays
the songs in a list underneath a set of columns. This type of column arrange-
ment is a tree structure, although it looks more like a fallen tree.
When you click an artist in the Artist column (as shown in Figure 10-2), the
artist’s album titles appear in the Album column on the right. At the top of
the Album column, the All selection is highlighted, and the songs from
every album by that artist appear in the Song Name column below the
Artist and Album columns.

Organizing Your iTunes
Music Library
Changing Viewing Options
To see more than one album from an artist at a time, hold down the Ô key
(under Windows, the Ctrl key) and click each album’s name. iTunes displays
the selected albums.
As you click different albums in the Album column, the Song Name column
displays the songs from that album. The songs are listed in proper track
order, just as the artist intended them. 
This technique is great for selecting songs from albums, but what if you want
to look at all the songs by all the artists in the library at once? You can see
all the songs in the library in Browse view by selecting All at the top of the
Artist column. 
Understanding the Song Indicators
As you make choices in iTunes, it displays an action indicator next to each
song to show you what iTunes is doing. Here’s a list of indicators and what
they mean:
✦Orange waveform: iTunes is importing the song.
✦Green check mark: iTunes has finished importing the song.
✦Exclamation point: iTunes can’t find the song. You may have moved or
deleted the song accidentally. You can move the song back to iTunes by
dragging it from the Finder (or Windows Explorer) to the iTunes window.
✦Broadcast icon: The song is on the Internet and plays as a music stream.
✦Black check mark: The song is marked for the next operation, such as
importing from an audio CD or playing in sequence. Click to remove the
check mark. 
✦Speaker: The song is currently playing.
✦Chasing arrows: iTunes is copying the song from another location or
downloading the song from the Internet.
Changing Viewing Options
iTunes gives you the ability to customize the song list. The list starts out
with the Song Name, Time, Artist, Album, Genre, My Rating, Play Count, and
Last Played categories — you may have to drag the horizontal scroll bar
along the bottom of the song list to see all these columns. You can display
more or less information, or different information, in your song list; you can
also display columns in a different order from left to right, or with wider or
narrower column widths.
You can make a column fatter or thinner by dragging the dividing line
between the column and the next column. As you move your cursor over
the divider, it changes to a double-ended arrow; you can click and drag the
divider to change the column’s width.
703

Part III: Organizing Your Music
You can also change the order of columns from left to right by clicking a
column heading and dragging the entire column to the left or right. In addi-
tion, you can Ctrl+click (press the Ctrl key and click) any of the column
headings to display a shortcut menu offering the same options as the View
Options dialog box, the Auto Size Column option, and the Auto Size All
Columns option.
Maybe you don’t like certain columns because they take up valuable screen
space. Or perhaps you want to display some other information about the
song. In the View Options dialog box (choose Edit➪View Options), you can
add or remove columns, such as Size (for file size), Date Added, Year (for
the year the album was released), Bit Rate, Sample Rate, Track Number, and
Comment, to name only a few (see Figure 10-3). 
You can select the columns you want to appear in the song list. To pick a
column, click the check box next to the column header so that a check mark
appears. Any unchecked column headings are columns that don’t appear.
Note that the Song Name column always appears in the listing and can’t be
removed — that’s why it doesn’t appear in the View Options dialog box.
The viewing options you choose depend on your music playing habits. You
may want to display the Time column to know at a glance the duration of
any song. You may want the Year column to differentiate songs from differ-
ent eras, or the Genre column to differentiate songs from different musical
genres.
You can also browse by genre in the Browse view, rather than by artist. To
add a Genre column to the Browse view, choose iTunes➪Preferences (under
Windows, choose Edit➪Preferences). Click the General tab at the top of the
dialog box that appears. In the General Preferences dialog box, select the
Show Genre When Browsing option.
Sorting Songs by Viewing Options
Knowing how to set viewing options is a good idea because you can use them
as criteria when sorting the listing of songs. Whether you’re in Browse view
Figure 10-3:
The viewing
options for
the song list.
704

Book III
Chapter 10

Searching for Songs
or viewing the song list in its entirety, the column headings double as sort-
ing options.
For example, if you click the Time heading, the songs reorder by their dura-
tion in ascending order — starting with the shortest song. If you click the
Time header again, the sort is reversed, starting with the longest song. This
can be useful if you’re looking for songs of a certain length, such as when
you need a song to match the length of a slideshow or a movie clip.
You can tell which way the sort is sorting — ascending or descending 
order — by the little arrow indicator in the heading. When the arrow is
pointing up, the sort is in ascending order; when it’s down, the sort is in
descending order.
You can sort the song list in alphabetical order. Click the Artist heading to
sort all the songs in the list by the artist name, in alphabetical order (the
arrow points up). Click it again to sort the list in reverse alphabetical order
(the arrow points down).
Searching for Songs
As your music library grows, you may find it time-consuming to locate a
particular song by the usual browsing and scrolling methods described ear-
lier in this chapter. So, let iTunes find your songs for you!
Locate the Search field — the oval field in the top-right corner, to the left of
the Browse button. Click in the Search field and type the first characters of
your search term. Follow these tips for best searching:
✦Search for a song title, artist, or album title.
✦Typing very few characters results in a long list of possible songs, but
the search narrows as you type more characters.
✦The Search feature ignores case. When you type miles, for example, it
finds “Eight Miles High” as well as “She Smiles Like a River.” 
✦If you’re in Browse view with an artist and a particular album selected,
you can’t search for another artist or song. Why not? Browsing with
searching narrows your search further. The song you’re looking for isn’t
on the selected album you’re browsing.
If you want to search the entire library in Browse view, first click the All
selection at the top of the Artist column to browse the entire library
before typing a term in the Search field. Or, if you prefer, click the
Browse button again to return to the default song list view, and type a
term in the Search field with the library’s song list.
The search operation works immediately, searching for matches in the Song
Name, Artist, and Album columns of the listing. 
To back out of a search so that the full list appears again, you can either
click the circled X in the Search field (which appears only after you’ve started
typing characters) or delete the characters in the Search field. You then see
705

Part III: Organizing Your Music
the entire list of songs in the library’s song list, just as before. All the songs
are still there, and remain there unless you explicitly remove them. Search-
ing only manipulates your view of them.
Organizing Your Music with Playlists
To organize your music for different operations, such as copying to your
iPod or burning a CD, you make a playlist — a list of the songs you want. 
You can use playlists to organize your music and do the DJ thing. Select love
songs from different albums to play the next time you need a romantic mood.
Compile a list of surf songs for a trip to the beach. I create playlists specifi-
cally for use with an iPod on road trips, and others that combine songs from
different albums based on themes or similarities.
You can create as many playlists of songs, in any order, as you want. The
files don’t change, nor are they copied — the music files stay right where
they are, only their names are stored in the playlists. You can even create a
smart playlist that automatically adds songs to itself based on the criteria
you set up.
Graphical user interfaces like Mac OS X and Windows were made for creat-
ing playlists: dragging items visually to arrange a sequence. Save yourself a
lot of browsing time by creating playlists — which, by the way, can really
improve the way you use music with an iPod. You can create playlists of
individual songs or whole albums.
Creating playlists of songs
You can drag individual songs into a playlist and rearrange the songs quickly
and easily.
To create a playlist comprised of songs, follow these steps:
1. Click the + button or choose File➪New Playlist.
The + button, in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes window under 
the Source list, creates a new playlist in the Source list named “untitled
playlist.”
2. Type a name for the playlist.
The playlist appears in the Source list, as shown in Figure 10-4. After you
type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts the playlist into alphabeti-
cal order in the Source list, underneath the preset smart playlists and
other sources.
3. Select the library in the Source list and drag songs from the library to
the playlist.
4. Select the playlist in the Source list and drag songs to rearrange the
list.
706

Book III
Chapter 10
Organizing Your iTunes
Music Library
Organizing Your Music with Playlists
The order of songs in the playlist is based on the order in which you
dragged them to the list. To move a song up the list and scroll at the same
time, drag it over the up arrow in the first column (the song number); to
move a song down the list and scroll, drag it to the bottom of the list. You
can move a group of songs at once by selecting them (on the PC, click
and press Shift+click; on the Mac, press Ô+click).
You can drag songs from other playlists to a playlist. Remember that only
links are copied, not the actual files. Besides dragging songs, you can also
rearrange a playlist by sorting the list — click the Song Name, Time, or
Artist column headings, and so on. And when you double-click a playlist, it
opens in its own window, displaying the song list.
To create a playlist quickly, select multiple songs at once (as I describe in
the previous section) and then choose File➪New Playlist from Selection.
You can then type a name for the playlist.
Creating playlists of albums
You may want to play entire albums of songs without having to select each
album as you play them. To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular
order, follow these steps:
1. Create a new playlist.
Create a playlist by clicking the + sign under the Source list or by choos-
ing File➪New Playlist. Type a name for the new playlist.
2. Select the library in the Source list, and click the Browse button to
find the artist.
The Album list appears in the right panel.
3. Drag the album name over the playlist name.
4. Select and drag each subsequent album over the playlist name. 
Each time you drag an album, iTunes automatically lists the songs in the
proper track sequence.
Figure 10-4:

707

Part III: Organizing Your Music
You can rename a playlist at any time by clicking its name and typing a new
one, just like any filename in the Finder or in Windows Explorer.
Viewing a Smart Playlist
At the top of the Source list, indicated by a gear icon, you can find what Apple
(and everyone else) calls a smart playlist. iTunes comes with a few sample
smart playlists, such as the My Top Rated playlist, and you can create your
own. Smart playlists add songs to themselves based on prearranged criteria.
For example, as you rate your songs, My Top Rated changes to reflect your
new ratings. You don’t have to set anything up — My Top Rated is already
defined for you. 
The smart playlists are actually ignorant of your taste in music. You can
create one that grabs all the songs from 1966, only to find that the list includes
“Eleanor Rigby,” “Strangers in the Night,” “Over Under Sideways Down,” and
“River Deep, Mountain High” (in no particular order) — which you may not
want to hear at the same time. You may want to fine-tune your criteria.
Creating a smart playlist
To create a new smart playlist, choose File➪New Smart Playlist. The Smart
Playlist dialog box appears (as shown in Figure 10-5), giving you the follow-
ing choices for setting criteria: 
✦Match the Following Condition(s): You can select any of the categories
used for song information from the first pop-up menu, and select an
operator, such as the greater than (>) or less than (<) operators from
the second pop-up menu — combine them to express a condition: Year
is greater than 1966 or something like that. You can also add multiple
conditions by clicking the + button, and then decide whether to match
all or any of these conditions.
✦Limit To: You can make the smart playlist a specific duration, measured
by the number of songs, time, or size in megabytes or gigabytes. You
can have the playlist select songs by various methods such as random,
most recently played, and so on.
Limiting a smart playlist to what can fit on a CD, or for the duration of a
drive or jogging exercise with an iPod, is useful.
✦Match Only Checked Songs: This option selects only songs that have a
black check mark beside them, along with the rest of the criteria.
Checking and unchecking songs is an easy way to fine-tune your selec-
tion for a smart playlist.
✦Live Updating: This allows iTunes to automatically update the playlist

Editing a smart playlist
To edit a smart playlist supplied by Apple, select the playlist and choose
File➪Edit Smart Playlist. The Smart Playlist dialog box appears, with the cri-
teria for the smart playlist. 
You may want to modify the smart playlist so songs with a higher rating are
picked. To do so, simply add another star or two to the My Rating criteria. 
You can also choose to limit the playlist to a certain number of songs,
selected by various methods such as random, most recently played, and 
so on.
Selecting a Playlist on Your iPod
When you update your iPod, the playlists copy to the iPod. Playlists make
playing a selection of songs or albums in a specific order easy. The playlist
plays from the first song selected to the end.
Follow these steps to play a playlist on your iPod:
1. Select the Playlists item from the iPod main menu.
The Playlists item is at the top of the main menu and may already be
highlighted; if not, scroll the main menu until Playlists is highlighted.
Then press the Select button. The Playlists menu appears.

Setting up multiple criteria gives you the opportu-
nity to create playlists that are way smarter than the
ones supplied with iTunes. For example, I created a
smart playlist with criteria shown in Figure 10-5 that
does the following:
 Adds any song added to the library in the past
week that also has a rating greater than three
stars.
 Limits the playlist to 72 minutes of music to fit
on an audio CD, and refines the selection to the
most recently added if the entire selection
becomes greater than 72 minutes.
 Matches only checked songs and performs live
updating.

2. Select a playlist.
The playlists are listed in alphabetical order. Scroll the Playlists menu
until the playlist name is highlighted and then press the Select button. 
A list of songs in the playlist appears.
3. Select a song from the list to start playing.
The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order defined for the

W
hen Diamond Multimedia released its Rio portable MP3 player in
1999 — the first portable MP3 player in the United States — the
record companies quickly filed suit. This new-fangled device was illegal,
they claimed, and violated copyright laws. To the relief of MP3 fans, the
record companies lost the case.
Diamond faces new problems today: The Rio line has been hit with legions
of competitors. A few years ago, only a few small imports released players.
Today, big names like Apple, Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, and a host of others
have released portable MP3 players. The Microsoft Pocket PC and the
Handspring Visor can play MP3 files, as well.
The home stereo market has opened up, too. Some of the latest CD/DVD
players handle CDs stuffed with hundreds of MP3 songs.
Which MP3 player is best? Is it finally time to buy one? Or is the MP3 player
yet another toy for people with too much money? This chapter helps you
decide.
No matter which portable player you purchase, splurge on a new set of
headphones. Check out a stereo shop for some lightweight sports head-
phones. The cheap little ones shipped with most players almost always
stink.
Deciding on a Storage System
Keep one key element in mind when choosing an MP3 player: How many
tunes can it hold?
See, MP3 technology squishes songs to less than 10 percent of their normal
size, but that’s still a huge amount of space. Songs average about 4MB of
space apiece. That means storage capacity is the key factor to consider
when shopping for a portable MP3 player.
711

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
Unfortunately, nobody has come up with a standard storage medium for
portable MP3 players. Most of today’s portable players use one of six types:
CompactFlash, SmartMedia, or MultiMediaCards; Sony Memory Sticks; CDs;
and hard drives. If you graduate from one MP3 player to another, the new one
might use different storage, rendering all your old storage cards useless.
In the next sections, I examine the pros and cons of each type of storage
system, and then explain how to choose one that’s right for you.
When looking at storage systems, remember that one minute of music con-
sumes about 1MB of MP3 storage space. That means a 32MB card holds
roughly a little more than half an hour of music.
CompactFlash
If you’ve seen a laptop, you’ve probably seen a PC card — those business-
card-sized thingies that slide into the laptop’s side to add more storage, a
modem, or other fun accessories.
Cut a standard PC card in half down the middle, and it won’t work anymore.
But the two remnants will each be about the size of a CompactFlash card.
Popular with many portable MP3 players, digital cameras, and other gad-
getry, CompactFlash cards store information without requiring a battery.
Best yet, CompactFlash cards have no moving parts, making them great for
joggers and stunt drivers.
CompactFlash cards come in sizes from 4MB to the recently announced
2GB. The most popular sizes for MP3 players are from 128MB to 512MB. In
fact, the best MP3 players toss in a CompactFlash card in the box. (Read the
box’s fine print closely.)
Here are some pros and cons about CompactFlash cards:
✦CompactFlash cards are sturdy. Encased in plastic, they can survive a
10-foot drop. (Your MP3 player might not, but you can still salvage the
CompactFlash card.) Under average use, the card will last more than 100
years without losing data.
✦Although CompactFlash cards are a bit larger than SmartMedia or
MultiMediaCards (which I discuss next), they hold more information,
and they’re often slightly less expensive.
✦CompactFlash cards certainly aren’t cheap, though. At the time of this
writing, a 128MB card cost around $30, a 256MB card cost about $60, and
a 1GB card cost $190. (Shortly after introduction, Simple Technology’s
512MB card carried a price tag of $1,599. Technology marches on.)
✦SanDisk began cranking out CompactFlash cards in late 1995, giving the
technology a big head start compared to other types of tiny storage
devices.
✦To transfer information quickly between a CompactFlash card and
your computer, check out some of the PC-card adapters. Slide the
CompactFlash card into the end of the PC card, slide the PC card into a
PC-card slot like the ones on a laptop, and you have immediate access
to the CompactFlash data. A slightly less speedy alternative is to buy a
card reader that plugs into one of your PC’s ports.
712

Book III
Chapter 11
Choosing a Portable
Music Player
Deciding on a Storage System
✦Head for the CompactFlash Association at www.compactflash.org for all
the information you could ever want to know about CompactFlash
cards. Even more information comes from the card’s creators: SanDisk
(www.sandisk.com), Kingston (www.kingston.com), or SimpleTech
(www.simpletech.com).
IBM Microdrive
IBM invented the hard disk drive and sold the first one in 1956. Now it has
pulled out a magnifying glass to shrink a hard drive. Really shrink it. The
IBM Microdrive, shown in Figure 11-1, fits into a CompactFlash card — other
manufacturers have also released their own Microdrive designs.
The Microdrive’s whirling platter is the size of a large coin, and the whole
thing weighs less than an AA battery. Yet it stores many hours of CD-quality
audio.
It’s no panacea for your MP3 storage needs, however (even if that word
rolls merrily off your tongue at high-tension social gatherings):
✦Whirling hard drives consume much more electricity than solid-state
memory cards. Don’t count on powering the thing very long — if at all —
with a single AA battery, like those used by many of today’s MP3 players.
Microdrives are also more fragile and subject to possible skipping.
✦Like any CompactFlash card, Microdrives aren’t cheap. Count on spend-
ing about $200 for a 2GB card. That’s cheaper than a CompactFlash card
of about the same capacity, but it still might cost more than your player.
✦Microdrives are Type II cards, meaning they’re slightly thicker than
some of the other, Type I cards. Better make sure that your player can
use it before shelling out the bucks. (Most players can use them.)

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
SmartMedia
The postage-stamp-sized cards are relatively easy to find because digital
camera owners have snapped them up for years. Toshiba created the Solid
State Floppy Disc Card (SSFDC) that’s now, thankfully, referred to as a plain
ol’ SmartMedia card.
Smaller than a CompactFlash card and only as thick as thin cardboard,
SmartMedia cards result in smaller MP3 players.
So what’s the big problem with SmartMedia cards? Actually, there are two
problems. First, they’re still expensive, costing around $60 for a 128MB
card. The other problem? SmartMedia cards can store far less than higher-
capacity CompactFlash cards, so these cards might be on their way out.
Bummer. I still have a bunch of them.
SmartMedia cards come in two voltages: 3.3 volts and 5 volts. Hardly any
device uses the 5-volt card anymore. (Turn the card with its shiny side up;
the voltage is stamped on that side. Also, the 3.3-volt card has a notch on its
right side; the 5-volt card has a notch on the left side.)
MultiMediaCard
The designers of the CompactFlash card didn’t rest on their laurels; they
also came up with the MultiMediaCard, a postage-stamp-sized card created
to compete with the SmartMedia card (see Figure 11-2). It’s one of the tini-
est storage devices available.
However, the MultiMediaCard has never taken off the way it was supposed
to, and its lack of acceptance mirrors the SmartMedia cards. Although
capacities run to 512MB, it costs significantly more than a CompactFlash
card with the same storage size.
In short, CompactFlash has quite a head start on both SmartMedia cards
and MultiMediaCards. But plenty of MultiMediaCard enthusiasts hang out
at www.mmca.org.
CDs
CDs seem like a natural storage solution. MP3 files are huge, and CDs hold
huge amounts of data. If you leave off the extended Grateful Dead jams, a
single CD can often hold 200 or more MP3 songs.
For years, though, only computers could play MP3 CDs. Home stereos
required their CDs to store music in standard audio CD format — techni-
cally called the Red Book format (see Chapter 7 of Book IV to read more
about the Red Book format) — that allowed only 10 to 12 songs per disc.
But that’s changing, albeit slowly. A large percentage of the personal (see
Figure 11-3), home, and car audio CD players on the market now recognize
MP3 discs.
Some people will scream in delight when receiving one of these as a birth-
day present. Others will say, “Wellllll.” That’s because a CD player is still a
CD player, even if it’s finally able to play MP3 files. It’s too big to drop into

supports CD-RW media). Plus, CD players are susceptible to motion, making
them a second-tier option for the athletic crowd.

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
It also takes a relatively long time to burn a CD with your favorite songs.
And all those moving parts can cause problems: hinges break, CDs scratch,
and some players are persnickety about how the MP3s are stored on the disc.
But hey, these new players are cheap, coming out at around $50 apiece. CDs
are about the cheapest storage medium around, costing less than a quarter
for about 200 songs. Adding the two prices together makes this one of the
cheapest solutions around — if you can put up with the awkwardness of a CD.
Hard drives
Everything about computers has grown smaller through the years, and hard
drives are no exception. That’s why serious MP3 aficionados once sat
around waiting for a player with a tiny hard drive that’s big enough to hold
their entire collection. There’s no need to wait any longer: The Apple iPod,
the most successful portable MP3 unit on the market, offers models with 15,
30, and 40GB worth of storage. 
Other hard-drive-based systems are appearing at cheaper prices than
the iPod — for example, the Nitrus and Karma players from Rio (www.
rioaudio.com) and the NOMAD MuVo2 from Creative Technology (www.
creative.com) — so let the price wars begin.
Sony Memory Sticks
Companies have two ways to make money on portable MP3 players. They
can sell the player, or they can make a player that uses a new breed of card
and sell both the player and the card. Sony took the latter route with its
Memory Stick, shown in Figure 11-4.
Sony is using its Memory Stick for a good portion of its product line, from
cameras to recorders to MP3 players. It’s a sturdy little beast, with a good
design — it’s hard to touch the metal contacts, so that keeps them clean
and free of dust.
Unfortunately, very few — if any — other MP3 players can use Memory
Sticks. If you buy them, they’ll work only on Sony products. I bit the bullet
and bought a 64MB Memory Stick for my Sony PC-5 camcorder. But I was
sure upset that the camera couldn’t use my collection of SmartMedia cards
or my growing collection of CompactFlash cards.
So, which storage format is best?
If you’re trying to save money in storage costs, it’s obvious that MP3 CD
players are the cheapest way to go. Because you’re only paying a fraction of
a penny per minute of song storage, you can buy a bunch of blank CDs, fill
’em up with your MP3 collection, and be done with it (or, even better, find a
Figure 11-4:

model that accepts reusable CD-RW media, and just use the same disc over
and over).
But you have more to consider than just storage costs:
✦The cost-effective CD player might be the one for you, but only if you
don’t mind the awkward size.
✦If you’re clumsy and afraid of losing something expensive, go for the CD
player. You won’t be out a bundle when you leave a card-based MP3
player at the bar.
✦If you need something smaller, the CompactFlash card, SmartMedia
card, MultiMediaCard, or Memory Stick might be the thing. They’re all
relatively expensive, however — especially if you’re prone to losing
things. But they’re also more convenient than some of the other sys-
tems when it comes to transferring songs back and forth.
✦A Microdrive stores songs for half the price of the CompactFlash and
similar cards, but it draws more power and is subject to rattles. Plus, if
you lose one of those expensive little things, you’ll be crying for weeks.
✦Today’s best bet — if you don’t mind carrying around a slightly larger
device — is a hard drive player. With up to 40GB of storage, it can hold
your entire music collection, letting you take it with you wherever you
go. Plug the gadget into your home or car stereo, and you won’t have to
think about buying a dedicated home MP3 player. (Can you tell how
much I love my iPod?)
✦If you have a digital camera or other device that already uses one of
these formats, think about buying a portable MP3 player that uses the
same format. When you can use the same card for both toys, you don’t
have to buy twice as many cards.
✦Consider buying an older MP3 player. Check out the auctions on eBay
(www.ebay.com) or Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com). Just as people trade in their
old cars when buying new ones, many people sell their old MP3 players
when buying the latest big thing. Last time I looked, I found more than
1,000 players on eBay, with some going for just $35.
Introducing the iPod
In his trademark style, Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the 30GB iPod with
a remark about Apple’s competitors: “We’re into our third generation and
the rest of them haven’t caught up with the first.”
As an iPod owner, you’re on the cutting edge of music player technology.
This section introduces the iPod and tells you what to expect when you
open the box.
The iPod is, essentially, a hard drive and a digital music player in one
device. Originally, iPods worked only with Macintosh computers, but the
latest models support both Macs and Windows PCs running iTunes. The
hard drive enables the device to hold far more music than MP3 players.
The 40GB iPod model (available as of this writing) can hold around 10,000
songs; that’s about 9,000 more songs than can fit on a typical MP3 player.
717

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
I’ve put enough music in an iPod to last three weeks if played continuously,
around the clock — or about one new song a day for the next 20 years.
The design of the iPod is superb. At less than 6 ounces, it weighs less than
two CDs. With an LCD screen, touch wheel, menu buttons, and backlighting
for clear visibility in low-light conditions, the iPod is designed for easy one-
handed operation. It offers up to 20 minutes of skip protection — keeping
music playing smoothly, not missing a beat even with jarring physical
activity — which is twice that of other hard-drive-based MP3 players on the
market. And with a thickness of only 0.62 inches, the iPod fits comfortably
in the palm of your hand and slips easily into your pocket.
The iPod is a music player — although an add-on device is available to turn
it into a voice recorder. In my opinion, however, what makes the iPod great
is the way it helps you manage your music. In league with iTunes, you can
have your iPod do the following things:
✦Update itself automatically to copy your entire iTunes music library
✦Copy music directly
✦Delete music
✦Update by playlist
Because of the lightning-fast FireWire connection, you’ll spend only about
ten seconds copying a CD’s worth of music from iTunes on your Mac to
your iPod. The iPod supports the most popular digital audio formats,
including MP3 (including MP3 Variable Bit Rate), AIFF, WAV, and the new
AAC format, which features CD-quality audio in smaller file sizes than MP3.
It also supports the Audible AA spoken word file format.
The iPod is also a data player, perhaps the first of its kind. As a hard disk,
the iPod serves as a portable FireWire backup device for important data
files, including your calendar and address book.
The iPod is a convenient way for viewing data on the road (while listening
to music, of course). You can display text files, notes, and your calendar,
and play one of several different games if you’re stuck in a line at the air-
port. It even offers a sleep timer and alarm clock that can wake you up with
your favorite music.
Choosing a Portable Player
When shopping for MP3 players, the following terms pop up either on the
box or the advertisements. You might already know what some of them
mean; others might be completely foreign. Either way, here’s a look at what
they mean.
Don’t just buy a player without researching it a little bit. First, head to
groups.google.com and search for the name of the player you have your eye
on. Chances are, that site will turn up discussions of many owners either
praising or damning their purchase. The MP3 Hardware forums at MP3.com
are another great place for finding information.
718

Book III
Chapter 11

Choosing a Portable Player
Skip protection
When you shake a CD player, the laser read head inside moves, making the
sound skip. So, those clever engineers added skip protection. When your CD
player starts reading the CD, it reads some of the song in advance, storing it
in memory that isn’t affected by movement.
Then, should the little laser doohickey get jostled, the player reads the
music from the memory — the buffer. Skip protection technology keeps the
song playing smoothly.
Sometimes skip protection is measured in seconds — the number of sec-
onds of music that’s read ahead. Other times, skip protection is measured
by the amount of memory used to store the music. Either way, the larger
the number, the smoother the song plays under rough conditions.
Radio tuner
Face it, the cheapest portable MP3 players can’t store more than ten songs.
If you’re taking off in the morning and returning later in the afternoon or
evening, those ten songs might become monotonous.
That’s why the best MP3 players toss in a few extra dollars of circuitry to
include a radio tuner. That lets you hear your favorite stations when your
MP3 tunes become tiring. A radio tuner is definitely a feature to look for.
Microphone
Everybody stumbles on a key thought from time to time that could change
their lives — if only they could remember it when they got home. So some
MP3 players add a microphone for recording those thoughts that seem so
important at the time.
Beware, however: MP3 players don’t record sounds in MP3 format. They
record them as a WAV file. An MP3 player also records sounds in a low-
quality format that’s fine for speech but lousy for everything else. Most
limit the recordings to a few minutes, as well. Even if you do smuggle one
into a concert, you’ll get only a bad recording of the first part of one song.
Directory and subdirectory restrictions
Some people meticulously organize their MP3 collections. They create one
folder called MP3 and then create folders inside that folder for each artist.
Next, they create folders in each artist’s folder, one for each album. This
meticulous organization makes it easy to find songs on a huge hard drive.
However, some players don’t recognize all this work. They want all the
songs lumped together in a single folder. That makes it harder for you to
pluck the right song from a big pile. This might just be a minor inconven-
ience, but beware of it, nonetheless. (If the manufacturer’s Web site doesn’t
hold such nuggets of information, a little research online should pinpoint
reviews of just about any player you’re considering.)
719

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
ID tags
MP3 files contain more than music. The format includes space for people to
add information about the music: the artist, song, album, type of music,
recording year, and other interesting tidbits.
Even if a file is named incorrectly, an MP3 player can look at the tag (assum-
ing that it’s been filled out correctly) and find out what song is really inside
the file.
The best players read ID tags and display the information on-screen, making
it easy to see what’s being played. The worst players ignore the ID tags and
just display a number in place of the song’s title.
Now the technical bit. As the MP3 format evolves, so does the ID tag format.
In fact, it’s gone through several incarnations, with the most popular being
either ID3v1 or ID3v2. ID3v2 is growing in popularity because it holds more
information about the song — even a picture of the CD cover, if desired.
However, some players can handle only the earlier, ID3v1 tag. That frus-
trates people who have meticulously entered ID3v2 information into their
563 MP3 files.
720
Just tell me which MP3 player to buy!
I tried doing that in one of my earlier books, which
contained pictures and reviews of all the MP3
players on the market at that time. A week after the
book came out, dozens more new players appeared,
followed by more players every week after that.
There’s just no way a book can keep up.
Instead, I’ll tell you how to cut through the promo-
tional and marketing stuff and find out what users
think about today’s crop of MP3 players. Here’s how
to find the best MP3 player for your pocket, your
car, or your home stereo:
 Go to MP3.com (www.mp3.com) and click the
Portable Players button in the Tech Guide sec-
tion. The folks at MP3.com get all the new
goodies before anybody else, so you’ll find pic-
tures, specs, and a review of each one.
 Head for the Internet’s Usenet, a spot where
computer geeks from around the world meet to
discuss just about everything. To search through
the Usenet messages easily, head to the Google
Usenet Archive (groups.google.com). That
service currently keeps track of all the Usenet
messages posted since 1999. Type the name of
the player you’re considering and click the
Search button. Wham! You see messages from
anybody who’s talked about that player in the
past two years. Best yet, these messages are
from real people — no company hype here.
 To find everything on the Internet about a par-
ticular MP3 player, head to the Google (www.
google.com) search engine. You’ll find chat-
ter from owners and dealers and information
from the player’s Web site — just about any-
thing related to the product. Another good
search engine is Surfwax (www.surfwax.
com). Surfwax searches bunches of search
engines simultaneously and posts the results for
your perusal. Some people like CNET.com (www.
cnet.com) for reviews and information, too.
By using a combination of these techniques, you
can find all the information you want about a par-
ticular player. Remember, however, that this is the
Internet, so don’t take any single message at its
word. Posts that appear repeatedly from different
people are more likely to be accurate than a post
from one user.

Playback options
Does the player simply play all your songs in a row? Can you program them
to play back in a certain order? Can it shuffle them randomly so that you
don’t get tired of the tunes as quickly? When it shuffles them randomly,
does it always use the same random order? Don’t laugh — it happens.
Power
Portable players come with batteries. But are the batteries replaceable or
rechargeable? There is a tradeoff. Rechargeable batteries are cheaper in the
long run, unless you’re living in California during a power crisis. But if they
run out during the afternoon, you can’t run into a 7-Eleven and grab some
new ones. You’re stuck.
How long do the batteries last? And does an AC adapter come with the
player, or do you have to buy it separately?
Accessories
Many MP3 players, eager to stand out among the competition, toss in some
extra goodies: a power adapter that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter,
for instance. How are the earphones? Does it have a carrying case? And, if
you’ll be jogging with it, does it come with a belt clip?
Playing MP3s through Your Home Stereo
You already know that you can play MP3 tunes on your computer, and you
might even have a portable player to listen to tunes when you’re away from
the computer. But serious music fans want a third player: one that hooks up
to their home stereo to fill the house with music.
You can make the tunes come out of the home stereo in several ways:
✦Your computer is an MP3 player — connect it to your stereo. Chapter
3 of Book III shows you how to connect the right cables between your
computer and home stereo. If you have a spare computer and enough
space for it to fit next to your home stereo, go for it.
✦Connect your portable MP3 player to your home stereo. Just follow
the instructions in the Check It Out section, “Hooking Up an MP3 Player
to a Home Stereo,” at the end of this chapter.
✦Hook up an FM transmitter to the back of your MP3 player and a
receiver to your home stereo’s input jacks. If they’re not too far apart,
you’ll hear your music without a problem.
Listening to MP3 Files in Your Car
You can play MP3 files from your home stereo, from your computer, and
from a portable player using headphones. But MP3 is still a relative new-
comer in the world of car audio.
721

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
If your car’s audio system doesn’t recognize MP3 music discs, consider
these less expensive workarounds:
✦Use a cassette player adapter. If your car has a cassette player, check
out a CD-to-Cassette Player adapter. It looks like a cassette tape with a
stereo cable hanging from one end. Plug the cable into your portable
MP3 player’s headphone jack, insert the cassette, and start listening to
your MP3s through your car stereo. It sounds amazingly good — well, at
least compared to the road noise.
✦Use a wireless FM adapter. Plug the cable from an FM transmitter into
your portable MP3 player. Then tune your car’s FM radio to the right fre-
quency and listen to your MP3s. Unfortunately, sound quality varies
because of local interference, and you’re dependent on the batteries
that power your wireless adapter.
✦Buy a car stereo with a CD Input jack. Some car stereos lack a CD
player. Instead, they have a CD Input jack. Plug a 1⁄8-inch stereo cable
between this jack and your portable MP3 player to hear MP3s through
your car’s stereo system.
✦Burn MP3 songs onto a CD in audio format. Does your car have a CD
player? Then convert your MP3 songs back into standard CD audio
format and copy them to a CD. You can’t fit more than a dozen onto the
CD, but at least you can hear them.
✦Connect a portable MP3 player to amplified speakers. Take some
amplified speakers — like the ones that come with your PC — and plug
a portable MP3 player into them. Carry it all to your car and start listen-
ing. To change songs, just swap new cards in and out of the portable
player.
Just like car stereos, dedicated MP3 players for cars can be ripped off. To
avoid that, substitute your portable MP3 player. You can easily grab your
portable MP3 player when you leave the car, keeping it safe.

Tunes is the software that puts music on your iPod. (It’s more than just
music — you can include audio books or anything that’s stored as a song in
iTunes.) iTunes can fill your iPod very quickly with the tunes in your library.
If you’re too busy to copy specific songs to your iPod, and your entire
iTunes music library fits on your iPod anyway, why not just copy every-
thing? Copying your library is just as fast as copying individual songs, if
not faster, and you don’t have to do anything except connect the iPod to
the Mac. This chapter shows you how to set up iTunes to automatically
update your iPod.
This chapter also shows how you can update your iPod manually, choosing
which songs to copy. iTunes is flexible in that you can use either option, or
both options, to update your iPod. You can, for example, update automati-
cally with all the songs in playlists, go into iTunes and copy other music
that’s not in playlists directly to your iPod, and then delete songs from your
iPod if you need to make room. This chapter explains how to set your pref-
erences for updating and change them when you need to.
Changing Your Update Preferences
If you at some point changed your iPod preferences to update manually, you
can change them back to update automatically at any time (and vice versa).
Change your iPod preferences by following these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your Mac through the Mac’s FireWire connection.
Your iPod must be connected for you to change the update preferences.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source list.
3. Click the iPod options button on the lower-right side of the iTunes
window.
The iPod Preferences window appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
4. Select the update preferences that you want, and click the OK button.

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
5. Click the OK button to accept the warning message that appears.
For example, if you select the Automatically Update All Songs and
Playlists option button, iTunes displays a confirmation message (see
Figure 12-2).
Updating Your iPod Automatically
Out of the box, the iPod updates itself automatically, synchronizing itself —
the iPod matches your library exactly, song for song, playlist for playlist —
with your music library. If you made changes in iTunes after the last time
you synchronized, those changes are automatically made in the iPod when
you synchronize again.
If you share an iPod and a large iTunes library with someone and you can’t
fit the entire library on your iPod, you can update automatically by playlist
rather than the entire library. That way, when it is your turn to use the iPod,
you can automatically erase all the music on the iPod that’s associated with
the other person’s playlists and copy your playlists. The other person can
do the same when you switch. You can update the iPod with different songs
as often as you like.
Of course, because the music for your iPod is on your computer, if someone
erases your music from the iPod, it’s no big deal — you can update the iPod
quickly with your music when it’s your turn. Make backups of your music
library regularly.

Updating Your iPod Automatically
Before you connect your iPod to a Mac to automatically update, keep the
following things in mind:
✦iTunes remembers your updating preferences from the last time that
you updated your iPod. If you already set your preferences to update
automatically, iTunes remembers and starts to automatically update
your iPod. If you already set your preferences to update manually, iTunes
remembers and makes your iPod active in the iTunes Source list.
✦You can prevent your iPod from automatically updating by holding
down Ô and Option as you connect the iPod; keep these keys held
down until the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source list. This
works even if you choose to automatically update the iPod in the
Setup Assistant.
✦If you connect your iPod to another Mac, you may be in for a surprise.
When you connect an iPod that was previously linked to another Mac,
iTunes displays the following message:
This iPod is linked to another iTunes music library.
Do you want to change the link to this iTunes music
library and replace all existing songs and playlists
on this iPod with those from this library?
If you don’t want to change your iPod to have this other music library,
click the No button. Otherwise, iTunes erases your iPod and updates
your iPod with the other Mac’s library. By clicking the No button, you
change that computer’s iTunes preferences to manually update, thereby
avoiding automatic updating.
✦Songs that are stored remotely (such as songs that you share from other
iTunes libraries on a network) are not synchronized because they are
not physically on your computer.
Updating the entire library
Your iPod is set up by default to automatically update itself from your iTunes
library. Just follow these simple steps to set the updating process in motion:
1. Connect the iPod to your Mac through the Mac’s FireWire connection.
When you connect the iPod to the Mac, your iPod automatically
synchronizes with your iTunes music library.
When the updating finishes, the iTunes status view tells you that the
iPod update is complete (see Figure 12-3).
2. Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the lower-right corner
of the iTunes window.
You can also eject (or unmount) the iPod by dragging the iPod icon on
the desktop to the Trash. After you drag it to the Trash, the iPod dis-
plays an OK to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod
from its dock or disconnect the dock from the computer.
While the updating is in progress, do not disconnect your iPod. (In fact, the
iPod displays a Do not disconnect warning as soon as you plug it in.) The
iPod is a hard drive, after all, and hard drives need to be shut down prop-
erly so that you do not to lose critical data.
725

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
Updating playlists
If you share an iPod with someone else, you can keep track of the music
that you use in the iPod by including those songs or albums in playlists in
your iTunes library and then updating the iPod automatically with your
playlists, deleting whatever was in the iPod before. To do this, set up the
iPod to update only selected playlists automatically.
Before using this update option, create the playlists in iTunes (see Chapter
10 of Book III) that you want to copy to the iPod. Then, to update your
playlist, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your Mac through the Mac’s FireWire connection.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source list.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences window appears (see Figure 12-4).
4. Select the Automatically Update Selected Playlists Only option button.
5. In the list box, select the check box next to each playlist that you
want to copy in the update, and then click the OK button.
iTunes automatically updates the iPod by erasing its contents and copy-
ing only the playlists that you select.
When updating finishes, the iTunes status view tells you that the iPod
update is complete.
6. Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the lower-right corner
of the iTunes window.
The update is finished.

Updating selected songs
You may want to update the iPod automatically, but only with selected
songs — songs that are selected with a check mark. To use this method,
you must first deselect the songs that you don’t want to transfer. To dese-
lect a song, click the check box so that the check mark disappears (clicking
the check box again makes it reappear, reselecting the song).
You can quickly select or deselect an entire album by selecting an album in
Browse view and holding down the Ô key.
After deselecting the songs that you don’t want to transfer, and making sure
that the songs you do want to transfer are selected, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your Mac through the Mac’s FireWire connection.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source list.
You can select the iPod name even when it is grayed out.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences window appears (refer to Figure 12-1).
4. Select the Automatically Update All Songs and Playlists option button,
and click the OK button when the Are you sure you want to enable
automatic updating message appears.
5. Select the Only Update Checked Songs check box, and click the OK
button.
iTunes automatically updates the iPod by erasing its contents and copy-
ing only the songs in the iTunes library that are selected.
When updating finishes, the iTunes status view tells you that the iPod
update is complete.
6. Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the lower-right corner
of the iTunes window.

Part IV: Using a Portable Music Player
Updating Your iPod Manually
With manual updating, you can add music to your iPod directly using iTunes,
and you can delete music from your iPod as well. The iPod name appears in
the iTunes Source list, and you can double-click to open it, displaying the
iPod playlists.
You may have one or more reasons for updating manually, but some
obvious ones are as follows:
✦Your entire music library may be too big for your iPod, and therefore you
want to copy individual albums, songs, or playlists to the iPod directly.
✦You want to share a single music library with several iPods, and you
have different playlists that you want to copy to each iPod directly.
✦You want to copy some music from another computer’s music library,
without deleting any music from your iPod.
✦You want to edit the playlists and song information directly on your
iPod without changing anything in your computer’s library. See Book III,
Chapter 10, to discover how to edit playlists and song information on
your iPod.
✦You want to play the songs on your iPod using iTunes on the Mac, play-
ing through the Mac’s speakers.
When you set your iPod to update manually, the entire contents of the iPod
are active and available in iTunes. You can copy music directly to your iPod,
delete songs on the iPod, and edit the iPod playlists directly.
To set your iPod to update manually, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your Mac, holding down Ô and Option to prevent
automatic updating.
Continue holding down these keys until the iPod name appears in the
iTunes Source list.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source list.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences window appears (refer to Figure 12-1).
4. Select the Manually Manage Songs and Playlists option button.
iTunes displays the Disabling automatic update requires manually
unmounting the iPod before each disconnect message.
5. Click the OK button to accept the new iPod preferences.
The iPod contents now appear active in iTunes, and not grayed out.
Copying music directly
To copy music to your iPod directly, follow these steps (with your iPod con-
nected to your Mac):
1. Select the iTunes music library in the Source list.
The library’s songs appear in a list view or in Browse view.
728

Book III
Chapter 12
Syncing an iPod

Updating Your iPod Manually
2. Drag items directly from your iTunes music library over the iPod
name in the Source list, as shown in Figure 12-5.
When you copy a playlist, all the songs that are associated with the
playlist are copied along with the playlist itself. When you copy an
album, all the songs in the album are copied.
When updating finishes, the iTunes status view tells you that the iPod
update is complete.
3. Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the lower-right corner
of the iTunes window.
Deleting music from your iPod
With manual updating, you can delete songs from the iPod directly. While
an automatic update adds and deletes songs, manual deletion is a nice fea-
ture if you just want to go in and delete a song or an album to make room
for more music.
To delete any song in the song list with your iPod set to manual updating,
follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source list.
2. Open the iPod’s contents in iTunes.
3. Select a song or album on the iPod in iTunes, and press Delete or
choose Edit➪Clear.
4. When iTunes displays a warning to make sure that you want to do this,
click the OK button to go ahead or click the Cancel button to stop.
To delete a playlist, select the playlist and press Delete or choose Edit➪Clear.
As in the iTunes library, if you delete a playlist, the songs themselves are
not deleted — they are still on your iPod unless you delete them from the
iPod song list or update the iPod automatically with other songs or playlists.

W
hen was the last time you really looked at a CD? I mean really stared
at it, in rapt fascination? Believe it or not, CDs used to be enthralling!
CDs are now a staple of the technical wonderland that you and I live in.
Unless you’re older and you were around long before 1980 — in the days of
disco, Charlie’s Angels, and Rubik’s Cube — you won’t remember the lure of
the compact disc. In those dark times, before the introduction of CDs, music
lived on huge, clunky vinyl albums. Computer software was loaded on floppy
disks. Movies? They were kept on videotape (and still are, but not for long).
At first, this situation wasn’t a bad one — at least until you kept these old-
fashioned storage media for a year or two. Suddenly, you would find that
those records had picked up scratches and pops. Computer programs were
growing so large that they would span five or six floppies. And sooner or
later, those floppy disks and movie videotapes could no longer be read reli-
ably; after a mere 100 viewings or so, you would end up buying another
copy of Enter the Dragon. (Okay, so I’m a big Bruce Lee fan. Substitute your
favorite movie instead.)
Like a circular knight in shining armor, the CD arrived, heralding the begin-
ning of the digital consumer age. I’m not kidding; I can remember an entire
room of technotypes jumping with excitement just to see their first compact
disc! (None of us could afford an audio CD player, and computer CD-ROM
drives hadn’t arrived yet, but it was great just to see a real, live CD.) In the
beginning, audio CDs brought us crystal-clear sound and the convenience of
jumping instantly from track to track. Then computer software suddenly fit
on one CD, and the software could always be read reliably. Now, with the
advent of DVD, movies are accompanied by luxuries like alternative sound-
tracks and interviews with the cast and director. Would you go back to any-
thing less?
733

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of the compact disc. You cer-
tainly don’t have to know all this stuff before you jump into recording your
own discs, but if you understand the basics of what’s going on, you avoid
mistakes. (Always be prepared.) I promise to tell you along the way about
what you absolutely need to know. You find out how discs store informa-
tion, video, and music as well as what components are inside your CD or
DVD recorder. I cover what types of media you can use and what you can
store. Finally, I show you how to properly care for your optical pets. (You
may not stare at CDs like I used to, but you still have to keep them clean.)
Always Begin with a Definition
In this case, let me start by defining the now-familiar term CD-ROM — short
for compact disc-read-only memory. (I’ve shortened this to “CD” throughout
this book, which will save about 200 trees by the time I’ve finished.) This
high-tech description simply means that a CD stores information of some
sort that your computer or audio CD player can read from but can’t write to
(which makes the CD-ROM drive different from a hard drive, for example,
which you can both read from and write to). In general, I use the word disc
to describe both CD-ROM and DVD-ROM discs; both are similar, and they
both look very much alike.
Keep that in mind: Whenever someone refers to just a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
drive (without using the word recordable), they’re talking about the drives
that just read discs and can’t record on them.
The basic specifications of both audio CDs and data CDs (those discs that
you use in your computer) are the same: They are 12 centimeters in diame-
ter and a millimeter thick, and they have an opaque top and reflective
bottom. Such is the Tao of the disc.
As shown in Figure 1-1, however, the structure of a mass-produced disc isn’t
a single piece of plastic. The disc is made up of a number of layers, each of
which has something special to add to the mix, as follows:
✦A label: Commercially manufactured discs that you buy in the store
have screen-printed labels; these graphics are created from layers of ink
applied one on top of the other (like that Metallica t-shirt you may be
wearing).
What’s that, you say? You don’t have $1,000 or so to spend on a special
CD screen printer? (Come to think of it, neither do I!) In that case, do
what I do, and use your ink-jet or laser printer to create a fancy paper
label, complete with the graphics and text that you choose. Or, you can

Book IV
Chapter 1
Optical Storage (Or It’s
All in the Pits)
Always Begin with a Definition
opt to buy an inexpensive ink-jet printer that also prints on special “print-
able” CD and DVD blank discs — we’re talking about $150 or less. These
are far less expensive than a dedicated CD screen printer, and the discs
look almost as good.
“Do I really need a label?” To be honest, no. A disc that you’ve recorded
works fine without one. However, if you’ve ever dug through a 6-inch stack
of unlabeled CDs to find that Andy Williams Greatest Hits disc that you
burned a month ago for Aunt Harriet, I guarantee that you will under-
stand. If you don’t need a professional look and you’re not into appear-
ances, just use a CD marking pen and scribble a quick title on the top.
Most recordable discs have blank lines printed on them just for this pur-
pose. You can pick up one of these handy pens at any office supply
store, but make sure that you buy a pen that’s designed especially for
marking CDs.
✦Opaque plastic: You need something to protect the top of the disc. I
suppose that you could use steel, but then a disc would weigh two
pounds and cost much more — therefore, you find a layer of scratch-
resistant plastic.
✦Aluminum film: Mass-produced CDs use a thin layer of aluminum that’s
covered with microscopic indentations called pits. These pits are
arranged in a single, tiny groove that spirals around the disc, just like
the groove on one of those antique record albums. (If something works,
why mess with it?) However, the groove on a CD starts at the center and
spirals to the outside of the disc, so it goes in the opposite direction.
✦More plastic: Again, you have to protect that shiny aluminum — how-
ever, in this case, the plastic must be crystal-clear (for reasons that
soon become apparent). Here’s a hint: It has to do with the passage of
laser light.
As I mention at the beginning of this list, this yummy sandwich is a cross
section of a commercial CD that’s produced at a factory — but the discs that
you record on are different in one important way, which I cover in a minute.
735
Dig that crazy acronym!
I have to use a truckload of acronyms in this
book — luckily, each one has only one meaning,
right? Almost! One strange exception applies: You
may be wondering what DVD stands for, and as the
mondo author expert, I should be able to tell you.
When DVD-ROM technology was first introduced,
everyone agreed that it stood for digital versatile
disc-read-only memory because it could store so
many types of data. Although a CD can store music
and computer files, it doesn’t have the room for a
full-length movie at the highest quality level. You
find out later in this chapter that you can cram a
huge amount of cool stuff on a DVD-ROM, so it was
the first optical media to hold all the different types
of digital information that we use today. Hence, the
word versatile, and everyone seemed happy.
At some point, however, those first owners of DVD-
ROM players who weren’t acronym aficionados
decided that DVD stood for digital video disc — and
for a time that was true because DVDs were first
used for only movies. This name situation leaves us
in a quandary because more and more folks think
video rather than versatile. Naturally, it doesn’t
matter a hoot because everyone just uses the
acronym anyway, but it does make a killer trivia
question!

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
How Is Data Recorded on CDs and DVDs?
Consider just how audio, video, and computer files are stored on a CD.
Although these three types of information are different, they are stored in
the same way: digitally. But what does that word really mean?
Programmers, technotypes, and hardware jockeys use the word digital
when they’re talking about binary, the language that’s used by computers
around the world. Unlike the imprecise languages that are spoken and writ-
ten by mere mortals, binary data is built from only two values — 0 and 1.
These values are often referred to as off and on, respectively, as shown in
Figure 1-2. (In fact, a computer is only a huge collection of switches, but that’s
another story.) Therefore, computer files and digital music are a long line of
0s and 1s. If you sat next to a light switch for 100 years and flipped it off and
on in the proper sequence, you would have the visual version of a digital
song from a CD (and a bad headache along with incredibly sore fingers).
Now that you’re privy to the binary master plan, you can see how the
absence and presence of light perfectly represent binary data — things in a
room are either dark or bright. The geniuses who developed CD technology
took this concept one step further! They had the great idea of using a laser
beam to read the binary data that’s stored on a disc, and that’s where those
pits in the aluminum layer that I mention in the preceding section take
center stage.
Figure 1-3 shows how the binary data is read: When the laser beam hits a pit
on the surface of the CD, the beam scatters, so most of it isn’t reflected
(hence, darkness, which in this case stands for a 0 in binary data). If the
laser beam hits one of the flat surfaces — they’re called lands, by the way —
the beam is cleanly reflected back, and the drive senses that reflected light.
(This is a 1 in binary format.) And, ladies and gentlemen, that is why the
bottom of a CD shines like a mirror; the rainbow effect is caused by the
microscopic groove that runs across the surface. Naturally, the process of
reading data from a disc happens very fast (I talk about speed in Book IV,
Chapter 2), but that’s really all there is to it.
Essentially, DVD technology works the same way — with a difference or
two. A DVD-ROM disc can hold the approximate equivalent of seven CDs,
and Figure 1-4 shows why: The pits on a DVD-ROM are much smaller and
are packed closer together on the surface of the disc, and the drive uses a
much more powerful laser beam to read them. DVDs can also have multiple
reflective layers, so data can be stored on both sides.

Optical Storage (Or It’s

It’s All in the Dye
Believe it or not, the DVD specification standard provides for two-sided
DVD-ROM discs that have two layers on each side, for more than 27 CDs’
worth of storage space on a single DVD-ROM! However, these discs are so
hard to manufacture that they’re on the endangered species list, and you
may never see one.
It’s All in the Dye
Consider the structure of recordable discs, which includes both recordable
CDs and recordable DVDs. Remember the aluminum film? Sounds perma-
nent, doesn’t it? Indeed it is, which is why you can’t use commercially man-
ufactured discs to record your own data. Your recorder has to be able to
create the equivalent of pits and lands in some other way. (Not even Bill
Gates has a CD-R manufacturing plant in his house.)

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Figure 1-5 shows how you create a CD — as well as a really bad pun. The
CD-R (short for compact disc-recordable) disc, which can be recorded once,
uses a layer of green or blue reactive dye under a smooth reflective surface
of either aluminum or gold. The groove is still there, but until the disc has
been recorded, the groove is empty. This dye permanently melts or darkens
when hit by a laser beam of a certain frequency; this melting (or darkening)
results in a pit.
So, you say, “Hang on, Mark — wouldn’t the beam from my regular read-only
CD-ROM drive cause problems?” That’s a good question, but the designers
of recordable CD and DVD drives have you covered. The laser beam that is
used to read a CD is far less powerful than the beam used to record one.
Therefore, when the beam from the laser in your CD-ROM drive hits one of
these dark spots, the beam isn’t reflected — instead, the beam is “swal-
lowed” like an apple pie at a state fair, so the dark spot acts just like a pit in
a mass-produced CD. In fact, your CD-ROM drive can’t tell the difference.
The inside of your CD or DVD recorder sounds like it’s getting a little
crowded with all these different laser beams, but it’s really not. A recorder
has a beam that can be set at two levels: a lower power setting that can read
a disc and a higher setting to record it. Slick, eh?
A CD-RW (which is short for compact disc-rewritable) disc is another story.
(Get ready: You’re going to love this description. It honestly sounds like
something out of Star Trek — the original series, not any of those later fail-
ures that don’t have Captain Kirk.) Here goes: A CD-RW disc uses a “phase-
change recording process” using a “crystalline layer with amorphous
properties” rather than a dye layer. Didn’t I tell you? It sounds like some-
thing Spock would say! You can promptly forget that stuff because nobody
cares and no one gives a test afterward.

Why all the different colors?
I get asked this question all the time. Some CD-R
discs are gold with a green dye, and others are
silver with a blue dye. Everything acts the same:
You’re just looking at two different recipes for the
dye that’s used by different manufacturers. Most
drives record on either type of disc, but in rare sit-
uations, an older drive seems to work better with
one or the other color combination. Personally,
I think that it has something to do with the align-
ment of the planets and the phase of the moon, but
I must report what I hear.
On the other hand, CD-RW discs and DVDs all use
the same type of dye, so they’re all colored the same.

Behind the Curtain: Inside CD-RW and DVD Drives
Anyway, although the crystalline layer starts out clear, the correct type of
laser beam can change it to opaque, creating — you guessed it — a pit.
When you’re ready to erase the disk, that same beam of laser light “resets”
the crystalline layer to clear again, and you’re ready to record all over
again. Talk about recycling!
Behind the Curtain: Inside CD-RW and DVD Drives
Before I delve into the depths of your CD hardware, I want to make one
thing perfectly clear: You do not have to read this section! In fact, if raising
the hood on your car and just looking at the engine gives you a headache, I
encourage you to skip this section. It’s definitely not necessary to know
what makes your drive tick.
Still here? I didn’t scare you away? Good! If you’re like I am, and cool
machinery like your recorder fascinates you, stick with me and read on! In
this section, I show you the guts of your CD-RW (or DVD) recorder.
The motor
Because pits are arranged around the entire disc, something has to turn
that CD — in this case, an efficient, high-speed electric motor. (No coal or
gas here, Bucko.) The motor turns a spindle, which holds the disc by the
hole in the center — yet another similarity to vinyl record albums!
The laser stuff
A read-only CD or DVD drive has a laser read head, and your recorder also
has one laser head — remember, it can be toggled to two different power
levels. When you read a disc, the laser beam is focused through a lens
upward toward the surface of the disc; if the beam is reflected by a land, the
light travels through a prism to an optical pickup. In turn, the pickup yells
to your computer — in effect — “Hey, I just passed a land back there, so
add a 1 to the file.”
When the power’s cranked up, it’s time to burn, baby, burn. As I mention in
the section “It’s All in the Dye,” earlier in this chapter, the higher-power
laser beam travels up to the surface of the disc and creates a pit by discol-
oring or melting the dye layer in one tiny spot.
How does the laser head get around the entire surface of the disc? It’s on a
track that can move forward and back between the center and outside edge
of the disc.
The tray
The tray is self explanatory but still pretty doggone important: You need
some method of inserting and ejecting discs. Although most drives use a
tray that extends to hold the disc, some integrated CD-RW and DVD drives
use a slot with a motor-loading system that draws the disc inside the drive
(just like a car audio CD player). Older drives used a thin plastic box called
739

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
a caddy — you opened the caddy and stuck the disc inside. Although you
would be hard pressed to find a new CD-RW recorder that uses a caddy,
some high-capacity DVD-RAM recorders still use them to help protect the
disc.
The controls
Your recorder is certain to have an Eject button. It probably also has a
headphone jack and a volume control for listening to audio CDs. More
expensive drives can go a step further with more audio CD controls, like
Pause, Play, Next Track, and Previous Track.
The emergency hole
I know that it sounds weird, but every drive has an emergency disc-eject
hole. Think of it as being similar to the ejection seat in a jet fighter plane
or one of those cool emergency airlock controls that crops up in every
science-fiction horror movie. (How many times now has Sigourney Weaver
blasted something nasty into space by slapping a button?) You can use
this microscopic hole on the front of your drive to manually eject a disc
whenever your drive has locked up or if a disc is caught inside. To use the
emergency-eject hole, push the end of a paper clip or a piece of stiff wire
into the hole to eject the disc. This technique usually works even when
no power is applied to the drive.
Love Those Discs: CD-R, CD-R/W, DVD-R/W,
DVD+R/W, and DVD-RAM
If you’ve been reading this chapter at a single sitting, you may have a media-
induced headache by now. No, I’m not talking about the nightly TV news — I
mean the four different kinds of discs that I mention from time to time in
this chapter. It’s high time that I identify each of the different types and
fill in all the details. This section does just that.
“Hey, can’t I buy just one drive?”
Yes, you certainly can. (And I encourage you to do it.) A dual-format DVD
recorder can read and write CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and
DVD+RW discs. Now you know why people get splitting headaches when
buying a DVD recorder, and why dual-format drives are so popular now:
They burn anything that you can load in them (except for DVD-RAM discs,
which can be used only in a DVD-RAM drive).
You’ll often see kindred write-once and rewritable formats grouped together
as a single name: For example, CD-R/W actually stands for CD-R and CD-RW.
(Remember, a CD-RW drive can also record CD-Rs.) Likewise, DVD-R/W
stands for DVD-R and DVD-RW, and — you guessed it — DVD+R/W includes
both DVD+R and DVD+RW.
Unfortunately, if you’re already the proud owner of a CD-RW drive, I can
assure you that it can’t be upgraded to record DVDs.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Optical Storage (Or It’s
All in the Pits)
Love Those Discs: CD-R, CD-R/W, DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, and DVD-RAM
First on the block: CD-R
In the beginning, there was the CD-R disc, and it’s still by far the most popu-
lar media on the market. A typical CD-R disc can store from 650MB to 700MB
of computer data, or 74 to 80 minutes of audio. (The higher numbers are for
higher-capacity, 80-minute CD-R discs.) You can also stack more stuff on a
CD-R disc using the overburning feature; read more on this rather nasty-
sounding feature in Book IV, Chapter 2. As I mention in the section “It’s All in
the Dye,” earlier in this chapter, after you’ve filled a CD-R to capacity, there’s
no turning back; the data is permanently recorded and can’t be erased.
Other sizes of CDs are indeed available — for example, discs with a diame-
ter of 8 centimeters that can hold 184MB — but they’re typically used only
in digital cameras and MP3 players.
CD-R discs are the most compatible optical media. Any CD-ROM drive — no
matter how old — can read CD-R discs, and they are the only discs that can
play in your home or car audio CD player. It’s time for the first Mark’s Maxim
for Book IV:
If you need complete compatibility, think CD-R.
In other words, use a CD-R disc in the following situations:
✦When you’re recording a disc to send to someone else
✦When you’re recording an audio CD for playing on anything other than
your recorder
✦When you’re not sure whether a drive reads a CD-RW disc
Reusable and loving it: CD-RW
The CD-RW disc is currently the most common rewritable media on the
market. It can store 650MB or 74 minutes of audio. A CD-RW disc must be
formatted before you use it, just like a floppy disk or your hard drive; most
discs come preformatted from the manufacturer. You also have to reformat
the disc if you want to erase its contents.
Did you read about the amorphous crystalline stuff that I mention in the
section “It’s All in the Dye,” earlier in this chapter? On the positive side, that’s
what allows your CD-RW drive to erase the disc and use it again. On the
downside, however, most CD-ROM drives that are more than 4 or 5 years
old can’t read a CD-RW disc, and a CD-RW disc can’t be used in older audio
CD players. (Check the manual for your audio CD player to see whether it
can read CD-RW discs.) Use CD-RW discs in the following situations:
✦When you’re recording a disc for use on your computer, such as for a
backup
✦When you’re sure that another CD-ROM drive can read a CD-RW disc
How can you tell whether a CD-ROM drive can read CD-RW discs? Many
manufacturers add a MultiRead symbol to their faceplates. If you’re still
unsure, try reading a recorded CD-RW disc in the drive (don’t worry — you
can’t hurt the hardware). If you can load files from the CD-RW disc, you have
a MultiRead drive.
741

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Ready for stardom: DVD-R/W
Perhaps I shouldn’t say “ready for stardom” — heck, in the video world, the
DVD-ROM disc is already quickly overtaking the traditional VHS tape. (I
don’t suppose that makes Betamax VCR owners feel any better, but every
dog has his day.) The DVD-ROM disc is also poised to take over the reign of
CD as the media of choice for virtually every new computer on the planet.
But what about recordable DVDs?
Unfortunately, things are still a little tenuous in the world of recordable DVD
standards. Luckily, the two competing formats correspond pretty closely to
the world of recordable CDs, so most of this will sound very familiar.
The first of these standards is DVD-R, which is short for — you guessed it —
DVD-recordable. (Note the dash before the R; it becomes pretty important in
a page or two.) Like your old friend the CD-R disc, a DVD-R disc can be
recorded only once. However, the DVD-R can hold a whopping 4.7GB (that’s
gigabytes, friends and neighbors) per side of the disc, for a total of 9.4GB of
data on a double-sided disc. DVD-R is the darling of the video-editing crowd,
because it allows you to record a disc that can be used in a standard DVD
player. Naturally, the DVDs that you create with a DVD-R drive can’t be read
on a standard CD-ROM drive (but you can burn regular CD-R and CD-RW
discs).
On the rewritable side, the DVD-R disc format is called DVD-RW. These discs
can also store 4.7GB, and you format them much like you format a CD-RW
disc. Any DVD-ROM drive should be able to read a DVD-RW disc.
Unfortunately, not all DVD players can read DVD-RWs, so if you’re an up-
and-coming Hollywood type that’s interested in producing your own movie
discs, you should stick with the DVD-R standard (which is compatible with
all DVD players).
Oh joy, what confusion: DVD+R/W
Okay, here’s where things gets a little hairy. No, that plus sign isn’t a typo:
The other independent DVD standard, DVD+R/W, is widely available as well.
This more recent format is being touted by an entirely different group of
computer hardware manufacturers. (I suppose that they needed different
names — but couldn’t they have chosen something easier to remember?
Whatever happened to the guy who chose the name Microsoft Bob for an
operating system? By the way, I still have my copy.)
Anyway, DVD+R discs and DVD+RW discs can store 4.7GB, and a DVD-ROM
player can read both types of discs. Again, however, you run into the same
problem — DVD+R discs are compatible with most DVD players, but
DVD+RW discs aren’t widely supported by DVD players. Plus, DVD-R/W and
DVD+R/W are incompatible. (Insert sound of my hand slapping my forehead
here.)
In fact, these two disc formats are roughly equivalent — DVD+R/W discs are
cheaper to manufacture, though, and DVD+R/W recorders are significantly
faster, so the DVD+R/W format may eventually get the nod. (Of course, if
you buy a dual-format drive like mine, you don’t really give a darn about
that plus or minus sign. I can record both DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W discs,
smiling quietly to myself all the while.)

Chapter 1
Optical Storage (Or It’s
All in the Pits)
What’s Wrong with Tape, Disks, and Removable Media?
If your DVD recorder is limited to one format or the other, take care when
you’re buying DVD media! Make doggone sure that you remember which
type of discs your recorder can burn — you’ll be deluged by the choices on
store shelves, and it’s easy to mistake DVD-R discs for DVD+R discs if you’re
not careful. (Some readers have told me that they are considering getting a
tattoo to help them keep things straight.)
The rewritable warehouse: DVD-RAM
Finally, you have good old DVD-RAM — a rewritable disc that can store as
much as 9.4GB of data by using both sides. (Remember, a double-sided DVD
doesn’t have a standard label; printing can appear only around the spindle
hole.)
DVD-RAM is well established, and no “plus” format is competing for fame
and fortune. DVD-RAM is a great option for storing those huge digital video
files, and because DVD-RAM discs are reusable, I find them to be the best
media for backing up my hard drives. Note, however, that most DVD-ROM
players can’t read DVD-RAM discs, so use one of the other DVD formats if
you’re recording something to distribute to others.
What’s Wrong with Tape, Disks, and Removable Media?
Nothing, really! It’s just that they’re antique technologies compared to
rewritable CDs and DVDs. In this section, I list the most important reasons
that optical beats magnetic hands down.
I strongly recommend that you never keep any data of value stored exclu-
sively on floppy disks! They are the most unreliable media on the planet —
they’re easily demagnetized, they don’t hold much, and they often can’t be
read by other computers.
More reliable
First (and to many folks, most importantly), a CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW,
or DVD-RAM disc provides permanent storage with a high degree of relia-
bility. Unlike magnetic media — including tape cartridges, floppy disks,
and even Zip disks and hard drives — a CD or DVD doesn’t stretch or
demagnetize. As long as you keep your discs clean, reasonably cool, and
free from scratches, you should be able to read them without error for a
century or more. (I don’t know about you, but my tax returns just won’t be
that important in 100 years. Then again, I want my priceless family photo-
graphs to last as long as possible!) A disc has no moving parts to wear out,
and it can’t rust.
Higher capacity
Forget about storing 700MB of data on a floppy disk! Even the latest Zip
disks are simply no match for the 9.4GB capacity of a double-sided DVD-
RAM disc. All that room comes in handy for backing up your system’s hard
drive, too.
743

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Cheaper
Have you priced a stack of 50 blank, 700MB CD-R discs recently? At the time
I wrote this book, I could find that 50-pack all over the Internet at $15; a 50-
pack of 650MB CD-RW discs is about $30. DVD-RAM prices are hovering
around $15 for a 9.4GB disc, and 50-packs of 4.7GB DVD-R and DVD+R discs
are selling for about $35.
As you can imagine, the lower the cost per megabyte for a storage method,
the better, and no other type of media can beat recordable CDs and DVDs.
And, if the current trend continues, prices will continue to drop. Ain’t life
grand?
Faster and more convenient
If you’ve ever waited for a tape to rewind or a floppy disk to load, you’ve
wished for a faster method of loading your stuff — CDs and DVDs feature
fast access time, and there’s no rewinding. To put it another way, even if
something did fit in the tight space of a floppy disk, would you want to run
that program from that floppy? Unlike tape drives — which must move lin-
early from one section of the tape to another — you can jump directly from
one part of a disc to another instantly. Take my word for it, it makes restor-
ing files from a backup much faster!
Compatibility
Virtually every PC that’s still running these days has a CD-ROM drive, so
compatibility is a big advantage to recordable CDs for folks like software
developers, network administrators, and your Uncle Milton. To put it another
way: Ever tried to stick a Zip disk into your car audio player? ’Nuff said.
What Do I Need in Order to Record?
You knew that there would be a catch, didn’t you? You’re probably thinking,
“I bet that I have to have a $1,000 software program and a cutting-edge com-
puter to record discs.” Not true, good reader, not true! It used to be that
way in the ancient mid-1990s, but CD and DVD recorders are now tame and
lovable creatures. They ask for only the basics — in fact, if your computer
came with a CD-RW drive already installed, you can skip this section,
because you’re likely to have everything you need.
What you need for Windows
The basic minimum requirements for CD and DVD recording on a PC that’s
running Windows 98 or Me are as follows:
✦A Pentium II PC (or better): You need at least 64MB RAM and 1GB of
free hard drive space (for a CD recorder). If you’re recording DVDs, you
need up to 6GB of free space.
✦A CD or DVD recorder: Of course, you also need the proper connection.
Internal recorders use Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) or
744

Book IV
Chapter 1
Optical Storage (Or It’s

What Kind of Discs Can I Record?
Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) connections. External recorders
can use SCSI, Universal Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire connections. If
you’re using an external drive, it should come with the cables that you
need.
✦Recording software: Most recorders come bundled with some sort of
software. If your computer already has a recorder, it probably also came
with the programs that you need to burn your discs.
✦Blank media: Naturally.
The basic minimum requirements for CD and DVD recording on a PC that’s
running Windows 2000 or XP are as follows:
✦A Pentium III PC (or better): You need at least 128MB RAM and 1GB of
free hard drive space (for a CD recorder) or up to 6GB of free space (for
a DVD recorder).
✦A CD or DVD recorder: Again, your internal choices are EIDE and SCSI,
while external recorders can use SCSI, USB, or FireWire connections.
✦Recording software: Whether your software is bundled with your drive
or provided with your computer, you’ll need a program to burn.
✦Blank media: You can’t burn without the raw material.
What you need for the Macintosh
The basic minimum requirements for CD and DVD recording on a Macintosh
that’s running Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X are as follows:
✦A PowerPC Mac of any speed with at least 64MB RAM and 1GB of free
hard drive space: You need up to 6GB of free space if you’re recording
DVDs.
✦A CD or DVD recorder: Most Macs come with internal CD-RW or 
DVD-RW drives, but you can also use external recorders with SCSI,
USB, or FireWire connections.
✦Recording software: Mac OS X allows you to burn discs from the Finder
menu, and you can burn discs from within iTunes as well. Other com-
mercial recording programs are available, like Toast from Roxio.
✦Blank media: Gotta have it.
If all this talk of connections is making you nervous, don’t worry: It’s all cov-
ered in rich detail in Chapters 2 and 3 of Book IV, including what you need
to know before you buy and install a drive.
What Kind of Discs Can I Record?
This question is the easiest of all to answer: Everything! If you can use it on
a computer, listen to it in your stereo’s CD player, or watch it on your DVD
player, you can record it using either a CD or DVD recorder.
745

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Later in this book, I take you step by step through the creation of different
types of discs; for now, this section gives you an overview.
Briefcase backup
Never heard of that term? It’s my own; I always carry a Briefcase backup
when I’m traveling with my laptop. Because my computer has a CD-ROM
drive (and the notoriously small hard drive that’s found on most laptops), I
record on a CD-R disc any files that are specific to my trip. PowerPoint pre-
sentations, Word files, contracts, and digital audio and video — even an
offline copy of my Web site — they all fit on a Briefcase backup. Therefore,
my trip-specific data doesn’t take up space on my laptop’s hard drive, and
it’s protected from damage. Plus, copying any of that data to my client’s
computer is a cinch: No cables or network configuration is required — just
pop in the disc and read the files and programs directly! (My Mom always
said that I had potential.)
Computer files and data of all sorts
If it can be stored on your hard drive, you can store it on a CD or DVD as
well. You can store the following information:
✦Files and programs
✦Digital images
✦Sound clips
✦Web sites
✦Backups
Digital audio
With a CD-RW drive, you can record standard audio CDs for use in any
audio CD player as well as “mixed” CDs, which have both audio and com-
puter data. Plus, you can extract, or rip, tracks from existing audio CDs and
record them on a new disc in any order that you choose.
Digital video
A CD-RW drive can create standard video CDs for your video CD player, and
a DVD-R/W or DVD+R/W drive can create interactive DVDs with your own
digital video.
Network storage
If you have data that is accessed often but never changed on your home
or office network, record that stuff to a CD-R disc and load it in your file
server’s CD-ROM drive. (Getting your network administrator’s help with
this process is a good idea — those folks get very nervous about such
initiatives.) Now you can still access every byte of those files, but you’re
not using precious hard drive space and you don’t have to worry about
backing up that information.

You can use your CD-RW drive or DVD recorder to create slideshow discs
with images from your digital camera or with scanned photographs.
Caring for Your Optical Pets
In the section “What’s Wrong with Tape, Disks, and Removable Media?” ear-
lier in this chapter, I tell you how CDs and DVDs are nearly perfect storage
media — but notice the word nearly. You have two or three outstanding
methods of ruining a disc. The trick is not to become proficient at any of
them, so in this last section, I cover the best ways to use, clean, and store
your discs.
You gotta grip ’em by the rim!
Let me sound like your mother for a second: Take a good, close look at your
hands! When was the last time you washed them? Reading data from a disc
that’s covered in fingerprints and dust is a touch-and-go process at best,
because the laser beam has to get through all that crud twice (especially on
DVDs, because the data is packed even closer together). Therefore, you
must know how to hold a disc properly.
In my travels, I’ve encountered two methods of comfortably holding a
disc for a decent length of time. You can even jog or tap dance using these
holds — whatever floats your boat. Either hold the disc by the outside edge,
as shown in Figure 1-6, or — if your fingers are small enough — create your
own “spindle” using a convenient finger, as shown in Figure 1-7.
The idea behind these holds is simple: Never touch the underside of a disc,
and never put a disc down on any surface. Flipping a disc over and setting it
label-side down for a second or two is okay, but put the disc back in its case
as soon as possible.

The deadly enemies
To keep your discs safe and avoid skips or data read errors, shelter your
discs from these arch-villains:
✦Pointed objects: Scratches are taboo, and that goes for either side of a
disc.
✦Heat: How would you like to spend a hot summer afternoon in a closed
car, baking on the seat? Underneath that high-tech design, a disc is basi-
cally a circle of plastic. Keep your discs cool and out of direct sunlight.
✦Surface crud: This includes liquids, dust, dirt, and peanut butter.
You may have seen one or more CD laser lens cleaners at your local com-
puter store; they usually look something like a disc with a little hairbrush
mounted on it. Never use one of these cleaners on a CD or DVD recorder
because it can damage the laser! In fact, the laser read and write heads
inside a recorder need no maintenance.
The Disc Hotel
So where should you put all your recorded discs? Stacking them in a big pile
in front of your monitor is one answer, but it’s the wrong answer. Your discs
must be protected from dust and scratches! Of course, storing discs in their
jewel boxes is a good idea — that is, until you have an entire 200-disc stand
filled and the stand takes up an entire corner of your room! Take a tip from
Figure 1-7:
Look, Aunt
Harriet, I’m
a spindle!

me: You can save that space and still provide the protection that your discs
need with a disc binder, as shown in Figure 1-8. A binder has individual
pockets that can hold from 10 to 250 discs, so you can donate your jewel
boxes to your friends.
Sometimes you’ve just gotta wipe
You may say, “I’ve seen an entire shelfful of CD cleaning stuff at the local
GenericMart. Do my discs need cleaning?” If a disc is only dusty, I recom-
mend using a lint-free photographer’s lens cloth, which you can pick up at
any camera shop. You can also pick up a spray bottle of disc-cleaning fluid
for liquid disasters, like those unavoidable soda stains. Other than a cloth
and some fluid, however, you can leave all the expensive James Bond con-
trivances on the shelf at the department store.
To close this chapter on a high note, Figure 1-9 illustrates how to wipe a disc:
Start at the center and wipe straight toward the outside of the disc, making
sure that you apply no more than fingertip pressure. Wiping harder — or
wiping in a circular motion, as shown in Figure 1-10 — can scratch your disc
and invite chaos into its ordered world of 0s and 1s.

espite the rumors that you may have heard, buying a CD or DVD
recorder in the modern world is no longer a dreadful experience (at
least, not with this book by your side). In days past, you would be at the
mercy of that fast-moving predator of the electronics store — the computer
salesperson — who would either turn on the high-pressure hose and sell
you the most expensive drive on the planet or stand motionless with hands
in pockets, oblivious to the answers to any of your questions. I know friends
who still bear the emotional and psychological scars of such an attack.
Today, however, you may never even enter a brick-and-mortar store to buy
your drive. If you’re on the Web, you can choose from literally hundreds of
online stores. You can shop 24 hours a day, at your leisure, and you have all
the time you need to compare features and prices. It’s paradise for those of
us who are ready to purchase online.
If your CD or DVD recorder is already installed and comfortable, you don’t
need this chapter (although you may still want to read it to brush up on
what’s available). If your computer came with a CD-RW, DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W,
or DVD-RAM drive, feel free to skip to Chapter 5 of Book IV. If, on the other
hand, you’re shopping for a CD or DVD recorder, you should devour every
word to come.
In this chapter, I cover everything that you need to know about buying a CD
or DVD drive, including the features that you should covet, the differences
between internal and external drives, the type of connection you need, and
the formats that your drive should record. Take copious notes or just circle
the important stuff directly in this book — whatever floats your boat.
751

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
I also provide you with tips on online shopping, which has both its peaks
and its pitfalls. Finally, I even cover a few pointers on how to face those
sales-sharks head-on at your local store — and win. (As my favorite actor,
Jack Nicholson, croons in the film Batman, “Wait ’til they get a load of me —
ooooOOOOoooop.”)
Enough talk. It’s time to go shopping.
Internal or External: Thinking Outside the Box
Your first choice to make in your trip down Hardware Boulevard is a simple
one, yet it has the most effect on the price and performance of a recorder. If
you’ve never run across these terms, an internal drive lives inside your
computer (just like your floppy drive or your existing CD-ROM and DVD-
ROM drives — the latter two are read-only drives). An external drive sits
outside your computer, using a power cord of its own and a cable of some
sort to connect to your computer’s case (like the Hewlett-Packard external
recorder that’s shown in Figure 2-1).
Stay inside with internal
Why pick an internal drive? Most folks do — and for the following reasons:
✦Convenience: Your drive is built in to your computer, without an extra
power cord to mess with and some sort of connection cable to boot.
✦Speed: Depending on the interface, most internal drives are faster than
their external brethren. (Read more about this party topic in the follow-
ing section.)
✦Cost: An internal drive is usually less expensive than an external unit,
because it’s not carrying around its home like a digital hermit crab.
Breathe the open air with external
For some computers (for example, laptops and the stylish Apple iMac), you
have to choose an external drive because you have literally no room to install

a second internal drive. (I don’t recommend the hacksaw route.) However,
the following are good reasons why an external recorder would appeal to
even the stodgiest PC owner:
✦It saves a bay. To explain, a bay is an internal space inside your PC’s
case where you can add devices. Most desktop PCs have several of
them, but technowizards and power users can easily fill every bay with
other gadgets. Because the case has no room inside, an external drive
suddenly looks sexy and attractive (at least to them).
✦It’s easy to install. Afraid to open your computer’s case? Believe me —
you are not alone, and you have no reason to be embarrassed. Adding
an external drive means that you can leave your desktop alone, and it
may even be easier than installing an internal drive. If you choose a USB
or FireWire drive, for example, the process is as simple as plugging in a
connector and the power cord. (Read more about USB and FireWire in
the next section.)
If you want to conquer your fear of computer hardware and delve inside
your PC’s case, let me recommend another of my books, conveniently
titled Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition (published by Wiley). In
the process of showing you how to build an entire Windows-ready PC
(yes, the whole ball of wax), in this book, I cover the complete process
of adding all sorts of internal hardware, including an internal CD or DVD
recorder.
✦It’s portable. Everyone in the building can share your recorder, perhaps
as a backup device or to carry along with laptops. (By the way, you can
also lock up an external drive to keep it from being carried away, if you
get my drift.)
Here’s the bottom line: Unless your computer simply doesn’t have room or
you don’t want to open it, I recommend saving money and sticking with an
internal recorder.
“Edna, He Says We Need an Interface”
Geez, what a word. It sounds like something you would hear from an
engineer — ack! — but the word interface really has a simple and straight-
forward meaning: It’s the type of connection that you use to unite your com-
puter and your recorder in everlasting friendship (at least until you unplug
the two).
In this section, I help you determine which of these exotic connections is
right for you.
EIDE
The first connection is the most popular for PC and Mac owners around the
world — which, naturally, is why I want to begin with EIDE. Because it’s not a
freedom-loving English word, it must therefore be one of those furshlugginer
acronyms; in this case, EIDE stands for Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics.
753

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Unfortunately, EIDE drives don’t come in external form, so if you need an
external drive, you can skip to the next interface.
Virtually all desktop PCs built today use EIDE hard drives and CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM drives. To handle the workload, your PC likely has both a primary
and secondary EIDE connector. Each of these connectors supports two EIDE
devices, so you have the capacity for a total of four EIDE drives. If you already
have one hard drive and one CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive in your computer,
you’re using only two of those four connections.
EIDE drives are simpler and cheaper to install than SCSI units and are a
good choice for most home PCs.
SCSI
This time, the evil acronym, SCSI, is short for Small Computer System Interface.
SCSI is significantly faster and more efficient than a typical EIDE drive, and a
single SCSI card can connect from 8 to 14 different devices — which is great
if you plan to expand your computer to help NASA with the latest Mars
probe. (Seriously, a real power user can add things like scanners and tape
drives to a SCSI connection.) SCSI drives are available in both internal and
external form. If you have an older Macintosh computer, it likely has an
external SCSI port. (And yes, the term is pronounced “skuzzy.” Those engi-
neers are real comedians, aren’t they?)
Unfortunately, a SCSI drive is harder to configure than an EIDE drive,
because a number of settings have to be made correctly. Also, a SCSI
recorder is usually significantly more expensive than its EIDE counterpart.
SCSI drives are a good choice for the experienced PC or Mac owner who is
willing to spend a little more for better performance and all those extra con-
nections — but be prepared to spend more time configuring and fine-tuning.
USB
At least USB is only three letters long. It stands for Universal Serial Bus, a
connection type that’s used exclusively for external drives. Let me be
honest with you: USB is the best thing to happen to PC and Mac owners
since the invention of canned air. Believe it or not, the same USB drive can
be used by both types of computers, and Figure 2-2 shows how simple it is
to connect.
USB is Plug and Play compatible, which means that you don’t have to reboot
your computer when you connect a USB recorder. Plus, your computer
automatically recognizes that USB drive, so you have nothing to fiddle with
or set. Many USB drives don’t even need a separate power supply.
On the downside, a USB 1.1 connection is much slower than an EIDE or SCSI
connection, so today’s fastest CD and DVD recorders can’t use it. You can’t
burn a DVD using a USB 1.1 connection, and CD burning is limited to 4X or
less. USB drives tend to be somewhat more expensive because USB is an
external-only connection. Finally, most older computers have only two USB
ports, so if you’re already using USB devices, you may need a USB hub; this
little black box converts one of your USB ports into four ports. Sassy!
754

Although USB 1.1 is too slow for today’s recording hardware, I do have some
good news: Luckily, those engineers haven’t been loafing and resting on their
laurels, because the recently introduced USB 2.0 is now quickly becoming
standard equipment on today’s PCs and Macs. USB 2.0 connections are so
speedy that they can easily handle the fastest external CD and DVD recorders
that are available today. Naturally, your computer needs USB 2.0 ports to use
a USB 2.0 drive. As the Mark’s Maxim goes:
Demand USB 2.0 for your external drive . . . and install new ports if
necessary!

Avoid those ancient parallel port drives!
If you’re using an older laptop without USB ports,
you may hear about parallel port drives, which use
the existing parallel printer port that’s found on vir-
tually every PC on the planet. (Macintosh comput-
ers have no parallel port, so this is not an option for
them.)
Visualize a huge, flashing STOP sign: Stay away
from parallel port CD recorders! These ancient
relics are ridiculously slow — think 2X or slower —
and more prone to errors, and they often don’t work
if you’re already using a printer or another external
device, like a Zip drive or a scanner, on your printer
port.
These days, a parallel port CD recorder isn’t even
worth scavenging as a doorstop, so avoid such
drives like the zombies they are. Instead, see
whether your PC can use an adapter to provide a
minimum of USB 1.1 connectivity, with USB 2.0 or
FireWire 400 preferred.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
I heartily recommend USB 2.0 for anyone who wants a typical external CD
or DVD recorder.
FireWire
Imagine a — hey, wait a second, FireWire is not an acronym! Anyway, FireWire
is also fast enough for today’s high-speed drives, and it’s been around longer
than USB 2.0. (Technoheads also call it the IEEE 1394 standard, and you may
see it advertised as such when shopping for digital camcorders.)
FireWire (developed by Apple) has all the advantages of USB, and it also
comes in two flavors: FireWire 400, the original standard, and FireWire 800,
the new standard that is twice as fast and currently available only in the
Mac world. Both types of FireWire connections work great for external CD
and DVD recorders. As an additional bonus, you can use a FireWire 400 port
for connecting many digital cameras, DV camcorders, scanners, and so on.
What’s the catch? Only external drives need apply, and FireWire drives are
typically a little more expensive than a USB 2.0 drive. All current Macintosh
computers now have FireWire built in (naturally), and PC owners can add
FireWire ports by installing an adapter card.
FireWire 400 is the best all-around choice for high-performance external
recorders, because it connects far more devices to your computer. (For
example, FireWire 400 is the bee’s knees for those using digital video
camcorders.)
The X Factor Explained
Of all the gobbledygook associated with buying a CD or DVD recorder, noth-
ing is as foreign to a normal human being — or affects the price of a drive as
much — as the X factor. You encounter these X numbers in every description
of every drive you see, so I cover the X factor thing like a wet blanket (or a
new coat of paint).
In plain English, the X factor is the speed at which a drive can read and
record data. For CD recorders, these speeds are typically expressed as
three numbers, like 40X/12X/48X. The order of the numbers is important
and is as follows:
✦The first number indicates the CD-R recording speed.
✦The second number is the CD-RW recording speed.
✦The last number provides the read-only speed for all pre-recorded discs
(both commercially-manufactured and the discs you’ve recorded).
Therefore, when you apply these conventions to the example, you’re look-
ing at a drive that can record a CD-R at 40X, record a CD-RW at 12X, and
read a CD-ROM or CD-R at 48X speed. Naturally, higher numbers are better,
so follow this general Mark’s Maxim (I really like those):
The faster the X factor, the faster the drive performs at either recording
or reading data.
756

Book IV
Chapter 2
Buying Your

Features on Parade
On the DVD side, you typically only see one X number — that’s the record-
ing speed for the drive. (Of course, because a DVD recorder can also burn
CD-R discs and CD-RW discs, you can see the familiar three-number X-factor
combination in the specs as well.)
Most internal CD drives on the market today record a CD-R disc at 24X speed
or faster, and most external CD drives record at a minimum of 16X speed.
If you’re considering a drive that’s slower than 8X, promise me that you
won’t pay much (if anything) when you buy it. A 2X or 4X recorder is an
antique now — of course, it works fine if your Uncle Milton gives it to you
for free. Scavengers forever!
For those who care about such arcane measurements, the CD recording X
factor is technically a multiplier of the original read-only speed of the first
drives that appeared in the early 1980s. (You can call them 1X drives.)
These drives could send data to a computer at 150 kilobytes per second.
Therefore, a 2X CD-ROM drive can send data to a computer at 300 kilobytes
per second. Read-only drives can now reach blinding transfer rates of 52X,
or 7,800 kilobytes per second. The same holds true for the DVD recording X
factor, which is based on the original 1X DVD recording speed.
The X Factor General Maxim (or, in the acronym-happy world of computers,
the XFGM) that I state earlier in this section seems to recommend that you
shell out every possible penny for the fastest drive around. If you were Bill
Gates, you would be right. However, common folk like you and me have
things called budgets, so buying the fastest sports car of a recorder may not
always be the best road to take. Consider the following examples:
✦If your computer already has a 40X or 48X CD-ROM drive — in the DVD-
ROM world, a 16X drive — you don’t need to spend anything extra for
faster read-only speeds. Play your games and video in the read-only
drive, and choose a lower-priced recorder just for burning discs.
✦If you plan to use your new drive exclusively for recording audio CDs,
why pay extra for a drive that records CD-RWs, DVD-R/Ws, or
DVD+R/Ws faster? A faster rewritable speed is better suited for you if
you plan to use the drive to back up your computer’s hard drive.
✦If you plan to record once or twice a week and you can wait the extra 4–5
minutes per disc, an 8X CD-RW drive works just as well as a 40X drive
that may cost twice as much.
In the end, the drive performance that you should choose depends on how
many discs you record, how fast you want to record them, and how much
you are willing to pay for a faster drive.
Features on Parade
The earlier sections of this chapter cover the three big features: internal
versus external, drive connections, and raw speed figures. Now consider
individual features that add convenience, performance, and (coincidentally)
cost to a drive. The more of these that you can pack into your purchase, the
757

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
happier you will be. Note that I also mention which features are especially
important for certain recording tasks. Believe me — it’s better to discover
that a drive has a tiny recording buffer before you buy it.
Make use of every pit: Overburning
Sounds like you’re making digital toast, doesn’t it? Overburning is a fairly
recent phenomenon in the world of CD recording; it refers to a drive that can
record more than the manufacturer’s stated maximum capacity of a CD-R
disc. For example, a drive that can overburn to 76 minutes can record 76
minutes of music on a standard 74-minute CD-R disc, or you could use the
same drive to store 685MB of data rather than 650MB. The amount that
you can overburn depends on your recorder and the specific brand and
storage capacity of the discs that you’re using. For example, 82-minute
discs with more than 700MB of space are now available (but, as you may
expect, these new discs aren’t compatible with most drives that are more
than 3–4 years old).
Overburning is mucho grande, but you must remember the following
caveats:
✦Most CD-ROM drives made in the past 2–3 years have no trouble reading
overburned discs, although some older drives spit them back out as
unreadable. Therefore, if you distribute your discs, I recommend that
you don’t overburn them.
✦Media manufacturers don’t guarantee their discs past the 74- or 80-
minute rating, so you overburn at your own risk.
How does a drive overburn? It uses the lead-out portion of the disc, which
was not originally intended to store data; in fact, the lead-out area is sup-
posed to indicate to your drive that it has reached the end of the disc. When
you overburn, you’re burning past that point. If your CD-ROM drive doesn’t
care and can read an overburned CD, in effect, you’re storing more in the
same space. Real 8-bit old-timers like myself who used the early Atari and
Commodore computers remember something similar: We used to flip over a
51⁄4-inch single-density disk and use the other side, which you weren’t sup-
posed to do. Shameful, really.
Important: Any CD recorder can use an 80-minute CD-R disc — you’re not
overburning when you put 80 minutes of music or 700MB of data on this kind
of media. Again, however, not every recorder can use these larger-capacity
discs. Check the specifications of any recorder that you’re considering buying
to see whether it can use 80-minute/700MB discs.
Three words: Buffer, buffer, buffer
For today’s faster drives, a large data buffer (also known as an internal RAM
or RAM cache) is indeed an important feature. All recorders have at least
some buffer RAM. This memory stores data that your computer has retrieved
from your hard drive until your recorder is ready for it. Figure 2-3 tells the
tale. The larger the buffer, the more efficient this process becomes, and the
less likely your drive is to return an error and ruin a disc because it ran out
of data to write.
758

Book IV
Chapter 2
Buying Your

Features on Parade
Most modern drives have at least 4MB of buffer memory, and more expen-
sive drives can have 8MB or even 16MB. When comparing drives, always
choose a model with a larger buffer.
The ultimate safety net: Burnproof recording
Consider now the hottest-burning feature (horrible pun intended) to come
along in several years. Burnproof recorders effectively end problems that
folks generally had when they were doing any of the following things:
✦Recording on slower PCs
✦Recording in the background under Windows or the Mac operating
system (for example, using Word, Photoshop CS, or Internet Explorer
while recording)
✦Recording at high speeds (12X or faster)
Before the arrival of burnproof drives 3–4 years ago, engaging in one of
these activities was risky business indeed. As you may have read in earlier
sections in this chapter, a recorder had to have a constant flow of data to
prevent buffer underrun errors. Any interruption or hiccup in the transfer
of data from the computer’s hard drive to the recorder was usually disas-
trous. A larger buffer helped, but that still didn’t solve the problem entirely,
and your recorder certainly couldn’t stop in the middle of a disc — it was
now or never.
If your CD-RW drive doesn’t support burnproof recording, you should be
happy to know that I devote Chapter 6 of Book IV to helping you optimize
your computer and recorder to prevent buffer underrun errors. Virtually all
DVD recorders support burnproof recording, so fear not.
Burnproof recording eliminates the potential for data errors by interrupting
the recording process. The drive monitors the buffer, and when things look
dangerous (for example, if you are running Adobe Photoshop CS, which is a
notorious disk and memory hog), the recorder takes note of the position of
the laser and stops recording. After the buffer has been refilled (which can
take a few seconds), the laser write head is automatically repositioned at
the point where the recording was interrupted and the recording process
continues.
I can’t stress how revolutionary burnproof recording is. If you can afford
this feature (which is now available on virtually all CD and DVD recorders),
by all means, get it.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Disc-at-Once: Funny name, important feature
Here’s a strong recommendation: I wouldn’t buy a drive that doesn’t offer
Disc-at-Once (also called DAO) recording. (Is that a definite enough recom-
mendation?) Rather than record digital audio or computer data as individ-
ual tracks, Disc-at-Once records the entire disc at one time. (You find out all
about this subject in Book IV, Chapter 7). Suffice it to say that the audio CDs
that you record sound better on some audio CD players, and you can get
more music on a single disc if you use Disc-at-Once technology. Again, check
a drive’s specifications to see whether it offers Disc-at-Once recording.
Sorry, but It’s Time to Talk CD and DVD Formats
Formats are tricky things. Any CD-RW drive can create a simple audio CD
(which, by definition, conforms to an international set of format stan-
dards called the Red Book) or a simple data CD with files on it (which
uses the Yellow and Orange Book standards). You don’t have to worry
about these basic functions; for a CD or DVD recorder, they’re like walking
and chewing gum.
However, you never know when you may suddenly find yourself needing a
Video CD or a CD Extra disc, and if your drive doesn’t support them, it can
never record those discs. You can’t add formats to your drive after you’ve
bought it.
Therefore, this section has two goals: First, I introduce you to each format,
and then I help you determine which one you are likely to need later. Here’s
another Mark’s Maxim to chew on:
Cast your purchasing eye on the drive that can write the largest number
of formats.
UDF/packet writing
If you skipped my discussion of burnproof recording earlier in this chapter,
flip back to the section “The ultimate safety net: Burnproof recording” and
read it. I’ll wait for you here.
Anyway, packet writing (or, as the format is officially named, UDF) is almost
as cool as burnproof recording: It allows you to write files to a CD or DVD
just as you would write files to your hard drive, using Windows Explorer,
the Mac OS Finder, or any of your other applications. You can add files one
at a time or in groups, without having to record the entire disc at one sit-
ting. In effect, packet writing turns your drive into a gigantic, superfast
floppy drive that can store more than 600MB (or a whopping 4.6GB).
You can also “erase” data from a disc. Yes, I tell you in Chapter 1 of Book IV
that you can’t erase data from a CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R disc, but I’m
stretching the truth a bit. Rather than being physically removed from the
disc, the data that you’re erasing is being rendered unreadable, so it simply
can’t be retrieved. The data is still there — you just can’t access it.
Again, it’s time to be blunt: Virtually all modern CD and DVD drives now
support the UDF standard, and I wouldn’t buy one if it didn’t.
760

Book IV
Chapter 2
Buying Your
Recording Beast
Sorry, but It’s Time to Talk CD and DVD Formats
Video CD
Although DVD-R and DVD+R are the unequivocal kings of digital video
recording, those of you with lowly CD-RW drives can produce your own
brand of visual magic: A drive that records in Video CD format can create
discs for a Video CD player (and most DVD players can read them, too).
Most CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives can now also read Video CDs — all you
need is the right software. I use Windows Media Player.
With a Video CD, you have many of the same features that you would find in
a DVD player, including an interactive menu for selecting video clips and
freeze-frame or slow-motion effects.
CD Extra
Another new format is CD Extra, which allows you to record a disc with a
mixture of audio and data tracks. Why create a mutant disc like this? Most
modern computers have high-fidelity audio systems, so many musicians are
using CD Extra to add a music video, song lyrics, and other multimedia
material to their audio CDs. (Remember that the disc can also be played on
your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.) For example, two of my
favorite bands — the Squirrel Nut Zippers and the Rolling Stones — have
turned out CD Extra discs in the past.
A CD Extra disc doesn’t overlook the folks who just want to listen to the
disc in an audio CD player. The audio track on a CD Extra disc is recorded
first, so it’s compatible with any audio CD player — in fact, the player doesn’t
know the difference. The only restriction, naturally, is the amount of audio
that you can record on a CD Extra disc: Because you’re adding data as well,
you don’t get a full 74 or 80 minutes of audio elbowroom.
761
Digging deep for specifications
I admit that I’m letting loose a landslide of features
and formats in this chapter, but I have a reason:
I don’t know how you will use your drive, so I can’t
tell you what features and formats are most impor-
tant for you. Instead, I explain all the relevant stuff,
and you can pick and choose what’s necessary for
your Dream Drive.
Unfortunately, the Feature Fairy doesn’t drop in to
tell you what formats and features are supported
by a drive, or what software ships with it. To buy the
best drive, you have to roll up your sleeves and do
the research. First, visit the manufacturer’s Web
site and look for that all-important specification
sheet. (This is also a good time to check on the
quality of the manufacturer’s support, like driver
updates, firmware upgrades, and FAQ files.) In
many cases, the specification list should tell you
everything you need to know.
Next, try visiting www.buy.com
or www.
pricewatch.com, where product features can
be compared side by side among different drives.
These sites are great for asking questions like
“Which 12X CD-RW drives are under $300 and have
burnproof recording?”
If you have an Internet connection and you’re
familiar with newsgroups, I recommend comp.
publish.cdrom.hardware and alt.comp.
hardware. Someone in one of these groups may
know the features of a particular drive (although
you may get opinions mixed in liberally with your
answers).
Most computer magazines have online Web edi-
tions, and they often cover CD and DVD recorders
with hardware comparisons and performance eval-
uations. Finally, use a search engine, such as
www.google.com, to locate information about a
specific make and model of drive; you may be sur-
prised at what turns up.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Multisession/CD-ROM XA
I can’t discuss CD-ROM XA format without first introducing you to the idea
of a session, so here goes: In effect, a session is a self-contained dataset that
is recorded on a disc. In English, think of it as a single track on an audio CD.
You can store multiple tracks on one disc and access each of them individu-
ally as you like. As an example, think of one year’s tax returns recorded in
one session, followed by the next year’s returns in the next session; it’s a
way to update the existing data on a CD without losing the old data. Each of
the sessions on a multisession-mode CD-ROM XA disc can be read, but only
one at a time.
CD-ROM XA isn’t nearly as popular as it once was because of the following
gotchas:
✦Not all CD-ROM drives can read CD-ROM XA. Truly antique CD-ROM
drives may be able to read only the last session that was recorded or
may not even be able to read the disc.
✦Software is required to change sessions. Some sort of session-selection
program or function is necessary; it comes with most CD recording pro-
grams. But if you’re sending a disc to someone else and that person
doesn’t have the session-changing software (or a CD or DVD recorder),
she’s out of luck.
✦Packet writing is better. The availability of the UDF standard on most
drives has made multisession recording as outmoded as the Model T.
Packet writing is far easier than recording multiple sessions.
Software You Just Gotta Have
I really shouldn’t say that: Of course, the software that you receive with
your recorder isn’t as important as the hardware itself. After all, you can
always add software later or upgrade what you have. Hardware is, well,
hard. Other than a firmware upgrade, your drive’s features and performance
are fixed, so the software should take a back seat (not too far back, though).
One drive that you’re considering may have a much better selection of soft-
ware than another. If the two drives’ prices, features, and speeds are similar,
a superior software selection can tip the scales. However, every CD
recorder that you consider should ship with basic recording software that
does the following:
✦Allows you to burn discs in all supported formats
✦Erases and formats CD-RW discs
✦Tests for proper installation and configuration of your drive
My favorite recording software is Easy Media Creator, from Roxio, and I
use it throughout much of this mini-book. I’m also fond of Nero Burning
ROM, from Ahead Software (visit www.nero.com and see Figure 2-4), and
the great shareware program CDRWIN, from Golden Hawk Software (visit

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
After you’ve taken care of the basics, you find that some drives offer addi-
tional software that can save you money and — as the marketing types
would say — “enhances your recording experience.” (In other words, the
more of this nifty software you get, the better off you are.) I cover this extra
stuff in the following three sections.
A sharp-dressed disc
Can you imagine Fred Astaire in a leisure suit? No way! The tuxedo was
practically made for him. Many people feel the same way about the discs
that they record: They want those discs to look as professional as possible.
One way to do this is to spend anywhere from $500 to a couple thousand
dollars on a disc label screen printer. If you would rather save the cash and
put your ink-jet printer to work, the following programs can spruce up the
appearance of a CD or DVD:
✦Label-printing software: Print labels with everything from simple text
to line art or full-color photographs. Labels are particularly nice for
audio CDs.
✦Jewel box-printing software: You can print custom front and back
inserts for a disc’s jewel box (that plastic whatchamacallit that stores
the disc) or DVD snap-case. I think that it completes the look of a
recorded disc. Again, audio CDs benefit from track listings, and com-
puter discs can use the space for file descriptions or installation
instructions.
Slick recording add-ons
As I mention in the section “Sorry, but It’s Time to Talk CD and DVD
Formats,” earlier in this chapter, any self-respecting recording program
should be able to take care of basic recording tasks all by itself, although
separate add-on programs can take care of specialized recording jobs.
Consider the following add-ons:
✦Packet-writing software: Why run that big, stodgy recording program
each time you want to write a UDF disc? With this thought in mind, most
software developers spin off packet writing into a separate program that
can run in the background under Windows or the Mac operating system.
The perfect example is Drag-to-Disc, from Roxio: It runs automatically
when you start your PC and doesn’t require you to run Easy Media
Creator first. (Read more about this program in Book IV, Chapter 10.)
✦Backup and disaster-recovery software: Call these programs digital
peace of mind — use your CD-RW drive to back up either part or all of
your system, and you can rest easy at night. I use Retrospect, from
Dantz Development (see Figure 2-6), which can even format your
rewritable media for you. 
I’ve said it before in most of my books, and I say it again (this time as the
King of All Maxims):
If you value your data, back it up.

Are you already using a backup program with a tape drive or Zip disks? If
so, check to see whether it already supports the use of a rewritable CD or
DVD drive. If so, you can keep original backup sets, avoiding a hole in your
backup schedule while you switch to the optical world.
Tools to organize and play your stuff
I go into the organization of your recording projects in complete detail in
Chapter 7 of Book IV. For now, suffice it to say that some of the following
programs make finding stuff on your finished discs easier, and other soft-
ware is required to play the digital video and audio that you’ve recorded:
✦Image- and video-editing software: Many drives are bundled with an
image editor for digital photographs and a simple video editor for chop-
ping Uncle Milton out of this year’s Christmas video. This feature makes
sense because the majority of recorder owners probably burn digital
images and video all the time.
✦Multimedia filing software: Think of these programs as organizers for
your audio, video, and images. The programs can help you locate and
retrieve a single clip or image for your next presentation or Office docu-
ment from thousands that are stored on a single disc. Plus, you can play
or view those images from within the program to make sure that you’ve
found the right one. My favorite multimedia filing program is Media
Center Plus, from Jasc Software, as shown in Figure 2-7. (Roxio’s Easy
Media Creator now comes with its own multimedia organization tool,
called Media Manager.)
✦Audio CD/MP3/WAV player: If you don’t get an audio media player with
your recorder, you will need one eventually. My favorite is Winamp (see
Figure 2-8), from Nullsoft, Inc., which can handle almost anything you
encounter: audio in MP3 format, audio CDs themselves, Windows WAV
files, and Macintosh AIFF files. Plus, it marks you as being technokeen.
You can find Winamp at www.winamp.com.
✦Video CD/MPEG player: The counterpart to your audio media player, a
video player is a welcome addition to any recorder’s software bundle. My
favorite is PowerDVD from CyberLink, which can play Video CDs on any
CD-ROM drive. If you have a DVD-ROM or DVD-R drive, PowerDVD can

Scavenging Fossilized CD and DVD Drives
Scavenging Fossilized CD and DVD Drives
The vulture may not be the prettiest scavenger on the planet, but it gets the
job done. In the world of computer hardware, a scavenged component can
often bring you and your computer a world of new possibilities, for little or
no cost. This is a good thing, and I’m proud to say that I’ve been scavenging
for many years.
Fate can present a number of different ways to acquire a used recorder: You
may inherit one from a family member or friend who is upgrading, or you
may stumble across one at a garage sale. The most popular place to find a
used drive, however, is probably one of the online auction centers; eBay is
the prime location (www.eBay.com). If you’re looking for a used drive, keep
the following recommendations in mind:
✦Don’t settle for less than 8X speed for a CD-RW drive. Unless someone
flat out gives you a 2X drive for free, ignore the deal and move on. These
drives are just too slow, and any drive with such poor performance
probably doesn’t have features like burnproof recording, Disc-at-Once
recording or a decent-size buffer. (Any DVD recorder is still worth scav-
enging if it’s free, no matter what the speed!)
✦Get those drivers. Nothing is quite as frustrating as searching the world
over for CD recorder device drivers, especially when the drive is 5 years
old or older. If you’re running Windows 98 or later, the process is easier
because the operating system comes with a host of drivers built in. The

767

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
moral? Whenever possible, get the original software and manual for a
drive, and check the manufacturer’s Web site to see whether you can
still find software and support.
✦Buy from recognized sellers. The seller feedback ratings on eBay make
it easy to see who has a good track record, so use these ratings. If a
seller has a feedback rating of less than 5 or has a number of negative
feedback entries, be wary. Don’t be shy about asking questions through
e-mail, and keep an eye out for exorbitant handling charges. (I do lots of
selling on eBay myself, and I’ve never charged someone for the over-
whelmingly difficult act of slipping something into an envelope or pack-
ing it in a box.)
✦Consider new versus used. Finally, consider the current prices for a
new drive: At the time this book was written, I could pick up a
40X/12X/48X CD-RW drive for less than $50. Before you spend more than
$25 on a used drive, make sure that you’re really getting a bargain.
Buying Your Drive at the Maze o’ Wires Mall
Let me set one thing straight: You should feel no shame in buying locally. In
the following section, I harp away on the advantages of buying online, and I
admit that I buy most of my hardware on the Web these days. However,
where you buy your drive is your business, and I don’t try to push you into
shoving dollars through your modem.
Besides the help from a salesperson (hopefully one who really knows the
ins and outs of recording), a local store offers three things that no Web
store can ever match: immediate delivery, hands-on shopping, and a fast,
friendly return policy. (No matter how good Internet Explorer becomes, you
can’t use your mouse to open a box that’s 2,000 miles away.) No waiting is
involved to either receive your drive or to bring it back if you find that
you’re the proud owner of a lemon.
Watch out, however, for pressure tactics from a sales thug. Ask plenty of
questions, request a demo, and bring along a knowledgeable friend to help
you shop. Check out several stores before settling on a drive.
Considering buying returned (or refurbished) hardware? Have the salesper-
son connect the drive and give it a thorough check before you take it home.
Also, don’t forget to ask what kind of warranty you receive on your purchase.
Your drive costs you more, and you pay local sales tax, but if you’re nerv-
ous about buying online or you want to install that drive tonight, jump in
the car and head to your local computer marketplace.
Buying Your Drive on That Web Thing
“Okay, I need to save money, and I’ve got a credit card — plus, it’s hurricane
season, I have nothing clean to wear, and my favorite episode of My Three
Sons is starting in 5 minutes. Can I buy a drive online?” Indeed, you can — in
fact, in a situation like that, it’s sheer madness to buy locally.
768

Book IV
Chapter 2
Buying Your
Recording Beast
Buying Your Drive on That Web Thing
It really does take only 5 minutes to buy your recorder on the Web (after,
of course, you’ve done your thorough research). The Web offers the widest
selection of drives at the lowest prices, and you can use sites like www.
pricewatch.com to search for the best deal. Depending on the state that
you’re in (pun not intended that time), you may be exempt from local sales
taxes, too.
Why pay for next-day or second-day shipping if you’re not itching for the
fastest delivery? Many sites select next-day shipping as a default option,
and you’re stuck paying twice or three times the cost of 5-day shipping.
Don’t fall for this old trick: Choose the shipping option that suits your
pocketbook.
One final word about ordering on the Web: Most mail-order companies
charge a virtual arm and a leg for restocking your drive if you decide
to return it. Make sure that you’re not charged if you have to return a
defective recorder.
769
No lock, no sale
If you’re ready to buy a recorder online and the
Web store doesn’t offer a secure connection, tell
’em to take a hike. A secure connection is
encrypted to protect your credit card number and
personal information, which makes it challenging
for the online criminal element to intercept your
data as it’s sent to the Web site.
If you’re using Internet Explorer or Netscape
Navigator, look for a closed padlock icon in the
status bar at the bottom of the browser’s screen.
(For Mac owners using Safari, the lock appears at
the upper-right corner of the window.) If you see
the lock, the connection is secure, and you can
enter your information. If you don’t see a locked
padlock icon (or the lock is open and not closed)
and you’re being asked for your personal informa-
tion and card number, I would immediately move on
to the next online store.

I
n the early ’80s, the acceptance of CD-ROM by the general public was
painfully slow but perfectly understandable. For example, John T.
Everyman had listened to vinyl albums all his life and had just begun to
mesh with the psychology of the cassette tape. Along came the audio CD,
and many folks couldn’t help but ask, “Is this just a flash in the pan, like my
Betamax VCR?” Because only a handful of plants initially manufactured CDs,
CD-ROMs started out prohibitively expensive, and the first year or two saw
only a pitiful selection.
What was worse, recording your own CD was science fiction for more than a
decade. Developing the technology took several years, and then when the
first CD-R drives appeared, they were priced so high that technotypes like
myself got nosebleeds just reading the advertisements. I can remember
wishing that I had $6,000 — that’s right; six thousand dollars — so that I
could become an optical alchemist and burn like professional musicians
and video editors. Only around 1995 or so did CD recorders descend from
the heavens to less than $1,000, and it took three more years for the typical
CD recorder to drop to less than $500. Recording software? You may as well
have written it yourself because what was available was almost as expen-
sive as the drive.
Thank goodness, we have all learned our lesson. Things have changed so
dramatically that the introduction of DVD a few years ago was a complete
mirror image of the early years of the compact disc. First, the CD-ROM has
become so common that DVD was immediately accepted as “the next step
in optical media.” No uncertainty, wailing, or gnashing of teeth this time. We
all want the storage space and convenience of DVD. A large number of well-
established factories were already ready and waiting to produce DVDs, and
the selection of films has mushroomed quickly. Prices on many popular
DVD movies are less than $10, and the selection grows every day.
Finally, DVD recording is light-years ahead of where CD recording was at this
stage of the game. Drives have reached rock-bottom prices, and software
abounds to help you produce your own interactive discs. Many computers
are already shipping with DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W drives, and prices con-
tinue to drop across the board for all types of recordable DVD blank media.
Many features that I cover in Chapter 2 of Book IV apply in this chapter as
well, such as internal versus external drives and the connections you can
771

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
use. Therefore, I focus more on the important questions you need to ask
before you plunk down your hard-earned greenbacks for a new DVD drive. I
also include a discussion of additional hardware and software that comes in
handy for recording, as well as information on those pesky DVD formats.
“Do I Need DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, or DVD-RAM?”
Do you need a rewritable DVD-R/W drive or a DVD-RAM model? Why not get
all three? (Oh, brother.) Unless you’ve been hanging out with the good folks
at the lottery commission, that’s probably not an option. You can, however,
find many drives on the market that can use both DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W,
like the Sony DRU-510. (Talk about alphabet soup! For the definition of each
acronym that I’m tossing around, visit Chapter 1 of Book IV.)
However, I still have good news: The relative strengths of all three types of
recordable DVD media make it easy to decide which one you need. Check
out Table 3-1 for the scoop.

Although I break DVD-R and DVD-RW into separate categories in the table,
it’s getting harder and harder to find a drive that records only DVD-R — and
the same holds true for DVD+R/W. This trend mirrors the development of
CD-RW technology. Try finding a drive that burns only CD-Rs these days!
(I dare you.)
I should point out something else about Table 3-1: Besides being incredibly
informative, it uses the words almost and usually, which don’t show up in
many definitive tables. Why? The answer lies not in today’s recorders, but
rather in yesterday’s DVD-ROM players: Four distinct generations of DVD-
ROM players have existed since their introduction in late 1997, and each
succeeding generation has a better chance of reading DVD-Rs, DVD+Rs, and
DVD-RAMs.
The result is a big question mark. Because of the wide disparity in manufac-
turers, I honestly can’t tell you whether the DVD-ROM player you have now
reads any type of burned disc. If you’re using a DVD+R or DVD-RAM, you
have the best chance with a DVD-ROM player manufactured since early
2001. If you’re using DVD-R, you have the best chance with a DVD-ROM
player made after late 1999. Thoroughly confused now? Sorry about that.
This alphabet soup of different standards and rapidly evolving hardware
can turn a computer book author’s hair very gray very quickly.

Book IV
Chapter 3
DVD Is the Cat’s Meow
“Hey — I Can’t Copy ‘Curse of the Mollusk People’!”
Anyway, here are my recommendations. First, pick DVD-R/W if
✦You’re looking for the highest level of compatibility with all DVD-ROM
drives.
✦You’re distributing discs to others.
Pick DVD+R/W if
✦You’re looking for compatibility with the latest DVD-ROM drives.
✦You want to spend a little less on media.
Choose DVD-RAM if
✦Compatibility with DVD-ROM drives is not an issue, such as when you’re
creating backups or discs that you read only on your computer.
✦You want to rewrite the largest amount of data on an existing disc.
Oh, and yes, Virginia: You can read a commercially manufactured DVD-ROM
movie disc in either type of recorder. At least I can guarantee you the extra
bonus of adding a DVD-ROM drive to your computer when you install a DVD
recorder.
“Hey — I Can’t Copy ‘Curse of the Mollusk People’!”
Man, of all the clunkers that Hollywood has turned out, why would you
possibly want to copy a movie about mobile glowing clams that enslave the
minds of simple townsfolk? (I’ve bought titles like Robot Monster, Nude on the
Moon, and Blood Feast for my collection. Perhaps I shouldn’t be too proud.)
Anyway, you can’t just copy a DVD-ROM movie for good reason: Lots of
smart engineers, software developers, and designers worked hard to make
sure that you can’t. Some discs are protected by the addition of unreadable
areas on the disc during manufacturing, and other protection schemes
involve encrypted key codes that must be present on the disc for it to be
recognized by either your player or your computer’s DVD-ROM drive.
Sure, some programs on the market purport to create direct copies of DVD
movies, but most DVD movies hold more than 4.7GB — in fact, many now
cram a whopping 8GB onto a single disc. (After all, commercial DVDs can be
mastered with more than one data layer. Turn to Chapter 1 of Book IV for
details.) Because current DVD technology can burn only 4.7GB on a DVD-R
or DVD+R, those pirating programs have two options:
✦Spread a single movie across two or more recordable discs, with a nasty
pause involved (while you or your significant other is banished from the
couch to change the discs).
✦Compress the digital video on the disc up to 50 percent so that it can be
stored on a single disc, which typically results in a noticeable loss in
picture quality.
This stuff gets really technical really quickly, so I don’t go into it here in any
great detail. Suffice it to say that buying a DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, or DVD-RAM
drive is not a free ticket to a shelf of cheap movies.
773

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
(And no, I didn’t think that you would do such a thing. Copyrights are
important — ask any book author.)
Weird, Wild DVD Format Stuff
Close the windows, bar the door: You can’t escape them. I have two more
acronyms to discuss, and I do the best I can to make sure that we all make it
out of this section in one piece.
DVD-V
If you’ve been perusing the DVD movie aisle at your local discount store,
you may have thought that you were looking at DVD-ROM — and you would
be right. However, I can be even more specific than that: A DVD-V (short for
DVD-Video, of all things) is a DVD-ROM that holds broadcast-quality digital
video in a special compressed format named MPEG-2. (You find out a little
more about MPEG in the section, “MPEG card: Aye, Matey, ’tis indeed a tiny
file,” later in this chapter.) You also get niceties like Dolby audio, surround
sound, subtitles, and different aspect ratios with a DVD-V. You can even run
programs from a DVD-V if you’re playing it in a computer DVD-ROM drive.
You may ask, “Can I burn a commercial-quality DVD-V with my new DVD
recorder?” Technically, yes. However, lots of work is involved in compress-
ing digital video, creating interactive menus, and adding a quality audio
track. It’s nowhere near as simple as recording something on comfortable
old VHS tape.
DVD-A
I know that this might break your heart, but even your friend the audio CD is
eventually going out to pasture. The likely replacement is a format standard
named DVD-A, or DVD-Audio. Imagine a standard audio CD that has been to
the gym four nights a week for the past ten years, and you get some idea of
what DVD-A is like: either two or four hours of stereo music (depending on
the type of media); interactive menus, like with the current crop of DVD-Vs;
and even the ability to store video clips. Plus, DVD-As store music at a higher
quality than standard audio CDs and with an even higher dynamic range . . .
in other words, they sound even better than your rusty old CDs.
For me, however, the most exciting new feature of DVD-A is the addition of
surround sound support. If you’re enjoying a surround sound system, you
know how realistic it is. If not, try out this type of system the next time
you’re in a stereo and video store. Although the extra data needed for sur-
round sound cuts the capacity of a DVD-A in half, you’re still talking about
an hour or two of incredible music.
Additional Toys You May Need
Before the sun sets on this introductory discussion of DVD recording, I would
be remiss if I didn’t tell you that you’re likely to need a little additional hard-
ware and software. Why? To make the most of the expanded features of DVD,
you need to import video, edit those video clips, convert them to different
774

Book IV
Chapter 3
DVD Is the Cat’s Meow
Additional Toys You May Need
formats, and design your menu system — not necessarily in that order —
and there just isn’t the need to do most of those things when you’re record-
ing a CD-R or CD-RW.
In this section of your palatial mansion, allow me to show you some of the
extras you’re likely to use.
MPEG card: Aye, Matey, ’tis indeed a tiny file
If you’re serious about creating your own DVD-Vs — or even experimenting
with simple video CDs and digital video clips — you should consider an
MPEG-2 adapter card for your computer. As I mention earlier in this chapter,
MPEG-2 is a compression format; it’s somewhat similar to the space you
save when you use Zip compression to shrink a folder full of files on your
hard drive. And, boy, do you need it: High-quality digital video that’s bigger
than a postage stamp on your screen takes up an incredible amount of
space. Without compressing (or encoding) the video, you’re likely to run out
of room on even the highest-capacity DVD media.
If you’re wondering about that term digital video (also called DV, for short),
indeed, no film or magnetism is involved. Digital video is composed of the
same familiar 1s and 0s (zeros) that are written to a recordable CD or DVD.
Unlike a traditional videotape (which can stretch and lose its magnetic
properties), you can edit, copy, and play digital video as many times as you
like without losing quality.
Most MPEG-2 cards have two functions: They can encode video to shrink it,
and they can also decode it so that you can watch it on your computer
screen. (If you receive an MPEG-2 card with a DVD-ROM drive, however, it
likely just decodes so that you can watch DVD movies.)
Software programs can take care of both these chores, but I always recom-
mend a hardware solution for folks who want to do any serious MPEG-2
video work. The advantages of the card over software include
✦Speed: Software encoding and decoding programs are nowhere near as
fast as an MPEG-2 card, so a process that can take minutes with a card
can take hours with a program. The encoding speed depends on the raw
power and performance of your computer’s processor.
✦Efficiency: An MPEG-2 card does all the heavy thinking about MPEG-2,
so even an older PC with a Pentium II brain can keep up.
✦Convenience: Most MPEG-2 cards offer connectors so that you can plug
your TV directly into your computer and pipe your DVD movies to the
tube. These connectors are handy little beavers to possess.
FireWire port: The real information superhighway
No ifs, ands, or buts with this one: If you work with digital video recording,
you need one or two high-speed FireWire ports on your computer. Virtually
every piece of machinery on the planet that works with DV uses FireWire to
connect to everything else, including digital video camcorders and external
DVD recorders. Many high-resolution digital cameras and scanners are now
using FireWire as their connection of choice as well.
775

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Some manufacturers seem determined to call a FireWire port an i.LINK con-
nection, for some reason. Heck, if you want to be perfectly accurate, the full
international title for the original FireWire standard is IEEE-1394. You may
see several of these names on the same box.
If you’re using a late-model Macintosh, you’re probably doing the
Technological Twist right now, dancing in front of your monitor like a Druid
partying around Stonehenge. That’s because Apple developed FireWire, and
all current Macintosh computers include built-in FireWire ports. However, if
you’re using a PC that didn’t come graced with the Wire of Fire, be reas-
sured that you can party just as well by installing a PCI card in your com-
puter. PCI cards average about $100 on the Web, and they provide you with
two FireWire ports and all the software and drivers. You need an open PCI
slot in your PC, naturally.
A new FireWire standard — called FireWire 800 or FireWire B, depending on
whom you talk to — started appearing on high-end Macintosh models in 2003.
This Speed Racer delivers twice the data of the original FireWire port, but it
hasn’t become popular yet in the PC world. Luckily, the original FireWire 400
still does the trick and is compatible with just about everything.
Digital camcorder: Your digital muse
By law (it’s written down somewhere, I know it), you can’t record digital
video without a digital camcorder (sometimes also called a DV camcorder).
Note that a DV camcorder is not the same as the VHS-C or Hi-8 camcorder
that you already own. Oh, no, things couldn’t be that simple, right? Yesterday’s
typical video camcorder records an analog signal (which doesn’t use the pre-
cise 1s and 0s of the digital world that we love so well), so you can’t use that
video feed with your computer and your editing software. (The next toy I
show you, however, helps you get around this problem.)
Virtually all digital camcorders download their video directly through a
FireWire port to your computer, where you can have fun with it to your
heart’s content. DV camcorders are more expensive than their traditional
analog brethren, but they’re much more versatile: You can take still photo-
graphs with most digital camcorders, and most models allow you to per-
form simple editing jobs onboard (“Can you please get the police out of our
wedding video?”) before you download the video to your computer. For the
George Lucas in you, most digital camcorders now allow you to shoot
footage in a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.
You now shell out anywhere from $300 to $3,000 or more for a digital cam-
corder. (Chapter 2 of Book II can help you find the digital camcorder to fit
your needs.) For example, Figure 3-1 illustrates the Panasonic PV-DV401,
which sells for about $400 online. It looks deceptively like a typical VHS-C
analog camcorder, but it sports both FireWire and USB ports and a digital
camera mode for taking still photographs. You can add special effects
during recording or playback, and it can even record in near darkness.
A-D converter: A bridge to the past
If you’re shaking your head and mumbling, “I can’t possibly afford that kind
of cash right now for a digital camcorder,” I’ve got a card up my sleeve that
776

Book IV

Additional Toys You May Need
may set things straight. This joker is called an analog-to-digital converter —
usually called an A-D converter by those who dislike $5 words. The A-D con-
verter freshens up the signal from a prehistoric analog TV, VCR, or camcorder,
and — voilà! — you’ve turned that analog signal into digital video.
Figure 3-2 shows one of the most popular A-D converters on the market, the
Hollywood DV-Bridge, from Pinnacle Systems, Inc. (www.dazzle.com). This
alchemist’s magic box costs a mere $200 or so on the Web, yet it can
✦Connect your computer, your analog devices, and your DV devices in
perfect harmony with a full set of ports (including a FireWire port)
✦Convert digital video to an analog signal so that you can use your VCR
to create tapes from a DV source

It also comes with two types of Windows video-editing software. I highly
recommend the Hollywood DV-Bridge if you’re itching to try your hand at
digital video, but you want to spend as little as possible and use the analog
equipment you already have.
Video-editing software
Speaking of software, I end this opening gambit in the world of DVD record-
ing by describing the typical software you use. In fact, two of these three
programs ship as part of the computer’s operating system. (Is DV main-
stream these days or what?)
Video-editing software now offers a basic set of tools that take care of all
common tasks, such as
✦Importing and arranging video clips
✦Removing unwanted footage
✦Adding basic transitions between clips, like fade-ins and dissolves
✦Adding and synchronizing audio
Figures 3-3, 3-4, and 3-5 illustrate three great examples of these multidimen-
sional DV tools: iDVD 3, which ships with new Macintosh computers (you
may be familiar with its little brother, iMovie 3), Microsoft Movie Maker
(Windows Me and XP), and Adobe Premiere (both platforms). Any of these
programs can deliver a quality digital video production.
Granted, you can spend a heinous amount of money on high-end editing
software that toots your car horn and makes doughnuts, but it typically
starts at $1,000 (and that’s for the cheap seats, my friend). Most programs I
cover in this book are free or under $200, and even the commercial version
of Adobe Premiere costs less than $500 on the Web at www.adobe.com. Other

hardware miracles beyond the reach of the mere computer owner. (The
pocket protector is no longer required equipment; in fact, I’ve never used
one.)
If that nerdy stereotype is still your impression of a typical computer tech-
nician, this chapter should open your eyes — because you can be your own
tech. Sure, you can pay someone at your local computer shop to install
your new recorder, but why not save that cash and apply it to something
else, like your rent? Come to think of it, that $50 you would have paid some-
one can buy you a stack of 100 blank DVD-R discs.
This chapter focuses exclusively on the installation and troubleshooting of
CD and DVD recorders — consider it the one-chapter, abridged version of
my book Building a PC For Dummies, 4th Edition (published by Wiley),
which shows that you can assemble an entire PC from the ground up. And
yes, I cover possible solutions when the worst things happen, such as when
your new drive sits there silently like a bump on a log.
Preparation Is the Key
Ever made a complex dish with a dozen ingredients without first reading
the recipe? Or how about climbing on your roof to fix a few shingles and dis-
cover that you didn’t bring your hammer? Preparation makes all the differ-
ence when you’re installing computer hardware as well, and in this section,
I describe the things that you need to know before you get started.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Read the instructions
The steps that I cover in this chapter apply to 99.9 percent of the computers
and recorders on the planet — but guess who may have bought the drive
that was specifically designed for the other .1 percent of the population?
That’s right: The Fates may have chosen you as the person who has to cut
the blue wire, not the red wire. Certain software may need to be loaded
first, or you may need to flip switches to configure your drive correctly,
which I don’t cover in these generic procedures.
Here’s a Mark’s Maxim that applies to all computer hardware:
You must read the installation instructions for your recorder!
(And yes, that includes external recorders.) If the installation process that’s
described by the manufacturer is significantly different, follow the general
steps I provide in this chapter and then jump ship to follow the manufac-
turer’s steps instead.
Collect what you need
No surgeon (or car mechanic) wants to operate without the tools at hand,
and you should follow their lead by using these guidelines:
✦Gather the stuff that you need. Most installations require just a screw-
driver, but bring along your drive’s installation instructions and any
extra parts.
✦Prepare your work surface. If you’re installing an internal drive, pre-
pare a flat, soft, well-lighted surface — several sheets of newspaper on a
table work fine, or you can use an antistatic mat.
✦Take your time. No one’s looking over your shoulder with a stopwatch,
so relax and follow the steps the right way the first time.
✦Keep those parts. You’re likely to remove small parts, like screws and a
bay cover, when installing an internal recorder; keep a bowl handy that
can hold everything you remove. You need some of the parts when you
reassemble your computer, and anything left over should be saved as
spare parts for future upgrades and repairs.
Ask for help
Do you have a friend or loved one — in fact, anyone other than your mortal
enemy — who has installed a recorder already or who is experienced with
computer hardware? If so, buy that person a meal and ask for assistance
while you’re installing your drive. If this is your first time working on
the innards of your computer, you can probably benefit from the moral
support, too.
By the way, as soon as you’ve successfully installed an internal drive, don’t
be surprised if someone you know asks for your help with a computer.

Installing an EIDE Drive
Choose a spot to be external
If you’re adding an external recorder to your computer, take a few moments
beforehand to select the right space for your new drive. The best spot is
described as follows:
✦A minimum of 6 inches away from your computer: This space helps
minimize interference from your computer’s power supply and monitor.
✦Well ventilated: An external drive can give off a significant amount of
heat, so make sure that your recorder has room on all four sides.
✦Free of vibration: For example, don’t park your recorder next to your
computer’s subwoofer (that big speaker box that delivers the deep bass
for your computer’s sound system). Vibration can ruin a recording and
eventually damage your drive.
Installing an EIDE Drive
Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) drives are internal, inexpen-
sive, and fast — no wonder they’re the internal drive of choice for most PC
owners. If you’ve bought an EIDE CD or DVD recorder, now is the time to get
down to business and get your new toy installed.
What you need
First, make sure that your PC has the following items:
✦An unoccupied drive bay: Your computer needs to have a 51⁄4-inch drive
bay that can be opened to the front of your case. Most PC cases have at
least two or three of these bays (although a hard drive may be hogging
one, even though it doesn’t need an opening to the outside world).
✦An unused EIDE connector with a cable: Most PCs made in the past
2–3 years have four available EIDE device connectors (a primary master
and slave and a secondary master and slave). You need at least one
unused connector for your new recorder. You may also need to buy a
cable if you’re using your secondary EIDE connector, because many PC
manufacturers don’t provide a cable if the connector isn’t being used.
✦An unused power connector: No recorder works without a power
supply. An internal drive uses a connector like the one that’s shown in
Figure 4-1. You can also buy a power splitter (or a Y connector) that can
convert one power cable into two.

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
The EIDE dance, step by step
This section covers the installation process for an EIDE drive. Follow the
steps in this section (and yes, you have to follow the steps in the order that
I list them).
Static electricity is not fun, is not amusing, and is not your friend. It’s the
sworn enemy of anyone who has ever installed computer hardware. Static
can damage an electronic component in the blink of an eye, and you may
not be able to spot the damage until you discover that you have a dead
drive on your hands. Therefore, you must discharge static electricity that’s
on your body before you touch the drive, your PC’s motherboard, or any of
the PC’s internal parts. Touch a metal surface before you open your com-
puter’s case — usually, you can just touch the case itself — and touch the
internal chassis (that’s the metal framework) often during the installation
process.
Follow these steps to install an EIDE drive:
1. Turn off your computer, and unplug it from the AC power outlet.
2. Remove the screws that hold your computer’s cover in place, and set
the cover aside.
Don’t forget to put those screws in that high-tech bowl that I mention
earlier in this chapter.
3. Set the EIDE drive configuration.
Every EIDE drive uses a specific configuration that allows your new
recorder to peacefully cohabitate with your existing EIDE hard drive(s)
or CD/DVD-ROM drive.
Setting up your recorder is not an overwhelming task, although the
exact settings for your jumpers vary among brands and models. (If
you’ve never handled a jumper, it’s the workhorse of the computer hard-
ware world. It’s a tiny, metal-and-plastic crossover that allows you to
make connections on the drive’s circuit board.) Check your drive’s
manual for the correct set of pins, and use a pair of tweezers to add or
remove jumpers to match that pattern. If you’re working with a scav-
enged drive or you don’t have the manual, check the manufacturer’s
Web site or call its technical support number. Set the jumper as follows:
• One hard drive: Configure the jumper on the hard drive as “multiple
drive, master unit,” and configure the jumper on your recorder as
“multiple drive, slave unit.”
• One hard drive and one CD-ROM drive on the same cable: Set the
jumper on your recorder as “single drive, master unit,” and connect
the recorder to the secondary EIDE cable. Leave the existing drives
alone.
• One hard drive and one CD-ROM drive on different cables: Configure
the jumper on your recorder as “multiple drive, slave unit,” and con-
nect the recorder to the EIDE cable that the hard drive is using. Then
set the jumper on the hard drive to “multiple drive, master unit.” Don’t
change your existing CD/DVD-ROM drive settings.
784

Book IV
Chapter 4
Poof! You’re a
Computer Technician
Installing an EIDE Drive
You may have to change the jumper settings on your existing EIDE
devices to get things working. For example, if you’re adding a DVD
recorder on your primary EIDE connector and you already have an EIDE
hard drive on that cable, you have to switch the hard drive from “single
drive, master unit” to “multiple drive, master unit.” In this situation,
your new DVD recorder is set to “multiple drive, slave unit.”
4. Check the bay that is to hold your recorder.
If a plastic insert is covering the bay, you should be able to remove the
insert by removing the screws that hold it or by carefully prying off the
insert with a screwdriver.
5. Align the drive into the bay, and slide it into the front of the case,
with the rear of the drive (the end with the plugs and connectors)
going in first.
The faceplate and buttons should be visible from the front of the case,
as shown in Figure 4-2.
Naturally, the printing and logo on the front should be facing right
side up.
6. Move the drive forward and backward until the screw holes are
aligned with the screw holes in the side of the case, and then attach
the recorder.
7. Connect a power cable to the drive, and make sure that you press it
in firmly.
Notice that it goes on only one way, so don’t try to force it on backward.
Figure 4-2:

785

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
8. Connect the ribbon cable that comes from the EIDE connector on the
motherboard to the EIDE connector on the back of the recorder.
No need to worry about this connector either, because it’s notched to fit
in only one way. Press it on firmly after it’s correctly aligned.
9. Because pulling and tugging on things inside your computer can result
in an unplugged cable, take a moment to check all your connections —
even the ones that don’t lead to your recorder.
10. Replace the cover on your PC with the original screws.
Did you read about that parts bowl earlier in this chapter?
11. Plug in the PC’s power cable.
12. Turn on your PC, and allow it to boot up normally.
I love that phrase — like your computer will suddenly grow wings and a
tail, leap off your desk, and fly around the room like a dragon. I would
say that that would be an abnormal boot — wouldn’t you?
13. Uh-oh. I hope that you’re not superstitious and that you don’t mind
my ending on Step 13. Anyway, install the software that accompanied
your recorder.
To verify that the installation was successful, jump to Chapter 8 of Book IV
and try your first recording. If things don’t fly, read the troubleshooting sec-
tion at the end of this chapter.
Plugging and Playing with a USB Drive
Made the Universal Serial Bus (USB) external choice, did you? (Hopefully,
you settled on a USB 2.0 drive, but older USB 1.1 drives are installed the
same way.) Notice that this step-by-step section is much shorter than the
internal EIDE drive installation in the preceding section; that’s part of the
beauty (and the popularity) of USB.
Follow these steps to install a USB drive:
1. Plug the power cord from your new drive into the AC wall socket.
Note that some USB drives are powered through the USB connection
itself, so they don’t require an external power supply.
2. Connect the USB cable to the drive (don’t connect the cable to the
computer’s port yet), and turn on the drive.
3. Turn on your computer, and allow it to boot up normally. (There I go
again.)
4. Plug the USB cable from your drive into the USB port on your com-
puter, as shown in Figure 4-3.
Your next step depends on the software and the operating system that
you’re using. You may see a dialog box that prompts you to insert the
driver disc that came with your drive, or you may have to install the
drive’s software separately.
5. Check your drive’s installation instructions to see which path you take.

Running the SCSI Gauntlet
That’s it. Follow the steps in Book IV, Chapter 8 to record your first disc and
make sure that everything’s working well. If your drive isn’t working, visit
the troubleshooting section at the end of this chapter.
Running the SCSI Gauntlet
Decided on an internal or external Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
recorder? Memorize these two important commandments (add them to the
original ten):
✦Thou shalt assign no two devices the same SCSI ID number.
✦Thou shalt terminate both ends of your SCSI device chain.
In this section, I explain exactly what I just said — in modern English, with-
out technobabble — and help you install your drive.
IDs ‘R’ Us
Think of a SCSI device chain as a neighborhood on a cable — to be precise, a
chain is at least one SCSI adapter (which may be built in to your computer’s
motherboard) and at least one device, which could be your recorder. For
your computer to transfer data to or from your drive, it has to know the
USB ports
USB cable
Figure 4-3:
Living the

787

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
“address” of your recorder in the SCSI neighborhood. In other words, every
SCSI device in your computer needs a unique SCSI ID number for identifica-
tion, as you can see in Figure 4-4. This sample SCSI device chain has a SCSI
card and three devices.
Typical SCSI devices can use ID numbers from 0 to 7, with ID number 7
usually the default for your SCSI adapter. (Your SCSI card manual tells
you which number the card uses.) Manufacturers of SCSI hardware use
different methods of configuring the ID number; most drives use a jumper,
which you can set on the correct pins with a pair of tweezers. Again, your
drive’s manual shows you which jumpers to move when setting the ID
number. Some drives also use a thumbwheel that you can turn to choose
the number.
By the way, you don’t have to assign SCSI ID numbers in sequence; as long
as all the device IDs are unique, it doesn’t matter what order they’re in.
If your SCSI adapter and your SCSI devices are all SCAM ready (man, what
an acronym!), you can forget about assigning numbers manually. That’s
because SCAM stands for SCSI Configured Automatically. Enabling this fea-
ture on your SCSI adapter allows it to automatically set SCSI ID numbers
each time you boot your PC.
Coming to grips with termination
No, I’m not talking about the Donald Trump kind of termination, where
another hapless apprentice ends up without a job (again). In the SCSI world,
a chain must be correctly terminated on each end to tell your SCSI adapter
where the chain ends. Without termination, your poor SCSI adapter contin-
ues to scan the horizon in vain, looking for straggling SCSI devices that
aren’t there — and your computer either locks up or fails to recognize the
last device on the chain. If the termination is set on a device that isn’t on the
end of the chain, that device becomes the end anyway, leaving at least one
SCSI device out in the cold. The device that is really at the end of the chain
either refuses to work or locks your computer. In short, without proper ter-
mination, you never get your SCSI devices to work.
Consider the simplest installation of a CD or DVD recorder on a SCSI chain.
As you can see in Figure 4-5, this is just the SCSI adapter and the drive, and
the drive could be internal or external. Both these devices naturally indi-
cate the ends of the SCSI chain, so both need to be terminated. When your
SCSI adapter looks for terminators, it finds that one device is on one end
and the card itself is terminated on the other.

Running the SCSI Gauntlet
However, what if you want to install an internal recorder into an existing
SCSI chain that already has a hard drive? If no changes are made and you
just added your spiffy new CD-RW drive to the end of the cable, you would
invite the disaster that is shown in Figure 4-6. Because the hard drive is still
terminated, your new toy is useless, and it can’t be recognized within
Windows or the Mac operating system.
For this reason, heed this Mark’s Maxim carefully:
Always review all your termination settings when installing a new SCSI
device chain or adding a new device to an existing chain.
Figure 4-7 shows how the same chain should be terminated. Now the SCSI
adapter can “see” and communicate with the recorder, and all is well.
Depending on the manufacturer, setting the SCSI termination usually
involves your old friends, the Jumper family. You may also encounter a
resistor pack, which you plug in to add termination and remove to drop
termination. Finally, you may set termination by flipping the tiny plastic

toggles on a DIP switch (a tiny switchbox that’s wired as part of the circuit
board) — use a pencil to set the correct pattern of switches to either On or
Off. Again, all these interesting settings appear in your recorder’s manual,
so keep it handy during the installation process.
What you need
If you’re installing an internal SCSI recorder, you need the following items:
✦An open drive bay: Look for a 51⁄4-inch drive bay that’s accessible from
the front of your case.
✦A SCSI connector: Your SCSI adapter should come with a cable, and you
should use the first open connector that’s closest to the SCSI adapter. If
you’re adding a drive to an existing chain, select the next open connec-
tor on the cable after the last existing device.
I’ve always recommended this technique of adding devices to the end of
the cable (instead of trying to stick them in the middle of a SCSI chain).
Why? You have less to worry about come termination time: You simply
remove the termination on the last existing device on the cable, and
make sure that your new device is terminated. Because it’s now the last
device on the cable, you always know that it marks the end of the chain.
Sometimes, this process isn’t possible (for example, if you have only
one open drive bay and the end of the SCSI cable doesn’t reach it), but
whenever you can, adding devices to the end of the cable is a good idea.
✦An open power connector: Most PCs come with a veritable forest of
available power connectors. If you’ve used them all, buy a Y connector
that splits one power cable into two. ’Nuff said.
Your step-by-step guide to internal SCSI happiness
Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to install a SCSI drive:
1. Turn off your computer, and unplug it from the AC power outlet.
2. Touch a metal surface to dissipate static electricity that may be
stowed away on your person.
Usually, your PC’s case suffices just fine.
3. Remove the screws that attach your computer’s cover, and place the
cover out of harm’s way.
Put the removed screws in your parts bowl.
4. Set the SCSI device ID on your drive to a unique number.
Refer to the drive’s manual to determine where the ID control is located,
and then configure the drive with a unique number that’s not used on
any other SCSI device in your system.
5. Determine the correct termination — don’t forget that the correct ter-
mination includes all existing SCSI devices on the chain.
Check the position of the SCSI connector that you want to use. If the
recorder is on the end of your SCSI cable, make sure that the device is
terminated (and all intervening devices have had their termination
removed).

6. If necessary, remove the plastic insert that covers the drive bay.
If the cover is the snap-on type, you can carefully pry it off with a
screwdriver.
7. Slide the drive into the front of the case, with the rear of the drive
(the end with the plugs and connectors) going in first.
The tray and buttons should be facing the front of the case, as shown in
Figure 4-2, and any printing or logos on the front should be facing right
side up.
8. Move the drive forward and backward to align the screw holes on the
side of the drive and the case, and then attach the recorder with the
manufacturer’s screws.
9. Connect a power cable to the drive, and make sure that you press it
in firmly.
10. Connect the SCSI ribbon cable to the SCSI connector on the back of
the recorder.
Note that the connector is notched to fit only one way. Press it on firmly
after it’s correctly aligned.
11. Take a moment to check all your power and cable connections — even
the ones that don’t lead to your recorder.
12. Replace the cover on your PC with the original screws.
13. Plug in the PC’s power cable.
14. Turn on your PC, and allow it to boot up normally. (Snicker.)
You should see the SCSI adapter verifying each of the devices on the
chain, including your new recorder.
15. Install the software that accompanied your recorder.
Sweet! It’s time to test things out by taking a quick detour to Chapter 8 of
Book IV. If you can’t record, remain calm and turn to the troubleshooting
section at the end of this chapter.
External SCSI stuff
Like USB and FireWire external drives, an external SCSI recorder carries its
house along with it — however, you still have to select a unique SCSI ID and
correctly terminate that external recorder before everything starts hum-
ming. Use your SCSI adapter’s external SCSI port to connect your recorder.
A number of different SCSI port configurations are possible, so if your card
didn’t come with a cable, make sure that you’re buying the right type with
the right connections.
All external SCSI devices come with two connectors, so you can add more
than one external device with additional cables — a classic example is a
SCSI system with an external SCSI recorder and a SCSI scanner. The same
termination rules that you followed for internal drives apply when you’re
installing multiple external SCSI devices. As shown in Figure 4-8, make sure
to terminate the last external device in the chain.
791

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
Remember that your SCSI adapter should never be terminated if you’ve con-
nected both internal and external SCSI devices (in fact, it’s now at the center
of your chain).
Installing a FireWire Drive
As is the case with USB, installing an external FireWire recorder is an easy
process. Granted, producing microwave popcorn is easier, but everyone
can do that, and it doesn’t sound nearly as impressive for the uninitiated.
(Remember, let others think this stuff is complex . . . technotypes have been
doing it for decades now.)
Anyway, follow these steps to install your FireWire drive:
1. Plug the power cord from your recorder into the AC wall socket.
2. Connect the FireWire cable to the drive, and turn on the drive.
3. Plug the cable from your drive into the FireWire port on your
computer.
4. Turn on your computer, and allow it to boot up normally.
Your next step depends on the software and the operating system that
you’re using. You may see a dialog box that prompts you to insert the
driver disc that came with your drive, or you may have to install the
drive’s software separately.
5. Check your drive’s installation instructions to see which path you take.
To double-check your work, rush to Book IV, Chapter 8 and try burning your
first disc. If your drive appears to be suffering from rigor mortis, jump to the
following troubleshooting section.
“Um, It’s Just Sitting There”
I really hope that you’re not reading this — I hope that your recorder instal-
lation was as smooth as butter, it lit up like a Christmas tree when you turned
things on, and it perfectly burned that first disc of Liberace tunes. Therefore,
I assume that you’re skipping this section completely. Or, perhaps you’ve
reached this section and you’re just curious about what could have hap-
pened. Perhaps you’re just generally interested in troubleshooting (the art of
figuring out what’s wrong with your computer and knowing how to fix it).

“Um, It’s Just Sitting There”
On the other hand, you may have reached this section with a hunk of hard-
ware that’s just sitting there like a dead weight. If so, these sentences are
pure gold, because they can help you diagnose the problem with your
recorder installation and solve it quickly.
EIDE troubleshooting
If you’ve installed an EIDE drive and it appears to be acting persnickety, the
following are some problems that folks often encounter along with some tips
on how to solve these problems.
The drive doesn’t eject the tray, and the power light doesn’t turn on.
The culprit behind this problem is usually an unplugged, loose, or broken
power connector. Unfortunately, this means that it’s time to crack open
your PC’s case and check your connections.
I tried to play an audio CD with my recorder, and I can’t hear any music.
This problem is common and easy to fix: You forgot to connect the Audio
Out cable from the recorder to your PC’s sound card. The manufacturer of
your drive should provide this cable (and it’s often also supplied with a
sound card). Consult the manual for your sound card to determine where
you should plug in the Audio Out cable from your new drive.
My drive ejects the tray, but I can’t find the drive symbol in Windows,
and my software says that it can’t recognize the recorder.
The simplest explanation for this problem is an unplugged data cable.
Check to make sure that you’ve plugged the flat ribbon cable from the EIDE
connector firmly into the drive. Next, you may have the master and slave
jumpers on your recorder configured incorrectly, so check them against the
configurations that are listed in the recorder’s manual. Finally — and this is
the tricky one — you may have set the jumpers on the recorder correctly
but forgotten to configure the new multiple drive setting on the drive that’s
already on that EIDE cable.
SCSI troubleshooting
I think that even Scotty on the original Star Trek TV series would have
thought twice before sticking one of those silver penlights into a recalci-
trant SCSI setup. (Just kidding.) Although you have more to troubleshoot
with a SCSI installation, all it takes to solve a problem is time and patience.
Check out the following problems and tips for solutions.
My computer locks up every time I boot after the installation, and I have
to turn it off manually.
I bet that you already suspect that your SCSI termination or ID numbers are
configured incorrectly — and if so, you’re right. Double-check all your ter-
mination settings and make sure that they’re correct, and then verify that
each SCSI device on your chain has a unique SCSI ID number.
793

Part I: Shake Hands with Your Recorder
I can’t get my SCSI drive to eject the tray, and the power light doesn’t
turn on.
On an internal drive, check your power cable — if you’ve added an external
SCSI drive, the external power supply is the likely culprit.
The drive ejects the tray, but my computer acts like the recorder isn’t
there. (Alternatively, the recorder works, but my existing SCSI scanner is
now broken.)
Poke your drive with a finger to make sure that it’s there. (Sorry, I couldn’t
resist that one.) The real problem is probably your old friends: two or more
devices trying to share the same SCSI ID number, or termination that’s
incorrectly configured for your new drive. Also, make sure that all other
SCSI devices on the chain are powered up and connected, and wiggle your
data cable to make sure that it’s firmly connected.
If your SCSI adapter card came with SCSI diagnostics programs, run them
now and see what error messages the programs display. Also, check your
SCSI adapter manual to see whether you can run a self-test mode.
USB and FireWire troubleshooting
Although both USB and FireWire are Plug and Play compatible (meaning
that you can simply connect and disconnect them without rebooting your
computer), that doesn’t mean that they’re trouble-free. If your external
recorder isn’t working, check out the following possible solutions.
My computer complains that it doesn’t have a “USB (or FireWire) device
driver” when I plug in my recorder.
This message is a clear cry for help from your computer: You either need to
install the manufacturer’s driver from the disc, or the driver that you
installed has been corrupted. To fix this problem, reinstall the recorder’s
software. Check the manufacturer’s Web site to see whether an updated
USB driver is available. If you’re using a Macintosh computer under Mac OS
9.2 and a FireWire recorder, check your Extensions list for the device’s
FireWire extension. To do so, click the Apple icon in the Finder menu and
choose the Extensions Manager from the Control Panel list. (Mac owners
running Mac OS X don’t have to worry with extensions.)
My recorder has no power. The tray doesn’t eject, and no power light
turns on.
Your first thought is probably to check the drive’s power supply, and if the
drive has an external power supply, you’re probably right. If you bought
your drive locally, take it to the salesperson and ask that person to check it
out with another power supply. However, if your USB drive is designed to be
powered from the computer’s USB port, it doesn’t have a separate power
supply. In this case, the port is probably not providing enough power to
meet the USB standard. (This problem happens frequently with USB hubs
and keyboards and/or auxiliary USB ports.) Plug your recorder into another
computer’s USB port, and see whether it jumps into action.

If the recorder’s software installation ran without a hitch and the driver is
present, this problem is usually caused by a faulty cable, a faulty USB or
FireWire hub, or a USB cable that’s too long (it shouldn’t be more than 10
feet long). Try connecting your drive to your computer with a different stan-
dard cable and without an intervening hub. Most USB and FireWire devices
don’t pass a signal when they’re turned off, either — this can cause any
daisy-chained peripherals that may be connected to suddenly go silent as
well. Make sure that all the external devices that connect your recorder to
your computer are turned on.

ardware. Are you up to your gills in it? I devote the entire first portion
of this minibook to describing your CD or DVD recorder, buying it, and
installing it. Sure, I admit that your drive is the most important part of your
computer-based Optical Recording Studio (ORS), but does it run itself? Can
it do anything by itself besides blink a light or two and stick out its tray?
The answer, of course, is a big, fat No. You need software to tame your
recording beast. It’s like Santa at the North Pole: The old guy gets all the
credit, and his elves are constantly toiling away behind the scenes year-
round while he’s watching marathon reruns of The Andy Griffith Show and
eating leftover popcorn balls. Without the elves, who would load the sleigh,
make the toys, and feed the reindeer? Not to mention the work that Mrs.
Claus must be doing to keep everyone fed and clothed. (Sorry, I tend to get
a little carried away — I have three kids.)
In this chapter, doggone it, I change all that. I cover the highlights and spe-
cial talents of each elf — whoops, I mean program — that I mention in this
minibook. This information comes in handy if you’re considering a share-
ware or commercial recording package to replace the lame program that
came with your recorder. If you decide to buy a different program from the
favorites I recommend in this chapter (insert look of shock and chagrin
here), make sure that the program you’re buying has at least most of these
primo features.
The Windows Tool of Choice: Roxio’s
Easy Media Creator 7
For PC owners running Windows, the choice is clear: Easy Media Creator 7
(which I call Creator 7, for short) from Roxio (www.roxio.com), shown in
Figure 5-1. This showpiece has been the solid, reliable Swiss army knife of
CD and DVD burning for many years. It has the widest range of features of
any recording software I’ve ever used in my travels, it can burn a host of dif-
ferent formats and disc types, and it’s simple enough for a novice to use.
797

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
Formats and disc types out the wazoo
If you’re likely to need just about any specific type of disc on planet Earth,
this program can do it. Of course, Creator 7 can burn simple data discs and
audio CDs using Track-at-Once or Disc-at-Once without even lifting an eye-
brow, but it can also pump out
✦CD-ROM XA (multisession) discs
✦DVD-Video discs
✦Video CDs
✦Mixed-mode discs
✦CD Extra discs
✦Photo slideshow discs
This lineup also includes two types of discs that deserve special attention:
the bootable CD-ROM and the MP3 music disc. As you may have already
guessed, you can boot most PCs by using a bootable CD-ROM, so you can
even run your PC without a hard drive — after a fashion, anyway. A bootable
disc can also carry other programs and data besides a basic operating
system. A Microsoft Windows XP CD-ROM is a good example of a bootable
CD: It uses DOS as a basic operating system to display simple prompts, but
after your computer is up and running, you can install Windows from it and
really screw up your system. (Sorry, Mr. Gates, I didn’t mean that. Please
don’t pull the plug.)
An MP3 music disc, on the other hand, is a specialized data CD-ROM.
Although it carries music in MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer 3) format, its songs

are not recorded in the Red Book digital audio format (refer to Chapter 2 of
Book IV), so you can’t play the disc in an older audio CD player. MP3 discs
are meant to be played exclusively on either your computer, using a pro-
gram like Winamp, or on specially designed MP3 CD players. (Many of the
current crop of audio CD players now support MP3 music discs; check your
player’s manual to see whether your model can use them.) You’ll find more
on MP3 music discs in Chapter 7 of Book IV — these CDs are called MP3
discs in Creator 7.
Wolfgang woulda loved this
Interested in burning hot music on a compact disc? Whether those songs
are in MP3 format or stored on older cassettes and vinyl albums or you’re
collecting tracks from a number of existing audio CDs, Creator 7 can do it in
style. Although I’ve tried many different programs that record audio CDs,
Creator Classic (the primary recording application included with Easy Media
Creator 7) continues to be my favorite; it’s the easiest to understand and
the fastest to use. On the audio side, the program can
✦Automatically convert songs in MP3 and WMA (Windows Media Audio)
formats and prepare them for recording
✦Extract tracks from existing audio CDs and save them as MP3 files on
your hard drive
✦Store CD text for display on many CD players with digital readouts
✦Add transition effects, like fade in, fade out, and cross-fading
✦Preview WAV and MP3 songs before you record them
I especially like how Creator Classic can venture onto the Internet to check
online music databases and download all the track names for CDs it finds.
This feature can save you both time and sore fingers because you avoid
typing all those track names by hand.
Extra stuff they give you (without even asking)
If the Creator 7 feature list ended in the preceding section, most folks would
be satisfied. But, wait — what if I told you that you also get these great
standalone (separate) programs to boot?
Disc Copier
Disc Copier makes it easy to produce a duplicate of an existing data CD,
data DVD, or audio CD (without requiring you to start Creator 7 and pro-
duce a disc image, which is a much longer process that accomplishes the
same thing). Folks who date back to the glory days of floppies should
remember programs that allowed you to copy a disk read from one drive
to another. If you have both a read-only CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive and a
recorder in the same PC, you can use the read-only drive as the source (as
I’m doing in Figure 5-2) — no swapping required. If you have only a recorder,
however, you can still use Disc Copier — you just have to eject the original
disc and load a blank. I show you how to use Disc Copier in Chapter 8 of
Book IV.

Roxio Retrieve
How many times in this book do I harp about backing up your hard drive?
Would you mind losing every file you’ve ever known if your hard drive
crashes? If you don’t have a current backup, I’ll nag you like your mother
until you make one. (There’s a scary thought, eh?)
With the combination of Creator Classic and Roxio Retrieve (shown in
Figure 5-3), you no longer have any excuse. You can back up a drive to mul-
tiple CD-RWs, DVD+RWs, or DVD-RWs as fast as your drive can shovel ones
and zeros.
Capture
Capture (shown in Figure 5-4) is an exciting program for anyone interested
in recording music: You can copy your favorite old cassettes and albums to
audio CDs. Those of us with extensive piles of vinyl and tape still occupying

the corners of a room know the heartbreak of losing an old favorite that
hasn’t been released in compact disc format. Scratches and stretched tape
can ruin your treasures, but after you use Capture to transfer them to CD,
you can keep them for their cover art. The program can also play your digi-
tal audio files and includes an editor that can modify tracks before you burn
them to disc.
Label Creator
Let me be honest: I like a labeled disc, but I don’t label everything I burn.
For example, if I’m going on a business trip and I’ve just recorded a disc of
material for a book I’m writing, I don’t go to the trouble of printing a label —
I just use my trusty CD/DVD-marking pen and write a short title right on the
disc.
On the other hand, Label Creator (shown in Figure 5-5) is the program you
want to use when a disc needs to look its best — if you’re giving it to some-
one else or you’re particularly proud of that DVD-Video disc you made at
your cousin’s wedding. The program can also produce front and back jewel
box inserts and DVD box inserts, with classy clip art, photographs, and dif-
ferent fonts. You can even choose one of the themes that’s already set up in
the program, which can produce a matching set with a label and a complete
set of inserts. Neat!

Packet Writing Made Easy with Drag-to-Disc
Besides the standard formats — audio, data, mixed-mode, Video CD, and CD
Extra — that we all expect, Toast 6 can produce a couple of nifty extras:
✦Hybrid discs: These strange beasts can be read under both Windows
and Mac operating systems — they’re often used for cross-platform
applications that have both a Mac and Windows version. Games are
often shipped on hybrid discs for the same reason.
✦Super Video CD: Also called SVCDs for short, Super Video CDs can
store digital video files just like standard Video CDs. As the name sug-
gests, however, Super Video CDs provide significantly better video qual-
ity (at the expense of disc space, so SVCDs typically hold only about 45
minutes of video). Standard Video CDs can usually store up to 60 min-
utes of digital video.
✦MP3 music discs: As I discuss in earlier chapters, these discs store
music files in MP3 format.
✦DVDs: Toast can burn both DVD data and DVD-Video discs on sup-
ported drives.
If you’re burning discs for older Mac operating systems, you can use the
Mac standard format. However, if your disc is used on a newer machine run-
ning Mac OS 9.0 or later, you should use the enhanced Mac OS Extended
mode.
As any Mac technotype can tell you, the Mac operating system can mount
a disk image as a virtual drive on your desktop. Toast can both create and
mount these images for you, so you can store multiple images on a single
CD or DVD and use them rather than hunt for a physical disc. (I leap head-
long into the subject of disc images in Chapter 8 of Book IV.) I also like the
Compare feature in Toast, where you can compare two folders or files and
view the differences — usually one folder or file on your hard drive and
another on a CD or DVD disc.
Chapter 9 of Book IV is devoted to burning with Toast. (I’m sorry — that
one just slipped in subconsciously.)
Packet Writing Made Easy with Drag-to-Disc
Packet writing is almost as foolproof as a burnproof recording: You simply
format the disc, write to it just like it’s a huge floppy or Zip disk, and then
finalize it for reading just like an ordinary CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. Teamed with
a CD-RW or DVD rewritable drive, packet-writing software can produce the
nearly perfect, reusable, low-cost storage solution that everyone has been
chasing since the first 1GB hard drive appeared way back when. Figure 5-7
illustrates Roxio Drag-to-Disc hard at work.
You can find a complete rundown on Drag-to-Disc in Chapter 10 of Book IV.

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
Introducing the Editors: iMovie, iDVD, and Premiere Pro
Not one of these three programs — iMovie 4, iDVD 4, and Premiere Pro —
counts as true disc-recording software. Instead, they’re programs for digital
video editing, disc design, and the creation of special effects that just happen
to have recording features built-in. (As you can tell, these programs cross a
number of boundaries when it comes to genre.) Because I use iDVD 4 in
Chapter 13 of Book IV and iMovie and Premiere Pro in Chapters 8 through
12 of Book II, I thought I’d tell you a little something about each one here.
iMovie, shown in Figure 5-8, was a groundbreaking arrival for both Apple
and the world of digital video. iMovie marked a revolution where practi-
cally anyone who could connect a FireWire cable, drag and drop video
clips, and select a transition or two could develop their own professional-
looking movies. For the first time, you didn’t need several hundred dollars
to spend just on editing software. The software has been shipping free with
iMacs since the program was first introduced. iMovie was simple enough to
appeal to novices, who definitely didn’t want to spend hours understanding
the basics of a more powerful, traditional editor. Unfortunately for Windows
folks, iMovie 4 runs on only Mac OS X. However, Windows Movie Maker is
very much like it.
iDVD 4 is the recently released big brother to iMovie 4. At the time I wrote
this book, it was available only on Macintosh computers that offered the
CD-RW/DVD-RW SuperDrive. With iDVD, you can master your own DVD-
ROM titles, complete with basic menu and submenu interaction. For exam-
ple, viewers can select a video clip to watch or view a slideshow of digital
photographs. While designing your disc, you can use a prepared theme to
automatically set the appearance of your buttons and background, or you
can add your own. Finally, iDVD allows you to preview your work and burn
the DVD within the program itself. Figure 5-9 shows iDVD in action.
The excellent Adobe digital video editor Premiere Pro (shown in Figure 5-10)
is available for both Windows and Mac OS. Premiere is much more powerful
than either iMovie 4 or iDVD 4, offering professional special effects, better

control over audio and timing, output as streaming Web video, storyboard-
ing, and the ability to handle more formats of digital video. However, it’s not
anywhere near as simple to use as iMovie or iDVD. Because it’s a commer-
cial program, you’re likely to spend around $700 or so for a copy. Premiere
Pro is the right choice for those folks who know that they’re in digital video
to stay, want to grow into a professional package, and want its tight integra-
tion with other Adobe products, like After Effects.

Chapter 6: Preparing Your Computer
for CD and DVD Recording
In This Chapter
 Reclaiming space on your hard drive
 Checking for hard drive errors
 Defragmenting your hard drive
 Disabling programs that can ruin a recording
 Fine-tuning Windows and Mac OS for better recording
“I
n the beginning, there were Windows 3.1 and the 486 processor, and
many tried to record their first CD-ROMs and fell by the wayside. For
buffer underruns roamed the land, ruining those early discs because the com-
puter could not keep up with the recorder. And many threw up their hands
in anger and frustration, and they knew then that they must optimize their
systems.”
Such tales are few and far between these days because you’re probably
using a PC or Macintosh that performs much better than the 486-based
computers of old. The latest hard drives can deliver data much faster than a
recorder can burn it, and today’s burnproof recorders no longer fear multi-
tasking and disk-intensive applications. So why do I dedicate a chapter to
optimization and fine-tuning? I have two important reasons (besides the
fact that I needed a topic for Chapter 6).
First, you may not be lucky enough to own only the cutting edge in hard-
ware. I own and use seven computers, and only one of them is state of the
art (meaning that it’s less than a year old). If both your computer and your
drive have been hanging around for 3 years or more, optimization is just as
important as ever.
Second, optimization helps your entire system run like the Six Million Dollar
Man: better, faster, and farther. I recommend many of these steps even if
your computer doesn’t sport a CD or DVD recorder right now — you’ll
thank me the next time you open Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.
Therefore, this chapter is designed to help you tinker and tune. Just hand
me a wrench and the proper screwdriver from time to time, and your com-
puter will soon be running at its best.
807

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
Creating Elbowroom
No matter how you cut it, 700MB of data takes up a fair chunk of hard drive
territory — and that’s just what you store on a CD-R or CD-RW disc. As you
may have read in earlier chapters, a DVD-R or DVD+R disc can hold 4.7GB,
and a double-sided DVD-RAM disc can store as much as 9.4GB! You can see
how hard drive space can become important very quickly, and you never
seem to have enough. You find that your data expands to fill your drive,
regardless of the size (rather like The Blob). In this section, I cover a number
of tips and tricks that can help you clear space for your next burning session.
’Course, you could just buy a bigger hard drive
Although a bigger hard drive is the likely option for the fine folks living in
the Gates mansion, I bet that you would rather conserve space, reduce clut-
ter, and just keep your current drive. Besides the space that you need to
temporarily store the data or audio that you want to record, the following
two other important temporary files take up space behind the scenes:
✦Temp files that are used by your recording software: If you’re recording
in Disc-at-Once mode, for example, your software is likely to create a tem-
porary image file of the entire disc — this process typically takes as much
space as the data itself!
✦Virtual memory: All versions of Windows (as well as Mac OS 9.2 and
Mac OS X) use territory on your hard drive as virtual memory, which
is storage space for all those 0s and 1s that don’t fit into the physical
RAM that’s installed in your system. (Ever wonder how a computer with
64MB RAM can run a 10MB program that opens 256MB files? That’s vir-
tual memory at work.) Figure 6-1 shows how limited your system becomes
if virtual memory is disabled. I talk more about virtual memory through-
out the rest of this chapter.
As you may have guessed from the word temporary, these files are deleted
after the recording has finished or the additional virtual memory space is
no longer needed. (Insert ominous chord here.) However, good people, not
all programs are as tidy in cleaning up behind themselves. Shame!

Locate unnecessary stuff
If you’ve ever deleted programs and data files manually from your computer,
you know that you’re waltzing in a potential minefield, and you’re a prime
candidate for this important Mark’s Maxim:
Never — never — delete files willy-nilly!
(By the way, “willy-nilly” is a nontechnical term for opening Windows Explorer
and simply deleting some files or an entire folder.) Luckily, programs that are
both built into your operating system and are available separately at your
neighborhood computer store can help you remove accumulated hard drive
crud safely.
First, though, you can kiss the following files goodbye without sending your
computer into a coma:
✦Demos, samples, and Aunt Harriet’s fruitcake recipe: First things first:
Get rid of those 10-year-old game demos and one-shot software installa-
tions that you’ll never need again! Naturally, you should drag any unnec-
essary documents that you have created to the Recycle Bin or Trash —
I mean, how many Top Ten joke listings should you save? Anyway, after
you decide what to trash, choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel➪Add/
Remove Programs to display the dialog box that is shown in Figure 6-2.
(You should always use this method to delete a program in Windows!)
Click the program that you want to delete from the list, and click the
Remove button to start things moving.

✦The contents of your Trash or Recycle Bin: Hey, you didn’t want these
files anyway, and they already have one foot in the Great Beyond! To
clear the space in Windows, right-click the Recycle Bin icon and select
Empty Recycle Bin from the menu that appears. In Mac OS 9.2, choose
Special➪Empty Trash; in Mac OS X, choose Finder➪Empty Trash.
✦TBR: That’s an acronym of my own — I guess I just snapped from all
these silly technobabble terms. It stands for typical browser refuse: the
images, Web pages, and sound files that your browser stores in its cache
to speed things along when you reload a page. Luckily, shoveling this
stuff out the door is easy because both Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator allow you to purge their cache directories. (In Internet Explorer,
click Tools➪Internet Options, click the Delete Files button, and click the
OK button to confirm that you want to sweep up the place.) If you’re a
big-time Web walker, you may be surprised at the sheer amount of
space you can reclaim!
Let the wizard do it!
Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic The Hobbit will agree: Dwarves would much
rather leave the heavy work to the burglar or the wizard! If your system is
running Windows 98 or later, you can turn to the Disk Cleanup Wizard to
help you automate the removal of accumulated disk gunk.
To run the Disk Cleanup Wizard in Windows XP, follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk Cleanup.
Geez, can the friendly folks in Redmond hide useful stuff like this any
farther under the rug?
2. If you have more than one hard drive on your system, select Drive C:
from the drop-down list box and click the OK button.
3. Windows displays the Disk Cleanup dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-3.
As you can see, you save quite a bit of space here! Click the OK button
to begin the cleanup.
4. Click the Yes button to assure Windows (which is often slightly para-
noid) that you do indeed want to delete files.
Sit back and watch while the wizard safely sweeps your system clean. Neat!
(And yes, Virginia, I bet Dumbledore could do just as good a job.)
Call in the professionals
I heartily recommend two commercial programs that can help you clean up
either a PC running Windows or a Macintosh running Mac OS 9.2/Mac OS X.
Figure 6-4 illustrates Norton CleanSweep for the PC, from Symantec (www.
symantec.com) — it offers a high level of safety. I especially like the feature
that locates and deletes temporary, zero-length, and duplicate files that can
nibble away at your free space.

Checking under the Rug
On the Macintosh side, I recommend Spring Cleaning, from Aladdin Systems
(www.aladdinsys.com), which does everything from uninstalling old programs
to zapping browser cache files.
Checking under the Rug
Your computer may be hiding something from you: No, I’m not talking about
a winning lottery ticket or a love affair with a coffee machine, but rather nasty
errors on your hard drive that may be robbing you of both free space and
performance. If you don’t look for these errors, I can guarantee that they
won’t leap up and identify themselves (except, of course, those errors that
continue to grow worse and eventually cause you to lose files and data per-
manently). Before you burn a disc — or, for that matter, once every couple
of days — running your computer’s disk diagnostics program takes care of
anything that may be hiding under the rug.

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
These errors fall into the following categories:
✦Logical errors: These are the most common file problems, and they’re
usually caused by improper shutdowns, power outages, and misbehav-
ing programs. If you have already encountered lost clusters and cross-
linked files, you have already met (and hopefully fixed) logical errors on
your hard drive. Most logical errors can be solved with the right software.
✦Physical errors: These errors, on the other hand, are caused by a mal-
function in the hard drive itself. The classic cause of physical errors is the
infamous and frightening hard drive crash, where either your entire drive
croaks or the magnetic platters inside are damaged. Physical errors usu-
ally can’t be corrected by the layman. If you’re willing to spend a rather
unbelievable amount of money, some companies can fix the innards of
your hard drive, but in most cases, it’s simply not worth the effort. There-
fore, if your drive is acting up and returning physical errors, I strongly
recommend that you back up now — this second! — and buy a replace-
ment drive.
Fixing your drive the Windows way
Checking a drive in Windows 98 and Windows Me is child’s play, thanks to a
program named ScanDisk; use it at least once a day to fix any logical errors
that may appear on your drive. Follow these steps to put ScanDisk through
its paces:
1. Choose Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪ScanDisk.
2. Use the drop-down list box to select the hard drive that you want to
scan.
3. Select the Standard radio button to check for logical errors, or select
the Thorough radio button to check for both logical and physical
errors.
Be prepared for a long haul if you choose Thorough, especially on
today’s huge hard drives.
4. Click the Start button to begin the scanning process.
5. After the disk has been checked and any logical errors squashed,
ScanDisk displays the results.
6. Click the Close button to return to Windows and your work.
In Windows 2000 and Windows XP, ScanDisk has been integrated into the
operating system, so you can check a disk for errors from the drive’s
Properties dialog box. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.
2. Right-click the icon for the hard drive that you want to scan, and
choose Properties from the menu that appears.
3. Click the Tools tab to display the panel that is shown in Figure 6-5.
4. Click the Check Now button to display the Check dialog box.

only every 6 months or so. Otherwise, I leave the Scan for and Attempt
Recovery of Bad Sectors check box deselected.

Fixing things with Mac OS 9.2
In the Macintosh world, with Mac OS 9.2, Apple includes a drive checkup
program named Disk First Aid. Follow these steps to use it:
1. From the Mac OS 9.2 desktop, double-click your hard drive and then
choose Applications (Mac OS 9)➪Utilities➪Disk First Aid to launch the
application (see Figure 6-6).
2. Click the icon for the hard drive that you want to scan.
3. Click the Repair button.
Disk First Aid automatically checks the selected drive and repairs any
errors.
To repair some errors on your startup disk, you may have to boot your
Macintosh by using your Mac OS 9.2 CD-ROM. To do this, insert the
CD-ROM, restart your Mac, and hold down C throughout the boot
process.
4. Done? Choose File➪Quit to return to the Mac OS desktop.

Avoiding Fragments
If the Repair Disk button is disabled, you have to reboot your Macin-
tosh by using your Mac OS X Installation CD-ROM. To do this, insert 
the CD-ROM, restart your Mac, and hold down C throughout the boot
process. After the first installation screen appears, click the Installer
button and click the Open Disk Utility button, and you should be able to
repair your hard drive.
4. Done? Choose File➪Quit to return to the Mac OS X desktop.
Most commercial disk utility programs can also check your drive. One
example is Disk Doctor, which comes with Symantec Norton Utilities for
both Windows and the Macintosh.
Avoiding Fragments
It’s time to cover another insidious problem that can rob your computer of
the performance that you need for recording: hard drive fragmentation. Geez,
more buzzwords.
I could get into a convoluted description of sectors, files, and your com-
puter’s operating system — but this is a For Dummies book, so I distill all
that hoorah into a sidebar. If you’re interested about what you’re doing and
why fragmentation occurs, read the sidebar “Defragmenting For Dummies.”
Otherwise, just remember this important truth: Defragmenting your hard
drive is A Good Thing to do once a month or so, and it increases the overall
performance of your computer (including, naturally, your recording projects).
Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000, and Windows XP all come with a defragment-
ing program named (strangely enough) Disk Defragmenter, but Mac OS 9.2
and Mac OS X don’t have a defragmenting program. Mac owners, I feel your
pain, and I recommend using a commercial program like Speed Disk (another
part of Norton Utilities, from Symantec), which works under both Mac OS 9.2
and Mac OS X.
Therefore, follow these steps to defragment your drive in Windows XP:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk
Defragmenter.
2. The Disk Defragmenter displays the window that is shown in Figure 6-8.
Click the target drive in the list to select it.
Do you have more than one hard drive? If so, defragmenting all of them is
a good idea (especially if you want to record files from multiple locations).
If you’re pressed for time, however, always choose Drive C because this
drive usually holds both Windows and your virtual memory swap file.
3. Click the Defragment button to begin the defragmentation process.
You can continue to work on other things, but defragmenting takes much
less time if you can leave your PC alone while it’s defragmenting. (For
this reason, I always defragment during the night, when I’m generally
not using my computers.)

Defragmenting For Dummies
No matter how cool I think defragmenting is, I just
don’t have enough material to write a For Dummies
book about it. I know for sure because I pitched that
idea to the publisher before I wrote this book. 
So consider this sidebar your personal copy of
Defragmenting For Dummies (definitely the short-
est book in the famous series). It has no table of
contents, no Part of Tens, no index, and not a single
figure or table — but I do tell you what’s happening
behind the curtain.
Why do files fragment? Well, when you delete files
from and move files around on your computer, you
open areas on your hard drive for new files.
However, these open areas aren’t always big
enough to hold a new file in one piece, so your com-
puter and hard drive work together to save files in
pieces called segments. For example, if you’re
copying a 200MB video clip to your hard drive so
that you can record it later, your drive may not have
200MB worth of contiguous, unbroken open space
on it — that’s when the file is broken up into seg-
ments. Perhaps 20MB can fit in one place on your
drive, 100MB can fit in another, and so on. When the
time comes to read the file, Windows or Mac OS X
automatically and invisibly reassembles the file and
sends it to the proper place. All is well, right?
It is until your drive becomes badly fragmented and
little chunks of thousands of different files are
spread across the surface of your hard drive! If a
file is saved as a contiguous whole, your drive can
read it efficiently and quickly. On the other hand, it
takes a significantly longer time for Windows or the
Mac operating system to rebuild a file that’s made
up of dozens of segments in several different loca-
tions. We humans see this lag time in the form of
decreased performance and a delay of a second or
two. When you’re burning a disc, however (espe-
cially on an older computer with a fast CD or DVD
recorder), that drop in performance can result in
creating a coaster. Scratch another disc, unless
you’re using a burnproof drive.
You can solve this problem by running your defrag-
menting program. This slick piece of software reads
each file on your hard drive, combines the segments
to form a contiguous file, and then saves the
reassembled file to the drive in one piece. Plus, most
defragmenting programs can also rearrange the
locations of your files so that the programs and data
that you use most often load the fastest. When the
program is finished, your hard drive is a smooth, effi-
cient vista — a storage wonderland. (I think perhaps
I need to stop now before I wax too enthusiastic.)

Avoiding the Unexpected
Avoiding the Unexpected
“Okay, Mark, how am I supposed to predict the unpredictable?” Good point —
I don’t mean the really unexpected things in life, like a hard drive crash or an
honest politician. Instead, I’m talking about that doggone screen saver that
pops up while you’re burning or that silly guy in the next office who bothers
you with constant network messages. Things like these are also unexpected,
and they can easily trash a disc.
In this section, I talk about a number of automatic features and functions of
Windows, Mac OS 9.2, and Mac OS X that you can disable before you start
recording. These items can help you avoid these irritating interruptions.
Scheduled events and scripts
Windows allows you to set up scheduled events that run automatically at a
certain time or periodically during the day. Although this feature can be a
great convenience, I recommend that you disable any scripted or scheduled
tasks if you’re set to record.
Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000, and Windows XP allow you to temporarily
pause scheduled tasks by pausing the Task Scheduler. In Windows XP, choose
Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Scheduled Tasks to dis-
play the Task Scheduler, as shown in Figure 6-9. Choose Advanced➪Pause
Task Scheduler. After you have finished recording, you can display the Task
Scheduler again and restart the schedule: Choose Advanced➪Continue Task
Scheduler, and click the Close button in the upper-right corner to banish
the Scheduler from your screen.
Although the Mac operating systems don’t have a built-in task scheduler,
you should disable any scheduling software that you may have added
before you record; check the program’s documentation to determine how to
disable or pause automatic events.
Network access
Planning on using your recorder on your office or home network? All that
network hard drive space makes this idea appealing, but I don’t recommend
recording a CD or DVD from a network source unless you have no other
Figure 6-9:
Pause any
scheduled
tasks that
might
interrupt a
recording.
817

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
choice. Depending on the traffic your network carries, your file transfer rate
may slow to a crawl, and your recording may be interrupted by network
messages from your administrator and other users. Someone halfway across
the building may decide to copy that unabridged electronic text of Beowulf
that you have stored on your hard drive.
Worst of all, you may hit a number of hidden snags: restricted or password-
protected file access, network drives that suddenly disappear because they
were brought down, and so on. When the network suddenly displays a
“dropped connection” dialog box in the middle of your recording session,
you have (to put it delicately) hosed a disc.
I’ll anchor this warning with a Mark’s Maxim:
Rebooting and recording directly from your local computer’s hard drive
is the best idea; don’t log on to your network unless you’re sure of its
stability.
However, if you absolutely have to use network storage for your recording
(for example, if you have a discless workstation at your desk), follow these
suggestions:
✦Buy a burnproof recorder. Burnproof technology prevents a ruined
recording that’s caused by a sluggish network and usually avoids opti-
cal tragedy even if the recording program is interrupted with a network
message. (Naturally, though, it can’t fix a disconnected network drive!)
✦Record by using packet writing. I recommend Roxio Drag-to-Disc for
packet writing, and I cover it in Chapter 10 of Book IV. Even older
recorders that don’t offer burnproof protection can successfully burn 
a disc on a busy network when you use Drag-to-Disc.
✦Record early in the morning or late at night. An empty office generally
means an empty network, with far fewer delays and intrusions from other
network users.
Power-saving mode and screen savers
Computers are now sophisticated pieces of equipment — they can even fall
asleep or switch to standby mode if their lazy humans take a soda or coffee
break. Allowing your computer to switch to these power-saving modes is
normally a great idea: You save electricity without having to shut down
your machine. When you’re burning a disc, though, your computer may not
recognize the activity — after all, you’re not moving your mouse — and a
switch to a power-saving mode can be disastrous! I recommend that you
either disable your computer’s power-saving or standby mode (especially if
you’re recording on a laptop computer) or allow 30 minutes (for CDs) or 60
minutes (for DVDs) to elapse before it kicks in.
The same is true of those cool screen savers that keep boredom at bay.
They’re neat, and I have more than 50 on my own machine, but whenever I
use a screen saver, I set it for at least a 60-minute period of inactivity before
it starts. This period allows me to complete any recording session before
the light show starts and the fun begins.
818

Book IV
Chapter 6

Computer for CD 
and DVD Recording
Avoiding the Unexpected
In Windows XP, you can configure both your power-saving mode and your
screen saver activity delay from the Control Panel. First, click the Power
Options Control Panel icon to display the settings that are shown in Fig-
ure 6-10 and set both the Turn Off Hard Disks and System Standby drop-
down list boxes to Never. To change the inactivity delay for your screen
saver, open the Display Control Panel and click the Screen Saver tab. Click
in the Wait text box and type 30 or 60 for the number of minutes.
If you find that you are continually using the Power Options Control Panel,
set up two power schemes. You can then switch back and forth between
power-saving and recording modes.
For Macintosh owners who use Mac OS 9.2, click the Apple menu and choose
Control Panels. Then, click the Energy Saver menu item to display the dialog
box that’s shown in Figure 6-11. Move all the sliders to Never, and click the
Close button in the upper-left corner.

If you’re using Mac OS X, click the Apple menu and choose System Prefer-
ences. Then, click the Energy Saver icon to display the panel that’s shown
in Figure 6-12. Move the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is Inactive For
slider to Never, and deselect the Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible
check box. Click the Close button in the upper-left corner.
Remember, these energy-saving features in Windows and Mac OS are quite
beneficial — just not when you’re recording. Don’t forget to restore your
energy-saving settings when you’re done burning!
Terrific Tips and Tweaks
Although I get into specific recording tips throughout the rest of this book, 
I beseech you to pay heed to these general tricks that apply to all types of
recordings.
Avoid disk-intensive, memory-hungry behemoths
Follow this advice while you’re recording, anyway. In other words, if you
don’t have a burnproof drive, launching programs like Microsoft Outlook,
Adobe Photoshop, or Macromedia Flash during that burn is not A Good
Idea. They simply consume too much system memory and thrash your hard
drive too actively to cooperate well with optical storage.
Give your recording software some elbowroom
Is Mac OS 9.2 your recording environment of choice? Do you have at least
64MB RAM? Then I strongly recommend that you reserve additional appli-
cation memory for your recording software, which can use the memory for
all sorts of good things.

Terrific Tips and Tweaks
If you’re using Mac OS 9.2, follow these steps to increase the memory that is
allocated to your recording program:
1. From the Finder, click the recording program’s icon once to high-
light it.
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
3. Click Show, and choose Memory to display the dialog box that’s shown
in Figure 6-13.
4. In the Preferred Size text box, enter a larger amount of RAM.
As a rule, I tend to double the figure, but you should add at least
1024KB, or 1MB, of extra memory.
5. Click the Close button to close the dialog box and save your changes.
Speed up your hard drive
Here’s a great tweak for PC owners running Windows 98 and Windows Me.
As explained in the following steps, this tweak can increase your hard
drive’s performance:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on your desktop, and choose
Properties from the menu that appears.
2. Click the Performance tab, and click the File System button to display
the File System Properties dialog box (see Figure 6-14).
3. Select Network Server from the Typical Role of This Computer drop-
down list box. Drag the Read-Ahead Optimization slider to Full (if it’s
not there already).
4. To save your changes, click the OK button to exit the File System
Properties dialog box and click the OK button again to return to the
desktop.
Note that you may have to reboot your system after this step.

Beware the flagged-out laptop
Laptop owners can be proud of their computers, but a loss of battery power
has caused the premature demise of many a recording session. If you’re using
a laptop to burn a CD or DVD while you’re on the road, use your AC adapter
if at all possible — and if not, make doggone sure that your battery is fully
charged and can last for at least 30 minutes. Also, remember that most lap-
tops automatically switch to standby mode if their battery power levels drop
below a certain point, so don’t cut things too closely!

A
t this point, you may be ready to throw caution to the wind and start
burning ones and zeros — and I can’t say that I blame you because I
cover a huge amount of ground in this minibook, and you may not have
even recorded a single disc yet! However, I want to devote just one more
chapter to preparations: in this case, steps you should take to make your
finished discs
✦Faster during loading and reading
✦Better organized
✦Easier to use
✦Easier to search
See? This stuff is worth another chapter’s wait. I promise! I especially rec-
ommend that you take care to follow the guidelines in this chapter when
you’re creating a disc for distribution or creating an archive disc that you
will use often over the next decade or two.
Picking a Jazzy Format
The formats that a recorder can burn are criteria you could use to tell just
how high a particular recorder ranks on the evolutionary scale. In this sec-
tion, I show you how best to use those different formats. Remember: Certain
formats are the right choice for certain jobs.
Data, lovely data
Data — pure binary ones and zeroes. Your computer lives on the stuff, and
that’s what data CDs and DVDs are for. If you’re storing only data or program
files — no digital audio — this is the disc format for you. These discs fall into
one of two standards: the Yellow Book (for data CD-ROMs manufactured in a
823

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
factory) and the Orange Book (for data CD-ROMs burned with your CD
recorder). Some specialized types of discs I briefly mention in Chapter 5 of
Book IV — for example, DVD movies, Video CDs, and photo slideshow
CD-ROMs — are specialized types of data discs.
Use a data CD or DVD when you want to
✦Store computer files and programs in the same folder or directory hier-
archy as on your hard drive.
✦Take advantage of the maximum storage space for data.
✦Run programs directly from the disc.
✦Load data (like a Word document or a spreadsheet) directly from the disc.
✦Save multimedia files, like digital video and digital photographs, as pure
data.
In case you’re wondering, your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is
the best playback solution for any kind of disc because it can read both
audio CDs and data CD-ROMs (or DVD-ROMs) without blinking. Your audio
CD player can’t return the favor, though. Don’t try to read a standard data
CD-ROM in an audio CD player: If you hear anything, it’s likely to be a
screeching wail that will drive away every living thing within a square mile.
I’m not kidding; even plants try to escape.
Sweet audio for the ears
Unlike a data disc, a disc recorded in audio CD format — also called Red
Book — can store only one type of material (in this case, digital audio).
However, it does this really, really well — so well, in fact, that an audio CD
player doesn’t recognize anything unless it’s either Red Book or a subset of
Red Book, like a CD Extra disc.
You can use a number of different sources for audio tracks, including
✦MP3 files
✦WAV files (a Microsoft Windows standard)
✦AIFF or AAC files (Macintosh standards)
✦WMA files (another Windows standard)
Unlike with a tape cassette, however, you can’t record your voice directly
onto an audio CD. Instead, you have to record your material (usually as an
MP3 or WAV file) and then record that disc in audio CD format later.
Are you a musician who uses a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (or MIDI
for short) instrument or composes in MIDI format? You can record your
compositions on an audio CD as well, but you still have to create an MP3 or
a WAV digital audio file on your hard drive with your MIDI software. After
the music is in one of these digital formats, you can burn it to an audio CD
just like any other MP3 or WAV audio. (Of course, the latest MIDI composi-
tion programs can do all this work behind the scenes, allowing you to
record your masterpiece to an audio CD from a menu command.)
824

Book IV
Chapter 7
Making Choices
Before Your 
Recording Session
Picking a Jazzy Format
Remember that older standard audio CD players can’t read CD-RWs. Use
only CD-R media when you’re recording Red Book CDs unless you’re sure
that the finished discs will be played only on an audio CD player that sup-
ports CD-RW media! Time for a Mark’s Maxim that can save you time and
trouble:
Use an old-fashioned CD-R whenever you want to record a disc for a
standard audio CD player!
Straddle the line with mixed mode
There’s always an exception, right? (Just like those spelling rules you used to
memorize.) In this case, you do have a way to record both data and digital
Red Book audio on the same recordable CD. I’m talking about mixed-mode
format, which is used for multimedia discs and games that need programs,
digital video, and high-quality audio on the same compact disc. As shown in
Figure 7-1, mixed-mode discs have two tracks: The first contains data, and the
successive tracks are digital audio. Pretty sassy, don’t you think?
Because that first track is a data track, however, you still can’t play a mixed-
mode disc in your audio CD player. This is the opposite of another type of
dual-purpose wonder, the CD Extra disc, where the audio tracks come first
in a separate session (think of a chapter in a book), followed by data tracks
in another session. You can play a CD Extra disc in your audio CD player.
825
Man, this band is horrible!
Okay, let me get this straight: You have just recorded
your first audio CD from that huge selection of Slim
Whitman MP3 files you’re so proud of, and the burn
seemed to go like butter. You got no error mes-
sages, the songs sounded perfect when you pre-
viewed them, and your new drive churned the disc
out in less than three minutes. Excellent! Hold on,
though — when you try playing your new disc in
your car’s CD player, you get either a screeching
wail that sounds like a catfight under an outhouse,
or nothing. I mean, absolutely zip. What went wrong?
This is the classic of all classic problems: You mis-
takenly recorded a data disc format rather than the
audio CD (Red Book) format! Those files are still in
MP3 format, and they can be played by using
Winamp or another MP3 player program — but only
on your computer. To play those songs with your
audio CD player, you have to record them again. This
time, make sure that you choose Red Book or digital
audio or audio CD format (whatever your recording
software calls it) when you set up the recording.
Alternatively, you may have recorded an MP3
music disc, which is very similar in format to the
data disc I just described. However, these discs are
now supported by many personal CD players, home
stereo systems, and car audio systems. The advan-
tage to an MP3 music disc is the storage space you
get. Because the songs are recorded in their exist-
ing MP3 form, they take up a lot less space than the
same songs recorded in Red Book (digital audio)
format. Unfortunately, if the audio CD player you’re
using doesn’t support MP3 music discs, the effect
is usually the same as trying to play a regular com-
puter data disc.
Oh, one other possibility exists: If your audio CD
player doesn’t recognize your new CD but your
computer’s CD-ROM drive (or your recorder) does
play it, you have rebelled against tradition and used
a CD-RW rather than a CD-R. Of course, this par-
ticular rebellion is in vain if you’re using an older
audio CD player because a player that’s four years
old or older probably can’t read a CD-RW. However,
that same disc should play fine in a newer audio CD
player that does support CD-RW media. (And come
to think of it, you haven’t really wasted a disc
because you can reformat that CD-RW and use it
again. Whew!)

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
Why aren’t all discs recorded in mixed-mode format? Of course, there’s not
much point in it if you’re recording only files and programs or recording
only digital audio. Other caveats apply:
✦They’re less operating system-friendly. Older versions of DOS, Windows,
the Mac operating system, and UNIX can’t read mixed-mode discs. (Then
again, DOS is fading into an indistinct memory for most of us; I use a com-
mand line only for Linux these days.)
✦They’re less compatible. Older, read-only CD-ROM drives may be able
to read only the first or last track on a mixed-mode disc.
✦They have decreased capacity. Working the magic of mixed mode takes
anywhere from 3MB to 19MB of wasted space. Most of that space is
required to separate the data track from the first audio track. Therefore,
don’t use mixed-mode format if you need to squeeze every possible bit
from your recorded CD.
Use a mixed-mode CD-ROM when you want to
✦Store both computer files and digital audio on the same disc.
✦Run programs and load files directly from the data track.
Throw caution utterly to the wind with packet writing
I crow enough about packet writing — or, as it’s more properly called,
Universal Disk Format (UDF) — in this minibook that you may already know

Making Choices
Before Your 
Recording Session
“Disc-at-Once? Track-at-Once? Why Not All-at-Once?”
what you want, when you want it, using any recordable CD or DVD (rewrit-
able or not). Heck, you don’t even need to open Easy Media Creator first to
write a UDF disc with Drag-to-Disc. Just drag and drop as you always do, or
save directly to the disc from within your applications. If you can do it with
a floppy disk or a hard drive, you can do it with packet writing.
Packet writing even allows you to delete files you have written — in a fashion,
anyway. The directory entries for the files you’re deleting are overwritten,
after which the unwanted files effectively vanish. This situation can make it
appear that you’ve erased them completely and regained that space, like you
would with your hard drive, but that’s not the case. They still take up space
on the disc; you simply can’t reach them. (Of course, if you’re using a rewrit-
able disc — that’s CD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, or DVD-RAM — you can always
erase the entire disc and start over.)
Also, you should remember that all recordable media must be formatted
before you can use it with a UDF program, like Drag-to-Disc. Naturally, after
you’ve filled up a CD-R, you can’t reformat it and use it over again, but (as I
mention earlier) you can reformat a rewritable CD or DVD recorded with
packet writing. You lose all the data on the disc, of course, but that makes
packet writing a great choice for one-shot discs.
Drawbacks to packet writing? Only a couple exist: You can’t record a Red
Book audio CD by using packet writing, and older operating systems (before
Windows 98 and Mac OS 8) can’t read UDF discs without a separate loader
program.
“Disc-at-Once? Track-at-Once? Why Not All-at-Once?”
If you really want to act like a computer technotype at your next party, walk
over to a group of your friends and jovially inquire, “So, folks, which record-
ing mode do you use with your audio CDs?” It always gets me a laugh. (I don’t
get invited to many parties.)
Anyway, this question is indeed a valid one. The recording mode you use
helps determine the compatibility of your finished disc and how much data
or audio it can contain. Therefore, I cover the three common recording
modes now so that you’re ready to answer my question if we attend the
same gala bash.
Meet you at the track
In Track-at-Once recording mode (or, as it’s technically known, CD-ROM
Mode 1), each data or audio track is kept primly separate from the others:
No co-ed mingling here! As shown in Figure 7-2, your recorder turns off the
laser write head between tracks.
On the positive side, Track-at-Once mode is supported on every recorder, no
matter how old, and can be read on any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. That’s
why it’s the default recording mode used by most recording programs.
827

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
Unfortunately, those gaps left by the laser when it toggles off can cause a dis-
tinctive click noise between each track on an audio CD — whether you hear it
depends on the audio CD player, but it can be excruciatingly irritating. There-
fore, Track-at-Once is best used for data CD-ROMs.
Do it all at once
Disc-at-Once recording mode is the best pick for audio CDs because your
recorder’s laser is never turned off, and the entire disc is written at once (as
illustrated in Figure 7-3). You don’t hear a click between tracks, no matter
what type of audio CD player you use.

Disc-at-Once mode has three drawbacks:
✦Truly antique CD recorders (ones that are older than five years or so)
can’t write in Disc-at-Once mode, so if you own an older drive and you
try to select Disc-at-Once in your recording software, you will probably
find that you can’t select it. 
✦Your disc takes longer to record in Disc-at-Once mode.
✦Disc-at-Once recording may occupy more temporary hard drive space
because — depending on your recording software — your computer
may have to create an image file of the entire disc before it can begin
burning.
Multipurpose multisession
Multisession recording (or to be technically correct, CD-ROM/XA Mode 2)
allows you to add more than one separate session to a disc, each of which
can be read just like a different CD, as shown in Figure 7-4. You can record
sessions at different times, too, which makes multisession recording partic-
ularly handy for incremental recordings over weeks or months.
Again, compatibility is an issue: Multisession mode is not supported on
many older, read-only CD-ROM drives, and you need a separate program
that can switch between sessions to read all the material on the disc. Also,
multisession discs can’t be properly read in audio CD players.

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
Long Filenames Are Your Friends
While I’m discussing the decisions you must make before recording a data
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, I think that now is the right time to mention the five
major file systems. A file system is a specific set of naming conventions and
a data layout that . . . whoops, there I go again, letting loose the program-
mer technical troll within me. (Sorry about that.)
To keep this simple, a file system determines
✦What type of computer can read your disc
✦The allowable filenames and their length
✦The total number of subdirectories (or folders) that can appear on the
disc and what arrangement they can take
The five major file systems are
✦Microsoft Joliet: Supported since Windows 95, Joliet is now by far the
most common file system used on PC CD-ROMs. Joliet provides the long
filenames and folder names that the Windows crowd now finds indispen-
sable, and those names can include niceties like periods, spaces, and
most of the characters on your keyboard. A notable exception is the \
(backslash) key, so don’t try to use it. If you’re burning a disc on a PC for
a PC running Windows, you have little reason to use anything else.
✦UDF: Universal Disk Format is a fancier name for packet writing, but it’s
also a file system. UDF is usually the file system of choice for burning
data DVDs and DVD-Video discs because it can handle individual files
over 1GB with aplomb.
✦HFS: If you own a Macintosh, most of your Mac-only discs use the Hier-
archical File System (HFS). Some programs allow a Windows system to
recognize and read HFS discs (and, in the same vein, you can find Mac
extensions that allow Mac OS 8 and earlier to read Joliet discs). Both
Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X can read Joliet discs without any help, thank
you very much.
✦Hybrid: Hybrid discs contain both a Joliet session and an HFS session
and can be read on both PCs and Macs.
✦ISO 9660: Finally, I come to the oldest file system still in use. ISO 9660
has been around since the dawn of the CD-ROM, and virtually every
operating system ever shipped can read it (including heretics like UNIX,
Linux, Solaris, and OS/2 Warp). Unfortunately, this high level of compati-
bility is caused by a strict file and folder naming convention, so you
don’t find long filenames on an ISO 9660 disc. (You’re back to the DOS
standard of eight-character filenames and three-character extensions.)
Also, you can store far fewer files in each directory.
Which file system should you use? Luckily, this question is one that basically
decides itself. For a PC disc, I strongly recommend Joliet; Mac owners can
rely on HFS. Folks recording cross-platform PC or Mac discs should use the
830

The Right Way to Organize Files
Hybrid file system. Hollywood types recording DVD-Video discs should
choose UDF. Finally, if you’re looking for the widest possible distribution
among the largest number of different computers and operating systems, 
go with the perennial favorite, ISO 9660.
The Right Way to Organize Files
Yes, Virginia, there is indeed a right way to add files to a data, mixed-mode,
multisession, or UDF CD-ROM! Smart organization makes finding that cer-
tain data file for your tax return easier — which is especially useful if you’re
being audited tomorrow. No matter what sort of data you’re recording, I
urge you to heed this oft-repeated Mark’s Maxim:
Take the time to think things through!
Believe me. I have spent many years — numbering in the decades now —
organizing my data. As an author and consultant, I can’t afford to waste
time digging through an entire binder of 250 discs, trying to figure out what
was burned where. Therefore, heed my words when I say
✦Use every character of those long filenames! The ability to use long
filenames is the primary reason why you should use the Joliet file
system whenever possible. You may know now that the file named
AHARCAKE you just burned is Aunt Harriet’s fruitcake recipe, but will
you remember that after five or ten years?
✦Put your files in folders! This problem is a common one with hard
drives, too. Storing all your files in the root directory (like the C drive)
results in the worst kind of anarchy — the computer kind! Also, file sys-
tems such as ISO 9660 can handle only a certain number of files in any
directory or folder, including the root directory. The solution is simple:
Create new folders in the root directory of your CD layout and give the
new arrivals logical names, and then organize the files within the folders
(more on this in a second).
✦Use a logical file arrangement. You can help yourself in years to come
when you’re searching for files by organizing them in a Spock-like fash-
ion. That is, stick files of the same type or files that relate to the same
topic together in one folder. Or, if you have enough files and you have
the time, you can do both with folder names like Pictures of Fluffy in
2002. Think of the fun you can have! (Okay, I need another Diet Coke.)
Anyway, when you combine a folder arrangement like this with long file-
names, you can suddenly locate that needle in a haystack — and you
can still find it three years from now.
✦Use file-cataloging software. Some shareware and commercial disc cata-
loging programs can store the names and locations of every file on a
drive. These programs create indexed databases of each CD-ROM you
record. With one of these utilities, searching for a single file among 20 of
your personal library discs is as simple as using the Windows Search fea-
ture. Your operating system may also allow you to search an entire disc.
831

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
For example, Mac OS 9.2 features Sherlock, and Mac OS X includes the
powerful Find feature, shown in Figure 7-5. You can use both to search
not only for filenames but also for strings of text inside documents!
Of course, you may not want to spend this kind of time if your disc holds
two or three 200MB video clips and nothing else — but it sure helps when
you have 300 files to store on one CD-ROM.
“Thumbnails? You’re Kidding, Right?”
Not the human body kind of thumbnails! I mean the postage-stamp-size pic-
tures that represent larger JPEG, TIFF, and bitmap images stored inside a
folder. (You may have seen thumbnails in Windows XP, which can be set to
show image thumbnails within Windows Explorer.) When you use a program
like Paint Shop Pro (www.jasc.com) to generate these munchkins, you can
build a catalog of thumbnails that makes it easy to scan dozens of images in
seconds (using the most sophisticated optical hardware ever designed, the
Human Eye . . . patent pending, I’m sure). After you find the right image, just
double-click the thumbnail to load it. Figure 7-6 shows a screen chock-full of
thumbnails that I’m searching through with Paint Shop Pro.
If you also want to catalog your other multimedia files — like sound files
and video clips — you can use Jasc Media Center Plus at www.jasc.com. Like
digital images, the multimedia thumbnails in this program allow you to pre-
view your stuff by just clicking the icons.
No matter what program you use, the trick to remember is that you must
generate the program’s catalog and add it to the disc layout so that it can
be recorded along with the rest of the material. (No sense in keeping the
catalog file on your hard drive for 100 years, unless, of course, you use this
disc every day.)

Converting Files for Fun and Profit
Converting Files for Fun and Profit
Before I end this chapter, here’s a riddle for you: If you have burned a
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM of photographs from your digital camera in JPEG
format (which most cameras produce) and you’re using a Macintosh, what
have you done wrong? (Because this chapter is about convenience and ease
of use, consider that a clue.)
Technically, the answer is “nothing” — until you try to use those images in
many Macintosh applications. You see, some Mac programs that use graph-
ics favor images in TIFF format. Of course, you can use an image editor like
Photoshop to open those JPEG images and convert them to TIFF format each
time you use them, but talk about a time-wasting hassle! In this case, you
would have made a wise decision if you converted all those files to TIFF
format before you recorded them so that you can simply pop the disc into
your computer and load photos directly from it. (Don’t worry if you didn’t
get that one — it was extra credit.)
With this example in mind, I devote this last section to format conversions:
which common formats work best in what situations and which programs
work best when converting files to other formats. The idea is twofold: You
want your material in the form you use it in most, and you also want that
material to be recognizable and usable in years to come.
What exactly is a format? A computer programmer would tell you that a file
format is an arrangement of data that corresponds to specific byte posi-
tions and data element lengths. (Whew. Thank goodness my days of writing
COBOL are over.) We flesh-and-blood humans can simply think of a format
Figure 7-6:
Scanning

100 images

a few

thumbnails!
833

Part II: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Preparing for Recording
as a language that’s recognized by a program for storing and reading files.
For example, although an image may look exactly the same when it’s dis-
played in two different formats, one file may be 100K, and another may be
1MB! The difference in size is caused by the format, which determines the
way the image data is saved.
You’re likely to encounter four major species of formats when you’re record-
ing CDs:
✦Audio: Without a doubt, the two most popular — and usable — audio
formats for saving your recordings are MP3 and Windows WAV. Between
the two, MP3 is probably the best choice because WAV files can reach
colossal sizes when recording longer songs at higher-quality sampling
rates. Also, Macintosh owners have far more support on their systems
for MP3 than for WAV. To convert other sound formats to MP3, I use
Musicmatch Jukebox Plus (www.musicmatch.com), shown in Figure 7-7.
You can download the basic version for free.
✦Video: Digital video now generally resides in QuickTime MOV format,
Microsoft AVI format, or MPEG format — and surprisingly enough, I’m
again not recommending the Microsoft standard. Instead, I archive my
video clips in MPEG format, which is recognized by just about every
editor on the planet. You can be certain that future versions of your
editor will be able to import your clips for new projects. For conversion,
I use Adobe Premiere on the PC, which can import all these formats.
More expensive commercial programs can handle a wider range of less
popular formats, but because I use only the Big Three, Premiere works
fine in my case.
✦Images: For archival purposes, select JPEG, TIFF, or Windows bitmap;
the latter two don’t use compression that degrades the image, so they
offer better quality, but both TIFF and Windows bitmap images are
much larger than their JPEG counterparts. JPEG is recognized by most
image editors (and because JPEG is the format of choice for Web pages,
you have the advantage of being able to copy your archived images
directly to your Web site). On the PC side, either Paint Shop Pro (from
Jasc) or Adobe Photoshop does the conversion trick. On the Macintosh
side, use Photoshop or the classic GraphicConverter from Lemke
Software, at www.lemkesoft.de/en/index.htm (see Figure 7-8).

✦Documents: I can’t think of a better set of tools for importing, convert-
ing, and exporting all sorts of document formats than Microsoft Office
(www.microsoft.com). On both the PC and Macintosh, it can read most
of your ancient, hoary document formats for spreadsheets, word pro-
cessing files, presentations, and databases. For archival purposes, it’s a
safe bet that saving your documents in one of the standard Microsoft
formats from the Office suite of applications is a good idea.

Don’t forget that virus check!
As a final preparation before burning, I always run
Norton AntiVirus (see the Downloads page at www.
symantec.com) and check the contents of those
folders that contain the files I have selected —
especially for a disc I’m giving to someone else.
Can you think of anything more antisocial than
sending your friend a virus in a Word document or
a program file?

t’s time to crank up Easy Media Creator on your PC and find out how to
make basic data discs and audio CDs! You can consider this chapter the
bread and butter of optical recording: These types of discs are likely to make
up 90 percent of the recordings that are burned by most PCs. First, I describe
the basic steps for each procedure, and I close this chapter with step-by-
step procedures that illustrate specific tasks.
Interested in recording data and audio discs on a Macintosh? I fill in the
details on recording with Toast in Chapter 9 of Book IV.
Recording Data: Putting Files on a Disc
The first disc I ever recorded was a data CD-ROM — ah, the memories! In
fact, the first version of Easy Media Creator hadn’t been released yet, and
the primitive software that I used was anything but automatic or easy to
use. In fact, I burned a couple of useless coasters before I finally got every-
thing to work.
Just about everything has changed for the better. Easy Media Creator shields
you from as much of the drudgery of burning a disc as possible. Follow these
steps to record a basic data disc with folders and files from your PC’s hard
drive:
1. Load a blank disc into your recorder.
If you’re using a CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM disc, it should
be formatted. (See the section “Erasing a Rewritable Disc,” later in this
chapter.) Easy Media Creator detects that you have loaded a blank disc
and automatically displays the rather sexy-looking Home window (as
shown in Figure 8-1).
To run the Home window from the Start menu, choose Start➪All
Programs➪Roxio➪Roxio Easy Media Creator Home.
837

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
2. Click the funky button marked Creator Classic.
The Home program runs Creator Classic, which is the main recording
application within Easy Media Creator.
Alternately, you can click the Copy Files to Disc button under the Data
section of the Home window; this performs the same actions as Steps 2
and 3. Hey, I use either method, depending on my mood!
3. Choose File➪New Project➪Data Disc.
Easy Media Creator opens an empty data disc layout, like the one that’s
shown in Figure 8-2.

Recording Data: Putting Files on a Disc
If you would rather run Creator Classic directly from the Start menu,
choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Creator Classic.
See the folder tree that fills the top portion of the window? It operates
just like Windows Explorer, and you use it to select the folders and files
to include in your layout.
4. To open a folder and display the contents, double-click it. To move up
to the preceding directory, click the Up One Level button (which
looks like a folder with an up arrow on it).
You can also use the Select Source drop-down list box to navigate to a
specific drive or top-level folder on your system. Highlight a folder or
file that you want to add by clicking once on the name — you can high-
light several by holding down Ctrl while you click.
5. After you have highlighted the folders and files that you want to add
in the current directory, click the Add Selected Files Above to Project
button in the center of the screen.
Alternatively, you can click and hold the mouse to drag the selected icons
from the Explorer tree to the project layout display that fills the bottom
half of the window. Oh, and if you look at the bottom of the window, you
see a truly nifty bar display that tells you how many megabytes you have
used in your layout and how much space remains — programs like this
one make me proud to be a technonerd. To switch between different CD
and DVD capacities, click the Disc Size drop-down list, which is conve-
niently placed to the left of the bar display.
6. If necessary, repeat Steps 4 and 5 with other folders until all the files
that you want to add appear in the layout display (as shown in Fig-
ure 8-3).
839
The great file and folder hunt
“I know I put that file somewhere on this drive!”
Brothers and sisters, I feel your pain — searching
for one document in the midst of 50 directories and
30,000 files is not my idea of a fun way to spend an
afternoon. If you agree, click the Search for Files
button (the button with the folder and the magnify-
ing glass) next to the Select Source Files list box to
call for help from Easy Media Creator.
First, choose the drive that you want to search by
clicking the Look In drop-down list box. (Boy, those
Windows programmers in Redmond sure know
how to label their fields.) Then, select your search
criteria, as follows:
The filename: Even if you know only a part of the
filename, you can enter the part that you know in
the Named field. (Don’t forget to select the Include
Subfolders check box if you want to search the
folders below the specified location.)
A word or phrase in a file: Search for all files that
contain a certain string of text by entering the text
in the Containing Text field.
The file’s time and date stamp: Click the When Was
It Modified tab. You can specify a search for files
that were created or modified within the last week,
month, or year — alternately, click the Specify
Dates button and type the beginning and ending
dates in the From and To fields.
The size of the file: Click the What Size Is It tab, and
choose its minimum or maximum size. You can
select one of the predefined sizes (less than 100KB,
less than 1MB, or more than 1MB) or click the
Specify Size in KB button and type the target file
size yourself.
When you’re ready to go, click the Search button.
Good luck, Mighty Hunter!

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
You can drag and drop in the Project layout display, too, so it’s easy to
arrange files in different folders or in the root directory of the disc if
necessary.
Arrgh! It never fails: You’re almost finished designing your Project layout,
and your mom calls (either on the phone or from the kitchen). Luckily,
you can save your current project within Easy Media Creator. Choose
File➪Save Project, enter a filename in the File Name field, and click the
Save button. (To copy the current project under another name, choose
File➪Save Project As instead.) When you’re ready to continue with your
project, run Easy Media Creator, run Creator Classic, and then choose
File➪Open Project; highlight the project file and click the Open button to
load it.
You probably won’t be satisfied with a name like 010803_0203 for your
disc — I don’t blame you! Therefore, why not change it? Click once on
the disc name, and then change the name just like you would rename a
file on the Windows desktop. Remember that you are limited to a cer-
tain number of letters, depending on the file system that you’re using,
so keep your name short.
7. Everything squared and ready? Houston, you’re go for recording!
Click the Big Red Flaming Disc-on-Fire Burn Button on the project
layout toolbar.
The program presents the Burn Progress dialog box. For a simple data
disc, the program’s default hardware settings should work just fine.
8. Check to make sure that the correct drive and recording speed are
listed.

9. Click the Details button (to display the advanced settings that are
shown in Figure 8-4). Then click the Record Options drop-down list
box and choose Test and Write. Although it takes twice as long, Easy
Media Creator performs a test recording first, and if the test is suc-
cessful, you can perform the recording.
If a problem occurs, you save a blank disc from becoming a coaster.
After you have become comfortable with your recorder, however, I rec-
ommend that you choose Write Only and press onward.
10. You can make more than one copy of your disc by specifying the
number in the Number of Copies field on the Detailed version of the
dialog box.
11. If you can select the Buffer Underrun Prevention check box, do so
with all haste — this action turns on your drive’s support for burn-
proof recording.

How do you “test” a CD-R?
“Hang on, there — you said that I could use a 
CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R disc only once. How can
my recorder test the disc without messing it up?”
It’s easy! If you read my discussion of lasers in
Chapter 1 of Book IV, you remember that your
recorder can toggle between two power levels.
When you test a layout, your recorder acts like it’s
burning the disc, when in fact the laser is toggled
to the lower power setting. At this lower setting, the
beam doesn’t affect the dye layer (or the crystalline
layer, if you’re using a rewritable disc).
The result is a safe test: Easy Media Creator can
still detect whether it would encounter an error
while recording, but if errors are detected, you
don’t lose your blank disc!

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
12. Select or deselect the Read-Only Disc check box to specify the record-
ing method, as follows:
• Deselecting the check box leaves the disc open so that you can
record more data later. The current session is closed so that the disc
can be read in any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. However, the disc
itself is not finalized, so you can write additional sessions later. If this
field is grayed out, either your drive or the file system that you
chose doesn’t support this option.
• Selecting the check box closes the disc, so you can’t write any more
data. (You can consider it as “write-protecting” the disc.)
13. Click the Burn button to start the wheels turning!
If you used the Windows Start menu method of running the Home window
and you haven’t already loaded a blank disc in the recorder, the program
automatically ejects the tray and demands that you feed it one.
The Burn Disc Progress dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5, 
and you can watch the fun. After the disc has been recorded, you can
optionally run Label Creator or just exit and try out your new toy.
Congratulations! You’re the proud creator of a brand-new data disc.
Recording Your Music
Remember to rip and record only what you’ve bought — or what’s legally
available on the Internet. Likewise, don’t copy commercial software and
blithely hand it over to those who didn’t pay a penny for it. I won’t turn into a
lawyer and start talking unintelligible legalese, but honor the copyrights of
the musicians and software developers that worked the long hours. Please.

Recording Your Music
These days, I find myself recording audio CDs primarily from MP3 files —
however, Easy Media Creator can also do the following:
✦Copy individual tracks from existing CDs (in a process sweetly called
ripping).
✦Copy an entire existing audio CD. (Find out more on this in the next sec-
tion, where I show you how to clone things with Disc Copier.)
With your permission, then, I show you how to create the Ultimate
Motorhead Mix CD (or, if you prefer, the Absolute Best of Alvin and the
Chipmunks):
1. Load a blank disc into your recorder, which automatically displays
the Home screen.
Yes, I’m saying it again: Do not use a CD-RW disc when recording a standard
audio CD for use in a stereo system unless the player is designed to play 
CD-RW discs! Are you getting tired of that sentence yet? (How about these
italicized sentences?) Anyway, you can’t say that I didn’t warn you.
2. Click the Creator Classic button in the Home window.
Again, you can skip this foolishness by clicking the Create New Audio
CD button under the Music section of the Home window. This performs
the same actions as Steps 2 and 3.
3. Choose File➪New Project➪Audio CD.
If you would rather create an MP3 music CD (and your audio CD player
supports MP3 music discs), choose File➪New Project➪MP3 Disc instead.
You can add up to 700MB of MP3 files from your hard drive — that’s
because an MP3 music disc is actually a data disc (and not a true audio
CD). MP3 music discs store MP3 songs in their native format, so you can
get several hours of listening pleasure on a single CD! (Remember, how-
ever, that you can’t play an MP3 music disc in an audio CD player that
doesn’t support the format — you’ll hear absolutely zilch.)
4. Now it’s time to add tracks from the Easy Media Creator screen that’s
shown in Figure 8-6. You can select one of the following options:
• Add MP3, WAV, or WMF files: Use the Explorer view in the upper-left
portion of the screen to locate folders where your audio files are
stored.
• Rip tracks from another CD: Load a disc into either your CD-ROM or
DVD-ROM drive, and then select that drive from the Select Source
drop-down list box to display the tracks. To load other tracks from
other audio CDs, repeat the process.
If you don’t have a track listing for the disc that you have loaded, just
double-click a track in the Explorer view in the upper-right portion of
the screen. Easy Media Creator displays the Preview player, and you can
listen to the track before you add it to your layout.
5. Click once on each track that you want to add.
To choose more than one track from the same source, hold down Ctrl as
you select each track name.
843

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
6. After you have selected your tracks from the source folder or disc,
click the Add Selected Files Above to Project button (which looks like
a document with an arrow pointing downward) in the center of the
window to add the tracks to your project layout. (Alternately, you can
drag the music files from the Explorer view and drop them on the
layout at the bottom of the screen.)
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 until your track layout is complete — or
until you have packed every second of your blank disc!
You can tell how much time you have used on your disc by checking the
Estimated Time bar at the bottom of the screen. This bar tells you how
much time the current track list needs and the remaining time that you
can fill on both a 74-minute and 80-minute CD-R disc.
8. Arrange the tracks in your layout as you like by clicking a track name
to highlight it and dragging it to the new position in the track list.
9. Although it’s not necessary, I recommend that you enter both a name
for your new disc in the New Disc Title field and the artist’s name in
the Artist Name field.
Need to change or add a name for a track? Just click the entry to high-
light it, and click again to edit the New Disc Title field.
10. Ready to burn those hip 0s and 1s? Click the Big Red Flaming Disc-on-
Fire Button on the project layout toolbar.
If you’re loading tracks from an audio CD, Easy Media Creator prompts
you to load the pesky CD when necessary so that the tracks can be
copied and converted.

to use CD-Text), select the Read-Only Disc check box.
Many audio CD players (and most CD-player programs for your com-
puter) display CD-Text while the disc is playing. This includes the disc
name, artist name, and each track’s name.
15. Click the Burn button, you music-producing mogul! If your recorder
is empty, Easy Media Creator yells for you to load a blank disc.
The program displays the Burn Progress dialog box (which has already
popped up in Figure 8-5), allowing you to monitor the 0s and 1s as they’re
shoveled into the furnace and onto your disc. When the recording is
done, you have the choice of running Label Creator if you want to print
a fancy-looking label or a set of jewel box inserts.
Time to grab your headphones and jam to your latest creation!
Copying a Disc
In this section, I describe how you can copy an existing data disc (both
CD-ROM discs and unprotected DVD-ROM discs) or an audio CD. Rather
than take the time to crank up Easy Media Creator, Roxio provides you with
a separate program named Disc Copier; it can clone a disc by using just the
recorder. If you’re lucky enough to have either a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive
or a second recorder in the same system, you can even copy drive to drive
and whip out a copy in record time!
Follow these steps to copy a disc:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Disc Copier to display what’s
shown in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7:

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
2. Click the Source drop-down list box, and select the drive in which you
have loaded the disc that you want to copy.
It can be any drive on your system that can read a disc, including your
recorder.
3. Click the Destination drop-down list box, and select the recorder that
is to burn the disc.
Remember that it can be the same as the Source drive.
4. It’s a good idea to check the advanced settings before you begin the
copy, so click the Advanced button to display the settings shown in
Figure 8-8.
5. You can select the Test, Test then Copy, or Copy radio button. Because
I’m familiar with my equipment, I skip any testing and jump right to
the real thing. However, the Test then Copy radio button does the
trick as well (it just takes twice as long), and you won’t lose a blank
disc if something is SNAFU.
6. If you want more than one copy of the original disc, click the arrows
next to the Number of Copies field and select, well, the number of
copies!
7. Instead of burning immediately, you can also create a disc image on
your hard drive that you can use later to record the actual disc. To do
so, click the Disc Image radio button.
This is a neat trick for those with external CD or DVD recorders who
have “lent” their drive to someone else. To burn a disc from the image in
the future, run Disc Copier again and choose Disc Image or DVD-Video
Folder as your source. You find out more about disc images in the next
section (including another way to record ’em).
8. Select the Buffer Underrun Prevention check box if your drive sup-
ports burnproof recording.
9. Click the Red Disc-on-Fire button at the right end of the toolbar to
unleash the fearsome power of your laser, and be prepared to load a
blank disc if you’re using one drive to copy.

Using a Disc Image
Using a Disc Image
From time to time, you may find that you need multiple copies of a disc but
don’t want to produce all the copies at one time. Perhaps the data will change
within a few weeks or you’re preparing discs for sale or distribution, but you
don’t know how many copies you need.
This situation is where a disc image comes in handy. Think of it as a complete
CD or DVD that’s saved as a single file to your hard drive. In fact, you can
even create a disc image for later burning without a recorder! I know that
sounds screwy, but when you’re on the road with your laptop or you’re at
the office and you don’t have your external recorder with you, you can
create a disc image file instead. After your computer and external recorder
are reunited, recording that disc is a snap.
However, you have to look at the downside: The disc image takes up all the
space of its optical sibling, so each disc image that you save on your hard
drive takes up the space that the data occupies on the recorded disc. There-
fore, it’s wise to save from 800MB to 5GB of free space on your drive (depend-
ing on the type of disc that you’re burning) if you think that you need to
create a disc image.
Follow these steps to create a disc image with Easy Media Creator:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Creator Classic.
2. Choose File➪New Project, and select the type of disc that you need
from the pop-up menu.
3. Build your project layout as you normally would.
4. Click the Burn button as usual, but this time click the Details button
and click the Disk Image File button in the Destinations panel.
5. Click the Save As button, navigate to the folder on your hard drive
where the image should be saved, type a name for your image file,
and then click the Save button.
Sit back and watch the fun as the disc image is recorded. The image file-
name carries a C2D extension.
Later, when you’re ready to record the disc, the process is just as easy. You
can use Disc Copier, as I showed you in the previous section, or you can
follow these steps to use Creator Classic:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Creator Classic to run the 
program.
2. Choose File➪Burn from Disc Image File.
The Burn from Disc Image File dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-9.
3. Navigate to the location of the disc image that you want to record.
Highlight the image, and click the Open button.
847

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
4. Make any necessary settings changes (as I show you earlier in this
chapter), and click the Burn button.
5. Load a blank disc, and the recorder does its stuff.
Erasing a Rewritable Disc
After you have finished with a CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM disc,
do you simply chuck it in the nearest wastebasket? No! Instead, you can
erase the entire disc at one time (you have no way to erase only part of the
disc — it’s either all or nothing) and use it all over again.
To erase a rewritable disc with Creator Classic follow these steps:
1. Load the offending rewritable disc into your recorder.
2. Right-click the drive in the folder tree, and choose Erase from the
pop-up menu that appears.
3. If Creator Classic prompts you for confirmation, answer in the 
affirmative.
You can choose a quick erase or a full erase. I agree with the good folks at
Roxio and recommend a quick erase in most cases.
When do you use the Full Erase option? Sometimes you may want to be
absolutely sure that your data is erased. However, if you’re trying to record
by using a rewritable disc and Easy Media Creator reports errors with the
disc’s formatting or TOC (table of contents) information, you probably have
to erase the disc to make it usable again. This can happen if a recording ses-
sion is interrupted by a power failure or if Easy Media Creator should —
perish the thought — crash on you.
Click the Start button to begin the process — and take a break for a soda or
a cup of java if you have selected the Full Erase option.

Project: Developing MP3 Fever
Project: Developing MP3 Fever
Friends, I have a hankerin’ to hear the King — that’s right, Elvis Aaron Presley
himself. The trouble is, I have all my Elvis songs in MP3 format on my hard
drive and I want to listen to them in my ’64 Cadillac’s audio CD player! If
you’re in the same boat (I don’t mean the Caddy), you have come to the right
project: burning a Best of Elvis audio CD. (And yes, neighbors, I own the origi-
nal commercial CDs for the music that I use in this project! I just ripped the
tracks into MP3 format for this demonstration.)
Follow these steps to record a standard audio CD from a passel of MP3 files:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Roxio Easy Media Creator Home.
2. Click the Create New Audio CD button in the Home window.
3. Click the Select Source drop-down list box, and select the drive where
your MP3 files are living. Use the Explorer view in the upper-left por-
tion of the screen to navigate to the right folder.
4. Hold down Ctrl, and in the right pane of the Explorer view, click the
MP3 files that you want to add.
5. Click the Add to Project button in the center of the screen — it looks
like an arrow pointing downward.
6. To add songs from another folder, repeat Steps 3 through 5.
Personally, I think that these eight are the King’s best songs, so let me
stop here.
7. You can click and drag the track names to rearrange them. I want my
disc to start out with “Jailhouse Rock,” so I click and drag the entry
from Slot 5 to Slot 1.
8. Click in the New Disc Title field, and enter a name for your disc.
9. Click in the Artist Name field, and enter the name of the performer or
band.
10. The disc layout is ready to record, so click the Big Red Disc-on-Fire
Burn Button.
The Burn Progress dialog box appears, and I click the Details button to
see all the settings.
11. I need only one copy of this disc, so I leave the Number of Copies
field set to 1.
12. Even if your audio CD player doesn’t display CD-Text, you may
encounter one in the future. Therefore, I always recommend that you
select the Read-Only Disc option and burn things permanently.
13. Click the Burn button to start the wheels turning, and then load a
blank disc.
14. When the recording is finished, you can run Label Creator. Otherwise,
eject your disc and enjoy your Elvis!

CHECK IT OUT
Archiving Digital Photographs
Have a number of family photos that you have
taken with your digital camera? Why not burn
them to a data CD and free that hard drive space
for other programs? Follow these steps to burn a
basic archive of digital images:
1.
Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪
Creator Classic.
2.
Click the Data Disc button in the Common
Projects task pane in the left side of the
window.
3.
Click the Select Source drop-down list
box, and navigate to the drive where your
images are stored. To move to another
folder, use the Explorer view in the upper-
left portion of the screen.
4.
Click one or more filenames while you
hold down Ctrl.
5.
Click the Add to Project button in the
center of the screen — that’s the one with
the arrow pointing down — or drag the
highlighted files to the bottom window.
6.
To select more images, just repeat Steps
3 through 5 until you have added all the
photos that you want (or, of course, until
the disc is full). Use the bar display at the
bottom of the screen to keep track of how
much space remains.
7.
To create a new folder in your project
layout, right-click the disc title in the
Layout window in the lower-left corner
and choose New Folder from the pop-up
menu that appears. The new folder
appears with the name highlighted; type 
a name for the new folder and press Enter
to save the name. To move images in and
out of folders, click and drag the filenames
wherever you want them.
8.
Click the disc title to highlight it, and
click it again to type a new name.
9.
When you’re ready, click the Big Red
Burn Button!
The Burn Progress dialog box appears, so
click the Details button to verify all your
settings.
10.
If you don’t want multiple copies, leave
the Number of Copies field set to 1.
11.
Choose whether you want to finalize 
the disc or add files and folders later.
Because I’m archiving, I select the Read-
Only Disc check box.
12.
Click the Burn button to start the wheels
turning, and then load a blank disc.
13.
When the recording is finished, you can
run Label Creator. Otherwise, eject your
disc and hand your photo archive to
Grandma!
Because you finalized this disc, you can’t write to
it again. If your drive supports packet writing,
Chapter 10 of Book IV shows you how to create a
UDF disc with Drag-to-Disc — which I prefer
rather than creating a multisession disc. With
Drag-to-Disc, you can add files later, and it’s
much easier than using Creator Classic. (Don’t
forget to check out Book I to find out all about
digital photography.)

 Creating a temporary partition
 Recording DVD-R backups with Toast
I
don’t even own a toaster, but I use my Toast to burn all the time! (Try
explaining that to your friends.) In the Macintosh world, however, that
sentence makes perfect sense. Compared to Roxio’s Easy Media Creator,
Toast 6 Titanium for the Macintosh (also from Roxio) is a lean, mean, and
exceptionally attractive recording machine. As you may guess, the program’s
menu system and appearance are radically different from its Windows sib-
ling, and it has a number of Mac-specific features. (If you’re running Mac 
OS 9.2, you’re out of luck. Toast 6 Titanium runs only under Mac OS X —
progress marches on.)
In this chapter, you take a look at both the basics of recording and many of
the advanced options that are available within Toast.
Putting Files on a Disc
Toast can create the following types of Hierarchical File System (HFS) discs:
✦Mac OS Standard CD: If your disc will be used on older Macs using
System 7 or earlier — those before Mac OS 8.1 — you should use this
standard disc.
✦Mac OS Extended CD: Macs running Mac OS 8.1 or later can take advan-
tage of the Extended file system, which allows faster performance and
provides a bit more room on the disc for your data.
Therefore, if compatibility is in question, always use the Mac OS Standard
CD version of HFS because both older and newer Macintosh operating sys-
tems can read it. (Also, as you see later in this chapter, some types of discs
require the Mac OS Standard CD file system.)
To record a simple data disc with files from your Macintosh’s hard drive,
follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program and
display the stylish Toast screen, as shown in Figure 9-1. (Talk about
classy!)
851

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
2. Click the Data tab at the top of the screen.
3. To select the type of data disc that you want to record, click the
Advanced button on the Disc Options drawer (in the upper-left corner).
Toast displays the different types of discs that you can record in the
selected category. For a basic Macintosh-only data disc, you should
select the Mac Only option. By default, Toast records a Mac OS Extended
CD. To record a Standard HFS CD, select the HFS Standard check box to
enable HFS.
To hide or display the Disc Options drawer, click the button to the left of
the Data tab. (In Figure 9-1, this button appears to the left of the words
Mac Only.)
4. Drag and drop files and folders from the Finder window into the
Toast main window.
Note that the program keeps track of both the number of files in your
layout and the approximate amount of space that these files use on the
disc. (Check out that nifty gas gauge bar graph that encircles the Record
button!) You can toggle between CD and DVD displays on the usage bar
graph display by clicking the CD or DVD button that’s next to the Record
button.
5. Repeat Step 4 until you have added all your files and folders or until
the disc layout is filled to capacity.
You can click and drag filenames to move them into and out of folders,
just as you would in the Mac OS X Finder window when you’re using List
view. To add a new folder, highlight the parent folder (or the CD itself)
and click the New Folder button at the bottom of the screen. To remove
a file or folder — just from the layout, mind you, not from your drive —
highlight the unwanted item and click the Remove button at the bottom
of the screen. Figure 9-2 illustrates a typical disc layout that I have cre-
ated on my system.

6. Load a blank CD into your recorder.
7. Click the big red Record button.
8. The Record dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
To make more than one copy of the disc, click in the Number of Copies
field and type the desired number. By default, Toast selects the highest
recording speed that your drive supports.
9. Click the Advanced button at the top of the dialog box.
Here, you determine whether you want to finalize (or close) the disc, as
follows:
• To write a single session and leave the disc open for later record-
ings, deselect the Close Disc check box. (This action is the same as
selecting the Finalize Session, Don’t Finalize CD check box in Roxio’s
Easy Media Creator.) You can read the disc in your Mac’s CD-ROM
drive, and you can create a multisession disc by using this disc in
the future.

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
• Select the Close Disc check box to write the session and finalize the
disc so that it can’t be written to again. This action corresponds to
selecting the Finalize CD check box in Roxio’s Easy Media Creator.
You can choose to test the recording by selecting the Simulation Mode
check box, but note that this selection does not automatically record
the disc if the test completes successfully.
If your Mac’s recorder supports burnproof recording — and all Macs
made in the last 3 years or so do — make sure that you select the Buffer
Underrun Prevention check box. With buffer underrun prevention turned
on, you can continue to use your Mac while it’s burning without fear of
ruining the disc. Sassy!
10. Click the Record button.
While recording, Toast displays a progress bar. After the recording is
complete, the program automatically verifies the finished disc against
the original files on your hard drive. Because this process takes several
minutes, you have the option of ejecting the disc immediately and skip-
ping the verification step.
Recording an Audio CD
Although Apple has released programs like iTunes that can burn audio discs,
I still prefer to record audio CDs on the Macintosh with Toast; it provides
more choices and more control over the finished disc. To record an audio CD
from files on your hard drive and existing audio CDs, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Click the Audio tab at the top of the screen.
3. Add tracks in either of the following ways:
• Add existing sound files that you have already saved to your hard
drive. For example, add AIFF or MP3 files to your layout by dragging
the files into the Toast window.
• Add tracks from an existing audio CD by loading it into your
CD-ROM drive and double-clicking the disc’s icon on the desktop to
display the track icons. Drag the desired track icons from the audio
CD window into the Toast window. (These tracks have a tiny CD icon
to indicate that they’re being ripped from an existing audio CD.)
If you plan to copy the majority of tracks from an existing CD, just drag
the entire disc icon to the Toast window and load all the tracks at one
time.
4. To create an MP3 music disc with the MP3 files that you’ve added,
select the MP3 Disc option in the Disc Options drawer.
If the Disc Options drawer is hidden, click the button to the left of the
Data tab. Naturally, you can add only MP3 files to an MP3 music disc
project.
854

Book IV
Chapter 9
Toasting Mac Discs
Ooh! It’s a Hybrid!
5. You can rearrange the tracks to any order that you want by dragging
them to their new positions. To rename a track, click the track name
to highlight it and click again to open an edit box. Type the new name.
To hear a track, highlight the track name and click the eminently
familiar-looking Play button at the bottom of the screen. To remove a
track, select the offending track and click the Remove button. Finally,
you can change the length of the pause before a track by clicking the
current value — by default, it’s 2 seconds — and choosing a new
value from the menu.
If you’re using files from an existing audio CD and you have only one
optical drive on your Mac system, you have to export (a more dignified
word for rip) any tracks that you’re copying from other discs before you
record your new audio CD. This export step eliminates any possible
problems that your drive may encounter if you try recording directly
from the discs themselves.
6. Highlight each track that you have added from another disc, and
click the Export button in the lower-left corner of the Toast window.
Toast displays a Save As dialog box that allows you to choose the folder
where the extracted audio is saved. The tracks are saved as AIFF files.
7. Load a blank CD-R disc into your recorder.
8. Click the big red Record button, which displays our old friend, the
Record dialog box.
9. For a standard audio CD, click the Advanced button and make sure
that the Close Disc and DAO (short for Disc-at-Once) options are both
selected.
10. Click the Record button.
I swear that this is the last time I’ll say this — it really is, folks — Do not use
a CD-RW disc when recording a standard audio CD unless you’re sure that the
audio CD player supports rewritable media! Using a CD-RW disc in an older
audio CD player that doesn’t support rewritable media will probably result
in stark silence (and a blinking error message from your CD player). If you
do hear anything, your CD player will probably produce something that
sounds like an enraged moose. (And yes, for you Monty Python fans, a
moose once bit my sister . . .)
After your audio CD has been recorded, you can regain hard drive space 
by deleting the extracted audio tracks that you saved. Or, if the notion is
attractive to you, keep the tracks for another recording or use them with
your iPod.
Ooh! It’s a Hybrid!
Next, turn your attention to an important type of disc that’s easily recorded
with Toast: a PC/Macintosh hybrid disc, that is, a disc that can be read on
both systems. The Mac portion of the disc uses the HFS standard, and the
PC portion uses either Joliet or ISO 9660. This disc type is a perfect way to
855

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
distribute files and programs to a wide audience — especially games, edu-
cational material, clip-art libraries, multimedia files, and fonts (all of which
are often shared between PCs and Macs).
Note that unless you’re running special software, only the native format
portion of the disc can be read by either operating system. (Geez, I need a
soda. In plain English: The Macintosh can read only the Mac information on
the disc, and the PC can read only the PC portion. Sorry about that.)
To create a hybrid disc, follow these steps:
1. Gather the Mac-only files that you want to record, and move them to
a separate volume.
(This volume can be a separate hard drive partition, a removable disk
like a USB flash drive, or a temporary partition, which I show you how
to create at the end of the chapter.)
If you have any files that should be visible on both Macs and PCs, copy
them to the volume as well.
2. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
3. Click the Data button at the top of the screen.
4. Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer, and then
select the Custom Hybrid option. 
Toast displays the screen that is shown in Figure 9-4.
If you’re just looking for a single disc that offers one set of files that both
types of computers can read, eschew the Custom Hybrid format. Instead,
click the Basic button on the Disc Options drawer and select the Mac &
PC option. This format creates a simple cross-platform disc that can be
read on both Macs and PCs. A Mac & PC format disc is suitable only for
Figure 9-4:
The

sharing simple data files. Unlike a true hybrid disc, a Mac & PC format
disc doesn’t support any operating system-specific features for either
type of computer.
5. Click the Select Mac button.
6. From the Select Volume dialog box, click the volume that you created
in Step 1 in the list and select the Optimize On-the-Fly check box. Click
the OK button to return to the main screen.
7. Click the Select ISO button to display the ISO 9660 dialog box, as
shown in Figure 9-5.
8. Drag and drop the files that should be read on the PC to the ISO 9660
dialog box.
You can click the CD title or a folder name to rename it — files are auto-
matically renamed to conform to the ISO standard. Click the New Folder
button to add a new folder, and feel free to drag files and folders around
to rearrange your ISO layout.
9. After you’re finished adding ISO files, click the Settings tab. From the
Naming drop-down list box, select Joliet (MS-DOS + Windows), which
allows long filenames. Click the Done button.
10. Okay, let’s burn this puppy! Choose File➪Save As Disc Image. Toast
prompts you for a location to save the image file. (I generally pick the
desktop because it’s easy to find.) Click the Save button to create the
image.
11. Click the Copy button at the top of the screen. This time, select the
Image File option from the Disc Options drawer.
12. Click the Select button, choose the image that you created in Step 10,
and click the Open button.
13. Load a blank disc into your recorder.

14. Click the big red Record button.
15. Click the Advanced button and make sure that the Close Disc option
is selected.
16. Click the Record button to begin the fun.
17. After the recording has finished, you have the choice of verifying the
disc or ejecting the disc immediately and skipping the verification step.
Let Your Video Do the Talking
Toast 6 Titanium allows you to create your own Video CDs, Super Video CDs
and DVD-Video discs — after a fashion, that is. Unlike iDVD, you don’t have
creative control over menu creation and what goes where — Toast does it
automatically — but if you’re looking for basic transportation for your digi-
tal video clips and digital photographs, you can’t get much easier than this
application!
Video CDs (commonly called VCDs) can be shown on your computer with
the proper VCD player application; most standalone DVD players can also
handle Video CDs. Super Video CDs (or SVCDs), on the other hand, display
significantly better video quality, but there’s a caveat or two: An SVCD
stores less information than a VCD, and most older DVD players don’t rec-
ognize the format. Therefore, use the Video CD format whenever possible to
ensure the best possible compatibility.
To create a Video CD or Super Video CD, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Click the Video button at the top of the screen.
858
Mounting an image (and not on the wall)
From time to time, you may want to take advantage
of the absolutely nifty ability to mount a disc image
on the Mac OS 9.2/X desktop, just like it was a
gen-u-wine piece of CD-ROM hardware. You can
open the mounted disc and even run programs
and load files from it. Your Mac applications can’t
tell the difference, and you don’t have to dig
through dozens of CDs to find the one that holds
the files that you need. (You’re likely to use a
mounted disc image only for data discs because
you can listen to audio tracks just by extracting
them as AIFF or MP3 files.) As long as you have
the available hard drive territory, you can keep a
disc image on tap for any contingency.
To create a disc image, build your data CD layout as
usual, as I describe in the section “Putting Files on a
Disc,” earlier in this chapter. (Make sure that you
have at least 800MB to 900MB of free hard drive
space if your image will reflect a full disc.) Then,
rather than burn the layout, choose File➪Save As
Disc Image. From the Save Disc Image As dialog
box, click the target folder in the list to select it, type
a new name (if necessary), and click the Save
button. Toast acts just as though it’s writing to a disc;
when it’s done, however, you have a brand-spank-
ing-new disc image file.
To mount the file, double-click it. Toast automatically
launches and presents you with two buttons: Select
and Mount. Click the Mount button, and you’re ready
to go. (After the volume icon appears on the desk-
top, you can exit Toast.) The mounted volume stays
on your desktop until you reboot your Macintosh or
drag the volume icon to the Trash. Enjoy!

3. Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer, and select the
Video CD or Super Video CD option.
If you’re creating a disc for use in the United States, make sure that you
select the NTSC option.
4. To add basic menus to the disc automatically, select the Create VCD
Menu check box.
Personally, I leave this option deselected and simply allow the video
clips to run sequentially. Remember, the more video clips you add, the
more cumbersome (and harder to navigate) your menus become.
I always recommend that you click the Video Quality drop-down list box
and select High quality. You get less recording time on the disc, but the
video on the finished disc looks much better.
5. Drag and drop video clips to the content window (see Figure 9-6).
Alternatively, you can click the Add button to select the video clips from
a standard Open dialog box. To remove a clip that arrived by accident,
select the clip and click the Remove button.
To import digital video directly from your DV camcorder, plug it in —
Toast displays a DV camcorder icon in the content window. Click the
Import button, and sit back while Toast creates the video clip! (Just
make sure that you have enough hard drive space to hold the imported
clip — the digital world can get cumbersome.)
6. Add photographs (or an entire folder of photographs) from your hard
drive by dragging them into the content window.
You can drag images from a Finder or iPhoto window; Toast labels a
folder as a slideshow and displays the number of images that each
slideshow contains.

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
Here’s a neat trick: Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options
drawer, and select the Add Original Photos check box. Toast creates a
separate folder on the final disc that contains all the photos that you
add to your VCD/SVCD project. When you load the disc into a computer,
you can copy those images directly from the disc to the computer’s
hard drive. (If you use this feature, your discs will both display and
store your images!)
7. Load a blank disc into your recorder.
8. Click the big bed Record button . . . and wait.
Unfortunately, digital video takes time to encode (a fancy-pants term
that describes the conversion of your digital video into a form that can
be recorded). How much time? Well, pardner, that depends on the size
of the video clips, the quality setting that you’ve chosen, and the speed
of your Mac — but don’t be surprised if you can take a break for lunch
before the Record dialog box appears.
9. Finally! Click the Advanced button, and select the Close Disc option.
10. Click the Record button, and relax.
Project: Recording a Backup DVD-ROM Disc
Toast can burn with DVD-R/W and DVD+R/W drives, so it makes a good
quick-and-dirty recording program for creating backups. The storage space
on a DVD-R disc makes backing up a decent-size drive easy, using only three
or four discs. You don’t get a full 4.7GB — a 4.7GB disc provides only about
4.25GB when you use the Mac OS Extended format — but it’s still nothing to
sneeze at.
860
Can I burn DVD-Video discs with Toast?
Yes, Virginia, Toast can handle basic DVD 
projects — however, don’t expect many frills.
(Forget creating fancy animated menus and embed-
ded content.) I recommend that you take the easy
route, and follow the same steps that I used for
VCDs and SVCDs. You’ll end up with a DVD-Video
disc that plays video clips and slideshows on your
computer and DVD player — but you won’t be able
to directly manipulate the contents of the VIDEO_TS
folder. A DVD movie must conform to the DVD-Video
standard, which uses a very specific set of directo-
ries (and is recorded using the UDF standard). If that
sounds like ancient Sumerian to you, you don’t need
to read any more of this sidebar!
Hey, you. Yeah, you, the DVD wizard who wants to
burn a DVD-Video disc. Actually, you can hot-wire
Toast to produce a bona fide DVD-Video disc with
your own VIDEO_TS files. (Forgive me if I get a bit
technical here for the DVD wizards.) You need to
burn the project as a data disc instead, and you
have to prepare the contents of the VIDEO_TS
folder separately because Toast doesn’t allow you
to directly author DVD content.
To create the necessary layout, click the Data 
tab, click the Advanced button in the Disc Options
drawer — choose the DVD-ROM (UDF) option, and
then drag your prebuilt VIDEO_TS folder into the
content window. (Remember, most older DVD play-
ers also require an AUDIO_TS folder for everything
to work, even if the AUDIO_TS folder doesn’t con-
tain anything.) Now you can burn the disc. Naturally,
I recommend that you use a DVD-R disc for the best
possible compatibility with all DVD players.

Toasting Mac Discs
Project: Recording a Backup DVD-ROM Disc
You, too, can burn a simple DVD-ROM backup disc for your hard drive files.
Follow these steps to do so:
1. Double-click the Toast icon on the desktop to launch the program.
2. Click the Data tab.
3. Click the Advanced button in the Disc Options drawer, and select the
Mac Only radio button.
When you’re backing up data, compatibility with other computers usu-
ally isn’t a big deal. Therefore, I heartily recommend that you select the
Compressed check box in the Disc Options drawer. To safeguard your
data, you can also select the Encrypted option, which will prompt you
for a password. Security is a good thing, but here’s a stern Mark’s Maxim:
Brothers and sisters, if you can’t supply that password, you won’t be
able to read anything from the disc!
4. Click and drag the desired files and folders into the content window.
5. Load a blank DVD-R disc into your DVD recorder.
6. Click the big red Record button, which presents our old friend, the
Record dialog box.
7. Click the Advanced button, and make sure that the Close Disc option
is selected.
Because a backup is such an important procedure, I also recommend
that you select the Verify Data check box. Toast takes additional time to
check the disc after the recording is complete, but isn’t your peace of
mind worth that extra step?
8. Click the Record button, and grab another soda.
Note that Toast can also write a data layout to a DVD-RAM disc, but the entire
disc is automatically reformatted first, and the data is recorded as a read-only
disc. If you want to record data to the disc again using Toast, you lose the cur-
rent contents of the disc when it’s reformatted. Sorry about that. But then, if
you’re using a DVD-RAM drive for backups, like I do, automatic reformatting
probably isn’t a problem!
861
CHECK IT OUT
Creating a Temporary Partition
As I mention in the section “Ooh! It’s a Hybrid!,”
earlier in this chapter, recording with Toast some-
times requires you to create a temporary partition
as a separate volume on your Mac desktop. In
fact, you can use the Mac Volume disc type to
record the contents of a temporary partition as a
complete disc.
In the following steps, I show you how to create a
temporary partition to store the Macintosh files
for a hybrid disc:
1.
Double-click the Toast icon on the desk-
top to launch the program.
2.
Choose Utilities➪Create Temporary
Partition to display the Create Temporary
Partition dialog box, as shown in the fol-
lowing figure.

3.
Click the Name field, and enter a volume
name for the partition.
In this example, I chose Fortisque. (I have
my reasons.)
4.
Click the Size field, and enter a partition
size in megabytes (the default is 650MB).
Naturally, this size can’t be larger than the
amount of free space on the drive that you
select in the On drop-down list box. I have
only about 150MB of Mac files to record on
this hybrid disc, so I show you how to
create a 160MB partition on my hard drive.
Leaving about 10MB of breathing space on
your temporary partition is always a good
idea. This allows you to add a forgotten file
or two later without running out of room.
5.
If you need a Mac OS Standard disc, select
it from the Format drop-down list box.
6.
Click the OK button.
As shown in the following figure, Fortisque
has suddenly appeared on my Mac 
desktop.
Don’t you wish that it was that easy to add
permanent storage space to your system?
After the partition has been created,
you’re ready to drag your Mac files into it.
After you’re done with the partition, you can
delete it by dragging it to the Trash.

O
kay, I trumpet the advantages of Roxio Drag-to-Disc throughout much 
of Book IV, and it’s time to deliver the goods. What makes Drag-to-Disc
so hot? Here are the facts:
✦You don’t need to open any recording software ahead of time. Just drop
a Drag-to-Disc disc in your drive, and everything’s taken care of for you
automatically.
✦The Universal Disk Format (UDF) recording mode — also known as
packet writing — that’s used by Drag-to-Disc is almost as reliable and
foolproof as burnproof recording. You can safely record data on a Drag-
to-Disc disc while you’re working in another application under
Windows.
✦You can add files at any time without creating a multisession disc.
✦Drag-to-Disc works with CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, and DVD-RAM
discs. In other words, you can forget the ASH Syndrome (an acronym of
my personal invention, short for Alphabet Soup Hassle).
✦Although Drag-to-Disc itself is a Windows-only program, all popular
operating systems can read a UDF disc produced by Drag-to-Disc.
Eager to find out more? This is the chapter for you — I put Drag-to-Disc
through its paces.
“Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?”
Hey, I didn’t say that Drag-to-Disc is perfect, did I? This program has only
two drawbacks, as follows:
✦You have to format a disc before you can use it.
✦You can’t create mixed-mode or standard audio CDs with Drag-to-Disc.
863

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
I can’t do anything about the latter — Drag-to-Disc prompts you to launch
Creator Classic if you’re moving digital audio files to your disc — but the
program automatically formats a disc for use with Drag-to-Disc when you
drag files to it within Windows Explorer.
If your drive doesn’t support this automatic formatting option (or if you
want to use compression, which I cover in a paragraph or two), you can
follow these steps to manually format a blank disc in Windows XP:
1. Load a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc into your recorder.
2. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Drag-to-Disc to display the Drag-
to-Disc window, as shown in Figure 10-1.
You can also double-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in the system tray to dis-
play this screen.
3. Press Alt+F to display the Format Options dialog box, as shown in
Figure 10-2.
4. It’s time to give your disc a name: In the Volume Label field, enter a
descriptive volume name that has 11 characters or fewer.
You see this label displayed in the same places as your hard drive
names, including Windows applications, within Windows Explorer and
within My Computer.
If you suddenly decide to rename your Drag-to-Disc disc later — if you
change your significant other, for example — click in the Drag-to-Disc
window, press Alt+R, and then type the new name.
You can also choose to use compression on your Drag-to-Disc disc, which
means that files can be reduced in size and you can pack additional stuff
on the disc. Woohoo! Roxio says that the compression ranges from 1.5:1

“Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?”
to 3:1. As with a Zip archive, the compression that you achieve depends
on the data that you’re adding to the disc. I like to select this check box
because the more space I have to add files, the better. However, this
action can limit the number of computers that can read the disc, as you
find out from my description of the Eject options in the section “Eject,
Buckaroo, Eject!,” later in this chapter. Don’t use compression if you want
any computer to be able to read the disc!
To read a compressed Drag-to-Disc disc on another computer, you must
have either Drag-to-Disc installed or you have to install UDF support
(which is already included on most PCs that are running Windows 2000
and Windows XP).
5. If you’re formatting a rewritable disc, select the Format type by click-
ing the desired button.
Drag-to-Disc offers two types of formatting for rewritable media. Quick
formatting takes only a few minutes, but you must have Drag-to-Disc
installed to read the disc. Full formatting can take up to 90 minutes
(depending on the speed of your drive and the capacity of the disc), but
the resulting disc can be read on any PC that’s running Windows 2000 or
Windows XP, even if Drag-to-Disc is not installed on that machine.
6. Click the OK button to set the wheels in motion.
Drag-to-Disc displays the dialog box that’s shown in Figure 10-3 while
it’s working.
When the disc has been formatted, Drag-to-Disc displays the volume
name in the Drag-to-Disc window, which is shown in Figure 10-4.
Double-click My Computer, and you can see your new drive. Although it
appears to be a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, it’s ready to store data and
read it. The Drag-to-Disc icon in the Windows system tray now sports a
fashionable miniature red padlock, which tells you that you have loaded a
Drag-to-Disc disc.

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
Depending on the brand and model of your recorder, you may not be able to
eject a Drag-to-Disc disc using your drive’s Eject button like you can with a
regular read-only disc. Don’t worry, though; I cover the procedure for safely
ejecting a Drag-to-Disc disc in the section “Eject, Buckaroo, Eject!” 
Just Add Files and Stir
“So what programs do I run to use a Drag-to-Disc disc?” Programs? You don’t
need ’em! Drag-to-Disc works behind the scenes, so you can forget that it’s
there. Just read, create, copy, and move files to your Drag-to-Disc disc in the
same way that you use your hard drive or a floppy disk. You can save to the
disc within your applications, drag and drop files, or use a file-management
program like Windows Explorer.
You can also keep tabs on the status of your Drag-to-Disc disc by checking
its Properties page: Double-click My Computer to display your drives, right-
click the Drag-to-Disc drive icon, and choose Properties from the pop-up
menu that appears. Figure 10-5 shows the Properties window for the disc
that I showed you how to format in the preceding section.
As you can see, the file system is listed as Drag-to-Disc-R, with compression
enabled. You can see that this disc has approximately 701MB of free space
remaining. (However, if you use compression, remember that the total capac-
ity of your disc is a guesstimate because the rate of compression can vary
depending on the type of data that you’re storing.)
That’s it! Of all the recording programs I cover, Drag-to-Disc is definitely the
easiest to master. There’s literally nothing to it.

Chapter 10

Drag-to-Disc
Eject, Buckaroo, Eject!
“Wait — I Didn’t Mean to Trash That!”
When you delete files from a Drag-to-Disc CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or
DVD-RAM disc, the files are deleted and you recover the space that those
files used. When you delete files from a CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R Drag-to-Disc
disc, the files are no longer accessible, but you don’t regain the space.
Unfortunately, you can’t undelete files from a Drag-to-Disc project by using
the Windows Recycle Bin — after they’ve been deleted, those files are long
gone, pardner. If a Drag-to-Disc project disc is damaged or corrupted, how-
ever, you can use ScanDisc to attempt to recover the files from it. Read more
about that in the section “Whoops, I Can’t Read This Disc,” later in this
chapter.
Eject, Buckaroo, Eject!
A Drag-to-Disc disc has one feature that’s a little tricky: You may not be able
to simply eject a Drag-to-Disc disc like any other mundane CD-ROM or DVD-
ROM disc. (In fact, the Eject button on your recorder may be disabled!) Drag-
to-Disc has to take care of a few housekeeping tasks, like updating directory
entries and preparing the disc for reading, before it lets you eject the disc.
Go ahead and give the Eject button a poke, but if it doesn’t work, you can
always follow these steps to eject a disc by using the Drag-to-Disc window:
1. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in the system tray, and choose Eject
Disc from the pop-up menu that appears.
Alternately, display the Drag-to-Disc window (as I show you in the sec-
tion “Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?” earlier in this chapter) and
click the Eject button. You can also right-click the drive icon in the My
Computer window and select Eject from the menu that appears.
If you’re using a nonrewritable disc, Drag-to-Disc displays the Eject Disc
dialog box that’s shown in Figure 10-6. You can select or deselect the
options in this dialog box (along with the options on the Advanced Eject
Settings dialog box) to determine how the disc is prepared when it’s
ejected. These options are as follows:
• To read the disc on a computer with UDF support (or Drag-to-Disc
installed): Select the This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers or
Devices option, click the Advanced button, and select UDF version
1.02. Click the OK button to return to the Eject Options dialog box. The
disc is closed so that computers that can read UDF version 1.5 can
read the disc — this includes Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, Mac OS 9.2, and Mac OS X. With this option, you can either leave
the disc open so that you can write more to it later, or you can select
the Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to Again check box
(which I describe in a second) to finalize the disc permanently.
• To read the disc on any computer: Select the This Disc Will Be Used
on Other Computers or Devices option, click the Advanced button,
select UDF version 1.02, and then select the Also Use ISO/Joliet check
867

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
box. Click the OK button to return to the Eject Options dialog box.
These choices create a Joliet/ISO 9660 disc that can be read on just
about any computer. (Note, however, that you can’t use this option if
you have elected to compress the data on the disc.) Again, you can
leave the disc open and write to it again later, or you can select the
Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to Again check box to final-
ize the disc.
• To allow further recording: If you want to continue recording later
(for example, if you need to read something else or record an audio
disc with Creator Classic and you need the drive), deselect the Protect
Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to Again check box. You can’t read
the disc on anything other than a recorder that’s running Drag-to-Disc,
however, so it’s effectively out of commission until you reload it.
2. Click the Eject button to eject the disc.
Depending on the option that you choose in Step 1, you may have to
wait while the disc is finalized, but Drag-to-Disc shows you a progress
dialog box to let you know how things are going.
Do you usually choose the same Eject options for your CD-R, DVD-R, and
DVD+R discs? If so, you can choose an Eject setting that Drag-to-Disc will
apply to all discs in the future. Click the Drag-to-Disc window, and press
Alt+S to display the Settings dialog box; then choose the desired Eject set-
tings. Click the Advanced Eject Settings button to specify whether non-
rewritable discs should be prepared with the UDF or ISO/Joliet file format,
as I describe earlier in this section.
Adding Files to an Existing Disc
If you have ejected a nonrewritable disc, you can reload it and write addi-
tional data if the following two conditions apply:
✦You didn’t select the Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to Again
check box.
✦Additional space remains on the disc.

Burning Data with
Drag-to-Disc
“Whoops, I Can’t Read This Disc”
When you reload a nonrewritable Drag-to-Disc disc, the program may have
to open a new session and read the files that it already contains. This process
can take a few moments, depending on whether you decided to close the
disc or leave it as is. However, after the disc is back in the drive, you can
use it normally.
Erasing a Drag-to-Disc Disc
Like Creator Classic (which I explore like Jacques Cousteau in Chapter 8 
of Book IV), Drag-to-Disc allows you to completely erase CD-RW, DVD-RW,
DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM media. To erase a disc, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Drag-to-Disc window, or right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon
in the system tray.
2. Choose Erase Disc from the pop-up menu that appears.
Drag-to-Disc requests confirmation that you really want to erase the disc.
3. Click the Yes button.
Sit back while the disc is erased, or go grab yourself another soda.
“Whoops, I Can’t Read This Disc”
In case something nasty occurs and you encounter problems with a Drag-to-
Disc disc (for example, if you’re hit with a power failure while copying files
to the disc), the program offers a ScanDisc feature that can recover files 
and fix some errors. Note that this program should not be confused with
Windows ScanDisk, which is used only with hard drives and floppy disks.
To scan a Drag-to-Disc disc for errors, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Drag-to-Disc window, or right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon
in the system tray.
2. Choose Launch ScanDisc from the pop-up menu that appears.
Drag-to-Disc prompts you to select the drive where you’ve loaded the
Drag-to-Disc disc.
3. Click the correct drive, and click the OK button.
Drag-to-Disc displays the dialog box that’s shown in Figure 10-7.
4. Click the Scan button to begin.
Drag-to-Disc provides a progress bar while it works. If the program finds
problems, you’re prompted for confirmation before the program gathers
recovery information.
5. Click the Yes button to continue. (Naturally, this is a definite choice.)
If files can be recovered, ScanDisc allows you to copy them to another
drive.
869

Part III: Starting the Recording Process
6. Select the target drive from the Destination Drive drop-down list, and
then specify the target folder in the Destination Folder list.
7. Click the Copy button to attempt to recover all files and folders.
Each recovered file is renamed with a generic filename, so you have to open
each file manually to determine what it is and to know whether it was recov-
ered successfully. (I know this stinks worse than an angry skunk in a closet if
you have dozens of files, but you have no other choice. Such is technology.)
Project: Creating a New Employee Disc
Here’s the deal: Suppose that you work in the Human Resources division 
of your company, and it’s your job to provide new employees with all the
information they need. However, your office doesn’t have an intranet (that’s
another book entirely), so you hit on the idea of a New Employee CD-ROM
that contains all sorts of company clip art, press releases, document tem-
plates, and the company president’s recipe for Heavenly Hash Browns. Your
coworkers often take these discs on business trips, too. Your discs are pop-
ular because they save plenty of hard drive space on laptops.
That’s a great idea, but it has one problem: Your company is continually
requesting that new material be added to the discs, and some information is
soon out of date and needs to be deleted to make sure that it doesn’t acci-
dentally get included in a company document. You need a way to add more
data to a disc and be able to selectively delete information whenever you
want. Hey, that’s the definition of a CD-RW Drag-to-Disc disc! Follow these
steps to create the perfect employee disc:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Drag-to-Disc to run Drag-to-Disc.
2. Load a blank rewriteable CD-RW disc into your recorder.
3. Press Alt+F to format the disc (as I demonstrate in the section
“Whaddya Mean, I Have to Format?” earlier in the chapter).
Depending on your recorder, you could do this automatically . . . but
this disc may need compression to hold that huge hash browns recipe.

4. Name the disc (ACMECO, for example), and because you’re assuming
that all computers in your company are running Drag-to-Disc or are
using an operating system that recognizes UDF discs, enable compres-
sion to make room for as much data as possible.
5. Click the OK button.
6. After the disc is formatted, double-click the My Computer icon on your
desktop. Drag to the recorder icon all the company files that you want
to add to the disc to copy them.
After all the files have been recorded, eject the disc.
7. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc icon in the system tray, and choose Eject
from the pop-up menu that appears.
Pass the disc with pride to your next new employee. Whenever you need to
update the contents of the disc, just pop it back in the drive and start copy-
ing and deleting files!

ll right, troops — if you’ve been following along in this minibook, you
know that I’ve been easy on you. I’ve covered the simple stuff, and you
can burn simple data discs and audio CDs until the cows come home. But
what if you need to burn a mixed-mode disc? Or a CD Extra disc? Or even
record a DVD for use in your DVD player? Those are heavy-duty recording
jobs, Private. Have you got what it takes?”
Of course, you do. Luckily, those are the specialized discs that I cover in
this chapter! You may not use them often, but when you do, you can hold
your head up high and say, “I know how these are made. Step aside, and let
the expert show you how it’s done.”
It’s Data, It’s Audio, It’s Mixed!
Ever felt like you needed both digital audio and computer data on the same
disc? If so, consider mixed-mode format. You can burn two different types of
mixed-mode discs — the one you select depends on the material you’re
recording and what device will play it.
Putting data before your audio
Standard mixed-mode discs are great for discs that need to combine both dig-
ital audio and computer data, but they aren’t meant to be used in a standard
audio CD player. These discs can be played only in a computer’s CD-ROM or
DVD-ROM drive.
Typically, the program is installed from the first track (the data portion),
which is closest to the spindle hole. After the program is running, it plays
the audio tracks that follow. Most sophisticated computer games now use
mixed-mode format because the game program can load movies and data
files from the first track and still access the digital audio tracks while you’re
blasting the aliens from Planet Quark.
873

Part IV: Meeting Your Data Storage Needs
The extra behind CD Extra
As you can see in Figure 11-1, a CD Extra disc turns regular mixed-mode
format on its head: One or more audio tracks come first, followed by a data
track. The big attraction here is for musicians; a CD Extra disc can be played
in both a standard audio CD player (which really can’t tell the difference
because the data is at the end) and a computer’s read-only CD-ROM or 
DVD-ROM drive. This, folks, is the definition of neat!
Groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the
Squirrel Nut Zippers have popularized the CD Extra disc with their fans.
Although the format costs a minute or two of disc space (the blank space
that’s necessary to separate the tracks), the band’s music can share the
disc with a multimedia presentation of the latest music video or still pic-
tures of a recent concert — or even lyrics to the songs.

Recording That MTV Video
The last advanced specialized disc that I discuss is the Video CD (commonly
called VCD), which stores digital video in MPEG-1 format. You can watch a
Video CD in a Video CD player, a computer CD-ROM drive (with the right soft-
ware), and most of the latest generation of DVD players. Before the advent of
DVD players, Video CDs were the primary method of recording and distribut-
ing digital video among computer owners. An enhanced version of the Video
CD — called the Super Video CD, or SVCD — provides even better video qual-
ity, but an SVCD stores less than a VCD, and SVCDs aren’t compatible with all
DVD players.
Roxio’s Easy Media Creator uses a separate program named DVD Builder 
to help simplify the creation of a Video CD. With DVD Builder, you can burn
professional VCD, SVCD, or DVD-Video discs, complete with a basic menu
system — I lead you through the process step-by-step in the last project in
this chapter.
Project: Recording a Mixed-Mode Disc
Suppose that you need to record a selection of multimedia clips to carry
with you on a business trip. Some are video clips that you need to store
only for the ride, and some are digital audio that you need to hear to prac-
tice your presentation. One solution would be to burn two discs — one, a
data CD for the video clips, and the other, a traditional audio CD. A mixed-
mode disc, however, allows you to combine both types of content on a
single disc.
Follow these steps to create a mixed-mode CD:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Creator Classic to run the 
program.
2. Choose File➪New Project➪Mixed-Mode CD to display a special mixed-
mode layout, as shown in Figure 11-2.
Make sure that the indented data CD icon is selected under the Mixed-
Mode CD Project label in the lower-right pane — the icon looks like a tiny
disc with just a file folder, as shown in Figure 11-2. (By default, Creator
Classic assigns the data portion of your disc with a string of numbers for
a name, but you can change that — more on this in a step or two.)
3. Locate and highlight the data files by using the same method that you
use to select files for a data CD-ROM.
(Need a reminder of how this works? Flip to Chapter 8 of Book IV and
check out the section that describes how to put files on a disc.)
4. Click the Add button (the downward-facing arrow shown in Figure 11-2)
to add the files and folders to the data portion of the layout.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until your data layout is complete, as shown in
Figure 11-3.

Don’t forget to click the data CD label and name the data portion of the
CD-ROM something descriptive. (Alternately, you can type the new name
directly into the Disc Name text box.) The default name, which is built
by using the current date and time, is rarely what you want.
6. Click the music CD icon next to the Audio Project label to add the dig-
ital audio tracks. (The icon looks like a disc with a musical note; refer
to Figure 11-2.)
As shown in Figure 11-4, the right side of the Mixed-Mode CD Project
pane changes to the familiar audio CD track layout.
7. Locate and highlight the MP3, WAV, or WMF digital audio files that
you want to record, just as you do in designing a standard audio CD.
Remember to watch the free-space display at the bottom of the screen
to make sure that you don’t run out of space while adding audio files.
8. Click the Add button (the down arrow in the middle of the window)
to copy the files to your track layout.
9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until your audio track layout is complete, as
illustrated in Figure 11-5.
10. Click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Burn button (refer to Figure 11-2)
and finish the recording, just like with a typical data CD-ROM.
(Consult Chapter 8 of Book IV — specifically, the section about putting
files on a disc — if you need a refresher course in choosing options for a
data CD-ROM.)

Part IV: Meeting Your Data Storage Needs
Project: Recording a CD Extra Disc
As you may have guessed, I could also have created the disc described in
the preceding project by using a CD Extra disc. Like a mixed-mode disc, a
CD Extra (or Enhanced) disc can hold the same unique combination of digi-
tal audio tracks and computer data. The big difference is that you can play
the audio tracks from a CD Extra disc in your standard audio CD player, and
you need a computer’s CD-ROM drive to access the digital audio on a mixed-
mode disc. That’s great for adding that video of your garage band to that
Best of Deep Purple disc you burned!
Follow these steps to record a CD Extra disc:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪Creator Classic to run the 
program.
2. Choose File➪New Project➪Enhanced CD.
Again, Creator Classic has a special layout screen for a CD Extra project,
as illustrated in Figure 11-6.
3. In the Enhanced CD Project pane, if the music CD icon next to the
empty Audio Project label isn’t already selected, select it now.
4. Locate and select the MP3, WAV, or WMF digital audio files to record,
just as you do in designing a standard audio CD.
5. Click Add (that familiar downward-pointing arrow in the middle of
the window) to copy the tracks to the audio CD portion of the layout.
6. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you’ve added all the audio tracks that you
want.

7. Click the label for the data CD icon and type a more descriptive label
into the Disc Name text box.
If folders labeled “CDPLUS” and “PICTURES” appear in your data layout,
leave them as they are. Don’t delete these folders or add files within
them because they’re used in conjunction with the audio tracks on the
disc! (You can find out more about this topic in the nearby sidebar,
“Documenting your CD Extra discs.”)
8. Locate the files and folders to add in the usual manner by using the
Explorer display in the Select Source pane, and then highlight them.
9. Click Add (that handsome arrow pointing down in the middle of the
window) to copy the selected files and folders to the data portion of
the layout.
10. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until all the files that you want are added. 
Figure 11-7 shows a finished data layout for your CD Extra disc. Note the
location of the data files in the layout.
879
Documenting your CD Extra discs
CD-Text is a nice feature that allows many audio CD
players to display the CD title and the artist and
track names while you listen. That’s all that most
people need. However, a CD Extra disc can store
even more reference information describing the
audio tracks, including the artist name, CD title, and
publisher. If your audio CD player can’t show this
additional stuff, your computer probably can when
you play the disc in your CD-ROM drive.
If you want to store this extra information, you must
enter it after you have added your tracks (see Step
5 in the section titled, “Project: Recording a CD Extra
Disc”). Choose File➪Project Settings, which dis-
plays the Project Properties dialog box, and click the
Advanced tab to display the dialog box shown in the
following figure. Click OK to save the information that
you entered and return to the CD Extra layout.
Personally, I don’t use these fields, and you don’t
have to enter any of this stuff. But the fields do
come in handy when you’re recording a disc that
will be used as a master for a manufacturing run or
a disc that will form part of an ongoing archive.

Project: Recording a DVD Movie Disc
Project: Recording a DVD Movie Disc
To end this chapter on advanced recording, I show you how to create a basic
DVD-Video of a child’s birthday party. Suppose that you edited a series of
short video clips with Adobe Premiere and saved them in MPEG format on
your hard drive. The DVD should show the clips in order as soon as it’s
loaded.
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Roxio➪DVD Builder to load the program.
As shown in Figure 11-8, the wizard runs automatically.
2. Select the DVD option button and click OK to continue.
Note that you can also capture a digital video stream from a DV cam-
corder or analog input (like a VCR). If you’re adding still images to your
project, you can also include existing images from your hard drive, or
capture digital photographs directly from your digital camera. For right
now, just add existing video clips, but you can switch to these other
sources whenever you like. Sassy!
3. Click the Add Intro Title link in the Edit Task Pane on the left side of
the window.
The Add Media to Project dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-9.
4. Navigate to the folder in which you stored your MPEG files and digi-
tal photographs. Click the desired clip or still image that should
appear first in your video and then click Add.
DVD Builder adds the clip to your Production Editor pane as a thumbnail-
size icon.
5. Add the rest of your clips and still images: Click the Open Media
Selector link to choose additional clips and images. To add an item,
drag it from the Media Selector dialog box to the empty frame at the
end of the sequence.
Figure 11-8:

Part IV: Meeting Your Data Storage Needs
If you want to insert an item, drop it in the desired frame, and DVD
Builder shifts the rest of the items one frame to the right. To change the
order of the items, just drag the offending thumbnail and drop it in its
new location.
Note that DVD Builder keeps track of the amount of space that you’ve
used with a bar display at the bottom of the window. You can toggle the
estimated space between the different types of discs by clicking the
Disc Size drop-down list box at the left end of the bar; click the type of
disc that you want to record, and the status bar changes to reflect the
capacity of the specified disc type.
Not quite sure about the contents of a video clip? Just double-click the
clip’s thumbnail icon to watch it in the Preview window, complete with
the familiar controls from a typical DVD player program — these include
pause and advance/rewind one frame.
If you add a clip or image by mistake, right-click the item to display the
pop-up menu and click Delete to remove the element from your project.
6. To add a transition between items, click the Add Transitions link —
DVD Builder displays a spiffy selection of transition thumbnails (see
Figure 11-10). Click the desired transition and drag it to the transition
box between the two items.
To view what a transition looks like before you add it, click the tiny Play
button at the lower-right corner of any transition thumbnail in the
Media Selector dialog box. 
7. Ready to preview your disc? Click the Preview button at the top of
the Edit Task Pane.
The program displays the high-tech control panel shown in Figure 11-11,
complete with familiar controls like the buttons on a DVD player. Click
the Intro button at the top of the control panel to begin the show.

8. When you’ve finished your preview, click the Edit button at the top of
the Edit Task pane and click the Big Orange Disc-on-Fire Burn button
to continue.
From the Burn Setup dialog box (shown in Figure 11-12), you can select
the drive to use for burning, and erase a rewritable (CD-RW, DVD-RAM,
DVD+RW, or DVD-RW) disc. In most cases, you want to burn your project
immediately, but you can also create a disc image file for later recording.
DVD Builder automatically selects the default advanced settings to match
the type of disc you’re burning, so you’re ready to go!

hether it holds 90 minutes of digital video or it’s simply crammed full
of backup files, a DVD recordable disc is a wonderful thing. Only cur-
rent prices are holding most technotypes back from investing in a DVD-R/W,
DVD+R/W, or DVD-RAM drive. But those prices have already fallen from
$1,000 to less than $200 for a fast DVD-R/W drive, and the cost of blank media
has dipped more than 50 percent over the past two years. It’s simply a matter
of time until DVD recorders pack the shelves at your local discount store;
they will replace the CD-RW drives that are now standard equipment on
today’s PCs and Macs.
My job is clear: I must prepare you for the rigors of DVD recording so that
you’re ready for the coming wave of new hardware! It’s a daunting job, but,
well, it’s not really all that daunting. If you’re interested in backing up your
system or simply saving 4.7GB of data at once, burning a DVD is a process
similar to burning a CD-R or a CD-RW. I show you how in this chapter.
If you’re interested in mastering a DVD with digital video for use in your home
DVD player or your computer’s DVD-ROM drive, you are indeed walking into
an unfamiliar land — but this chapter shows you the way there!
Let me be honest with you (as always): This chapter offers only a basic
introduction to digital video editing and DVD authoring. For a much more
in-depth discussion of these topics, peruse Book II.
What’s Involved in Recording a DVD-R or DVD+R?
In short, the same four things required to burn a CD-R are involved in
recording a DVD-R or DVD+R:
✦A recorder
✦A blank disc
✦Your source material
✦The appropriate recording software (either UDF/packet writing, a DVD
authoring program with built-in burning capabilities, or a full-blown
mastering program similar to Roxio Easy Media Creator or Nero 6)
885

Part IV: Meeting Your Data Storage Needs
With this close resemblance to the now-familiar process of CD recording,
what gives DVD recording that James Bond feeling — at least at the time
this book was written? Here are several reasons:
✦Prices are still high. The painful side of DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, and DVD-
RAM recording simply starts with the high cost of the drive. Then you’re
hit with the cost of the blank media! A single DVD-R or DVD+R sets you
back anywhere from $1 to $2, and a typical DVD-RAM is a hefty $15. The
higher the cost, the less appealing DVD recording remains to average
computer owners.
✦DVD standards are still evolving. “Should I invest in DVD-RW, or is there
something just around the bend? Will my DVD player read the discs that I
record?” Unfortunately, far too many question marks still surround the
different DVD formats, and many computer owners are holding back
another six months to a year, hoping for one to become a clear winner.
✦Perceived value. At this point, many folks just don’t feel that they need
the space offered by recordable DVD. DVD is attractive for digital video
and system backups, but 700MB per CD-R is still a fair chunk of territory
(at a mere pittance of a price, too).
✦DV is only just becoming a mainstream technology. As DV camcorders
continue to drop in price and Uncle Milton decides to try out digital video
editing, DVD recording is sure to heat up (pun intended). Right now, the
analog camcorder and the VHS VCR are still Kings of the Mountain.
The Heavy Stuff: Introducing DVD Authoring
If you’ve been reading up on DVD technology, you know that DVD authoring
(that’s the process of creating an interactive DVD-ROM title, usually involv-
ing digital video, still images, and custom-written programs) and DVD burn-
ing go hand in hand.
Authoring a disc involves a little bit of flowchart design (the creation of a logi-
cal menu system), a little bit of artistic talent (the development of a distinc-
tive look and feel for the buttons, images, and background), and at least a
basic knowledge of digital video. Of course, the DVD video discs that you buy
at your local video store are authored by professionals who use hardware
and software packages that cost many thousands of dollars. You may be sur-
prised, however, at the results that you can achieve with the right software, as
you see in the iDVD project at the end of this chapter. (My first DVD amazed
my family. After they played with the menu system for several minutes, I was
such a hit that I could have sold them oceanfront property in Kansas.)
Although the recording is only a small part of the authoring process, I want 
to give you a small taste of two authoring programs. iDVD 4 is a free package
(with a new Mac) that’s exceptionally easy to use, and DVD Studio Pro 3 is a
full-blown professional authoring package that sets you back $500. (If that’s
not a wide price range, I don’t know what is.) Both these programs were
developed by Apple (www.apple.com) and run exclusively on the Macintosh,
but PC folks get about the same treatment at the low-end price point with
MyDVD 5 Deluxe from Sonic for $70, at www.sonic.com. Coincidentally — wink,
wink — MyDVD works very much like iDVD 4. Go figure.

The Heavy Stuff: Introducing DVD Authoring
Welcome to the world of iDVD
iDVD, a Mac OS X application, ships with the current crop of high-end G4 and
G5 Macs that offer the DVD-R SuperDrive. Because iDVD is aimed squarely at
novices, it has only a small selection of the more powerful features offered
by more expensive authoring applications. For example, iDVD automatically
creates your disc’s menu system, and you’re limited to full-screen video. But,
friends and neighbors, the kids at the local elementary school are now using
iDVD. It’s easy — and if it’s easy, normal people will try it!
DVDs created with iDVD are limited to displaying digital video and still
images (using a slideshow format). These displays are organized into media
folders (which, in turn, can hold subfolders). I especially like the fact that
discs created with iDVD take advantage of the DVD player’s remote control
(even though you don’t have to know anything about how your DVD remote
functions). It’s all taken care of automatically by iDVD, leaving you free to
concentrate on where to put what and how it should look.
An iDVD disc can contain up to about 90 minutes of digital video (DV) or a
combination of DV and slides. After you have completed your design, you
can use the program’s Preview mode to try out your disc before you burn it
(complete with a virtual remote).
For a guided tour through the process of creating a DVD-Video disc with
iDVD, check out the project at the end of this chapter.
Letting loose with DVD Studio Pro
On the other end of the spectrum, you have a heavyweight of DVD authoring:
DVD Studio Pro 2. It includes commercial features like Macrovision copy
protection, support for today’s popular widescreen aspect ratio, a total of
nine possible camera angles, MPEG format support, region coding, and
much more. You have complete control over your menu creation, with lay-
ered images taken from Adobe Photoshop. Unlike with iDVD, you choose
what actions are taken when the different buttons are pressed on the DVD
player’s remote control. Whereas iDVD can use only one audio track — the
audio from the video itself — a high-end package like DVD Studio Pro allows
as many as eight tracks, so you can mix music with your DV.
As with iDVD, you get a Preview mode with DVD Studio Pro, so you can
double-check all your work before burning. Speaking of recording, that too
is supported internally. As extra options, you can also write your completed
project to a disc image or DLT tape.
If you’re already well-versed in digital video editing, you should feel right 
at home using DVD Studio Pro 2 (and you should be better prepared for the
high prices for DV hardware and software). If you have just bought your
Macintosh and you have never shot a frame of DV, I recommend that you
pass on both the complexity and the price. This package will likely take you
places where you don’t want to venture, so stick with iDVD 4 (or, on the
Windows side, MyDVD 5).
887

Part IV: Meeting Your Data Storage Needs
Letting UDF Do the Work
Here’s another of my patented Nuggets o’ Knowledge, a Mark’s Maxim for
rewritable recording:
What works with CD-RW usually works just as well with DVD-RW or
DVD+RW.
(Look out — you could soon see this catchy phrase on bumper stickers and
t-shirts.)
In this case, what works is UDF — Universal Disk Format, otherwise known
as your old friend packet writing, which is compatible with Mac OS 9, Mac
OS X, and all versions of Windows 98 (and later). A number of great programs
are available for both Windows and the Mac operating system (OS) that
implement the Holy Grail of UDF. These applications allow you to use your
recordable DVD drive as a 4.7GB floppy (isn’t that a mind-boggling idea?)
except that your DVD recorder is much faster and much more reliable and
holds a heck of a lot more.
For DVD packet writing, I use Roxio’s Drag-to-Disc, which I cover in stunning
detail in Chapter 10 of Book IV. Of course, you can also run the full-blown
Easy Media Creator to build a DVD from a project layout, as I demonstrate
in Chapter 8 . . . but it takes longer, and I’m a creature who craves instant
satisfaction. (Really.)
Project: Recording a DVD-R with iDVD
Do you have a DVD-R drive in your Macintosh? Yes? Then you’re a self-
contained movie studio, and you probably didn’t even know it! (Don’t 
worry — you have plenty of time to hit eBay and bid on a beret, a mega-
phone, and one of those chalkboards with the clacky thing on top.) On 
the software end, all you need is iDVD. (And, as you’ve probably already 
figured out, this project gives you a good idea of how to handle things
under Windows XP with MyDVD 5.)
In this project, I use iDVD to show you how to create a home video DVD-
Video disc that you can watch in almost any standard DVD player. You may
be amazed at how easy Apple has made the process and how professional
your finished DVD looks. The completed disc features
✦An interactive menu system
✦Separate menus for digital video and a slideshow of still photographs
✦Menu music imported from iTunes
✦An automated slideshow
As a first step, you should convert or export your video in QuickTime format.
Both iMovie and Final Cut Pro allow you to export QuickTime movies directly,
but you can also use QuickTime Pro to convert video from other formats. If
you plan to add digital images, I recommend that they be in JPEG format,
which takes up far less room than the same images in TIFF format.
888

Project: Recording a DVD-R with iDVD
One cool feature of iDVD is its ability to use a digital photograph as the
background for your DVD menu system. If you want to do this, make sure
that the image you’re using is 640 x 480 pixels. (If necessary, you can resize
it with any image editor; I use Photoshop.)
After your source material has been converted to QuickTime and JPEG,
follow these steps:
1. Double-click the iDVD icon in your Applications folder to launch 
the program, which displays the iDVD project window shown in
Figure 12-1.
In effect, the project window is the skeleton for your DVD menu, so it’s
time to put something on those bare bones.
2. Choose Project➪Project Info. Click in the Disc Name field and type
the name for your DVD. Click OK to save the change.
In this case, I entered Example. (Just call me Mr. Imagination.)
Next, it’s time to choose a theme, which includes preconfigured choices
for fonts, button styles, and the background image used in your menu.
3. Click the Customize button in the main iDVD window, which opens
the iDVD Theme drawer.
4. Click the Themes button at the top of the drawer and scroll through
the choices that appear, as shown in Figure 12-2, to choose a theme.
For this example, select the Green Linen 2 thumbnail in the list.
5. To use your own background image, click the Settings button in the
Theme drawer (see Figure 12-3), drag an image from a Finder
window, and drop it into the Image/Movie thumbnail (or well) in the
Background section.
To add a moving background, drag a QuickTime movie into the well
instead.

Return to save it.
In Figure 12-5, I’ve used the title “Our Lazy Crazy Day at the Beach.”
Man, do I like Apple software!
7. Drag an audio clip into the Audio well in the Settings panel.
What fun is a menu without your favorite background tune? You can drag
the audio file from a Finder window, or click the Audio button in the iDVD
drawer to choose a song from your iTunes collection (if you’re feeling
sassy). iDVD recognizes AIFF, MP3, AAC, and WAV sound files.
Next, it’s time to add a video clip to the menu. That sounds a tad daunt-
ing, but there’s nothing to fear with iDVD.
8. Open the folder that contains your QuickTime movies and drag one
to the iDVD project window.
As shown in Figure 12-6, the program creates a custom button using a
thumbnail image from the video. The button is automatically centered
in the screen for you. Definitely not daunting.

9. Because the title under the button is less than descriptive, change it:
Click once on the text to display the edit box and then type a new
name.
You can also move the slider that appears above the button to choose
the thumbnail image from within the clip. (This is great for clips that
begin with darkness or something equally as uninteresting.) Figure 12-7
illustrates the slider. If you enable the Movie check box, the Movie
button in the menu becomes animated!
You can move a Movie button anywhere you like on your menu. Just click
it and drag it to the desired destination; it snaps to the closest position on
an imaginary grid. You can turn off this automatic alignment by enabling
the Free Position option in the Settings panel.
10. Add additional clips by repeating Steps 8 and 9.
You can add a maximum of six buttons to a single DVD menu screen;
personally, I avoid overcrowding a menu by adding no more than four
buttons.
11. Add a separate submenu for your slideshow display of digital images:
Click the Folder button to add a submenu button to the project window
and change the button name to whatever you like (I typed Slide Show).
You can change the look of your menu buttons another way: Click the
Settings button in the Theme drawer, and then select any Movie button
you’ve added to your DVD menu layout. Adjust the button’s properties
in the Button section of the Settings panel, and voilà! You have a new
appearance for your buttons!
12. Double-click the Slideshow button on your iDVD menu to display the
submenu screen. Click the title at the top of the submenu screen to
open the edit box, type your title text, and press Return to save it.
13. It’s time to add the Slideshow button itself. Click the Slideshow but-
ton at the bottom of the iDVD window, which adds a button to your
submenu.
14. Double-click the button that you added; this opens the My Slideshow
window. Drag the images that you want to add from their locations on
your hard drive into the window, as shown in Figure 12-8.

Once again, you can add images to your slideshow in another way: Click
the Photos button at the top of the iDVD drawer, which displays all the
images in your iPhoto Library (as well as the albums that you’ve defined
there). You can drag images from the Photos tab to the Slideshow
window.
15. At this point, you need to decide whether you want an automated
slideshow or a manual slideshow. If your parents had a slide projec-
tor like mine did, this step should really interest you:
• Manual: For a manual slideshow, leave the Slide Duration drop-down
list box set to Manual. It’s a good idea to enable the Display < > During
Slideshow check box, which superimposes left and right arrows on the
image as appropriate. (Although these arrows are optional, they help
remind Aunt Harriet how to advance through the photos in a manual
slideshow.) The lucky person holding the DVD player remote control
presses the right cursor key to move forward through the images and
the left cursor key to move backward.
• Automatic: The DVD player displays the images automatically (but
you can still move forward and backward by using the remote). Click
the Slide Duration drop-down list box and select the number of sec-
onds to delay before switching to the next image. If you like, you can
still enable the Display < > During Slideshow check box.
16. How about some audio for that slideshow of your cousin’s wedding?
Again, you can drag an audio file from a Finder window to the Audio
well in the Slideshow window.
If you’re a fan of iTunes, click the Audio button in the iDVD drawer, and
you can choose that perfect song from your iTunes playlists.
17. If you want to change the order of the slideshow sequence, click and
drag the image that you want to its new spot on the list. After you’ve
finished designing your slideshow, click the Return button to return
to the submenu screen.
Whoops — now that you have added your images, don’t forget to cus-
tomize the slideshow button.

Part IV: Meeting Your Data Storage Needs
18. Drag the slider to select one of the images in the slideshow as the
button image. To change the button’s caption, click it and type your
new text; press Return to save it.
(If you’re too cool for sliders, drag one of the JPEG images that will make
up your slideshow and drop it on top of the button.)
19. Care to preview your DVD? Click the Preview button at the bottom of
the iDVD window.
iDVD displays a cool-looking virtual remote. Note that the slideshow
button in the middle of the screen is now highlighted, just as it would 
be if you were using your DVD player. Use the buttons on the remote to
select menu items, and press Enter on the remote to activate the item
that’s highlighted. When you’re done playing with your DVD-to-be, click
the Preview button again to return to editing mode (where you can
make changes if you like).
You should save your project to your hard drive before you burn it.
20. Choose File➪Save Project As to display a standard Mac OS Save
dialog box. Navigate to the destination folder, type a new name for
your project, and click Save.
Okay, you film mogul, you — it’s time to record your own DVD!
21. Click the Burn button, which opens to display a glowing fail-safe
button. (Kinda nuclear-looking, ain’t it?)
Apple doesn’t want you to waste a blank disc with an accidental click of
your mouse. (Plus, it’s one of the neatest animated controls I’ve ever
used. Let no one say that Steve Jobs has no sense of humor.)
22. Click the Burn button again to start the recording process, and load a
blank DVD-R into your DVD recorder when prompted.
After the first disc has been burned, you can choose to record addi-
tional copies.
23. When the recording is done, eject the disc and pop it in your DVD
player.
Or, if you like, you can watch your creation on your Mac with the Mac
OS X DVD Player, which you can find in the Applications folder.
I should warn you that iDVD has quite a bit of housekeeping to do to pre-
pare your digital video, so you probably have to wait several minutes before
the recording starts. (This preparation time depends on the speed of your
Mac, the number of movies that you have added, and how long they are.)
