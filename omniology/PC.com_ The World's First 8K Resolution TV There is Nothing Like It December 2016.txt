EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD FROM
THE EDITOR
Nur Atiﬁ | PC.com Editor
H
ere we are again as the end of the year 
is closing in on us. To say that 2016 was 
a smooth sailing year would be lying. 
Regardless of the trials and tribulations, 
the Malaysian tech landscape has come 
out fairly unscathed. There were great consumer 
launches and events throughout the years, peppered 
with some industry drama in between. Overall, it was 
an exciting 2016, indeed. 
  Closing the year with a bang, PC.com is back once 
again with an amazing box issue – one that will solidify 
your New Year’s resolution. 8K resolution, that is. Read 
all about this new range of TV by Sharp and how it is 
revolutionising the market. 
Since the holiday season is in full cheer, get into the 
spirit of giving with our exciting Christmas Gift Guide. 
This year’s theme “12 Days of Christmas” will help you 
(or your loved ones) to create an extensive wishlist just 
in time for the holidays. 
We’ve also done away with our Tested segment for 
this December 2016 issue. In its place is Versus – a 
section that’s not for the faint hearted. Have a peek to 
see who wins in a one-to-one battle from categories like 
smartphones, cameras, gaming peripherals and many 
more. 
Our gaming section is particularly varied this time 
around. You have your action-adventure sequel and 
Japanese RPG on one end, and some indie games at the 
other. Curious? Head on there to read what we have in 
store for you.  
As always, do check out the latest happenings and 
events, including (but not limited to) new launches for 
the last month of 2016. You’d be surprise at the range of 
new products and services available. 
We won’t hold you back any further from delving to 
what we have to offer this month. Go forth and explore 
the last issue of the year from PC.com. We’ll be back to 
greet 2017 with a bang. 
Till then, happy holidays and happy reading.

Hello Hirzy! It all depends on your budget to be honest. Maxis for instance offers four different plans under its 
Maxis One plans where you pay either RM98/RM128/RM158/RM188 a month and you will get 20/30/40/50 GB 
of Internet data. Digi has three seperate plans where you will have to pay a monthly fee of RM50/RM80/RM110 
and you will receive 10/20/25 GB a month.
Thank you for the question! If you turn to page 66 
and 67, you will see which smartphone we chose 
to have the best camera. Alternatively, you can also 
check out the Oppo F1S or the new Apple iPhone 7 
Plus if you’re looking to splurge. Good luck!
Hey there Prakash. Yes we do have the game with us right 
now and are currently playing it. Look out for its review in 
our upcoming issue!

igital wide-format printing maintains its
popularity over the years, boasting a steady 
growth momentum in the industry. This can 
be attributed to the increased adoption of
new technologies and expanding range of applications

investments to purchase a wide-format printer. With
an aim to create a product that is both affordable and
highly efﬁcient, OKI Data introduces a new addition to
its ColorPainter family: the ColorPainter E-64s.

ho knows what evil lurks in the hearts 
of webcams? After the Dyn DDoS last 
month, this is a question on the minds
of a lot of security people. Someone 
recently asked us if we shouldn’t adopt a new name
for the Internet of Things (IoT) because the existing 
term is too vague. 
We responded that this vagueness was in fact 
the desired effect; many people have little to no 
understanding of how many devices in their house 
are now interconnected. This leaves us surrounded 
by things that are effectively web-enabled 
computers, which most people don’t even know
need to be secured.
So what do you need to do to help secure your 
devices, to decrease the chances of their being used 
for ill? There are a few things you can do, regardless 
of whether you know exactly which devices need
protecting. You may be able to improve the security of 
the IoT devices themselves, which is ideal if the device
is one that will accompany you in your daily travels.
But tightening up the settings on your router can 
help protect all of your devices while they are in 
your home.
1. CHANGE THE DEFAULT 
USERNAME AND PASSWORD
Routers and IoT devices often ship with default 
credentials that are easily found with a quick
trip to your favourite search engine. Use the 
web page or app provided by your router’s 
W

manufacturer that allows you to adjust settings.
Change both the username and the password to
something strong and unique. IoT devices may
also allow you to change your username and/
or password, and you should do so if you can.
2. DISABLE UNIVERSAL PLUG 
AND PLAY (UPNP) 
Unless you speciﬁcally know you need to use 
UPnP, you should disable this option in your
router settings. If this is not a service that you
know that you use, it’s unlikely you will notice
any difference after disabling it. Leaving this 
feature enabled allows people to access your 
network without authentication.
3. TURN OFF REMOTE 
MANAGEMENT
By turning off remote management (it may 
also be called something like “Web Access”),
physical access to the router will be required 
to change its settings.
4. CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR 
ACCESS POINT
Choose a name that doesn’t make it obvious
what type of router you’re using, or whose 
access point it is. While this isn’t something
that makes a huge difference in your security,
it’s usually a very easy change and it does make
it a little bit more challenging for attackers.
5. REQUIRE A PASSWORD FOR 
YOUR WI-FI CONNECTION
Allowing people to connect to your Wi-Fi 
without a password invites misuse, so use
strong encryption (WPA2 is best) to limit the 
number of people able to use your access 
point. Choose a good password, and don’t
post it where people can see it.
6. UPDATE THE SOFTWARE 
ON YOUR ROUTER AND IOT 
DEVICES 
Most people don’t know to check their router
or IoT devices for security updates at all. If you 
don’t get prompted to apply security patches
as soon as they become available, set an item 
on your calendar to prompt you to check for 
updates on a monthly or quarterly basis.
7. RESEARCH YOUR PURCHASES
If you’re considering buying a new router or
device, a little extra research can help you
improve the odds of getting one that was 
designed with security in mind from the 
beginning (or at least one that doesn’t have
too many existing problems).
8. READ REVIEWS 
Read online reviews of routers and IoT devices 
before purchasing them, with an eye towards 
ease of use, especially where security

HOME NETWORK 
PROTECTION
Home Network Protection includes hacked 
router detection and a list of devices on your 
network. Home routers are highly vulnerable 
to malware used to launch distributed denial-
of-service attacks (DDoS). This feature can 
identify a hacked router and provides you with 
an easy-to-access list of connected devices, 
with devices categorised by type (e.g. printer, 
router, mobile device, etc.), to show you who 
is connected.

features are concerned. While it’s possible to
tweak any router to make it more secure, if 
you don’t want to get into the nitty-gritty to 
accomplish that – such as installing 3rd party
router software – intelligible conﬁguration
software is a necessity. IoT devices are
enough of a novelty that alternate software is 
not yet an option, so it’s even more important
for them to be easy to secure.
9. CHECK FOR KNOWN 
VULNERABILITIES
Search for vendors and speciﬁc products 
on CVE Details to see if they have known 
vulnerabilities. 
If 
the 
product 
you’re 
considering has vulnerabilities, you can do 
a search for the speciﬁc CVE number to see
if a patch is available. Naturally, it’s best to 
avoid devices that have issues with ongoing, 
unpatched security holes.
10.  CHECK FOR KNOWN ISSUES
Search for vendors on the Better Business 
Bureau site to see if other customers have 
reported issues, or if there are government 
actions against the company. Use your
favourite search engine to look for the product 
or vendor name with the word “recall” to see 
if there are any recalls under way.
11. PERUSE THE VENDOR’S 
WEBSITE
Look at the vendor’s website to ﬁnd their
privacy policy, to see if it’s easily readable
and clear. While you’re there, look for a 
responsible disclosure policy, as this can
indicate that a vendor is willing and able to
quickly address issues as they’re discovered.
While it’s unlikely that your home devices
played a part in last month’s DDoS attack, it
is entirely possible that this event was just
a preliminary test. If businesses bolster their
security and return recalled devices, and if we
all start hardening our devices at home, we can
decrease the number of devices available for
miscreants to use in their next attempt.

Malaysia’s economic outlook riding on ICT
 allocations in Budget 2017 
58
DEC 2016

W
hile the years before 
has its difﬁculties, the 
onslaught of uncertainties 
and economic instabilities surprised 
many of us in 2016. Much like the 
rest of the world, the Malaysian 
economy 
experienced 
its 
fair 
share of challenges, which can be 
attributed to political instability and 
external factors, among others.  
Factors like the fall of global oil 
prices, Brexit and the US Elections 
affected our economy more than 
we care to admit; the weakening of 
the Malaysian Ringgit being one of 
them. 
Given the looming reservations 
in business growth, it was certainly 
one bumpy ride for most, if not all 
sectors. As we approach the tail end 
of 2016, we can’t help but wonder 
what’s in store for us in 2017. 
In last year’s ICT Outlook, we 
highlight the steadfast growth of 
the sector for 2016. At the time, 
technology was not only fuelling 
major business transformation across 
industries, it was also changing how 
technology enterprises sell their 
products and services, operate, and 
plan for future growth, says Paul 
Sallomi, Global Technology, Media & 
Telecommunications Industry leader 
and US and Global Technology 
Sector leader, Deloitte. 
He adds that technology is the 
backbone of the digital economy, 
where the rate of change and 
the level of disruption driven by 
modern technology are exponential. 
Advancements 
in 
computer 
processing power, data storage, 
and chip design; the ubiquity of 
bandwidth; enterprise mobility; and 
many other developments that have 
unfolded in recent years are enabling 
myriad opportunities that were once 
impossible, both technologically and 
economically.
External Woes 
According to John-David Lovelock, 
research vice president at Gartner, 
2016 was the year that business 
focus turns to digital business, the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and even 
algorithmic business. 
“To fund these new initiatives, 
many businesses are turning to cost 
optimisation efforts centring around 
the new digital alternatives (for 
example, SaaS instead of software 
licenses, voice over LTE [VoLTE] 
instead of cellular and digital personal 
assistants instead of people) to save 
money, simplify operations and speed 
time to value. It is precisely this new 
breadth of alternatives to traditional 
IT that will fundamentally reshape 
what is bought, who buys it and how 
much will be spent,” he opines. 
While these ideals still hold 
true in today’s ICT landscape, we 
cannot ignore that Gartner had 
also forecasted that worldwide IT 
spending has not been reﬂecting 
the sentiments back in July 2016. 
The agency shares that worldwide 
IT spending is forecast to be ﬂat in 
2016, totalling US$3.41 trillion. The 
change in the forecast is mainly due 
to currency ﬂuctuations.
“The immediate impact of Brexit 
has caused modest growth in IT 
spending to turn negative for 2016,” 
says Lovelock. 
“Without the U.K., global IT 
spending growth would have been 
59
DEC 2016

COVER STORY
modestly positive at 0.2% in 2016, 
but with the U.K. included, IT 
spending is expected to decrease 
0.3%. The immediate impact of the 
British pound will also cause the IT 
spending patterns to shift as prices 
for IT will increase.”
On the other hand, Malaysia’s IT 
spending is expected to grow 6.5% 
to reach almost RM68 billion in 
2016, according to Gartner, however, 
the growth rate is smaller at 1.5% 
when reported in US Dollar due to 
currency ﬂuctuations.
All in the Numbers
In 
2017, 
IDC 
predicts 
Digital 
Transformation 
(DX) 
will 
attain 
macroeconomic scale over the next 
three to four years, changing the way 
enterprises operate and reshaping 
the global economy and expects we 
will see in 2017 the dawn of the “DX 
Economy”. 
It predicts that total IT spending 
that 
includes 
infrastructure, 
software and services is expected to 
grow by 3.3% to be worth US$21.16 
billion in 2017.
“This transformation will have 
a profound impact on industries 
and citizens in Asia, including 
Malaysia. Industries can use cutting 
edge digital technology to improve 
productivity and efﬁciency, while 
digital citizen services (through both 
public and private providers) will 
improve the standard of living and 
quality of life,” says Pranabesh Nath, 
Research Director, IDC Malaysia. 
This is in line with Dell 
Technologies 
Research 
ﬁndings 
where 83% of APJ (Asia Paciﬁc 
including Japan) businesses believe 
digital start-ups will pose a threat to 
their organisation, either now or in 
the future. 
This phenomenon is propelling 
innovative 
companies 
forward 
and accelerating the demise of 
others. More than half (52%) of 
businesses surveyed fear they may 
become obsolete in the next three 
to ﬁve years due to competition from 
digital-born start-ups (Global: 45%).
Some companies are feeling 
badly bruised by the pace of 
change. Six in ten (61%) of APJ 
business leaders have experienced 
significant 
disruption 
in 
their 
industries over the past three years 
as a result of digital technologies 
and the Internet of Everything, and 
58% of businesses in the region 
don’t know what their industry will 
look like in three years’ time.
“IDC sees this transformation 
is in its advanced stages in the 
region such as Singapore and Japan, 
with clear beneﬁts in increasing 
macroeconomic indicators such as 
GDP per capita, employment and 
productivity. Hence, many countries 
in the region are accelerating 
their own digital transformation 
programmes,” says Nath.
Amit Midha, President, APJ 
Commercial, Dell EMC adds: “The 
inﬂuence of digital revolution has 
led to a signiﬁcant decline in the 
barriers to entry across industries. 
Aided by the strong entrepreneurial 
spirit and government support in the 
APJ region, we have witnessed the 
rise of numerous digital start-ups. 
Failing to innovate will impact the 
competitiveness of established APJ 
businesses in the digital era.”
Budget Led Digital Economy
Thankfully RAM Ratings Services 
Bhd has projected the Malaysian 
economic growth momentum to 
stabilise in 2017 due to the resiliency 
of domestic demand and improving 
external prospects. 
RAM Ratings projected gross 
domestic product growth of 4.5% 
in 2017, slightly better than 4.2% 
expected this year, where private 
investment growth driven by big-
ticket infrastructure projects. 
“That said, the prevailing uncertainties 
vis-à-vis the commencement of ‘British 
exit’ talks and the impact this may have 
on European businesses, the US’ trade 
strategy under a new administration and 
the lingering uncertainties over global oil 
prices will still pose crucial downside risks 
to RAM Ratings’ forecasts for next year,” 
it adds.
In hopes to bolster the growth of 
the country – hopefully to prepare 
for the challenging year ahead – 
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib 
Razak tabled a range of proposals in 
the recent Budget 2017. 
The Oxford Business Group 
(OBG) opines that the latest national 
budget signals an acceleration of 
Malaysia’s digital drive, with both 
ICT research and development (R&D) 
and broadband provision awarded 
signiﬁcant funding increases.
Seconding the motion is IDC 
Malaysia. It believes Malaysia Budget 
2017 was an incremental step in 
achieving Malaysia’s vision of a fully 
connected digital economy. Although 
the speciﬁc ﬁnancial breakdown of the 
budget initiatives is not yet available, 
the direct and indirect impact on the 
Malaysian ICT sector is apparent.

speed of ﬁxed line broadband 
services; tax relief for purchase 
of selected technology products 
and services; funding for speciﬁc 
MDEC programs focusing on speciﬁc 
initiatives and the launching of a 
Digital Free Zone. 
IDC Malaysia comments: “It will 
be interesting to see if the recent 
budget initiatives will help Malaysia 
in achieving its vision of a digital 
economy given that key budget items 
are directly related to technology.” 
High-speed internet connectivity 
is 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
requirements in accelerating the 
adoption and usage of digital 
services in the economy, which 
produces a positive impact on 
overall GDP growth, says IDC. 
Currently, the average ﬁxed line 
internet speed in Malaysia is at 
6.8 Mbps, up 36% compared to the 
previous year, according to Akamai‘s 
Q2 2016 State of the Internet / 
Connectivity Report. The proportion 
of internet users with access speeds 
greater than 10 Mbps and 4 Mbps 
has increased to 16% and 66% 
respectively. 
The same study also highlights 
that Malaysia had slipped down 
to 70th on a global list comparing 
broadband speeds, trailing behind 
the likes of Singapore, Vietnam and 
Thailand.
On this front, the Malaysian 
government has channelled a total 
of RM1.2 billion into developing 
broadband services in rural areas.  
The funds, under the purview 
of the Malaysian Communications 
and Multimedia Commission, will 
be spent on upgrading the national 
ﬁbre-optic backbone as well as the 
undersea cable system.
The 
government 
has 
also 
recognised 
the 
importance 
of 
further enabling SMEs in increasing 
macroeconomic 
indicators. 
The 
US$17.7 
million 
allocated 
to 
promote SMEs development, as 
well as the funding for MDEC 
programs such as the e-commerce 
ecosystem 
and 
Digital 
Maker 
Movement, is a very positive step 
in this direction.
“The e-commerce ecosystem 
will continue to evolve in the future 
with the maturity of services, and 
the consumption patterns of the 
citizens. Two key areas worthy of 
future attention are ﬁguring out 
how to retain more revenues from 
e-commerce sector within Malaysia, 
as well as encouraging global 
e-commerce platforms to increase 
investment in the country,” says 
Vijay Sundararaman, IDC Malaysia 
Country Manager. 
“There is a growing discussion 
on the creation of e-hubs that can 
accelerate SMEs output, as well 
as interconnectivity of these hubs 
globally to create a worldwide 
Mega Trading Platform.”
Another interesting proposal 
to look forward to for 2017 is the 
Digital Free Zone or DFZ concept in 
the Malaysia. The concept seeks 
to enable Malaysia-based small to 
mid-sized businesses to sell their 
products additionally through an 
e-platform. Such an initiative can 
increase SME sector contribution to 
the overall GDP, while also placing 
Malaysia in a leadership position in 
the development of e-hubs globally.
“We are thrilled that the 
budget for next year recognises the 
contribution of the digital economy 
to the country’s GDP. Initiatives 
such as the Malaysia Digital Hub 
and the creation of the world’s first 
DFZ are steps in the right direction 
to bolster the country’s strategic ICT 
thrust,” says K Raman, Managing 
Director, Microsoft Malaysia.
“This is a very exciting time 
for Malaysia, as a growing digital 
economy needs a strong support 
structure and ecosystem to thrive. 
Initiatives such as the Digital Free 
Zone will set the country apart as 
a key differentiator amongst other 
competing nations.”
Microsoft Malaysia also lauds 
the announcement of the Digital 
Maker Movement and the Malaysia 
Digital Hub, which will help nurture 
talents and create innovators, while 
enabling the country to be a fully 
sustainable digital economy. 
In a media statement PWC shares: 
“The concept of the DFZ sounds 
exciting, and hopefully will be a game 
changer for us. The MSC initiative 
certainly propelled us forward into 
the technology space, and it’s time we 
had another catalyst to make us an 
attractive destination as a digital hub.”
However, there may be some 
challenges ahead. For instance, 
73% of SMEs in Malaysia are 
lagging in adopting ICT in their 
business operations, which implies 
lack of awareness to the benefits of 
digital platforms in enhancing their 
business and elevating them from 
competitors.
“Given the potential this initiative 
alone has in helping Malaysia 
leapfrog into the league of high-
income nations, this is possibly the 
most noteworthy announcement of 
the 2017 budget,” Nath concludes.

pleasure; picture was sharp 
even at close range and the 
colours were exceptionally 
vibrant. The curved edges 
played an important role

would. There’s a sense 
you are getting maximum

possible with the denser 
pixels of 1440 x 2560 
pixel resolution alongside 
an improved AMOLED 
technology with 16 million 
colours.
Fully Submerged 
With No Problems
One of the key features of 
the Galaxy S7 Edge was 
the dust and waterproof 
IP68 rating, which we 
just had to verify. We 
submerged the S7 Edge in 
a beaker ﬁlled with water, 
left the YouTube video 
running (it continued to 
receive the office Wi-Fi 
signal and played the full 
video); we took the phone 
out, wiped it down and 
made a call. There were no

E6 OLED 4K TV
Everyone Gets 3D
One of the features that I 
thoroughly enjoyed from the 
LG E6 OLED 4K TV – it was 
only an hour or so by the way – was its 
passive 3D feature, which allows you 
to turn any movie you watch into a 3D 
movie. The TV also came included with 
a pair of passive 3D glasses so you can 
enjoy watching your favourite movies 
in 3D without having to head out to the 
cinema to catch one instead.

Elegance Meets Practicality
What makes the E6 stand out among the crowd is its paper-
thin OLED panel that has been seamlessly integrated into a 
transparent glass plate. It ﬁts perfectly into any part of your 
home without taking up much space and will add a touch of 
class and elegance without even being turned on. The E6 is 
capable of catching anyone’s eye just by its design alone but 
it’s its superior picture quality that makes you want to stay.
It Comes To Life
The E6’s OLED panel is a technological 
wonder as it comes with self-lighting 
pixels, capable of turning themselves
on and off, depending on what is being 
shown on the screen. This
allows the E6 to generate 
the perfect black where
perfect colours come to life.

X85D 4K HDTV
Personal Cinema Experience
If you ever thought heading to the cinema was the best 
way to watch a movie, you have not tried it out on the 
X85D. Thanks to Sony’s innovative Slim Backlight Drive, 
it guides light to where it’s needed most on the screen. 
This ensures that parts of the screen that is too bright is 
dimmed down while other parts that are in need of light 
gets brightened up.
My name is... Slim... 
Shady?
Although the X85D doesn’t 
sell platinum rap albums, 
it does however, hold its 
own when it comes to 
being considered as one 
of the slimmest LCD TV’s 
Sony has to offer. At only 
11.2mm, the slim bezel on 
the X85D ensures you 
get the most out of the 
TV without having to 
compromise on the quality 
of the picture.

U
p
While having interchangeable lenses is a welcomed addition, I can t 
help but feel that it’s not optimised for it. I’ve tested the camera and 
both lenses in various locations with different lighting conditions, and 
it performed remarkably in daytime and brightly lit areas. However, 
it went immediately downhill when it came to lowlight situations 
especially with the zoom lens. The autofocus was certainly lacking as 
it didn’t register an object even though it’s just less than 12 feet away.

Garmin Connect application where you can build your customised 
workout online, sync it to the 235, and you’re good to go. It’s a little 
limited though, as the watch itself does not contain previous data

Worth Every Penny
The GoPro HERO4 Black is the top-of-the-line action camera that 
GoPro has to offer (before the HERO5 Black hits the shelves, of 
course). And because of that, it’s priced almost similar to an entry-
level DSLR camera. However, it’s tough, adaptable and shoots really 
high quality video. As a complete package, the GoPro is hard to beat 
as it is chock full of features and produces broadcast-quality video for 
the casual adventurer.
Top Notch Image Quality
Image quality at both 4K and 1080p 
resolutions was very good. The lens
did a good job avoiding chromatic
aberrations and details were sharp. 
Colours were slightly muted but that
could also be due to less-than-ideal

Learn more about what goes into preparing for a live concert photography gig
Professional photographer Hajime Kamiiisaka shares some tips on what he has learnt from his experience photographing numerous artists, including Momoiro 
Clover Z, AKB48, and Arashi. If you’ve ever wondered how to get started in or get better with your live concert photography skills, look no further!

PRO TIPS FOR LIVE CONCERT PHOTOGRAPHY: 
4 TIPS FOR GETTING READY
98
DEC 2016

PIXELS
Getting Ready 1: Understand that live concert photography starts before the performance begins
To skilfully photograph an artist at a live concert, you should realise that the photoshoot starts even before the performance begins. Don’t forget to keep the 
following 3 points in mind.
Point 1: Visualise the kind of photos you will take and mentally rehearse how to take them
Firstly, have an image of the photos you want in mind. Strive to undertake live concert photography with a clear image in mind as to what kind of photos you 
would like to take and which performing artist you would like to capture in your shots. I usually prepare myself by viewing live videos of the artist(s) whom I will 
be shooting, so that I can predict the moments when they do certain actions such as jumping.
Point 2: Check where you can photograph from during the live concert
Next, secure your shooting position. It is important to conﬁrm whether you will be able to move freely around the venue to take your shots. If you are unable to 
do so, secure a position where you can take the kinds of shots you have in mind.
Point 3: Prepare techniques for handling your shoot ﬂexibly
Finally, be able to adapt to any shooting condition. Conditions, such as lighting and direction, might differ for events held at a live music club that accommodates 
a crowd of 100, as opposed to events held in a concert hall with a capacity for 10,000 or more. Remember to practise your photography techniques in advance 
so that you can ascertain and deal with the differences between what you had in mind and the live concert conditions. This way you’ll be one step closer to 
successful shots in live concert photography. While there are various techniques available, if you are able to freely move the AF point around as intended, you 
will be able to take better shots.
f/5, 1/50 sec., ISO 
2000
I aim to create shots 
that are not only 
close to what I had 
in mind, but also suit 
the atmosphere of the 
venue. 
f/4.5, 1/100 sec., ISO 
4000
The lighting differs 
for each live venue. It 
is important to study 
the performances and 
personality of the artist 
so that you can have an 
idea of what you would 
like to shoot, and be 
able to ﬂexibly deal 
with the conditions of 
the live concert. 
99
DEC 2016

PIXELS
Getting Ready 2: Know the ISO range available on your camera
A live concert venue can be darker than you imagine. However, it is a must to have a shutter speed of 1/125 second or higher. This is particularly important when you are
capturing a shot of the vocalist, as you will not get the desired result if the movement of the mouth is not “frozen”. You will want to have a certain depth of ﬁeld as well,
so as a guide, set your aperture to f/4-5.6. However, as you increase the ISO speed, the shots you can take will eventually be limited by the capabilities of your camera.
High ISO speeds inevitably produce noise. The degree of noise differs depending on the type of camera you use. When limited to live concert photography with a lot 
of dark scenes, I have found that ISO speeds of up to ISO 1600 are ﬁne on the EOS 760D. While high-end cameras are able to keep noise to a minimum even at high ISO 
speeds, my preference is to limit the ISO speed to ISO 2500 on the EOS 5D Mark III as nothing beats a beautifully captured photo.
To readily determine which ISO speeds are suitable for your camera, you can increase the ISO speed and take test shots in the comfort of your own room. It’s a good 
idea to take this opportunity to check the ISO speeds that you can set on your own camera.
f/5, 1/20sec, ISO 200
f/5, 1/500sec, ISO 3200
The graininess of the
noise according to
different ISO speeds is 
easy to spot. Take some 
test shots to check the 
ISO speeds that you can
set for your camera.
100
DEC 2016

PIXELS
Getting Ready 3: Prepare a telephoto lens for any close-up shots
If you want to take close-up shots of an artist, you will need a telephoto zoom lens. With only a standard kit lens (e.g. EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM), the focal length
will not be sufﬁcient in many cases. Some affordable lenses that I would recommend are the EF-S55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM and EF70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM. One
way to try out the effects of telephoto zoom lenses is to attend a Canon Photo Party, where you can borrow equipment to try out for yourself.

up shot of the artist.
f/4, 1/100 sec., ISO 640
It is hard to capture
close-ups of artists with 
kit lenses as they have a 
shorter focal length.
Getting Ready 4: Know the shooting angle for capturing great shots of artists
You should also learn the basic angles for taking great shots of artists.
For vocalists, focus on the mouth. Place the mouth of the vocalist clearly in the frame to “freeze” the movement of their mouth. Even if you are able to get a 
close-up shot of an artist, if the movement of their mouth isn’t “frozen” due to a slower shutter speed, or if the shape of the mouth appears unnatural, this will 
spoil the ﬁnish of your photos.
There are angles for capturing great shots of artists. As a guideline, remember to “freeze” the mouths for vocalists, and make sure to clearly show the 
surface of the instruments when shooting instrumentalists.
And there you have it, some of the basics to getting ready for live concert photography! Naturally, it is possible to put this into practice by composing your 
shots to boldly bring the neck of the guitar into the foreground to bring out a sense of depth in your photos.
The last tip comes from my personal experience: I have noticed that shooting someone’s face from the left side produces a sharper image, while shooting from 
the right side captures an image that leaves a softer impression. However, ultimately, the artists themselves also have an image to maintain. Check out their 
websites and photos, and you might make new discoveries as to which side (left/right) they prefer.

Summary: Getting ready in advance will help you bring out an artist’s appeal
Having shot for numerous live concerts, I can say that advance preparation is of utmost importance. Find out everything you need to know about the venue, such 
as the shooting location, distance from the stage, lighting and direction, and the progression of the programme. At dark live concert venues, it is harder to check 
the equipment you have on hand, and you won’t have much time to do so. Hence, don’t forget to practice using your equipment on a daily basis so that you can 
operate it smoothly on your own.
It is also important to study the artist’s image, dominant hand, habits, and so on. For me though, I think the real thrill of live concert photography is in being 
able to communicate with artists through the shoot. While your own tastes are important, ideally you should be able to shoot with an understanding about the 
artist’s musicianship and preferences for their performance.
Each of these points on their own might not be particularly remarkable, but when you put them all together, you will be able to get results. Aiming to get a 
shot that exceeds the artist’s expectations is the ﬁrst step toward becoming a pro. Get so familiar with your camera that you can operate it freely without having 
to look at the controls.

For guitarists, bass players, etc., focus on their instruments. Keep the 
surfaces of the instrument in mind when composing your shots so that they 
can be seen clearly. When you keep the surface of the instrument in mind, its 
form and shine will complete the image. It is also very important to ﬁnd out 
the artist’s dominant hand in advance so as to avoid being on the opposite side 
instead when you are in your shooting position.
For vocalists, focus on the mouth. Place the mouth of the vocalist clearly in 
the frame to “freeze” the movement of their mouth. Even if you are able to get 
a close-up shot of an artist, if the movement of their mouth isn’t “frozen” due 
to a slower shutter speed, or if the shape of the mouth appears unnatural, this 
will spoil the ﬁnish of your photos.

what their industry will look like in
three years from a recent study done
by Dell Technologies.
From the data gathered, businesses
have agreed to moving towards a

strategies to digital transformation. 
However, 
most 
companies

embark on a digital transformation.
To truly realise their digital future,
we believe the vast majority of
organisations will transform their IT

printing 
will 
ultimately
replace the silk screen printing for
the mass market.”
“Working with the Epson digital
textile printer was truly exciting. It’s
just amazing that the machine uses 
the silk screen technique but works 
more like a photocopy machine. I
will deﬁnitely consider digital textile 
printing for my future work. Based on 
my experience, it complements the 
fashion industry and hopefully will 
eventually cater to the couture market 
too,”,” he adds.

upon that footprint into a brand new nationwide LTE 
network. I’m proud to say that we are the 4G champion 
of Malaysia in the truest sense as we are the ﬁrst to 
introduce nationwide 4G ﬁve and a half years ago with 
the YES network.
Over the past few years, mobile phones have 
evolved to becoming the centre of people’s lives, 
replacing the needs of PCs, laptops and tablets. In 
order to support a data-centric as well as a mobile-
centric lifestyle, it makes sense for us to use the 
existing investment that we have to layer that on top 
with a brand new investment using LTE technology. 
We’re proud to announce that we have launched 
the single largest LTE footprint in Malaysia, covering 
both the East and West. In addition to that, we’ve 
also launched the world’s most advanced telephone 
technology – Voice over LTE (VoLTE) on this network. 
We are the ﬁrst in Malaysia to launch nationwide 4G 
LTE as well as being the absolute ﬁrst in Malaysia to 
launch VoLTE services, which is the most advanced 
form of mobile communications in Malaysia.
Sufﬁce to say, we are very proud of what we’ve 
achieved in terms of fantastic network technology, 
superior innovation and to rung it up, amazing pricing 
programs to make our services more affordable.
PC.com: It has been quite a journey for YES 
from WiMAX broadband and now full 4G LTE 
rollout and your coverage is expanding at such 
an accelerated rate within such a short span of 
time. What is the difference do you have in stored 
for the consumers and how are you different 
from the many others who are operating in the 
same space as you?

DEC 2016
Wing: That’s a very good question! First of, 
we are not the ﬁrst to launch LTE in Malaysia; 
we are probably the third or fourth. But, what 
makes us different from the rest is that on other 
LTE networks in Malaysia, you don’t get the full 
performance beneﬁts of LTE. What’s important for 
your readers to know and understand is the fact 
that all the existing operators launched its LTE 
networks through a 3G spectrum.
Let me put it this way; you have an existing 
highway that carries 3G trafﬁc. For the other 
network operators in Malaysia, capacity is 
removed from the existing 3G highway in order to 
add a few 4G lanes to it. However, it all shares 
the same highway, which will result in congestion. 
So even 4G and LTE devices connected to those 
highways will only have a few lanes to work 
with and not the full highway. Everyone at YTL 
Communications – myself included – believe that 
this isn’t the proper way to go about launching LTE 
because we are not fully utilising the performance 
characteristics of LTE.
What we have done is creating our very own 
4G highway using WiMAX technology, which is a 
broadband network. As opposed to taking capacity 
away from that network to offer new highway 
lanes for LTE on the same highway, we decided 
to build a brand new highway on top of that. This 
means, we have two multi-lane 4G highways on 
one network.
As far as the consumers and I are concerned, 
consistency is key when it comes to experience. 
Nobody wants to have a good and consistent 
connection to the servers in the morning only to 
have it slowed down and congested during the 
rest of the day. Another important aspect for our 
consumers is if you look at other networks, they 
only offer 4G in dense urban areas i.e. big cities. 
For the people who are constantly travelling 
around Malaysia, you will notice that once you 
leave a dense populated urban area, the most 
you will get out of your device is 3G or even 2G 
sometimes if you’re really unfortunate. This is 
why we have focused our goals to bringing 4G 
nationwide so you can have the same level of 
consistency and performance no matter where 
you are.
PC.com: In regards to your earlier explanation 
on the 4G highway that you’ve built, to the 
average consumer, this would all seem very 
complex to him. Some consumers wouldn’t 
be able to understand what the competitor’s 
4G is all about and what YES’ 4G is all about. 
When it comes right down to it, it is the price 
point that is the selling factor. Do you see 
that as a challenge?
Wing: No, absolutely not. In my mind, that is an 
amazing advantage for us. If you look at it from a 
network standpoint, we have the most efﬁcient 
network in Malaysia. Network operators in Malaysia 
started out with an existing GSM network; soon 
after, data was added to upgrade to a 2G network, 
which then soon evolved to becoming a 3G network 
and shortly after, 4G network as well. Basically, they 
have to maintain four different networks and every 
single network costs money and not only from an 
initial cost standpoint but also from an on-going cost 
standpoint for maintanence and support.
From this, you can see the cost structure 
gradually rising whereas in our case, our network is 
a ﬂat IP network from day one. This means that every 
network from East to West, North to South only runs 
on one technology – IP technology. This allows you 
to enjoy the huge efﬁcieny of Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). For the sake 
of driving innovation, this is the most efﬁcient and 
powerful protocol as the Internet thrives on IP. I think 
we did the right thing seven years ago where we ﬁrst 
started building this network. Back then, it wasn’t 
intuitive to build a network ground up to be IP-based 
but in that critical juncture but now, it is intuitive as 
we are currently reaping the beneﬁts of having a 
nationwide IP-based footprint while still continuining 
to be innovative.
PC.com: I checked out your 4G coverage on 
your site. Peninsular Malaysia is covered but 
what about East Malaysia?
Wing: For now, we have covered Sabah and we are 
in process of going to Sarawak as well. Firstly, we 
will ﬁrst need to look for ideal sites where we can 
build towers and we are currently working with the 
state of Sarawak to do that. Secondly, we also have 
to have sufﬁcient backhall capacity in order to build 
a facility in Sarawak so we don’t have to ferry the 
trafﬁc back to our facilities in Johor or Penang.
PC.com: And what is your subscription 
base now?
Wing: As of right now, we have two networks; one 
has been running for ﬁve and a half years using 
mobile broadband technology, which is using the 
YES broadband network and has over a million 
subscribers. When it comes to our LTE network that 
was just recently launched, we are currently very 
happy with the results and are seeing very good 
uptake throughout the country.
PC.com: What can you tell us about your 
double-double plans and its relation to Eric 
Cantona?
Wing: Cantona has the unique honour of being a 
double-double winner, which goes well together 
with our double-double plan. This is due to Cantona 
winning the BPL as well as the FA Cup back in the 
1996-96 football season. Most people in Malaysia 
would know Eric Cantona as that and we’ve 
incorporated our double-double network into the 
equation where our customers has access to both 
LTE and broadband network.
While we’re on the subject of price plans, 
many other networks in Malaysia (not to mention 
any names) have a certain restriction in its ﬁne 
print when it comes to data usage. What makes 
us different from the rest is that we have no 
restrictions to our data plans. It’s the customer’s yet 
hence, how they choose to use their data is totally 
up to them. 
PC.com: Do you have any closing statements?
Wing: In ﬁve and a half years, YTL Communications 
have achieved so much. We launched the ﬁrst and 
largest 4G broadband network in this country and on 
the same footprint we launched the ﬁrst and largest 
advanced 4G network complete with VoLTE service.

solutions, with Accenture estimating 
the regional investment in FinTech 
increased from US$880 million in 
2014, to nearly US$3.5 billion in the 
ﬁrst nine months of 2015. 
To get an in-depth look at the
state of IT in banks across the region,
Hitachi Data Systems got together 
with IDC Financial Insights to examine 
how the latest technology trends in 
Digital Transformation are creating
new opportunities and challenges. 
The ﬁndings revealed that despite 
an average annual increase of 6% 
in IT spending in the last four years,
80% of banks see high total cost of 
ownership (TCO) in infrastructure 
related investments. This has driven 
many to adopt solutions designed to 
improve cost efﬁciency, a factor in the
rising popularity of all-ﬂash storage in 
the region.

compliance as a ‘major concern’
despite the increase in their budgets. 
TheIT industry has been quick to respond,
developing solutions to help those in
regulated industries gain visibility and
improve governance of their data. When
it comes to security, 25% of banks faced
Severity 1 incidents in the past year, and
with downtime costing Asian banks an
average of US$1.4 million per hour, these
are breaches they can ill-afford.

can quickly detect any anomalies that
could pose a threat to security. One 
of Australia’s ‘Big Four’ banks has 
implemented a turnkey system, allowing
it to reduce the costs associated with

compliance. 
Banks in India are embracing Pentaho-
embedded analytics to enable the 
adoption of new mobile banking services
through 
greater 
business 
insight. 
Meanwhile in China, a tier 1 bank 
saw a 45% reduction in IT costs after
consolidated its infrastructure. 
Change is taking place across the

From the ﬁrst stone axe to the latest, 
state of the art assembly line robots, 
machines have become an integral 
part of the manufacturing ecosystem, 
helping humans improve efﬁciency 
and productivity since the stone age. 
With the help of machines, humans 
have been able to innovate, and work 
faster and smarter, focusing on tasks 
that require more brain than brawn. 
This has beneﬁted businesses and 
employment numbers across the 
globe. In fact, recent research has 
revealed that over the past ﬁve years, 
robotics created an estimated 1.5 
million jobs, and is expected to create 
up to a further two million by 2020.
With the manufacturing industry 
in Southeast Asia still growing 
and evolving, a group of small 
and compact robots, with ﬂexible 
arms and the ability to work 
alongside people in tight spaces, 
are setting themselves apart from 
traditional, bulky industrial robots. 
Collaborative robots, or co-bots, 
in short, are the latest evolution 
in the realm of industrial robotics, 
and fast emerging as a new and 
powerful industrial tool. The term 
encapsulates the notion that robots 
and humans working together can 
deliver the best of both worlds: the 
speed and repeatability of robotic 
assembly, with the adaptability and 
intelligence of trained humans.

intelligent 
robots are capable of performing 
repetitive 
tasks, 
with 
pinpoint 
precision and unfailing consistency, 
the success of co-bots in the 
workplace is still critically dependent 
upon human safety. 
->viÌÞ\Ê/iÊÌ«Ê«ÀÀÌÞ
While 
robots 
have 
evolved, 
manufacturing still contains many 
basic 
ergonomically 
hazardous 
tasks such as welding, grinding, and 
the lifting of heavy objects. These 
tasks place employees at risk of 
industrial accidents and injuries. In 
addition, fatigue is a real concern, 
as workers have to be constantly 
vigilant to prevent carelessness, 
which contributes to a fair amount 
of workplace accidents.
Furthermore, manufacturers in 
Southeast Asia are increasingly 
pressured to maximise the usage of 
factory space to meet rising customer 
demands, especially as the cost of 
real estate in the region continues 
to rise. Many employees have, 
therefore, had their work spaces 
shrunk, which in turn, can lead to 
unexpected accidents in tight spaces. 
Enter the use of industrial robots 
as a solution to this challenge. 
With these considerations, and 
as industrial robots have risen 
to prominence, the International 
Organisation for Standardisation 
(ISO) established the ISO 10218 
‘Safety Requirements for Industrial 
Robots’ standard as a set of 
requirements and guidelines for 
the inherent safe design and 
protective measures for the use of 
industrial robots. 
However, with the introduction of 
co-bots, a new technical speciﬁcation, 
ISO/TS 15066, was announced early 
this year that guides manufacturers 
on the implementation of co-bots, 
and how they can operate safely 
with humans. For example, Universal 
Robots’ (UR) robots stop instantly 
when it comes in contact with an 
unexpected object. As the safety 
system of UR robots is approved and 
certiﬁed by TÜV (The German Technical 
Inspection Association), businesses 
are not required to make investments 
to install and maintain safety guarding 
and devices in most of the scenarios 
(subject to risk assessments). 
As manufacturing companies 
increasingly emphasise workplace 
safety, co-bots present a viable 
option in raising safety standards 
in production lines. In deploying 
safety compliant co-bots, workers 
are assured that they will not end 
up undertaking dangerous jobs, but 
instead focus on safer, varied and 
engaging tasks.

in, which is particularly important in
the manufacturing industry. They are
built to take on jobs that are unsafe for 
humans, such as lifting heavy loads, or
in hazardous conditions – and are able 
to perform these strenuous tasks with
consistency and precision.
In 
addition, 
co-bots 
can 
also be used in more repetitive, 
straightforward tasks, such as
packaging or gluing, leaving the 
human brain to take on more 
stimulating challenges. They can be
placed right next to human operators 
with no safety guarding, after the 
relevant risk assessments. For
example, robots can be programmed
to lift heavy components, while
human workers can be assigned to
oversee value-added tasks such as 
quality control or production planning. 
With the growing trend of
millennials looking for intellectual
challenges, businesses can now
place more emphasis on skills
upgrading. The advancement of
technology has led to the need for
specialists to operate machines.
Companies can now look to enhance
the skillset of the existing workers
so they are able to operate the
machines, which in turn lowers the
total cost of operation, while still
maintaining control over their own
manufacturing processes.
Ultimately, 
the 
aim 
of
automating production lines is for
robots to complement their human
counterparts – and to function as a
tool to complete tasks in a simpler
and safer way.
As the manufacturing sector in
Southeast Asia continues on the
rise, manufacturers should look
towards automation as a smooth
and tailored process to meet the
demands of the industry. Pairing
workers with advanced technology,
such as co-bots, can enhance
business operations and facilitate
smoother workflow in day-to-day
operations. All this leads to a better
work environment for humans,
while enabling businesses to gain
an edge in today’s competitive
world. A win-win scenario for the
industry as a whole.

rkane Studios returns to the Empire of 
the Isles with Dishonored 2 and with 
this sequel, they’ve grown any ideas that 
weren’t fully ﬂeshed out into one worthy 
of a sequel. 
The ﬁrst Dishonored was a throwback to the late 
90s FPS games that shunned the high-octane trend 
most FPS games followed (most well-remembered 
is of course the Thief series) and in doing so, created 
a world that was not only unique but memorable 
amongst all the other modern shooters that were so 
desperate for attention. 
The art direction and powerful narrative certainly 
helped too. The question is whether Dishonored 2 
stacks up to the original and from what I’ve seen, 
it’s a resounding yes.
Choosing Your Path
Set 15 years after the events of the ﬁrst game, 
Dishonored 2 now gives players a choice to play 
as the original protagonist, the Royal Protector 
Corvo or as his daughter, Empress Emily. While 
the story progresses incredibly fast once players 
make a choice, the subtle nuances between the 
two characters makes for two very interesting 
playthroughs and viewpoints. 
The world built by Arkane is certainly 
remarkable, I know a lot of developers like to throw 
the concept of how your actions shape the world 
but in Dishonored 2, your actions certainly affect 
how easy or difﬁcult the game becomes as you 
progress. 
You have the choice between lethal and non-
lethal methods within the game and along the way 
you’ll be offered some supernatural help in the form 
of the mysterious Outsider, an entity who rules a 
parallel universe outside of the physical world. 
Accepting his assistance grants you with a plethora 
of powers and abilities but if you want a more Thief-
like experience and a real challenge you can forgo 
the Outsider’s brand and forge your own path. 
Choose a path of violence and the world 
becomes a grim place as bodies attract vermin and 
illness to the isle and if you choose a non-lethal 
path, the empire might be in a better position to 
rebuild and grow again.
For Better or For Worst
Gameplay has been improved quite a bit since the 
ﬁrst game but the improvements made to the enemy 
AI means that direct confrontation seems to be a 
bad idea until your character has gained a certain 
amount of abilities to confront multiple enemies 
out in the open, after all this is a stealth oriented 
game. Nevertheless, the choice lies in the hands of 
the player, be it to spread death and chaos or just a 
shadow in the night. 
The abilities given to the players in terms of 
mobility allows you to navigate around certain 
conﬂicts and access the many buildings and shops 
within the world. I once thought Deus Ex Mankind 
Divided had a well ﬂeshed out world but Dishonored 
2 has taken that title by leaps and bounds as the city 
and environment is not only well planned out laterally 
but also vertically. 
The rewards given to players for exploration not 
only helps the players upgrade their abilities but also 
the amount of world-building and ﬂavour text hidden 
every weaves a very convincing story of a steampunk 
world full of wonders and nightmares.
Cause and effect are two words that comes to 
mind when playing Dishonored 2 and discovering 
and manipulating the world your own ends is a very 
enjoyable experience as it’s very easy to ﬁnd yourself 
immersed in the world. What might seem as a non-
lethal takedown may set a series of unfortunate 
events into play which could very well result in the 
deaths of some innocent guard down the alley. 
This, frustratingly so, affects your non-lethal 
playthrough but I don’t see this as a negative point 
but proof that the simulation of the world has 
worked. Enemies don’t just react based on light and 
movement but also sound and line of sight which 
makes sneaking around a fairly tense affair but pull 
of a string of nigh-impossible parkour moves and 
you’ll feel like a Victorian Ninja in no time. Of course, 
failure comes often and quickloading is almost an 
instinctive response when you mess up.
Verdict
Dishonored 2, with its beautifully designed world, 
incredibly subtle but impactful writing and proper 
character story arcs has certainly taken the game 
to another level and in a world where everything 
happens for a reason, immersion happens before 
you realise it. 
While there were some performance issues 
during launch, I’m happy to report that ﬁxes have 
been rolled out and shouldn’t be an issue by the time 
of writing. If you’ve been dying for a good stealth 
FPS and skipped Deus Ex Mankind Divided because 
it felt to angsty or claustrophobic, Dishonored 2’s 
large environments and properly ﬂeshed out world 
will make you feel right at home.

he Tales Of series of JRPGs may not share the same level of popularity as that of the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest series, but it is still a staple that 
is popular amongst JRPG aﬁcionados. Tales of Zestiria, which was ﬁrst released on the PS3 in Japan in 2015, also marked the 20th anniversary of the 
Tales Of series and made it one of the most anticipated titles by fans of the series.
As with all Tales Of games, Zestiria tells the story of a young boy and his group of friends as they save the world from certain devastation. The 
protagonist of this particular tale is Sorey, a young boy who was raised by a tribe called the Seraphim. Long story short, the Seraphim are akin to angels and 
no normal human, save for Sorey, can see them.
Sorey is joined by his long-time Seraph friend Mikleo as he travels outside of the comforts of his Seraphim village to the world below to discover the cause 
of the Malevolence that is currently seeping through the land. Along the way, Seraphs and human companions join him in his journey.

Even if you’re not a long-time fan of the series, 
players will quickly ﬁgure out that the story for 
Zestiria is fairly straightforward, as Sorey acts 
as the Shepherd, a sort of prophet if you may, to 
deliver the world from a calamitous event.
Therein lies the problem with Zestiria’s story. A 
lot of plot points that were introduced early in the 
game end up being either not properly resolved, 
or end up being tied up in a manner that is wholly 
unsatisfying, considering the number of hours 
being put into the game.
Unlike Tales of The Abyss, which arguably has 
one of the best plot and character development of 
many modern Tales Of games, Zestiria’s characters 
start out to be somewhat interesting, but have 
very little development throughout the game. This 
is especially the case with Sorey, who keeps his 
squeaky-clean façade till the end. 
The character skits, which is another staple for 
the Tales Of series, does a good job at unveiling 
some of the backstory and unexpected sides of 
the characters throughout the game. These skits 
make the characters endearing to the gamer, as 
otherwise they do feel bland.
Fight Shepherd, Fight!
Where Tales of Zestiria truly does shine, is in its 
battle system. While it still utilises the series’ old 
Linear Motion Battle System, Bandai-Namco has 
done well to add several changes, the ﬁrst and 
most noticeable being how the transition from 
free-roaming to battle mode looks and feels very 
seamless. 
What’s also great is that the battleﬁeld that 
you’re on will be exactly where you entered the 
battle. The one downside to this is that the camera 
angles can get a bit awkward at times, especially 
in dungeons where there are plenty of narrow 
corridors.
Speaking of the battle system, abilities in the 
Tales Of series of games are called Artes, and this 
hasn’t changed much, however, unlike the older 
games where you can pretty much just button 
mash your way through, you will need to think 
about elemental afﬁnities when ﬁghting monsters.
While the human characters (Sorey, Alisha, 
Rose) have a variety of elemental Artes at their 
disposal, the Seraphim characters all have their 
own elemental afﬁnities, and swapping them in 
and out of combat is the key to a successful battle, 
especially against bosses where striking with 
elements that they are weak against is especially 
important.
Armitisation is another new concept that is 
introduced in Tales of Zestiria, where the human 
characters can fuse together with their Seraphim 
counterparts to become a sort of super being, 
capable of not only unleashing devastating 
attacks, but heal your comrades and boosting their 
attack power too. 
On top of that, the equipment system has 
also seen a major overhaul, as the weapons you 
use can level up as well, and have skill slots as 
well, which provides you with Artes as well. Each 
equipment can be fused together, which in turn 
provides you with more powerful skills that can be 
used in battle.
The World’s A Bigger Place Now
For better or worse, Tales Of games’ overworld 
isn’t much different from its dungeons in a sense 
that they’re all linear paths that are dressed up 
differently. Tales of Zestiria is still technically the 
same, but the overworld has seen some major 
changes in a sense that the areas above ground 
now look more like wide open plains rather than a 
green or brown corridor.
Another new addition to the area maps are the 
Lords Of The Land, which are deities that allow 
you to do things like fast-travel and replenish 
treasure chests, amongst other boosts, which can 
be boosted by increasing your afﬁnity with them.
The dungeons however are much less 
elaborate than that. For the most part, they’re 
very uninspiring.  In some cases, these dungeons 
have puzzles that you have to navigate through, 
although in the case of the Water Temple, it is 
an exercise in patience as it has eyes on the wall 
that will teleport you back to the beginning of the 
dungeon if they see you.
Side-bosses also roam the lands, and defeating 
them nets you various items, ranging from Orbs that 
increase your entire party’s HP and powerful weapons 
that can help you tackle other optional content.
Verdict
Tales of Zestiria has several things we’d like to 
see improved in future titles, but we do have to 
give Bandai-Namco credit for making the series an 
interesting one again with the changes that they 
have made, especially in regards to the battle, 
skill, and equipment system. The good thing about 
the Tales Of series is that the story and gameplay 
are all self-contained within the title itself, so it’s 
a good game if you’re considering picking it up as 
your ﬁrst Tales Of game.

When you ﬁrst load up One Piece: Burning 
Blood, there is only one option available to you, 
which is Paramount War. This is the main campaign 
of the game, taking you through the Paramount 
War arc via several chapters, each dealing with 
different key members of the story arc. 
The main campaign starts having you as Luffy 
arrive at the Marine headquarters and try to save 
your brother from being killed. Then you must 
ﬁght off different enemies along the campaign. 
The story is simple and is deﬁnitely one of the fan 
favourites but the campaign in this game is quite 
short. It’s only about four to ﬁve hours long. 
The game tells its story through a combination 
of narrated story boards and full animated cut 
scenes. Burning Blood has you travelling across 
a board, defeating stages to move on and playing 
through the whole arc. Some stages have special 
conditions, if you accomplish them you will 
be given extra, branching stages that you can 
complete. These extra stages are usually harder 
than the main quest stages, while adding even 
more to the story.
Extra content
There are many other modes and features in the 
game. First, you have paramount war which is the 
main campaign. There is an ofﬂine and online PvP 
multiplayer mode where you can choose from 44 
character rosters too. 
It also has a collection feature where you can watch 
back the event movies and replay wanted versus mode 
which is a harder of battle against the enemies… kind 
of like pirate hunts, pirate base where you can build 
your own crew, and pirate ﬂag battle where this mode 
pits you against other players around the world. 
You select a pirate crew to join and play 
against other teams. When u win a ﬁght, you 
capture the ﬂag on a world map indicating that 
you’ve conquered that area. 
Unpromising combat system
The combat, on the other hand, is decidedly in the 
lose category. Most of the time, players spending 
most ﬁghts just trying to get close enough to 
land an attack. Sometimes players may even 
feel reluctant to hit their opponents with more 
powerful attacks, just to avoid having to chase 
after them once they’ve been sent ﬂying across 
the arena. Each of the more than 40 characters’ 
control roughly the same, so if you master one 
you’ve basically mastered them all.
Beautiful graphics and music
0The game looks great on Windows. It has great 
cel-shaded artist graphic much like the anime. 
Fights are always visually engaging with plenty of 
ﬂair to dazzle the senses, and the stages are bright, 
colourful and quite lively. The music is perfect too. 
It gives you the feeling of suspenseful and energetic 
while you’re battling. The game is also accompanied 
with a great Japanese voice cast. 
All in all, One Piece: Burning Blood is a very fun 
game for fans of the series, however its combat 
is a bit of shame. People who haven’t read and 
watched the anime or manga will also get very 
lost in the story, meaning the game’s only for the 
demographics of those who already know the 
franchise.

helicopters and titans. The game harkens back to 
the days when arcade-style top-down shooters 
were popular and players can play either a single

levels in total. Each consisting of a different region

and just like heroes they can be levelled up to earn 
points which can then be spent to have great unique 
special abilities, active skills and passive skills such 
as health regeneration. You can also unlock abilities 
for your hero to capture towers and control enemy 
to ﬁght alongside you as companions when there 
isn’t a vehicle nearby. 
Impressive gameplay
The gameplay is impressive. It is nostalgic, 
simple and a lot of fun. It doesn’t require a lot 
of thinking but there are times when strategy 
is required especially during boss fights at the 
end of level. The game is also neither too easy 
nor too hard but it can be challenging especially 
when you are chasing for perfect score. Every 
episode completion will grant rewards that 
are based on combat score which takes into 
consideration the amount of combo achieved, 
enemy defeated and how long you took to clear 
the level. 
Hybrid Wars truly feels like a believable 
world that’s more than likely to happen in the 
future thanks to the real-world setting and the 
design of the buildings and the terrain of the 
areas. It’s so satisfying to find out that 90% 
of the structures and objects are destructible. 
Graphically there’s nothing to shout about but 
for top-down shooter I was happy with what I 
saw on how everything looked on the highest 
graphic settings. The game soundtrack also just 
fits right in during gameplay.
The Cons
However, if you’re hoping to get a good story out 
of Hybrid Wars then you’re out of luck. The story 
within the single-player campaign is bare-bones 
and not cohesive at all. Before each level, you 
get a fully-voiced brief from your so-called client 
on why you’re heading out to town but again it 
all feels disjointed and you won’t really care by 
the time you’re halfway through. It’s just more 
fun to blow shit up without asking questions. 
Besides, it’s great that the game has co-
op mode to play with friends but the lack of a 
dedicated PvP mode is rather disappointing. 
Being branded under a wargaming.net game, I 
expected to see them cranked out a mode they 
are known for.
To sum it up, Hybrid Wars is set up to be a 
fun top-down shooter and it has achieved it. I 
can spend hours killing enemy units and blowing 
up bases. The gameplay all around is solid but 
done at a cost of a boring single-player story 
and of lacking of the PvP mode.
