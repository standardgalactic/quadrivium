EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE EDITOR
Sharil Abdul Rahman | PC.com Editor
H
ello everybody, and welcome to the May issue of 
PC.com. We have a lot to cover this month so let’s get 
the show on the road. 
We start with our cover story of our 17th year of 
publication. Yes, we are 17 years old and if we are human, we 
are just about to ready to sit for SPM. Good luck to us. We have 
seen many things as the years pass by, and we have seen that 
technology played a big role in our lives throughout the decade 
and a half we have been on print. 
A surprise for all of our readers – we have one of the first 
reviews of the Samsung Galaxy S8 on print! And as many say, 
yes, it is a pretty, pretty phone. It is so pretty that it got an 
Editor’s Choice for this month’s Tested lineup! We also have the 
HP Spectre X360, which also garnered a Editor’s choice sticker 
for the month, as well as a couple other items on the plate that 
you should read about in our tested pages. 
If you are looking for a compact yet very capable camera to 
bring along during your travels – check out our showdown for the 
month. We pitted three of the sought-after enthusiast cameras 
on the market right now and see how it compares against each 
other. Will the compact win? Or will it be the walkaround camera?
Not forgetting our gamers, we have the Horizon Zero Dawn 
in our Gametime review! Yes, the most beautiful game on the 
PS4 has been thoroughly tested, and we check our thoughts on 
this game. 
Lastly, we have in the house an interview with PC.com’s 
pioneering editor, Justin Then. Read on about what he thinks of 
the industry back then and now. 
Until next month, keep on reading!
Errata: In our April issue, we mislabelled that the Wiko uFeel 
Tab features up to 2GB of RAM. The correct amount of RAM 
for the Malaysian market is 3GB of RAM for the smart device. 
We apologize for the error made.

budding businesses grow and build

the working environment.
One of its latest technological 
innovations HP introduces is the 
EliteBook x360, the world’s thinnest 
business convertible laptop. Aside 
from being powerful with a sleek and 
stylish design, the EliteBook x360 also

If you’re stuck in the office, the 
HP Z2 Mini Workstation is the perfect 
companion for you. Standing at just 
2.3-inches high, it is 90% smaller 
compared to the conventional business 
desktop towers but still maintaining 
twice as powerful as the latter. The

allow the smartphone to integrate 
seamlessly with your workstation 
in the office or even at home. It also 
allows you to continue working 
through the device, even after you’ve 
left the office. Lastly, the HP Elite 
Slice was introduced to allow for 
an alternative when it comes to 
traditional PC desktop designs. Its 
small footprint ensures there will be 
no messy cables while still getting 
work done seamlessly and effortlessly.
“To motivate employees and 
attract new talent, businesses need 
to adapt to the latest ways employees 
prefer to work as well as provide 
them the autonomy to take control of 
their work experiences,” said Vinay 
Awasthi, vice-president of Commercial 
Computing, HP Asia-Pacific & Japan. 
“Technology is a key enabler in building 
a smart and safe work environment. HP

manageable, and secure for employees 
to engage more closely and fluidly but

ust when you thought the 
fenix 3HR from Garmin 
was a great virtual fitness 
companion to have on your 
runs or trailblaze, Garmin takes 
things up a notch with the release of 
the fenix 5, its new range of rugged 
and compact multisport GPS sports 
watches. The fenix 5 comes in three 
different variations – Fenix 5, Fenix 
5S and Fenix 5X.
These three models sports 
different size variations as well 
- the fenix 5 has a 47mm watch 
face size while the fenix 5S sports 
a 42mm and the fenix 5X is fitted 
with a 51mm face. All models will 
feature a stainless steel bezel and 
five different buttons surrounding 
the bezel. Each version also 
offers a variety of stainless steel 
finishes and QuickFit watch band 
combinations. You can choose 
between the normal Glass or the 
more sturdy Sapphire lens for the 
fenix 5 and 5S while the 5X only

three models.

The Fenix Rises Again
Garmin releases three new sports watches with multiple capabilities
One of the features that Garmin 
has improved on from the fenix 3HR 
is its Garmin Elevate wrist heart 
rate technology, which now gives 
users around-the-clock heart rate 
monitoring. In addition to counting 
steps and monitoring sleep patterns, 
the watch uses heart rate to provide 
calories burned information and will 
also quantify the intensity of a user's 
fitness activities. Another great feature 
introduced into the fenix 5 series would 
be its satellite navigation system. 
Instead of relying on your smartphone, 
you can now simply look at your watch 
for a thoroughly accurate reading of 
your surroundings thanks to its GPS 
and GLONASS (Global Navigation 
Satellite System).
Battery life on the fenix 5 has 
also been improved tremendously. 
On smartwatch mode, the fenix 5 
could last up to two weeks while the 
5S can last for 9 days and the 5X for 
12 days. On GPS mode, the fenix 5 
can hold its own for up to 24 hours

LED Technology equals to less moving parts, which 
results in a longer life for the printer.

10 Ways to Ruin a 
Cybercriminal’s Day
Learn how to keep yourself protected at all times
echnology has changed the way we live, 
our relationships with others, and even 
how we take care of ourselves. These days, 
everyone – from the most inexperienced 
to the most advanced user – takes measures to 
protect themselves from cybercriminals seeking to 
compromise or steal information.
In this article, we discuss how you can fend off 
cybercriminals’ malicious attacks, making it much 
more difficult for them to succeed. 
1. 
UPDATE YOUR SECURITY 
SOLUTION, APPLICATIONS, AND 
OPERATING SYSTEM
This is of vital importance, as software 
updates often include solutions to security 
defects that have been found. This way, if 
your system or application has any flaws, they 
will be resolved by the updates, meaning an 
attacker will not be able to exploit any kind of 
known vulnerability in your system.
2. 
INSTALL SECURITY SOLUTIONS ON 
YOUR DEVICES
Computers, smartphones, tablets and any 
other devices that allow security software to 
T
be installed should be protected. It is important 
not to use pirated software because, besides 
being illegal, it is unlikely to offer proper 
protection.
Tools like firewalls and antivirus software 
will defend you from various threats, including 
Trojans and other types of malware, as well 
through various detection technologies, which 
help prevent leaks or information theft.
3. 
MAKE BACKUPS
As well as making backup copies regularly, 
you should ensure that they are kept in a 
safe place: putting them on an external drive 
should be sufficient. Be sure not to leave 
them constantly connected, because if your 
computer becomes infected with any kind of 
ransomware, your backup files could become 
encrypted too, even if they are stored in the 
cloud.
If your computer becomes infected and you 
have kept your backup in a safe place, you will 
easily be able to restore your information after 
you disinfect your system.
4. 
REPORT PHISHING EMAILS AND 
WEBSITES
One of the most frequently used methods for 
carrying out fraud is the old trick of setting 
up fake websites. Receiving an email from 
a sender that looks familiar, with a link that 
directs you to a fake portal, is a technique 
often employed by cybercriminals.
To prevent this from happening, it is very 
important to report phishing websites from 
whichever browser you are using, and also 
report them to your antivirus provider if it does 
not already recognize the site as a malicious 
portal.
“One of the most frequently used methods for 
carrying out fraud is the old trick of setting up 
fake websites.”

If the phishing website is a financial one, 
you could get in touch with the organization 
affected so they can start the process of 
getting rid of it. This way, you will be helping 
to protect the community by warning people 
about the dangers of visiting fake sites. 
5. 
CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS
There are many ways in which your password 
can be compromised. Make sure you have a 
strong password, change it regularly, and 
don’t use the same one for multiple accounts.
These three pillars will help keep the key 
to your digital identity secure.
6. 
ACTIVATE TWO-FACTOR 
AUTHENTICATION
Even if you follow each of these recommended 
practices to protect your passwords, they 
could still become compromised. However, 
two-factor authentication, which is available 
on most social networks and online services, 
will significantly increase your levels of 
security.
If a cybercriminal manages to steal your 
password, they will not be able to do any 
significant damage, as they will still need to 
input a code generated by this additional layer 
of security.
7. 
CHECK THE PRIVACY OF YOUR 
SOCIAL NETWORKS
All too often we’ve seen users sharing an 
excessive amount of sensitive information on 
social networks. 
“Platforms like Facebook allow you to set 
up groups where you can share information 
and limit who views it.”
This problem is exacerbated if their posts 
are public. Platforms like Facebook allow 
you to set up groups where you can share 
information and limit who views it.
It is also important not to grant access 
to users you don’t know and to review the 
permissions that you have in place around 
your personal information.
8. 
CHECK THE STATUS OF YOUR BANK 
ACCOUNTS
You can never check your balance too often, 
as by doing so you may detect an irregularity 
or unknown transaction. If your card has been 
cloned or you have fallen victim to banking 
malware, regularly checking your account 
is the best way for you to keep tabs on any 
attacks that may have happened – and 
minimize the damage.
9. 
MAKE SURE YOU AREN’T 
SUBSCRIBED TO ANY PREMIUM 
SMS SERVICES
The number of hoaxes circulating on 
WhatsApp continues to increase, with one 
single campaign having the ability to yield 
more than 10 million victims. This often 
ends up with users being caught off guard 
and subscribing to numbers that send SMS 
messages which charge the recipient a fee to 
receive them.
To prevent this, many countries allow 
you to check whether you are subscribed to 
any such services on your phone provider’s 
website.
10. BE AWARE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT
Understanding how hoaxes work is the best way 
to avoid falling victim to one. At the same time, 
sharing your knowledge will make you a friend of 
IT security; and by protecting the devices of other 
people who use the same network as you, you 
will also be taking care of your own property and 
the information stored on your computer.
Undoubtedly, if you follow these tips, you will 
be able to increase the security of your devices 
and create obstacles for cybercriminals, which 
in most cases will prevent attacks, as increasing 
the complexity of these operations will most 
likely put them off attempting them. 
ABOUT ESET TECHNOLOGY:
REPUTATION & CACHE
When inspecting a file or URL, before any 
scanning takes place, our products check 
the local cache for known malicious or 
whitelisted benign objects. This improves 
scanning performance. Afterwards, our 
ESET LiveGrid® Reputation System is 
queried for the object’s reputation (i.e. 
whether the object has already been seen 
elsewhere and classified as malicious). This 
improves scanning efficiency and enables 
faster sharing of malware intelligence with 
our customers.

SMARTPHONE SENSORS ‘CAN 
REVEAL PINS AND PASSWORDS’
A smartphone’s internal sensors may 
provide 
cybercriminals 
with 
enough 
information to be able to guess a user PINs 
and passwords, according to new research 
by Newcastle University in the UK.
Experts found that PINs and passwords 
could be deciphered relatively easily this 
way. Tests carried out by the university, 
for example, found that cybercriminals 
could work out a four-digit PIN with 70% 
accuracy on the first guess.
CLOSE TO 1.4 BILLION DATA 
RECORDS COMPROMISED IN 2016
Over 
a 
billion 
data 
records 
were 
compromised globally in 2016, according to 
Gemalto’s latest Breach Level Index.
The report revealed that close to 1.4 billion 
records were involved in some sort of data 
breach, representing an incredible 86% 
increase compared to 2015. Identity theft 
was the most common type of security 
incident last year, representing 59% of all 
data breaches. 
As for the main cause of data breaches, 
“malicious actors” were found to be the 
most responsible for compromises (68%). 
This was followed by accidental losses 
(19%), malicious insiders (9%), hacktivists 
(3%) and state-sponsored attackers (1%).
GOOGLE: MORE WEBSITES 
FALLING VICTIM TO 
CYBERCRIMINALS
The number of websites compromised by 
cybercriminals during 2016 was 32% higher 
than the previous year, according to Google.
The tech giant added that this spiral of 
cyberattacks is unlikely to lose momentum 
anytime soon, as more websites become 
“outdated” and cyberattackers “more 
aggressive”.

COVER 
STORY
PC.com looks back over 17 years of technology progression 
globally, and in Malaysia.
A Journey Thus Far
eventeen years; that is how long PC.com has been in the Malaysian market. And oh boy, we have seen so many things in 
the tech world and how it has changed over the years. From the start of the modern IT age, to the current hyper-connected 
world we live it, PC.com saw many ups, downs and all arounds in tech, and we are happy that we can share this milestone 
with you, the readers. 
Throughout the seventeen years of our publication, the tech world at large, and in Malaysia, has evolved tremendously. As we reach 
over a decade and a half into the millennium, technology’s fast pace has surprised everybody – from the giants of the industry, to the 
market at large, and even the mom and pop shops that sells these items on their store shelves.

Phones: 
Then and Now
In our inaugural issue, 
we 
talked 
about 
the latest craze of 
technology of 2000 – mobile phones. 
Back then, the idea of someone surfing 
the internet is on a beige desktop 
computer, with stalwarts like Yahoo 
and Ask Jeeves ruling the roost in 
the emerging World Wide Web. The 
phones were not exactly smart, but they 
were slim and portable – a far cry from 
the original smartphone that came out 
from the labs of Motorola and Bell Labs 
in the United States. 
Last issue, we were talking about 
affordable smartphones that popped out 
during the recently concluded Mobile 
World Congress. These phones carry 
more features, memory and capabilities 
over the ones that we covered in 2001, 
and thanks to miniaturisation and 
economics of scale - are vastly cheaper 
to own even when considering inflation 
from back then ‘til today.

millennium and now is the holistic focus on the IT 
market. When we first started, the talk of the town 
was centring around mainframes and servers – be 
it for small businesses or even large enterprises. 
Companies were toying with the idea of moving 
their critical services in-house, while maintaining 
relationship with server providers on non-critical 
applications to be hosted on their machine off-site. 
These days we are talking more about the cloud, 
and how companies are moving just about everything 
to the ubiquitous platform that is accessible by 
anyone, anywhere and anytime. Companies like 
Microsoft, Amazon and Google are the dominating 
names in offering cloud services to all sectors, and 
thanks to their platforms, computing on the cheap is 
now available to just about everyone. 
With per-use payment and a robust platform to sit 
on, companies (and even small home-based ones to 
boot) can leverage on the power of cloud computing to 
achieve what people seventeen years ago did not have 
access to, and have no concept whatsoever. 
Hyper-Connectivity as A Lifestyle
This is the reflection of the industry, as more people 
are looking to have their computing needs to be sight 
unseen, yet is powerful enough that it is available on 
demand when they want it. The same can also be said 
about how we interact with each other online, as we 
live in a hyper-connected world of social media and 
instant communication platforms. 
Take for example Facebook. It started in 2003 – 
a couple of years after we set our roots in the tech 
industry – and since then it has been the number one 
social networking service the world over. At last count, 
nearly two billion people are on Facebook, interacting 
with each other every day. Lets put that in perspective 
– two in every seven people you will meet up today 
are on Facebook, and that number is growing by the 
year. Malaysia is already one of the highest (if not at 
the top of the list) numbers of active Facebook users – 
at last count in 2016, we are clocking in at 18 million 
active users. That is just over half of our population.
These numbers were unimaginable when we 
started PC.com, where the net exists for text-
based websites, and friends are contacted through 
applications such as MSN Messenger and Yahoo 
Messenger. Anyone here still using these two?
Going Everywhere with Mobile
Mobile is a segment that really took on a life on its 
own through the years. The big three telcos – Maxis, 
Celcom and Digi – are still big names in the mobile 
marketspace. However, since 2001, we have seen 
many more companies enter the race in connecting 
people. Companies like U Mobile and Tunetalk are 
now part and parcel of the telco industry in Malaysia. 
Scarcely five years ago we all think only three 
names will be the leaders in the market – now thanks 
to more companies, as well as Mobile Virtual Network 
Operators (MVNO), we have over 10 companies vying 
for customers here in Malaysia. 
Not only the telcos are becoming big – the phones 
are also increasing in size as well. Gone were the days 
of small, two-line LCD mobile phones that only display 
the phone numbers of incoming calls, to large-screen 
behemoths that we have on sale today. A five inch, full 
colour and full HD display is now standard fare for the 
market, where a monochrome, two-line LCD display

was the highest option available for customers who 
are looking to be connected to the GSM network. 
Sadly during the rush of the technology race, 
many companies have been set to the wayside, due 
to various factors. The companies include names like 
Nokia, NEC, and also local names like Ninetology are 
all but extinct in the hone market. However, Nokia just 
recently announced a comeback to the market with 
their new line of smartphones – we have to see how 
this round goes for them. 
Malaysian Made No More?
Talking about Malaysian companies, during the start of 
the digital age, we saw many companies tried to make 
their mark on the market with their wares. Companies 
like Intellitech and Mimos created and marketed their 
own line of PC for the consumer, but throughout the 
years, bigger names prevailed and smaller names did 
not survive the intense competition that they face in 
the market. 
These days, only multinational names are being 
mentioned on the lips of consumers – such as HP, 
Acer, ASUS and Dell to name a few. Globalisation 
meant that thinking ‘glocal’ is more important than 
ever before, as each company can cater to their local 
customers by thinking locally, backed by a global team. 
Names such as HP and Dell are stalwarts of the 
industry, but even they have seen changes throughout 
the last seventeen years, with market shifts and 
focus changes by both consumers and customers. 
Going back to the previous point of going to the cloud, 
companies are now producing more products that are 
tied to the cloud rather than anchoring themselves to 
the ground. 
Google’s own Chromebook experiment meant 
that computers are just input devices rather than 
computing devices – Chromebook lives purely on the 
cloud and they are dependent on having good internet 
connection to function to their fullest potential. 
Internet Connects Us All
A good segue to the next point, internet connectivity 
has grown so much in the past seventeen years. We 
started the journey with the high-pitched sounds of 
a dialling 56.6K modem, we have progressed to the 
point of having multi-megabit connectivity through 
fast 4G LTE over the air. Companies like TM has made 
changes to their business structure, going from a 
purely connectivity-focus company to a full suite of 
service offerings, ranging from high speed broadband 
to over-the-cable entertainment content through their 
platform HyppTV. 
Unfortunately the first Internet Service Provider 
(ISP) in Malaysia, JARING, had to liquidise themselves 
a couple of years ago due to changing market 
condition. This is a loss for the Malaysian tech scene 
as JARING was the first company that wired Malaysia 
to the world-wide web, and laid the foundation for all 
other ISPs to set up shop here. 
Technology’s march has been an incredulous 
journey that we all have seen through the years, 
and we are blessed that we are living in what many 
consider the golden age of technology. We have seen 
so much, and we are set to see many more in the 
coming years, as we head towards Vision 2020, The 
National Transformation 2050 (TN50) and beyond. We 
also thank you readers for staying with us all these 
years, and we hope to see you again next year.

S Done Right
Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+
Beautiful in every way
If you are waiting to see what 2017 
will bring to the flagship segment of 
smartphones, wait no further. The 
Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+ is the 
pinnacle that is the S-series from 
Samsung. The sculpted body, the 
curved edges, the glass body – all of 
which combined in a single package 
that will definitely entice people to 
Samsung for their smartphone needs
10nm power
Inside the phone(s) is the new 
Exynos 8895 (the US version gets 
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835) that 
is definitely powerful enough to 
run just about any benchmark or 
apps you can throw at it. The chip 
is built with the new 10 nanometer 
(nm) manufacturing process that 
makes it more power efficient when 
compared to the previous generation 
SoC- up to 20% in some cases. 
To infinity and beyond
The new selling point of the 
Samsung Galaxy S8 (and S8+) is the 
display. Samsung dubs it ‘Infinity 
Display’, which is sort of correct. The 
screen curves to both sides, and is 
tall almost to the top and bottom of 
the device – making it almost a full 
screen smartphone. With the 18.5:9 
screen ratio, you get a larger display 
area, in a body that is similar to last 
year’s device. The S8 features a 5.7-
inch display while the S8+ has a 6.2-
inch display – in a body no bigger 
than the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.
New Position
The fingerprint sensor 
is located in a weird-
location, but it works

SPECS
VERDICT: “ Hello there gorgeous! ” - Sharil
Same yet 
different camera
We have reports saying that 
the camera module in the S8 
and S8+ are upgrades to last 
year’s units. In tests we agree 
on that. The 12 megapixel 
sensor features an f/1.7 lens, 
similar to last year, but the 
colour reproduction on the 
images are better when 
compared to the ones on 
the Galaxy S7. You also get a 
higher megapixel front unit, at 
8 megapixels. One comment – 
the camera app does not take 
advantage of the new screen 
ratio. Pity
Bixby is…ok?
Another new feature that 
Samsung touted at launch is 
Bixby, their new on-phone voice 
assistant. It even comes with its 
own button on the side of the 
phone, that can be annoying as 
it can be accidentally pressed 
when you meant to press the 
power button. The features on 
paper is cool, but we have to 
wait and see if we get the full 
treatment here in Malaysia for 
Bixby.

HP Spectre x360
Easy on the Eyes
Although not as sleek nor as sexy as 
the HP Spectre 13, the Spectre x360 
is still in its own class of style, class 
and sex appeal. The gold accents 
around the edges of the laptop give 
it a very subtle yet appealing look, 
turning heads wherever you go. The 
black aluminium finish is clean and 
crisp as the Spectre x260 means 
business and wants to be taken 
seriously.
Running the Latest 
Hardware
What makes the Spectre x360 
great is the hardware put into it. 
Running on the 7th Gen. Intel-Core 
i7 processor, the Spectre x360 was 
great for daily usage, whether it was 
for work or play. Although I don’t 
recommend playing games on it, it’s 
exceptionally great for movies and 
music. The 8GB of RAM also makes it 
run a lot smoother while the 256GB 
of PCIe M.2 SSD makes starting up 
the laptop as well as its programs a 
lot faster.
Flexibility is Key
Much like the Lenovo Yoga tablet, 
the Spectre x360 comes with 
360-degree hinges – hence, the 
name – which allows you to flip the 
monitor on its back to use it in Tablet 
mode. You can also flip it backwards 
into Tent mode or just keep it at its 
generic Laptop mode for work but 
my favourite would be Media mode. 
Flip the display 180-degrees to the 
back and you can still continue doing 
work but without overworking the 
cooling fan at the bottom.
All Glass 
Everything
The trackpad is extra 
wide and is also made 
of glass, making it that 
easier and swifter to use.
Speed is 
Everything
The Spectre x360 
comes with two USB 
Type-C ports, which 
allows for faster 
charging and even 
transfer speeds with 
read and write speeds 
off the charts.
Light as a Feather
Weighing at only 1.2kg, the 
Spectre x360 will feel great 
in your hands or even in your 
bagpack as you will barely 
notice it’s there.

VERDICT: “ Priced at RM5,999, the HP Spectre x360 is a pricey laptop with multiple features and purposes, making it a 
worthwhile purchase, especially if you’re constantly working on-the-go” - Wi-Liam
Bit of an Annoyance
I’m not a fan of keeping it in 
Laptop mode as the fan does 
tend to heat up after a short 
while, making it that much 
harder to work on-the-go, 
especially if there isn’t a flat 
surface nearby and you have to 
rely on your thighs. This makes 
it a lot more uncomfortable 
as not only is there heat 
dissipating, but the fan gets 
louder the longer you keep it in 
Laptop mode.
Perfect for Movie Night
Standing at 13.3-inches tall, 
the FHD display screen of the 
Spectre x360 makes everything 
look better; from colours to 
moving pictures and even 
normal social media browsing. 
The colours are vibrant and crisp 
while making it easy on your 
eyes, reducing eye strain if you’re 
using for long hours. 
Banging like a 
Drum
To make movies and 
music sound even better, 
the speakers on the 
Spectre x360 are tuned 
by none other than the 
people over at Bang & 
Olufsen to give a rich 
and detailed sound.
Use it Anyway 
You Want
You can also use the Spectre 
x360 with a stylus pen, 
making it that much easier to 
present your work when set 
up in Tent or Tablet mode.

Sony α6500
Yet another 
mirrorless camera
The market is getting bigger, and Sony 
is set to be one of the big-name players 
in that market. The new Sony a6500 is 
a great example of what Sony thinks

own and operate as your daily shooter.
4K Recording at any

Thanks to the combination of the 
APS-C sensor, BION X image processor 
as well as the range of Sony’s G and 
Zeiss lenses, the camera can capture 
great photos as well as 4K recording at 
any focal length the users desire. This 
flexibility gives the a6500 unparalleled 
power in both photography and 
videography. video camera on the go.
More than meets the eye
The a6500 is not an upgrade to the 
a6300 – rather it is the next tier-up 
model for the family. That is why it is 
fitted with the best technology from 
the larger brother. This includes the 
5-axis stabilizer system, S-Log and flat 
profile recording for video recording

Making your Life a 
little bit Better
Powered with Android 
Nougat, the XA1 is capable of 
learning and understanding 
your daily usage patterns 
and will craft out a detailed 
plan for you and your daily 
activities, making your day 
that much better.
Sony Xperia XA1
Striking the Right Balance
The Xperia XA1 was introduced 
during MWC 2017 and it does live 
up to its name as a great mid-range 
device. At first glance, it does share 
the same design concept as many 
other previous Sony Xperia devices. 
However, it’s metallic unibody 
design gives it a great look while 
still looking good in your hand. Its 
5-inch display screen is also bezel-
less so you can get more out of the 
device when it comes to gaming or 
even video streaming at 720p.
Better in the Long 
Run
The XA1 also comes with 
Qnovo Adaptive Charging 
technology, which can 
monitor the condition of 
your battery while charging 
and will adjust your battery 
charging patterns so it will 
not die so quickly on you, 
giving you more time with it.

Better than its Predecessor 
When I had the Xperia XA, I was 
critical about it. However, I have now 
eaten humble pie as the XA1 is a 
great resurrection of the XA series. 
Sporting similar specs and design, the 
stark contrast between the two is the 
Mediatek Helio P20 processor, which 
trumps the former quite admirably. 
With 3GB of RAM to boot, daily 
usage of the Xperia XA1 gave me a 
much smoother and quicker overall 
performance as compared to the 
Xperia XA.
Everything Looks Better in 
Slow-Mo
For the XA1, it seems that Sony 
has finally come to its senses 
and brought out an impressive 
range of features for the camera 
with an affordable price to boot. 
Its 23-megapixel with Exmor RS 
sensor brought out some pretty 
impressive shots, whether it’s 
during the day or not. It also 
comes with object tracking and 
a smile shutter paired with a 
quick autofocus so you will never 
miss capturing your target. The 
8-megapixel front-facing comes 
with a 23mm wide-angle lens so 
taking selfies and wefies just got a 
lot better.

it may remind you of a certain fruit

Huawei has reached peak quality

– a far cry from products they have 
produced just a few years ago.
Powerhouse, with minor 
caveats
The Kirin 960 processor 
from HiSilicon. Huawei’s SoC 
manufacturing arm, is one of the big 
SoC one can get in the market right 
now. It is at par with its peers, and it 
can run just about any app that you

to optimised codecs. options, and

options too!
Dual cameras done right
We have seen many phones both 
high end and lower tier that makes 
and present dual camera sensors 
as part of their unique selling point 
(USP) list, but the one in the P10 is 
one of the few that has done justice 
to the concept. The dual sensor 
combines images taken with the 
12 megapixel RGB sensor and 20 
megapixel monochrome sensor into 
one, to create images with depth like 
never before. Plus, the 20 megapixel 
monochrome sensor is a beast by 
itself, creating great black & white 
images with a snap. Also, there is no 
camera bump!

Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro
Speed is of the Essence
It’s almost unheard of for a mid-range 
flagship to carry 6GB of RAM, and 
that is exactly what Samsung did 
with the Galaxy C9 Pro. Paired with 
a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 653 
processor, the Galaxy C9 Pro will 
be able to keep up with your heavy 
daily usage without breaking a sweat. 
Although it tends to slightly overheat 
after long periods of heavy usage, it 
wasn’t enough to dissuade me to get 
off Instagram and Tinder (I’m lonely, 
let me be).
No Filters Needed
With the camera prowess of the 
Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, Samsung 
takes it one step further with the C9 
Pro as both rear and front cameras 
are equipped with 16-megapixels 
and f/1.9 aperture lens. Not only is 
the autofocus quick in detecting 
your intended target, pictures are 
also sharp and clear. Shooting during 
the day brought the best out of the 
camera and night shots were also 
well above average with very minimal 
graining and noise, provided there is 
some ambient lighting provided. 
Insanely 
Juiced Up
The Galaxy 
C9 Pro comes 
with 4,000mAh 
battery capacity, 
and if it ever runs 
out, there’s fast-
charging thanks 
to the USB 
Type-C port.
It’s Always On
Much like the Galaxy S7 and 
S7 Edge, the C9 Pro also 
comes with the Always On 
display feature so you won’t 
have to unlock your phone 
just to check the time or your 
calendar.
More than 
One Way to 
Use It 
Not only is the 
SIM tray dual-
SIM enabled, 
you can also 
choose to fit 
in an external 
microSD card 
in place for the 
second SIM 
card.together. 
Samsung is on Cloud Nine
With the eventual release of the 
much-anticipated Samsung Galaxy 
S8 and S8 Plus, it’s easy to overlook 
the Galaxy C9 Pro. However, that 
doesn’t mean it’s a bad device by 
any means; it’s sleek and smooth 
metal unibody isn’t slippery on the 
fingers while still being a device 
worth looking at for hours. With its 
6-inch FHD Super AMOLED display, 
it made watching YouTube and 
Netflix through the device a lot more 
enjoyable than most other devices.

Aspiring For Greatness
Acer Aspire VX 15
Budget-Friendly Gaming 
Buddy
Leaning away from its Predator lineup, 
which mostly focuses on mid-range 
to high-end gaming systems, Acer 
introduces the Aspire VX 15, a budget-
conscious gaming laptop that is 
capable to meet the everyday gamer’s 
expectations. After making its debut 
during CES 2017, the Aspire VX 15 
finally makes it way to our shores at 
RM4,399, a much more reasonable 
price as compared to what the Acer 
Predator series has to offer in terms of 
gaming laptops.
Speeding Up The Move
The Aspire VX 15 comes with 4GB 
of DDR4 SDRAM with the option to 
upgrade up to 32GB. To make up for 
its affordable price, you will want to 
upgrade the RAM as 4GB is way too 
little, even for a basic laptop standards. 
Having Google Chrome with three 
tabs open and Spotify playing in the 
background, it took me a good five 
minutes to just navigate my way to the 
home screen. 
Saving Grace
Thankfully, the Aspire VX 15 comes 
with NVIDIA’s latest Pascal architecture, 
the GeForce GTX 10 Series GPU. It 
also comes with Intel’s 7th Gen. i7 
processor, making it an extremely 
worthwhile purchase, that is if you’re 
also planning to upgrade the RAM. 
The Aspire VX 15 also has admirable 
benchmark scores; although not great, 
it is marketed towards the everyday 
casual gamer who considers gaming a 
hobby and a pastime.
Easier 
Viewing 
Enjoyment
The 15.6-inch 
FHD (Full HD) IPS 
display screen 
allows you to game 
better while also 
enjoying your 
movies a lot more 
than usual.
Powered by Dolby
The Aspire VX 15 comes with Dolby Audio Premium, 
greatly enhancing the laptop’s overall audio quality 
with home-theatre quality sound.

Almost Carbon Copy Design
One note I would like to point out about the Aspire VX 
15 is its eerie similarity with the ASUS ROG laptops. 
Granted, both companies are from Taiwan and share 
similar colour schemes with each other. However, 
it was the exhaust ports of the Aspire VX 15 that 
gave it away. ASUS ROG laptops are known for

With its modest price tag and top-notch components, the Aspire VX 15 is a no-brainer, 
especially if you’re looking for a gaming laptop that can run most games while still being able 
to watch your movies, enjoy your music and even get work done. However, you must upgrade

Powerful Giant
Oppo R9s Plus
Clear and Crisp
The 16MP camera comes at a f/1.7 
and indeed as their tagline goes 
– it’s clear. The colours come out 
beautifully and pictures are crisp. The 
front camera is also a 16MP, making 
it just as powerful and delivers to all 
your photography needs. With such 
a massive screen, it’s easy to watch 
videos without straining your eyes. 
One annoying thing though – the 
screen is reactive through clothing, so 
it would turn on even in your pocket. 
Just don’t get yourself locked out. 
Stellar Performance
Running applications on this phone is 
a dream. With 6GB of RAM and 64GB 
of ROM, I didn’t think twice about 
downloading all sorts of different 
games and functionalities. Running 
several apps at once, and switching 
in between was smooth, although on 
a rare occasion it might have a slight 
delay – it was negligible. Games that 
are heavy on graphics loads perfectly 
and it’s just a joy to play on such a 
huge screen. 
iPhone 
wannabe
While the phone 
OS runs Android, 
the interface 
resembles more to 
iOS. While it might 
appeal to many iPhone 
fans – it took me (an 
Android Girl) some 
time to get used to the 
settings.  
HUGE screen
It’s a big phone, 
and with a lot of big 
phones, I have a little 
problem. While playing 
games horizontally, you 
might keep accidentally 
touching the recent apps 
button. Sigh. 
Fingerprint
The fingerprint sensor is 
at the front and you’d be 
forgiven to think that it’s a 
clickable button – Psych! 
It’s not. 
Power, so much power
Boasting a 4000mh battery, I 
could play games for hours without 
worrying about draining the battery, 
or needing a charger. I swear I barely 
touched the charger over a weekend 
of use, even after a full day of heavy 
usage – play games, watch videos, 
browsing social media, calls, text, 
recording video, and there were still 
some left over.

Nice feel
The keyboard is easy to type 
with, trackpad is very reactive – 
sometimes a bit too reactive. For 
a person not used to the Mac style 
trackpad, it can get frustrating after 
accidentally tapping instead of right 
clicking. The on/off button actually 
resembles a key, where normally 
you’d expect the “del” button. 
Slightly odd, but if you accidentally 
press the wrong button nothing 
drastic will happen. (ie. It won’t just 
suddenly turn off)
Solid workhorse 
Daily usage of editing word docu-
ments, opening several browser tabs 
for web browsing, playing videos, 
simple editing for pictures – all works 
pretty well. Say you’re opening 30

Passport with Flying Colours
WD My Passport (2016) 4TB
A Splash of Colour
Upon receiving the newly re-
designed WD My Passport 4TB, I 
was very surprised at how it stood 
out among my collection of portable 
hard disks. It wasn’t just the bright 
colours that threw me off, the boxy 
design with a textured pattern that 
made it look like an oversized Lego 
brick instead. I am all for the adding 
a splash of colour in my otherwise 
boring selection of hard disks, but 
I foresee that not everyone can 
appreciate this new look. 
For the Paranoid 
When comparing to its sister 
product, the My Passport Ultra, 
this particular My Passport 4TB 
model comes with the uber useful 
auto backup, which comes bundles 
together with the quintessential WD 
Backup Software. You can customise 
just how often you want the drive to 
back up your PC – a good alternative 
for those who don’t trust the cloud. 
It also comes with a 256-bit AES 
encryption, so you can be assured 
that whatever is inside is safe from 
prying eyes. 
A Good All-Rounder
I’m happy to note that the new look 
for the My Passport hasn’t affected 
the performance of the model at 
all. If you are an ardent user of WD 
portable storage, you don’t have to 
worry about its aesthetics dulling its 
efficiency and performance. Beauty 
and brains all in one, this one. Of 
course, if you are not keen on the 
bright colour selection, the My 
Passport Ultra does a little better 
job with the transfer speed (but it’s 
slightly more expensive).

Definitely No Middle Child Syndrome
AMD Ryzen 5 1600X
Mid-tier rank, higher tier 
performer
Get out your wallet – the AMD Ryzen 
5 is here, and oh boy it is a scorcher. 
After the recently launched Ryzen 
7 series CPUs, AMD is on a roll and 
has just announced their mid-tier 
processor family, the Ryzen 5. This 
is something to be rejoiced by all 
gamers because finally, we have a 
proper contender to the enthusiast 
CPU market. No longer we are going 
to see a dominance of the Blue team 
– AMD is back and they are ready to 
rock and roll.
Middle Isn’t Always A Bad 
Thing
On paper, the Ryzen 5 1600X is a 
formidable processor. It features 
16MB of L3 Cache, with 512K L2 
cache per for for speedy memory 
access. Speaking about cores, the 
1600X is a hexa-core processor, 
meaning that it has 6 cores available 
to the end user. This collection of 
cores starts with a 3.6GHz base 
clock, with a potential XFR boost 
of up to 4.1Ghz. That is a lot of 
headroom for overclockers to play 
around with, and then some.
Wallet Friendly
The biggest reason to have an AMD 
powering your CPU is always the 
pricing – and with the Ryzen series, 
we are heading for the direction of 
great value for money. The 1600X 
we have here for example, will be 
retailing in Malaysia for RM 1199. 
This, when compared to a retail 
price of the Intel Core i5 7600K 
for instance (all Ryzen chips are 
unlocked btw), is within spitting 
distance. However, the 7600K is a 
four core, four thread CPU while the 
1600K is a six core, twelve thread 
CPU. Value for money number one.
PRICE: RM 1,199
PROCESSOR: AMD Ryzen 1800X
SPEED: 3.6Ghz
SOCKET: AM4
TDP: 95W
CACHE: 20MB L2+L3
GRAPHICS: None
8.6
SPECS
Going Beyond Mid-Tier
At 95 Watt TDP, the 1600X is in the top tier of the Zen architecture processor power 
envelope. Basically what this means is that you get the same performance for less power 
usage – which is great for anyone who are looking for a more power-optimised CPU 
build. It actually shares the same TDP as the Ryzen 7 1800X so that is saying something.

Power, power and more power!
Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080ti
Nvidia’s fastest card ever
If you say to me five years ago 
that we will be getting a graphics 
card that is this powerful, I would 
have called you nuts, and walked 
away. Yet, we are here with the new 
NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080ti. This is 
the company’s latest card available 
to the consumer right now, and it is 
a beast. It is about 40% better than 
the last Ti card that graced our labs, 
the GTX 980ti.
Is this the Titan killer?
On paper, the GTX 1080ti is similar to 
the preciously launched Titan X gpu 
from NVIDIA – and the Titan series 
represents the best performance 
that one can buy. Sure it may has 
less ROPs and VRAM on board, but it 
has a faster core, can generate more 
processing power and it is at half the 
price. A killer combo yes?
NO DVI 
NVIDIA has elected to not 
include a DVI connector on the 
card - weird
Bring The VR
The GTX 1080ti is VR ready, 
with three DisplayPort for 
maximum compatibility
Win every game you have
Run the 1080ti on your game 
machine, and you will be the king 
of the hill. That is what we saw in 
our own testing benchmarks. We 
routinely managed to get in the 
high 100s in just about every game 
that we got out hands on, and this 
includes DOOM, Rise of the Tomb 
Raider and even Overwatch. The 
games were running at a resolution 
of 2560 x 1440 at Ultra settings 
(when available) – not 4K, but more 
than enough to satisfy our gaming 
needs.

JOI-ning The Big Leagues
Joi 11 2 in 1 tablet With Dual OS
Tablet of Notebook?
The new tablet comes embedded 
with dual OS Android and Windows, 
for those who are looking for a single 
machine to manage both their work 
and social life on. Using the device, 
we found new ways of getting things 
done if not for the dual OS. JOI 11 is 
a tablet first, attach it to the optional 
keyboards available and you have 
laptop on your desk. During a recent 
presentation, we took the device 
to a client’s place and got it to run 
a full PowerPoint slideshow while 
editing whenever necessary, we can 
safely say everything went smoothly. 
We trust the people at Intel and 
Microsoft had a prominent role to 
play in getting the tablet certified.
Dual boot goodness
There is a reason why the JOI 11 
is operating on an older android 
version and it perfectly makes sense 
on a device that’s purely for users 
who want just the basics and ensure 
performance is not compromised. 
If you require all your components 
to be spec’d high, latest OS, 
higher storage, most number of 
ports, slimmest and lightest in the 
market then look elsewhere and be 
prepared to cough-up RM5k, but 
if you are just looking for a system 
that works well, versatile and does 
not cost an arm and a leg, this 
should be on your target list.

Handy Hotspot 
If you’re the type of traveller who 
wants to stay connected when on 
holiday to share their memories on 
social media, the Dlink DWR-932 4G 
Mobile Router is a nifty gadget for 
you to have on your travels. With a 
simple data-enabled SIM card, you’ll 
be able to stay connected wherever 
you are with up to 150 Mbps 
downlink and 50 MBps uplink speed.
Everyone gets a Share
It doesn’t matter if you’re travelling 
alone, in a group of friends or even 
with your family, the DWR-932 can 
accommodate up to 10 devices 
simultaneously for a smooth, stable 
and secure connection. Although I 
didn’t test it with 10 devices, I did 
run it through 4 separate devices at 
the same time with pleasing results.
Safety is Key
If you’re worried about connecting 
to the mobile router in a different 
location, fear not as the DWR-932 
comes with a built-in firewall to 
protect you from Internet attacks. 
It also comes with the industry-
standard WPA/WPA2 security 
feature so you don’t need to worry 
about unfamiliar devices connecting 
to your network. 
Pocket-sized
The DWR-932 weighs 
only 100 grams and 
is small enough to fit 
into your pocket while 
providing you with 
a stable 4G Internet 
connection.
Personal Pet 
Peeve
The DWR-932 only 
accepts the original 
SIM card rather than 
the conventional micro 
SIM or even nano SIM 
so finding the sleeve for 
your SIM will be a hassle.
Store More
Aside from a removable 
20,000 mAh Li-ion 
battery, the DWR-932 
comes with a microSD 
slot for you to store all 
your files and documents.

TV Subtitute
 Epson EH-TW8300 4K Home Theatre Projector
4K Goodness
If you thought spending money on 
a 4K TV was absurb to get cinema-
like video quality, Epson goes ahead 
and introduces the EH-TW8300 4K 
Home Theatre Projector, blowing 
every other 4K TV out of the water. 
Its 4K Enhancement technology is 
straightforward – turning everything 
you watch into pristine, crisp and 
crystal clear 4K quality that you 
won’t even recognise your favourite 
movies; even I didn’t. Even gaming 
in 4K made games like Horizon Zero 
Dawn even more appealing than it 
already is.
Watch in its Purest Form
The EH-TW8300 comes with a 
whole list of features that wants you 
to watch and stream your videos 
in 4K video quality. This made 4K 
YouTube videos great to watch and 
even Netflix Original shows. Thanks 
to the 3LCD Technology from Epson, 
you will always get amazing detail 
in colour with reliable consistency. 
You can even convert 2D movies into 
3D, making your favourite movies so 
much better.
External Audio Required
Sadly, one flaw of the EH-TW8300 
is that there are no built-in speakers 
so you will need external speakers 
to go along with it. What good is 
watching your movies in 4K when 
there’s no audio? Unless you’re into 
the old B&W movies. With that said, 
no ordinary speakers will do as you 
need to have top-quality speakers 
to go along with the top-quality 
picture. 
Insanely Small 
Footprint 
For a 4K home theatre 
projector, the EH-
TW8300 has a small 
footprint, promising to 
take up less space than 
many others.
Keeping Itself 
Cool
The EH-TW8300 comes 
with its own efficient 
cooling system, which 
not only keeps it cool but 
also quiet so it wouldn’t 
interrupt your movies.
10 Lens Memory
You can now preset up to 10 various 
positions for zoom, focus and lens shift 
for the EH-TW8300 so you can have 
a specific position for movies, gaming 
and presentations.

All U Need
 U Mobile Post Paid Plan
Unrestricted Access
U Mobile comes with various options 
for postpaid plans, and we got the 
P48 to test it out ourselves. The plan 
comes with unlimited voice call to 
all networks, as well as unlimited 
free data for social media use, music 
streaming, and waze. You get 5GB 
of video streaming too. All these are 
not limited to time of day or day of 
the week. 
New phone? At a discounted 
price?
The Hero Postpaid P70 and P98, 
which comes with some extra data 
and perks, allows users to buy a 
device with monthly instalments. 
U Mobile’s Ultimate Device Plans 
(RM60, RM90, RM 130) also allows 
you to own a device at discounted 
price. Although purely basing on 
telco features you get, we say the 
Hero postpaid plans are much more 
worth your buck.

Roaming overseas
While most telcos charge a few for 
roaming data overseas, U Mobile 
lets you roam with just RM10 a day 
unlimited in 12 countries. For P70 
and P98 customers you can roam 
on your existing data plan for free in 
certain countries. While we haven’t 
tested any lines overseas, the lines 
locally is stable enough. Although 
in certain areas where other telcos 
easily picks up 4G signals, our 
testing line was stuck on 3G signals 
or lower.

our travels will not be complete with photos. Yes, even if you are doing those solo trips, taking photos as keepsake 
for later days when you want to relive your holiday. Yes a smartphone camera these days are sufficient for causal 
photography, but when you want to be a little bit more artistic, nothing can replace a true camera. Hence, we gathered 
the three cameras which we think will be perfect for travel photography, due to their features and design – but which 
one is the best? The cameras are more for the enthusiasts, but they are perfectly suitable for photographers all over. 
This month we will be checking out three entries in the enthusiast camera market. Read up on our showdown 
between the Fujifilm X100F, Sony RX100 MkV and the Canon G1X Mark II.

Fujifilm X100F
he entry from Fujifilm is a bit more unique when compared with the others 
here. For one, it only has one focal length – 23mm or in full frame terms 
34.5mm, which is near the standard street photography lens favourite – 
35mm. This is by design as the X100F has been designed to be for those 
who captures street photography more often than not. What is also different is 
that the camera features manual controls all around the body. 
T
You want to change a setting? There is a dial for that. Shutter? The dial is 
within reach of your finger. Aperture? It is right there around the lens, so you 
can just twist to select the aperture that you want to use. Even the ISO speed is 
accessible via a dial – except that it is actually inside the shitter dial. You pull up 
and twist to change the ISO value. 
From the front the X100F will not look out of place when compared to a 
camera from 40 or 50 years ago. The model we got has the silver top and the 
leather-texture body, reminiscence to the older cameras of yesteryear. Of course 
when you go to the back of the camera, it is all modern. You see a 2.36million 
dot LCD (which is not touch sensitive), a very useful joystick at the top of the 
buttons, and a four-way d-pad to control your information and settings that are 
not accessible with the dials. 
Behind the lens is a 24-megapixel APS-C X-Trans sensor, which will give your 
images that are sharp, clear and nice looking with every satisfying click of the 
mechanical shutter (FYI, the shutter button comes with a thread for those old-
style shutter releases that are used by classic cameras!)
The lack of zoom in the lens will put this camera on a disadvantage when put 
against the others in this list, but that APS-C X-Trans sensor, Fujinon lens, and the 
image processing makes it a very compelling camera to own. Images taken with 
this camera has that special sauce which makes it stand out against the pack. 
Using the camera is a joy for camera enthusiasts. I did say camera enthusiast, 
not photography enthusiast. Why? This is because the construction of the camera is 
one of a kind, and it is very satisfying when carried around the town snapping away. 
The shutter sounds and feel old school, which may be a turn on or turn off to some. 
One special feature of the camera is the hybrid Optical/Electronic View Finder 
(OVF/EVF). Thanks to a prism, the view finder can work like a classic view finder, 
where it is an optical POV, or switched to an EVF where all the information of the 
camera can be displayed to the user.

Sony RX100 Mark V
hile other camera manufacturers are churning out new designs to 
the market, Sony is sticking to a formula that they know which has 
been tried and tested. This results in the fifth iteration of the well-
known camera design that has served the company well thus far.
W
From the outlook of the camera, the Mk V looks like all the previous RX100 that 
has come before it. In fact, it is being sold with the Mk IV and Mk III on the 
Malaysian market right now. Why, we do not know. However the Mk V does have 
some features that puts it above and beyond its siblings (and competitors). 
First, the camera is the smallest zoom camera with 4K recording right now. 
While some smartphones can record 4K video, this is the smallest camera with 
zoom lens that can record the new UHD video format with ease. That makes it a 
very compelling reason for those who wants to record content to share. 
Second, the Mark V comes with a new hybrid AutoFocus (AF) system that 
includes 315 phase-detect points that covers about 65% of the image frame. 
Usable in both shots and video (even in 4K), this system ensures that your shots 
will be spot on. 
The sensor on the camera is still the 1-inch, 20.2-megapixel stacked Exmore 
RS sensor, but now includes an updated LSI chip which gives it a faster processing 
speed, and expands the memory buffer so that you can take more shots at once. 
Press and spray, as the industry will say. 
What is also new with the RX100 Mk V is the Photo Capture mode, which 
allows you to save any frames from a 4K video as an image, with each frames 
clocking in at 8-megapixels (Full HD videos gets you a 2-megapixel still image 
file). 
One reason people are attracted to the RX100 series is the size – and the 
latest camera is still one of the best pocketable camera around. Barely bigger 
than a ciggy box, the RX100 Mk V will be a great companion for those who are 
limited in the carrying department (ladies purse & manbags, I am looking at your) 
but still need to get good photos every time. 
Plus the photos taken with the RX100 Mk V is one of the best out there 
for cameras with 1-inch sensors. If you need the photos to be transferred to 
your phone don’t worry – NFC and WiFi means that photos and videos can be 
transferred wirelessly to your smartphone with just a scan of a QR code. Easy 
peasy.

SHOWDOWN
Canon G1X Mark II
or something a bit beefier, the Canon G1X Mark II will be the choice 
among the three. It is physically bigger, has a larger sensor than the 
RX100, and even features longer zoom range when compared to the two 
cameras here. Will it pass the test and be the one to choose from?
F
Just as a preface, this camera is one of the older models in the line-up, but it 
is still a great option from Canon in terms of compact(ish) enthusiast cameras for 
photographers who are looking for a camera to bring around. 
What makes this camera a compelling buy is the sensor – it is a 1.5-inch sensor, 
which is only about 20% smaller than an APS-C sensor, like the one in the Fujifilm. 
It is paired with a respectable zoom lens that is about 4x (28-112mm) so you can 
capture far subjects without you needing to do the leg zoom method. The lens is a 
f/2.0-3.9 equivalent lens by the way. 
This is the only camera in the line-up that does not come with a viewfinder – be 
it electronic or optical. However Canon does have the EVF available as an optional 
accessory for sale. It slots onto the hotshoe (which coincidentally also accepts all 
Canon Speedlights). 
Also featured in the camera is the tilting 3-inch, 1.04milion dot touch display. 
Yes, this is the only camera here with a touch screen that you can use to manipulate 
elements on screen. Touch and refocus your shot – even when you are using the EVF. 
Using the camera is a bit of a mixed bag, as the feeling of the buttons can 
be mushy – including the shutter button. You don’t feel as confident using this 
camera as with the others in the line-up. You do get a sturdier body – it feels 
really solid in the hands – but the experience of using it can be confusing. Like 
the Sony, the Canon features a front dial around the lens. However, you need to 
be in the selected mode to use that dial – it can’t be used when the correct mode 
is not selected. 
This camera is nice to be carried around, as the small stature of the camera 
will not make it stand out around when compared to DSLRs. Your chances of 
being stopped by security will be lower – which is a good thing. 
Photos taken with the G1X Mark II looks almost DSLR-like for some reason. 
The lens also has a wider angle of view, and may has an advantage against the 
other cameras here. The biggest negative for this camera is the slow operating 
speeds when compared with the others in the line-up. We wish it can be a bit 
faster.

CONCLUSION
Without a doubt, the best carry around travel camera here is the Sony RX100 
MkV. The combination of its small size, great performance and nice feature makes 
it a recommendation in our books. An honourable mention is the Fujifilm X100F for 
pure photography performance. 

Perfecting the Art of Black and White Photography
We live in a colourful world. Yet, colours can distract you away from the essentials of a great photo – texture, tonal contrast, shape, form and lighting. To 
master the art of black and white photography, you should learn how to balance all these elements to create a memorable image. Here are a few tips to 
help you get started.

Visualise in black and white
When it comes to shooting in black and white, it helps to look out for strong lines, shadows, and shapes. As you’re shooting, imagine how your final shot will 
look like. Look beyond the colours; picture how the image’s shapes, textures and tones will be captured. It takes practice to hone this vision so get out there and 
get shooting. 
Canon EOS 6D, EF16-35mm f/4L IS USM, f/5.6, 1/160 sec, ISO 100
Think about composition
The next time you’re looking for a subject to shoot in black and white, pay close attention to elements like texture, line, shape, and tonal contrast. Textures look 
best in black and white, but be sure to shoot during the golden hour of light to enhance it. Tonal contrast is about finding the right balance between the lighter 
shades and darker tones of grey. When all these elements come together in your photo, you might be on to a pretty great shot.

Go RAW
Shoot in RAW mode if your camera allows that function, as RAW files contain 
all the colour information from a shot, giving you more control of the image’s 
appearance. You’ll also be able to change your mind later if the photo didn’t turn 
out as great in black and white as you had hoped. You might just be surprised at 
what you can achieve during the post-production stage.
Go low on ISO
Use the lowest ISO possible. When it comes to black and white photos, 
images with noise become even more obvious. Noise makes your photos 
look grainy and not as smooth as you’d like. It’s harder to edit out the 
noise, but if you prefer this effect, you can always choose to add it later 
in post production.

Get moody 
Dark and gloomy days, a nightmare for photographers who shoot in colour, can 
actually be the best time for black and white photos. The trick is to ensure the 
light suits the subject. Light at noon, for example, can be great for architecture 
but poor for portraiture. An overcast day might be great for taking portraits, but 
unsuitable for landscapes.
Subject matter
One of the many reasons why photographers love black and white is its 
versatility. It gives the photographer freedom to shoot across various subjects. 
Good subjects to get you started on monochrome photography include portraits, 
landscapes, architecture, travel and street photography.

 Exabytes Founder cum Executive Director, Chan Kee Siak (4th from left) posing with Cockroach Startup Program Team
will also get RM20,000 in cash in 
exchange for Exabytes to gain 5% 
equity shareholding in their business.
Why Cockroach? Founder cum 
Executive Director of Exabytes, 
Chan Kee Siak shares, “A cockroach 
startup is the one which keeps 
struggling and moves forward in 
spite of changing environments, 
market conditions and investment 
scenarios, just like a cockroach.”
Malaysia is the 3rd largest 
market for startups. Grab, iflix and 
HappyFresh are just a few notable 
Malaysian founded examples that 
have established themselves in the 
South-East Asia region. According 
to Chan, over the years, Malaysia’s 
startup ecosystem has seen more and 
more entrepreneurs with innovative 
products coming into the market.
“We see that there is a need 
to provide a platform to accelerate 
local startups which have a 
scaleable business model but they 
lack of insights on how to utilise 
the strategic technology to work 
for them to achieve maximum 
success…. even the possibility 
of bringing their ventures to 
the global startups ecosystem,” 
explains Chan.
Since 2001, Exabytes have 
helped many SMEs to grow their 
businesses by leveraging on their 
online platform services. Besides 
being awarded as one of the BEST 
Domain Resellers by MYNIC (The 
Malaysia 
Network 
Information 
Centre), 
Exabytes

Mastercard and Maestrano join forces to 
launch first SME cloud marketplace in APAC
SMEs can now derive insights and view real time financial data to help give their businesses a boost
astercard and Maestrano 
partner up to encourage 
SME 
development 
by 
enabling issuing banks 
across the region to leverage cloud-
based technologies. 
Under the agreement, Mastercard 
will be able to refer Maestrano as a 
complementary platform to its business 
card proposition to banks across Asia 
Pacific. This will be the first SME cloud 
marketplace partnership for Mastercard 
in Asia Pacific.
According to the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB), SMEs accounts for 98 
percent of all enterprises in the region, 
and employs up to 66 percent of 
the respective national workforces 
collectively. In certain markets, SMEs 
drive up to 38 percent of GDP. 
Despite SMEs playing an integral 
role in developing APAC economies, 
many SMEs do not enjoy the same 
economies of scale as multi-national 
M
companies, and are hesitant to invest 
in their technological capabilities. 
Studies by the Asia Cloud Computing 
Association (ACCA) found that the 
average SME spends only 2.5 percent of 
its overall budget on IT. 
Philip Glickman, Regional Head, 
Commercial Payment Solutions, Asia 
Pacific, Mastercard, said, “Financing 
for business growth and capability 
development is a key priority in ensuring 
sustainable growth for SMEs, and it 
is critical that SMEs are empowered 
with products and solutions that enable 
them to thrive in highly competitive, 
global marketplaces.” 
The partnership aim to help SMEs 
reduce operational inefficiencies and 
encourage greater visibility and control of 
finances. With Maestrano’s technology, 
issuing banks will be able to provide 
SMEs with an integrated solution that 
enables businesses to track expenditure 
and finances in real-time via cloud. 
Aggregating different applications, 
the Maestrano solution allows for 
sharing of data across multiple software, 
as well as provide reporting capability 
via a customised dashboard, which 
allows SMEs to view critical financial 
data in real-time. SMEs will be able to 
use the dashboard to derive insights 
on their financial position, cash flow 
management and debt reconciliation as 
well as other functions up to four months 
in advance. 
Maestrano’s solution is compatible 
with most cloud business applications 
and 
software 
available 
in 
the 
marketplace today, allowing SMEs to 
save significantly on time and resources 
required 
to 
manage 
operational 
administration, with automatic updates 
across applications.  
The solution will assist banks to more 
clearly differentiate their products and 
solutions for the SME sector, improving 
customer loyalty. When integrated 
with an existing product or solution 
provided by a bank, the Maestrano 
platform can also provide insights 
into the financial needs and health 
of an SME, allowing banks to better 
anticipate and meet customer needs. 
This will deliver improved cash flow 
management and reduce the amount 
of time required in processes such as 
loan applications. 
Stephane Ibos, CEO of Maestrano 
said, “Together we will support the 
growth and development of SME 
customers, enabling new insights 
and services, delivered by our 
unique technology.” 
The 
Maestrano 
platform 
solution is currently available in 
several Southeast Asia markets 
with plans to expand into the wider 
Asia Pacific region by the end of 
the year. Interested customers can 
sign up for the service by contacting 
Mastercard representatives.

Digital Disruption: Do or Die  
Dimension Data Technology Summit sees industry players coming together to 
discuss managing IT in a hybrid world
imension Data’s Technology 
Summit saw many key 
industry players coming 
together 
to 
discuss 
about digital disruption in various 
sectors. The theme revolves around 
reimagining IT with business values 
in mind. 
The keynote was delivered by 
Chief Technology Officer of Dimension 
Data Asia Pacific, Andy Cocks. He 
emphasised on the importance of 
businesses transforming their culture, 
or risk getting left behind. Cocks notes 
that businesses are changing - IT is 
not just an integral part of operations, 
it is the business. At the emerging 
trend of startups that are IT focused, 
Cocks observed that most of these 
companies are IT companies that 
happen to specialise in a certain field. 
“There’s many born in the cloud 
companies that are very disruptive 
and the challenge for traditional 
enterprise organisations is how do we 
maintain competitiveness with these 
new startups.”
D
“All organisation needs to change. 
If you go back about 20 years of the 
fortune 100 companies, only about 
20% still exist. Companies that don’t 
step up into this new world with 
these born in the cloud entrants is 
potentially, all at risk.”
The tech industry has long been 
discussing about the fourth industrial 
revolution, with many agreeing that 
digital is the next wave. 
From 
a 
Dimension 
Data 
perspective, there are five main 
driving forces for digital enterprise 
– mobility for real-time data; big 
data and analytics for making sense 
of structured and unstructured data; 
social media insights for better 
informed decisions; cloud computing 
for distributing resources on a 
limited budget; AI and robotics for 
automation systems. 
Despite 
tools 
being 
readily 
available, analyst data shows many 
companies starting on the journey 
but not many has fully embraced 
it. Traditionally, IT spending tethers 
around internal IT projects. Cocks 
argues 
that 
companies 
should 
instead think of bringing to market IT 
enable products.
 “60% of the tech spending by 
2020 will be done by business units – 
this will be HR, distribution marketing, 
it won’t be IT. If you want to become 
a digital company, you have to be 
involved in your digital strategy. It’s 
not traditional IT guys working in a 
silo with the operations team.”
Cocks explains that the brick 
and mortar IT is no longer the major 
concern of enterprises. Roles in 
hardware or software maintenance 
such as network, datacentre, desktop, 
even security, is no longer filled in 
house – but instead purchased as a 
service (Anything-as-a-Service, XaaS) 
through vendors. 
In fact, where traditionally most 
IT vendors will provide support for 
hardware and software done on 
premise, increasingly enterprises are 
opting for some or limited movement 
of applications and workloads to cloud 
based services such as Microsoft 
Office 365 (Software as a Service), 
Microsoft Azure, and AWS (Platform 
as a Service). 
“The 
main 
question 
from 
organisations is ‘How do I manage 
my IT in a hybrid world?’. All of 
the vendors, without exception, 
are moving a lot of software, 
management, 
management 
controls, 
big 
data 
analytics 
platform, into their cloud.”
Despite alluding to the benefits 
of embracing an agile framework, 
Cocks warns that there needs to be a 
balance between quick and constant 
change in the dynamic world, as well 
as maintaining the tools for services 
to remain available and secure.
“I don’t think the industry’s fixed 
it, we haven’t got the answers. 
But I think the industry certainly is 
looking for a solution. I would ask 
all of you, how are you going to 
manage in this new world that is 
open, dynamic, talking to these 3rd 
party ecosystem partners?”

PC.COM’S FIRST EDITOR SHARES HIS EXPERIENCE WITH US
WALKING DOWN A 
17-YEAR MEMORY LANE 
By Sharil
SPOTLIGHT

101
MAY 2017
eventeen years of PC.com has 
changed all who has been touched 
by it. Our first editor, Justin Then, 
has been in and around the industry 
for over twenty years, and was the 
pioneer for the magazine when it first came 
out in 2001. For our 17th anniversary, we 
caught up with Justin as we chatted about 
the industry back then and now, and where 
we are heading in the years to come. 
PC.com: You have been in the industry 
for, what, 20 plus years? 
Justin: Yes, that is about right. I started in 
around 1992 with Computerworld. When I 
joined, the tech industry was very different. 
Those days you talk about mainframes, 
servers, and also the start of affordable 
personal computer. A typical computer back 
then would cost around RM 5,000 to RM 
6,000. Mind you the processor was an Intel 
286. We were still using floppy disk back 
then – not the smaller ones, the larger 5 
¼ inch versions. I remember the first game 
was Wolfenstien and the process to install 
the game. Those were the days. 
The industry then started to develop, 
things change very quickly when Microsoft 
introduced Windows 3. That is when 
the personal computer started to take 
off. Focus back then was all about office 
application – your Lotus 1-2-3, Wordperfect 
and the rest. In those days, the companies 
we would cover – apart from the enterprise 
companies, were the big names like Lotus 
and IBM, but they have an office here in 
Malaysia. That is the amazing thing. They 
had a rep office here and worked with 
distributors to distribute their software 
around with the like of ACA pacific. There 
were local names that worked with these 
companies to distribute their software here 
in Malaysia. It was also around that time 
where branded computer shop started to 
appear on the scene to engage with the 
consumer market. 
Exciting times happened when the 
internet was first introduced, with Jaring. 
Newsgroups were where everyone hung out 
back then. So, everyone grew up from there, 
and from there we moved to the age of the 
web. Even if the content was static, it was 
cool back then. I still remember connecting 
with modems and the associated pitfalls. 
Today we talk about gigabits per second 
connection speed – but before 56k modems 
were the pinnacle of consumer connectivity. 
US Robotics was king, Motorola was huge 
as well. Those were the days. 
Then miniaturisation started to happen. 
The next big thing to happen to the market 
was the mobile phones. Names like Nokia 
and Ericsson were the names on everyone’s 
lips then. 
PC.com: Was small mobile phones 
around then when you joined PC.com?
Justin: I joined PC.com around 2000 
when I joined PC.com. I joined when they 
were planning the first issue. The older 
managerial team roped me in to help edit 
and publish the first issue. I remember the 
first issue we covered the emerging trend 
back then – mobile phones. 
It was difficult to get information back 
then. There is the web, but it is not as 
prominent as today. PC.com was modelled 
against a very popular magazine from the 
States and UK. Their policy was that they 
will purchase the product they review, and 
run it to the ground. It kept them neutral, 
and that was the model that we were 
heading towards back then because we 
needed to be different. After a while we 
started to be a little bit more pragmatic as 
we realised that we can be independent, 
and at the same time looking for ways 
to also help grow and support the local 
industry as well by being the voice of the 
brands for the consumer, and vice versa. 
We were the first local magazine with a 
Malaysian voice as other magazines back 
then were all imported ones, which were 
not localised for the Malaysian market. 
We took the model – design, content 
ideas, scoring system for reviews – and 
adapted it for PC.com. The magazine plays 
a very important role when we started the 
journey. We were educating the market, 
and well as helping the vendors as a voice 
for and to the consumer. 
PC.com:  Was the industry back then 
more of a hard-core type industry?
Justin: I guess it was hardcore only 
because the market was asking for 
something along that line. We understood 
that the people who will be reading the 
magazine was the ones who are into 
the stuff – the guys who runs the IT 
departments.
PC.com:  Anything you saw as a miss 
opportunity for PC.com over the years?
Justin: I think the one thing that I feel 
PC.com dropped the ball a bit was for 
online content. Back then the web was still 
in the infancy and it was not as developed 
as it is today. So the management was a 
bit pragmatic and decided to focus on print 
first rather than split their resources. 
PC.com:  How has the market changed 
since all those years ago?
Justin: Back in the days, personal computers 
are the things that everyone use. Today, 
hardly anyone uses them anymore. Why 
work with something cumbersome when 
you can do everything on your smartphone? 
Also for the market standpoint, the industry 
has changed the way they sell items to 
their consumers. Before, people will make 
a few trips to see what they want to get at 
Lowyat. Now, people research first online 
and then get everything at Lowyat in one 
go. 
Technology wise – miniaturisation, the 
web and the cloud are the ‘in’ thing today. 
Before, portable hard disk is usually the 
first line for backup solution – now, the 
cloud is first, and the portable hard disk 
is last. Everything is being pushed to the 
cloud.
Readers are actually being more well 
informed thanks to magazines like PC.com. 
Even in the age of the connected web, 
having a local voice for technology is still 
very appreciated. 
PC.com:  Do you feel that print is dead?
Justin: I don’t think print will ever be dead. 
Ever since the web and related content 
first started to appear online, people have 
been saying that print will be dying pretty 
much soon. Even now we are still seeing 
people reading and holding physical issues 
of magazines and newspaper as people still 
want to feel what they read in their hands, 
and they can take their time to ingest the 
information in the age of short attention 
span that we have today. 
Print is no longer king, but print is 
definitely a new component for consumers 
today. Print will be playing a complementary 
role. That is the key, as print will support 
the web, and vice versa.

hen I first launched the game Horizon Zero Dawn, I was mesmerized by 
the look and the feel of the game – even if only at the menu screen! 
The visual presented to me promised something a little bit special than 
your typical console RPG.
Developed by the people of Guerilla Games in The Netherlands, Horizon Zero 
Dawn is an RPG-style game for the PlayStation 4 in an open-world environment. 
It is made just for the PlayStation 4, so only Sony console players get to play this 
game at this point of time. When we say ‘open-world’ game, Horizon Zero Dawn 
is exactly that – a game for players to explore an open-world. And boy the world 
is open and big.

he’s a little girl 
in a big, big 
world
You are Aloy, 
an orphan raised by 
the outcast Rost, in 
a 
post-apocalyptic 
world in the distance 
future. While many games 
already have this setting in play, 
what makes this game special is that 
you are not only living with humans, you 
are living in a world inhabited by a wide 
variety of lifeforms – both natural and 
mechanical. Yes, there are robots out 
there – and they are big. 
As the character Aloy grows in experience, so 
does your gameplay. Thanks to the post-apocalyptic 
setting, you do not have any access to firearms. 
Instead what you have is your trusty bow. Of 
course, this is not just your run-of-the-mill bow and 
arrow. In this universe, the bow and arrow can be 
upgraded with technological components taken 
from fallen mechanical beasts and augment your 
attack. You get electric-based attack, disarming (or 
in this case, dis-armouring) arrows and even rope 
arrows that stakes your enemy to the ground with 
high-tensile rope. 
At one point of the narrative, Aloy will be given 
the reason to explore out of the tribe and see the 
world. When you open up the map from this point, 
your world map is revealed, and you will be awed by 
the size of the world you can explore.
Open your eyes to wander around
As you explore the world, you will come across 
many side quests as you work to push the main 
quest to completion. Along the way, you will also 
come across optional quests to either help you get 
better understanding of the environment around 
you, obtain superior weapons and armour, or even 
ways to tame the mechanical beasts that roam 
around the world of Horizon Zero Dawn.
Talking about the mechanical beasts – this 
inclusion of roaming protagonists brings a new 
level of gameplay for the player. By taking down the 
beasts, you get to harvest important items such as 
weapons part, in-game currency and even tradable 
materials for traders you will eventually meet 
MAY 2017
around the map. 
Taking down the beasts can 
be very satisfying, as you will be 
pitting your wits, skills and tactical 
strategy against the mechanical beasts 
that are modelled from seemingly 
ancient animals such as sabretooth 
tigers, raptors and even the T-Rex. Yes 
– you are going against mechanical 
dinosaurs. How cool is that?
Your journey as Aloy in the world will pit you 
against these monsters, as well as flesh and blood 
ones – as you meet up with raiders and eventually 
the game’s human protagonist; all of these 
happening while you are figuring out who you are 
in the world, and what Horizon Zero Dawn is in the 
context of the game. 
One feature that got my (and seemingly 
everyone’s) attention is the environment of the 
world in the game – how beautiful it is to just 
walk around and gawk at the flora and fauna you 
can see in game. The art designers at Guerrilla 
Games really done justice with the game, and this 
is reflected with a built-in tool that the company 
has included with the game. The Camera Mode 
allows you to control the current scene like how 
you would control your camera – aperture value, 
focusing distance and so on. You can actually 
make professional-looking shots with the feature in 
conjunction with the PS4’s screenshot toggle. The 
same adjustment can also be done with the video 
clip that you capture in game.
Push me around, player
Controlling Aloy in game is extremely easy and 
precise, thanks to the Sony PlayStation 4 Dual 
Shock 4 controller. The analogue controls make it 
easy to control how fast or how slow Aloy moves 
in game, and it helps in executing precise weapon 
strikes to enemies that you are going against. 
Upgrading your character also comes with 
benefits, such as better damage given, better 
precision when pulling back the arrow, as well as 
other upgrades such as extra damage for electrical 
and fire elements with every arrow. Upgrades come 
in the forms of modules that you can install on your 
weapon, which increases the effectiveness of the 
weapon according to the type and rarity of the 
module used. 
As a casual console player, the game was easy 
to enter and master within several hours of playing, 
and once you are playing it, you will get hooked by 
the sheer expanse and beauty of the game world, 
gameplay as well as the interactions you get 
between the characters in game.

pace, the final frontier. 
These are the voyages of the Starship 
(insert name here).
To boldly going where no one has gone 
before – massively multiplayer online gaming!
If you are a trekkie (or trekker to some) i.e. a Star Trek 
fan, check out this new game that is set both in space 
and ground, where you get to play as your own captain, 
and control your own ship to find your destiny. Welcome 
to Star Trek Online. 
A score and seven years ago…
The game was launched in 2010, and just celebrated its 
7th year running. What this means is that the game has 
accumulated over 7 years worth of information, story 
and content. As this is an official licensed product from 
CBS, all of the stories contained here can be considered 
as ‘canon’ or official content that is directly relatable 
to the TV series and movies that has come before the 
game. 
As it approaches Season 13 in game, the mechanics 
of the game has largely stayed intact, but with new 
tweaks and features added in along the way. You 
start off as a character in one of the three factions 
– Federation, Klingon or Romulan. The player can 
extensively change and mold his/her character to their 
specification according available template – or just start 
from scratch as a new alien species. 
After which the player will be immersed in the lore 
of Star Trek Online, with missions scattered around 
the galaxy on explorable planets and locations that 
appeared in many incarnations of Star Trek. Space 
station Deep Space Nine, planet Vulcan, Star Fleet 
Academy in San Francisco, Romulus, Kronos and even 
the Delta Quadrant to name a few. These names will 
instantly be knowledgeable to Star Trek fans. 
On the ground and in the heavens
Basically the game is split into two mechanics – space 
and ground. The latter will bring you to ground maps 
in locations that is relatable to the mission at hand. 
Starting as a cadet, your character will rise up in rank 
to finally achieve the game’s current level cap of 60 and 
use high ranking weapons that will effective against evil 
doers and enemies that surrounds you in missions. 
Space is where the pretty eye candy lives, as the Star 
Trek universe is full of star ships that lets you travel 
between stars at warp speeds. At print time, the game 
features over 400 ships, ranging from simple small ships 
called shuttles, all the way to space carrier behemoths. 
The number of ships are spread across all three factions, 
as well as cross faction ships. The ships can be obtained 
through several ways – free ships from level upgrades, 
as well as seasonal events; purchased using the in-
game currencies (dilithium and Energy Credits); and 
through the Zen store, the in-game currency that can be 
purchased using real world money. 
Step into some rich content
What make this MMO different when compared with 
other online games is the combination of content and 
gameplay that is accessible by the gamer. On one 
hand, you get the usual grinding mechanic that allows 
players to gain in-game currency through daily events 
and missions; on the other hand you get a very rich 
story-based content that was developed throughout the 
years, and expanded through new ‘Seasons’ that are 
introduced roughly once every six months. 
The content that has been created not only pulls 
from Star Trek lore, they also pulled in the original actors 
to voice their characters in-game to further enhance the 
gameplay experience. Characters such as Worf, Seven 
of Nine, Nog and even classic characters such as Scotty 
and Spock are well represented in game and voiced by 
their original actors. This adds value to the already rich 
game for the player. 
To top everything off – the game is a free to play 
(F2P) game that is accessible to any players out there. 
Players can either pay real world money to get items 
and ship, or grind in game to get the ships that they are 
looking forward to own. 
Fly off at warp speed
If you are a Star Trek fan, this is one game that you 
should pick up and spend some time to play as it will 
add depth to your knowledge of the Star Trek lore. If you 
are a fringe fan, it is also a good game to check out, just 
to see all of the ships and races walking around you. If 
you are not a fan, do still check out the game as it is an 
MMO that is easy to pick up and to master. 
Plus, you get to shoot lasers in space. What is not 
fun about that?

IT’S MIGHTY
MORPHIN’ TIME
 Power Rangers Legacy Wars 
nother month, another reminiscent of my childhood which 
never came true. Back in the 90’s where times were simpler, 
kids my age would look forward to coming home from school 
and Saturday mornings where we will park our asses in 
front of the TV and for half-an-hour, be filled with glee as ‘The Power 
Rangers’ would come on and we’ll sing, dance and karate our way 
through the intro, remembering every line to the song. I’m not ashamed 
to say that I did all the above with much gusto, which resulted in a 
broken lamp or two.
As kids, we would always dream of being a Power Ranger – 
the Red or White Ranger to be exact – and have our childhood 
crush be the Pink Ranger for obvious reasons (nobody will ever 
replace Amy Jo Johnson!). As good a throwback to 
the classic the 2017 movie remake of The Power 
Rangers were, it would never be the same. This 
time round, we’re playing Power Rangers: 
Legacy Wars on an Android device.

Taking 
it Back 
to the 90’s
The tutorial for 
Legacy Wars is pretty 
straightforward; you swipe back 
and forth to dodge enemy 
attacks 
while 
having 
two main abilities to 
deal damage and being 
able to call upon two 
teammates to help 
you out in battle. 
What 
nWay 
did well was 
i n t e g r a t i n g 
both the new 
and 
original 
Power Rangers 
battle 
suits where we 
have the more Transformer-like 
suits as well as the gaudy, bright-
coloured jumpsuits that made 
Kimberly 
that much hotter. 
Aside 
from 
the 
original Power Rangers lineup, 
you also get the chance to unlock 
various other Rangers from the 
Zeo generation and many other 
Rangers from different seasons of 
the TV series.
Believe me, I was insanely 
tempted to spend RM43.99 to 
purchase the Exclusive Legacy 
Warrior 
Launch 
Offer, 
which 
includes the OG Green Ranger, 
Tommy Oliver (the same actor who 
is now an MMA fighter).
Bringing the Worst Out of Me
Another 
gameplay 
feature 
introduced into Legacy Wars 
is its PvP element without any 
storyline. Instead of beating the 
crap out of Rita Repulsa and her 
goons, you instead have to plan 
your 3-man roster against another 
player of a similar skill level 
as you each have to strategise 
between defense, attack and ally 
assistance to get the upper hand 
in the battle. Fortunately for me, 
this is my territory when it comes 
to schooling my opponents through 
my insanely random mashing of 
skills that almost made me drop my 
smartphone more than once.
One great thing about Legacy 
Wars is the low waiting time you 
get when looking for an opponent. 
The longest I’ve ever waited was 
probably a minute at most. Legacy 
Wars is also easy-to-learn with a very 
gentle learning curve, allowing you 
to be reasonably good at the game 
without dedicating much time to it. 
Not to brag, but I beat someone who 
has much higher experience points 
than I did (now that’s how you humble 
brag, ladies and gentlemen).
Cop or Drop
If you’re interested in reliving your 
childhood fantasies of being able to 
become a Power Ranger (somewhat!), 
Legacy Wars is the game for you with 
its no-nonsense battle system and 
easy-to-learn gameplay mechanics. 
The only long wait time you will have 
is unlocking Morph Boxes, which will 
increase in time the more you unlock 
them.
You can instantly unlock them 
by spending Power Crystals and 
spending real cash to unlock more 
virtual crystals. If you see that as a 
great way to level up in the game, go 
right ahead but just know that I hate 
you.

n the past couple of years, 
NVIDIA 
and 
Intel 
have 
transformed the IT industry with 
ground-breaking 
innovations 
like Intel’s 7th Gen. Intel-Core Kaby 
Lake processors and NVIDIA’s GTX 
10 Series GPUs that is everything 
a gamer would want and need. 
However, AMD has now emerged 
from over the ho-ryzen with a brand 
new lineup of processors and GPUs 
that will keep its competitors looking 
over its shoulders.
Although AMD did introduce 
its Radeon RX 400 Series a month 
after NVIDIA rolled out the GTX 
10 Series, it could not match the 
mean green machine in terms of 
performance. However, what AMD 
did to counter that was keep its 
AMD pulls out all the stops in its launch of the Ryzen processors and RX 500 Series GPU
The Ryze(n) of AMD
i
Radeon RX 400 Series at a much 
more affordable and budget-friendly 
rate as compared to NVIDIA.
This time around, the Radeon 500 
Series promises to stand toe-to-toe 
with NVIDIA in performance while 
keeping its pricing at a reasonable 
rate. Featuring the RX 550, RX 
560, RX 570 and its flagship, the 
RX580, these GPUs are going from 
US$70 (approx. RM308) to US$269 
(RM1,189). Although finalised pricing 
has yet to be confirmed, AMD did give 
us a sneak peek into the performance 
ratings and features of the Radeon RX 
500 Series.
One of the key features is Radeon 
Chill, an intelligent power-saving 
feature that will dynamically regulate 
its GPU’s framerates based on your 
movements 
in-game. 
Supporting 
over 20 games (which includes two 
of the biggest eSports MOBA games 
– Dota 2 and League of Legends), 
Radeon Chill comes with an improved 
responsiveness to your gameplay 
while still maintaining its high 
efficiency rate and keeping your GPU 
cool always.
Aside from Radeon Chill, the 
Radeon RX 500 Series GPUs are 
also optimised for DirectX 12 and 
Vulkan 
Gaming, 
ensuring 
your 
gaming experience is like no other. 
It also comes with Radeon FreeSync 
Technology, Radeon ReLive and even 
HEVC H.265 4K Encode/Decoding.
First off, the tagline for the 
Radeon RX 580 is ‘Smooth HD Gaming 
and Beyond’; with the specs provided 
for the RDX 580, AMD is really pulling 
out all the stops. It has a faster base/
boost clock speed at 1257/1340 MHz 
respectively, 36 compute units and 
supports up to 8GB of GDDR5 RAM 
on a 256-bit interface. The RX 580 is 
also VR Ready so you can plug in a VR 
headset and be immersed.
Right behind the RX580 is its 
younger brother, the RX 570, which 
is perfect for 1080p gaming. A base/
boost clock speed of 1168/1244 MHz, 
32 compute units, 4GB of GDDR5 
RAM on a 256-bit interface makes 
this card a great performer for Full HD 
gaming. Expect smooth 60fps gaming 
on titles such as Doom, Battlefield 1 
and the new Resident Evil game.
Next on the list is the RX 560. 
This is for those who wants good Full

“the RX550 does 
not need any extra 
power socket so 
it is perfect to 
upgrade your older 
machines to play 
modern games.”
HD (1080p) gaming while still looking 
for an efficient card in their system. 
It has a base/boost clock speed of 
1175/1275 MHz, 16 compute units and 
the same 4GB of GDDR5 RAM on a 
256-bit interface as the RX 570.
Lastly for those who are just 
stepping (gingerly) into the gaming 
scene, the RX 550 may be your ticket. 
It has a 1183 MHz boost clock, 8 
compute units and 2GB of GDDR5 
RAM on a 256b-it interface. If you are 
coming from an integrated graphics 
processor (IGP) found on most PC these 
days, this card makes lots of sense. 
Play favourites such as CS:GO, Dota 
2 and Overwatch at 80+fps for smooth 
gaming, even on your bog-standard 
machine. Plus, it does not need any 
extra power socket so it is perfect 
to upgrade your older machines to 
play modern games. The card also 
opens the market to Freesync-enabled 
monitors to be used with their machine 
and a lower entry point.
Besides the introduction of the 
Radeon RX 500 Series, AMD also 
brought forth its latest desktop 
processor, the AMD Ryzen in three 
variants – Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 
3. Although the Ryzen 7 is already 
out on the market here, the formal 
launching was to introduce the Ryzen 
5 in our shores along with an attractive 
price point.
The Ryzen 5 comes in four versions 
– 1400X at RM819, 1500X at RM899, 
1600 at RM1,039 and 1600X at 
RM1,199. Both the 1400X and 1500X 
comes with 4-cores and 8-threads but 
the 1400X comes with a base clock 
speed of 3.2GHz with a maximum 
of 3.4GHz overclocked. The 1500X 
however has 3.5GHz base clock speed 
and overclocked will get you 3.7GHz. 
The 1600 and 1600X feature 6-cores 
and 12-threads but with improved 
base and overclocked speeds at 
3.2GHz to 3.6GHz as well as 3.6GHz to 
4.0GHz, respectively.

life as you will now be able to play it 
on Steam. The Digital Deluxe Edition 
is now available on Steam at RM40, 
which also gives you wallpapers,

reminiscent of Sonic the Hedgehog. 
Bayonetta can also use magical 
attacks while kicking butts with 
her heel guns and using her hair to 
summon demons to her aid. 
If you think that Bayonetta 
reminds you of the Devil May Cry 
series, you would be right. This 
popular hack-and-slash was directed 
by the brilliant mind behind Devil 
May Cry and Resident Evil 2 - Hideki 
Kamiya and is developed by Platinum 
Games. As it had somewhat of a 
cult following after its release in 
2009, seven years is a long enough

their original content and creations 
to the millions of daily players on 
Minecraft itself.
This feature is set to go live in 
Spring 2017 with nine businesses 
already lined up to to sell its feature 
packs in the game, which includes 
new storylines and in-game activities 
to name a few. Pricing for these new 
features range between US$1 to 
US$150 per creation so you better be 
ready to spend some heavy dollars. 
Over the subsequent months, other 
companies can apply to sell its feature 
packs in Minecraft’s marketplace 
and users wishing to purchase new 
content will have to use Minecraft’s 
new currency - Minecraft Coins.
The purpose of this new feature 
is to connect creators to players who 
can then make a living from a video 
game, said John Thornton, Minecraft’s 
executive producer from Microsoft. 
Minecraft Coins can be purchased 
via any supported device that comes 
with its own app store, such as iOS, 
Android and Microsoft. Said coins 
will then live in a user’s Microsoft 
Xbox Live virtual wallet and will be 
accessible for marketplace purchases 
on any platform. Although no exact 
figure has been established to how 
much developers will receive from the 
revenue share after Microsoft Corp. 
and its app stores take a cut, Thornton 
says it’ll be more than half.

eing a fan of both Razer 
and Apple can be stressful 
at 
times. 
Since 
the 
introduction of the iPhone 7 
without a headphone jack, being able 
to use Razer headphones has been 
a nightmare. However, that has now 
changed as Razer has added two new 
models into its Hammerhead v2 line, 
a Bluetooth model as well as an iOS 
Lightning-compatible model.
With Bluetooth v4.1 added into 
the Hammerhead v2, you can now 
have clear and cordless audio without 
having to deal with the constant 
struggle of wrestling wires. It also 
features the Qualcomm aptX codec 
for low-latency, high-quality audio,

Razer expands on its ever-popular Hammerhead v2 with Bluetooth and iOS Lightning models
an in-line remote and mic that is 
compatible with both iOS and Android 
devices. These in-ear headphones 
also has a battery life of up to 8 hours 
on a single charge so you can have it 
on for the entire day.
As Apple keeps its Lightning 
Connectors as the only port available 
on its iPhone, Razer comes out with 
its new Hammerhead v2 variant 
that is compatible with the latest 
iPhone. It delivers a clean digital 
audio 
through 
a 
custom-tuned, 
digital-to-analogue converter (DAC). 
There is also a Razer Hammerhead 
iOS companion app where you can 
customise your listening experience 
with a pre-configured equaliser.

StarCraft gets its first major patch update and is now free for all
rguably one of the most 
popular eSports games of 
this generation, StarCraft 
has been a household 
name for many years now ever 
since its release in 1998 with two 
expansions – Insurrection and Brood 
War. 
Developed 
and 
published 
by Blizzard, the only way to play 
StarCraft and its DLCs (downloadable 
content) is through Blizzard’s own 
gaming platform, Battle.net. You will 
also have to purchase the game to 
play it exclusively on the platform.
However, all that has now 
changed as StarCraft is now available 
absolutely free! Available on both PC 
and Mac, Blizzard has just released 
the first StarCraft game along with 
its expansions for free. This is a 
good way to gain new fans and 
gamers who never had a chance to 
play StarCraft because it didn’t make 
sense to purchase a game that came 
out almost 20 years ago.
a
This will also be a good throwback 
for avid fans of the RTS game as 
Blizzard also recently announced the 
remastered version of the original 
StarCraft with up-to-date graphics, 
revised dialogue and audio, slated for 
a release sometime in 2017.

hen you think about electronic automobiles, you would immediately think of Tesla and its owner – billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark 
Elon Musk. Having revolutionised the automotive industry in unprecedented ways, Musk now faces stiff competition from Lucid Air, with its 
alpha prototype, the luxury electric Lucid Air.
With production of the Lucid Air slated to start in 2019, the Lucid Air is steadily taking the world by storm ever since its reveal during a private 
VIP event held in Fremont, California back in December 2016. Lucid Motor’s very own CTO – Peter Rawlinson has claimed the Lucid Air to be 
revolutionary compared to the Tesla Model S (which says a lot seeing as Rawlinson was the chief engineer for the Model S back in his Tesla days).
While the base model of the Lucid Air features a 400-horsepower rear-wheel drive system with a 24-mile driving range priced at US$52,500, the 
more upscaled version of the Lucid Air will house over 1,000-horsepower with a twin-motor all-wheel system as well as a 400-mile driving range 
battery option. In terms of aesthetics, the upscaled Lucid Air will also feature a glass-canopy roof, 21-inch Lucid-design wheels, a fully-activated 
suspension system with 22-way power front seats that comes with all the trimmings (ventilation, heating, etc. etc.). Both the base and upscaled model 
will have four screens with interactive-touch surfaces on three and LED multi-lens array headlights.
Both models of the Lucid Air are currently available for pre-order on Lucid Air Motor’s website but you will sadly have to be in Canada or the United 
States to be able to pre-order a unit for yourself. However, it doesn’t hurt to dream to being able to own it one day.
