Dedication
To the pleasure of a productive day, the calm of a loving family, and the secu-
rity of a world at peace.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to first acknowledge the gracious help of the folks at Sun
Microsystems for their time spent reviewing this book as we’ve proceeded,
their generosity in underwriting my attendance at some Solaris training, and
the long-term loan of a Sun Blade100 system to double-check every example
and screen image against the latest release on a solid SPARC box. In addition,
Tadpole Technology was generous in loaning out a cool SPARCbook 6500
SPARC-based laptop ,and Tenon Software was kind in sending an X Window
Server for Mac OS X to allow session interoperability in my network.
There were also a number of people involved in this writing project, notably
including the lovely team at Wiley: Terri Varveris, Pat O’Brien, tech reviewer
extraordinaire Terry Cummings, and Andy Cummings, a long time friend of
mine in the publishing biz. In addition, Dave Miles at Tadpole had some
insights into Solaris strategies; Steve Christensen, Webmaster of sunfree-
ware.com had great ideas about online resources; and Martin Brown and
John Meister shared their Solaris expertise. Dee-Ann, as usual, let me vent
when needed, and I can’t say enough about the great support of my wife, chil-
dren, dogs, and cat!

Solaris 9 For Dummies

Foreword
It’s my pleasure to introduce you to Solaris, a computer operating environ-
ment that has been a important part of my life for more than 20 years. Not
that I’ve paid much attention to it.
The great thing about Solaris, from my perspective, is that it has simply been
there for me whenever I need it. To put it plainly, Solaris is pretty darn reli-
able. And it has always allowed me do several tasks at once — run a
spreadsheet, send mail, watch a Webcast, or whatever — with ease.
Even if this book is your first conscious exposure to the Solaris Operating
Environment, chances are you’ve already “used”  Solaris. Millions do without
ever knowing it. That’s because many of the Web sites and Internet applica-
tions we use every day run on Solaris. Something like 90 percent of all
Internet traffic runs through a Sun server at some point.  Eighty-five percent
of all NASDAQ trades run on Sun, and every one of the Fortune 100 uses
Solaris in some capacity.
We started out in 1983 with Solaris 1.0 and in 2001, we rolled out Solaris 9
with a host of new features and functionality in areas like security, instant
messaging, and so on.
Reading this book, you’ll learn about the subtleties and strengths of the
Solaris environment, including both the command-line and graphical inter-
faces. Like me, you won’t do any programming or advanced system
administration, but you will get to know a friendly, reliable co-worker who
can help you be more productive.

Introduction
W
elcome to Solaris 9 For Dummies! This book covers everything you
need to know to be productive with your computer and does it in a
fun and engaging manner. 
Solaris is the flagship Unix operating system from Sun Microsystems, a com-
pany started by a group of graduate students from Stanford and the University
of California, Berkeley. In fact, Sun comes from the Stanford University
Network, where MBA student (and now Sun CEO) Scott McNealy studied. 
Unix has a long and interesting history as an operating system, starting with
its initial development at AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories in the early 1960s.
The first version of Unix was written so that the BTL folks had a computer
that ran Space War, a very early computer game. Really!
The first few versions of Sun’s Unix OS (initially called SunOS — the Solaris
name showed up later) were variants on UC Berkeley’s Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) Unix. Many of the top BSD developers at UCB ended up
at Sun, most notably Bill Joy, who shows up time and again in this book.
The Unix community has always been a bit splintered compared to the PC
world where Microsoft is a ubiquitous presence. If you were to really explore
the history of Unix, with the Posix standardization efforts and shared devel-
opment efforts of Motif and the Open Software Foundation, you’d find Sun
has consistently been at the forefront of both technological development and
coolness factor. If you wanted to be a cool Unix type, you’d have a Sun work-
station on your desk.
This continues today, and one of the themes in this book is to not only explain
the fundamentals of working with the OS, but also reveal some of the coolest
features and capabilities. By reading this book, you too will become a smart
and productive Solaris user with a higher coolness quotient!
As with all For Dummies books, this title has lots of humor, some of which is
even funny (I hope!), and great cartoons by Rich Tennant. In addition, to get
you into the swing of the Solaris community, I’ve woven some subtle digs at
Microsoft into the book. It’s a popular hobby in the Solaris world. Stick with
me, and you’ll quickly get the hang of it!

About This Book
I like to write books that sound like I’m sitting at a table with you, we’re both
sipping our cups of tea, and we just happen to have a computer on the table,
where I’m demonstrating certain things or letting you explore. As you pro-
ceed with this book, I think you’ll find it fun, easy to read, and entertaining!
As with any computing topic, the target readers of this book have a wide
range of experience and expertise level. This book is geared to neophytes
with some basic computing skills (you know what a computer mouse is, for
example) up through intermediate users who want to, perhaps, ease the tran-
sition from the Sun Common Desktop Environment to the new GNOME
graphical world. Any Solaris user can benefit from a brush-up of command
shell and terminal skills. They’re covered extensively. This book is made up
of about 50 percent graphical interface content and 50 percent command line
content, so it’s like getting CDE and GNOME For Dummies and Working the
Solaris Command Line For Dummies all wrapped up in one neat package!
You will want to have access to a Solaris system on a regular basis. Whether
it’s SPARC-based or Intel-based won’t affect your experience with this book,
but everything in this book was run on a SPARC-based Sun Blade100
workstation.
To get an idea of the content, here are some sample sections:
 Getting Started with GNOME
 Compressing Big Files
 Working Effectively with Netscape 7
 Connecting Securely with SSH
 Using the vi Text Editor
 Exploring the Solaris Management Console
 Configuring Solaris Networking
 Disabling Unnecessary Internet Services
Although it may seem like this book covers lots of highly advanced technical
topics, you’ll find that the emphasis is on ensuring you have a productive and
secure working environment. Much of the book assumes that you have some-
one else doing the basic system administration and therefore focuses mostly
on the user-level tasks and knowledge needed to avoid any common pitfalls
or mistakes. It’s fun to use Solaris! It’s a sophisticated, powerful, and surpris-
ingly easy-to-use operating system with a ton of great built-in features.

How to Use This Book
This book focuses on the Solaris user experience, interweaving sections on
the Sun Common Desktop Environment (CDE), GNOME, and the command
line. For each, I use a slightly different approach to detail what you should
do at any given point.
When I talk about steps you need to take with a graphical application, you’ll
find screenshots of pop-up menus, the CDE taskbar, or similar, to ensure that
when you’re staring at your own computer, you know what you’re supposed
to do. 
Command-line utilities are a little easier: Your input to the command shell is
always shown in bold:
$ echo “this is a sample command output”
this is a sample command output
The first line (other than the $, which is the system prompt) is something
you type in. The second line, not in bold, is the output of the command.
Don’t try something other than what’s shown in the book until you’re more
confident in your skills. Failure to enter exactly what’s shown can sometimes
have unfortunate, or at least puzzling, results. For example, there’s a world of
difference between rm –f x* and rm –f x *. The former removes all files
that start with the letter x, whereas the latter removes all files in the current
directory! Just be careful, okay?
One additional tip: Some command lines are longer than what’ll fit in this
book — or even on the screen. Rather than have lines wrap willy-nilly, I use
the standard Unix trick of ending the partial line with a backslash followed by
Enter. Ensure that there’s never anything after the backslash on that line. For
example, look at the difference between the following two commands:
$ cat /usr/local/bin/myapp/data/hidden.data.file | \
> sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head –5
(output omitted for space)
$ cat /usr/local/bin/myapp/data/hidden.data.file | \   
ksh:  : command not found
Although you can’t see this, the second example has a trailing space after the
backslash, causing the shell to not only think there’s nothing else left to enter
(it didn’t use the > prompt for more input) but also look for a command called
(space character), which isn’t found. Hence you get the otherwise puzzling
error ksh: : command not found. Just pay attention, and it won’t be too
much of a problem!

Introduction

Solaris Installation: The Missing Topic?
This book diverges from most For Dummies computer titles in that it does not
include any information on Solaris installation and configuration. Unlike the
homebrew hacker ethos of the Linux world, Solaris is more straightforward in
its installation, and, more importantly, almost all Solaris systems are deployed
by a central system administration or information technology group. Solaris
users are uniquely shielded from the installation and configuration process. 
As a result, I’ve decided it’d be much more useful to jam as much user level
information in this book as humanly possible. Rather than spend 75 pages
nattering on about this configuration switch, that disk partitioning scheme,
and this other swap space allocation algorithm, you find out how to use
Solaris.
If you must install and configure your own Solaris system, the Sun installa-
tion package makes it a breeze, and the 385-page Solaris 9 Installation Guide
included with your Solaris 9 distribution does a good job of explaining how
to accomplish this task. If you really, really, really wish I would have included
some information on this topic, please let me know!
Speaking of missing topics, I also don’t cover programming, hacking into a
Solaris system, or advanced system administration and network configuration
topics. You can find plenty of great books on those topics, including Java 2 For
Dummies and Exploiting Security Holes For Fun and Profit For Dummies (just
kidding on that one).
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts, arranged to help you proceed logically in
your understanding of Solaris. The first few parts primarily focus on what
you can do and how to do it, and the later sections are on more advanced
topics, ending with a few chapters on important system administration and
security topics and the Part of Tens. This book is modular, so you can dig
into a specific part, find a topic, and just read that section to find out how to
accomplish something or work with a specific application. The index is a ter-
rific resource for jumping directly to a concept, program, or application!
Here’s a breakdown of the book:
4
Solaris 9 For Dummies 

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris
The computer’s sitting on your desk, staring at you. Now what? This first
part explores how to log in, and how to work with both the Common Desktop
Environment and the new GNOME environment. I also delve into the myster-
ies of the command shell, explore which of the many different shells are best
(my choice: Bash), and look at how to redirect input and output, feed the
output of one command to another with pipes, and even dabble a tiny bit
with shell scripts. This first part ends with an exploration of the different
file managers, file permissions, and compression utilities.
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section
Scott McNealy, the CEO of Sun, was the first to coin The Network Is the
Computer, so it’s no surprise that Sun systems have excellent, easy-to-use
Internet utilities. The first chapter of this part covers the true killer applica-
tion of the Internet, e-mail. This part continues by looking at the latest
version of Netscape’s venerable Navigator browser and then touches on a
worthy alternative, Mozilla. I then switch gears and look at how to build Web
pages in Solaris, run a Web server, and even analyze Web log files to see
who’s visiting and what they’re viewing. The last chapter considers ftp,
telnet, and the superior alternative ssh, the Secure Shell.
Part III: Becoming Productive with
StarOffice
Until recently, Solaris users faced a dilemma when working with office docu-
ments: Either buy a PC or Mac to run Microsoft Office or admit to your
colleagues that you couldn’t view the presentation, check the figures in the
spreadsheet, or proof the latest memo. This all changed when StarOffice
showed up on the scene. It has evolved into an excellent alternative, offering
complete compatibility with PC and Macintosh office applications. 
This succinct part introduces you to the key components of StarOffice, with
a particular emphasis on StarOffice Writer, the document processing system.
You get a good idea of the power and capabilities of StarOffice so you’ll be
ready to begin your own exploration.

Introduction

Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs
This part introduces you to the key command-line tools and GUI-based
applications for viewing files, analyzing file content, and editing files with vi,
CDE Text Editor, or the GNOME Text Editor. I also delve into some of the inter-
nals of Solaris to help you understand what processes are running and how
to inter-act with them or — if you’re feeling particularly aggressive — kill the
processes. The last chapter in the section discusses two commands near and
dear to every Solaris guru: find and grep. These are definitely worth knowing!
Part V: Administration and Security Issues
This part addresses something that may be beyond your individual responsi-
bility on your Solaris computer: system administration and security. However,
if something goes wrong on your computer, it’s your files that’ll be lost, cor-
rupted, or stolen. Whether you have a top-notch system administrator or not,
it’s wise to know something about how to keep your system running opti-
mally, with as many hatches battened down as possible.
The three chapters in this part explore different ways to hook a Solaris
system to an existing network, including the popular Dynamic Host Control
Protocol (DHCP) and the creaky Point-to-Point Protocol for modem access.
You also explore the Solaris Management Console and discover the proper
and safe way to stop your computer so you can unplug it.
Never just unplug your computer or flip the power switch to turn it off. Augh!
That’s the worst possible thing you can do to a Solaris system. 
Although I don’t explore Solaris security in depth, the last chapter in this part
offers a good overview of basic security techniques and concepts that can go
a long way towards improving the security of your system. It includes infor-
mation on what Internet services on your computer are potential security
holes and how to disable them.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part consists of three incredibly useful lists to ensure you can continue
your Solaris journey in safety and comfort — and, of course, keep your hands
inside the boat at all times for your own safety! 
The three lists are the Ten Best Solaris Web Sites, the Ten Key Security
Features in Solaris 9 (just in case you’re still running a previous version of
6
Solaris 9 For Dummies 

Solaris and need yet another reason to upgrade), and my favorite, the Ten
Great Free Add-Ons to Solaris.
Icons Used in This Book
This icon tells you that a pointed insight lies ahead that can save you time
and trouble as you use Solaris. For example, maybe learning how to type with
your toes would help increase your speed in entering commands and moving
the mouse at the same time. (And maybe not. . . .)
The Technical Stuff icon points out places where you may find more data
than information. Unless you’re really ready to find out more about Solaris —
much more — steer clear of these paragraphs the first time you read a given
section of the book.
This icon tells you how to stay out of trouble when living a little close to the
edge. Failure to heed its message may have disastrous consequences for you,
your drawing, your computer — and maybe even all three.
Remember when Spock put his hand over McCoy’s face and implanted a sug-
gestion in his brain that later saved Spock’s life? This icon is like that. Helpful
reminders of things you already know but that may not be right at the tip of
your brain . . . or whatever.
Stay in Touch!
With the help of the team at Dummies Press and my friends at Sun
Microsystems, I have done the best job I can of covering the most impor-
tant, interesting, and helpful facets of Solaris, but I don’t yet know you and
your unique skills, expertise, and interests. I’d love to hear from you, whether
you want to share brickbats, kudos, errata reports, or even funny Solaris
anecdotes.

T
he best place to start is almost always at the beginning. This book is no
different. This first chapter gives you a quick tour of the world of Solaris,
describing the evolution of the operating system, how Solaris 9 compares to
earlier versions of the operating system, and how Solaris compares to Unix,
Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
The hands-on part of this chapter focuses on the nuances of the login panel
and how to log in to the desktop environment of your choice. Once you’re
logged in, you’ll have a chance to start up a program and practice using the
mouse and keyboard, and then log out of the system safely.
Understanding Solaris Versions 
I’m going to travel back in time, just briefly, to the birth of the Unix operating
system. It’s 1969, at Bell Telephone Laboratories, and Ken Thompson and
Dennis Ritchie are interested in taking an old, unused computer and writing
a space exploration game called Spacewar. Problem is, the computer doesn’t
really have any sort of development environment. A few evolutionary steps
and Unix was born.
It’s no exaggeration to say that Unix has the Internet running through its
veins and that the Internet is unquestionably powered by Unix systems —

not just Unix, but Solaris. As Sun CEO Scott McNealy says in his foreword,
“Around 90% of all Internet traffic goes through a Solaris system.”
As Unix grew, it split into two different operating systems:
 System V (more commonly, SVR4, System V, Release 4) was based on the
development at Bell Telephone Labs (renamed AT&T Bell Labs, and now
a part of Lucent). 
 The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) flavor came from research and
software development efforts at the University of California, Berkeley.
Unix people refer to all the different versions of Unix, Linux, Solaris, and
so on as flavors of Unix. Think of ice cream, and you’ll smile every time
you hear this particular jargon!
Bay Area universities like UC Berkeley are important to the history of Sun
Microsystems, too:
 Sun head scientist Bill Joy was a star at Berkeley.
 Sun grew from a rival college, Stanford University. In fact, the name SUN
comes from Stanford University Network.
Andreas Bechtolsheim was a student at Stanford when he saw great potential
for computers designed to always have a network connection — a connection
to Stanford University Network. Stanford wasn’t too interested, so in 1982
Bechtolsheim convinced a couple of fellow Stanford grad students (Scott
McNealy and Vinod Khosla) and a friend from UC Berkeley (Bill Joy) to create
Sun Microsystems.
The first release of Sun’s operating system was called SunOS. The last version
of SunOS that was called SunOS by the Sun marketing team was SunOS 4.3.1.
Since then, the OS has been marketed as Solaris. 
All versions of Solaris also have the official moniker SunOS 2.x; the x is the
major release number of Solaris. (Yes, Sun went backwards from 4 to 2.) If
you want to impress someone who wears the Official Unix Suspenders, call
Solaris 9 by its other name, SunOS 2.9. (I’ve heard there’s a secret handshake,
too.)
Solaris 9 Features
Each release of Solaris adds to the strength and capabilities of the operating
system, typically for the key Sun customer running high-speed, high-demand
12
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

servers or complex multisystem networks. The most important additions to
Solaris with the release of Solaris 9 are 
 Linux compatibility
 Significant security enhancements
 A new Resource Manager tool
 A new directory server
 A volume manager and other file system enhancements
 An improved multithreaded library 
 Incremental improvements for installation and configuration
What you don’t see on the preceding list are user-level improvements. One
of the most exciting changes of Solaris 9 is the gradual transition of the Sun
graphical interface from the stale Common Desktop Environment to the excit-
ing new jazzy GNU Object Management Environment, also known as GNOME.
13
Chapter 1: Logging In and Poking Around
How Linux fits into the puzzle
Linux is a splinter variant, or flavor, of Unix cre-
ated because of frustration with legal
restrictions on Unix. Although AT&T freely dis-
tributed Unix to the research and commercial
community, it kept a tight rein on innovation.
Many software developers found the restric-
tions frustrating, so they started developing
operating systems like Unix.
 One group of programmers, led by the bril-
liant and eccentric Richard Stallman, began
rewriting a Unix-like operating system from
scratch for free distribution. That group was
GNU. (GNU stands for — I kid you not —
GNU’s Not Unix.) The GNU group developed
on expensive minicomputers and main-
frames, such as Sun Solaris computers.
 Other programmers really wanted a version
of Unix running on the low-cost Intel-based
IBM PC family of computers. They created
systems like Minix. Most importantly, Linus
Torvalds successfully wrote and distributed
Linux, his own Unix core kernel for Intel
computers.
Eventually, the GNU group (more commonly
known as the Free Software Foundation) and
the Linux group got together. Today’s Linux, with
all the bells and whistles, was created. Over 50
distributions of Linux are available today, most
notably from well-known distributors like Red
Hat and MandrakeSoft.
Linux has evolved to the point where it is impor-
tant for Sun to ensure strong Linux compatibility
(which is one of the major improvements in
Solaris 9) while focusing on the Solaris advan-
tages in security, performance, and scalability
within the Solaris/SPARC world.
If you want to read more about the history
of Sun Microsystems — it’s an exciting 
story — check out www.sun.com/about
sun/coinfo/history.html.

This book covers two graphical interfaces:
 Common Desktop Environment, for those users who are still in the
legacy world of CDE
 GNOME, for users ready to bravely step into the future of Solaris
By the release of Solaris 10, GNOME will be the primary graphical inter-
face for Solaris. That will be wonderful for all Solaris users, whether guru
system administrators or just plain folk trying to be productive and effi-
cient on a Sun SPARC-based computer.
If GNOME isn’t an option on your Solaris system, ask your system administra-
tor to install it. It’s available for easy download at www.sun.com/gnome/
Your Login Account
The first and perhaps most important step to use a Solaris system is to have
an account on the system. An account consists of
 A unique login name
 A secret password
 A home directory that you can fill with your files, pictures, and work
Login names are two to eight characters long. Your system administrator
should have notified you of your login name. Many organizations use one of
these login name formats: 
 First initial, last name (I’d be dtaylor)
 Last name only, unless there’s a name conflict (I’d be taylor or dtaylor)
 Nicknames, cute words, or whatever else you want (I might be author or
heydave) 
The initial password set up with your account probably is a simple word or a
random sequence of letters and digits. Both of those are bad passwords, as is
your car license, social security number, or any other public information.
The goal of a password is to protect the privacy and security of your account.
Anything that makes it easy to break in is bad. Anything that makes it hard is
good.
14
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Don’t write your password down and don’t share it with other people. Ever.
Here are the elements of a good password:
 It’s something you can remember. If you have to write it down, you’ve
just compromised the security of the password.
 It’s not a dictionary word or other simple combination of all lower-
case letters. Common password-cracking tools can spin through a
dictionary of words and obvious variations (backwards, for example) in
an hour or two.
 It’s not based on any easily identifiable personal information. If you
pick the name of your daughter, your mother’s maiden name, the license
of your current vehicle, or even your social security number, a deter-
mined hacker can figure it out.
 It’s longer, not shorter. Because passwords can only contain letters,
digits, and punctuation, each letter of the password can only have about
80 possible values. If you have a two-letter password, that’s only 6,400
possible values. If your password is seven characters long, over 2 billion
possible combinations exist!
 It consists of mixed letters, digits, and punctuation, not just letters. If
there are 2 billion possible seven-letter mixed letter/digit/punctuation
passwords, how many are there if you just use lowercase letters? Instead
of 807, you have a possible password space of only 267, many, many
fewer possibilities.
How do you invent a secure, memorable password? Try these strategies:
 Replace a letter with a punctuation character. Instead of using sparky
as a password, try Sp@rky! instead. It’s easy to remember and difficult to
guess.
 Take a phrase and create a password from the first letter of each
word. If you’re fanatical about all things Tolkien, you might take the
phrase one ring to rule them all and turn it into ortrta. Then add some
mixed (upper and lower) case, punctuation, and digits. A great, memo-
rable password would be OR+trta! It looks completely random but isn’t
if you know its derivation.
Don’t use the # character in your password. If not properly configured,
a Unix login program interprets # as a backspace. 
 Take a phrase and replace a word like for with a digit. The
Shakespearean phrase “Wherefore art thou, Romeo?” could be
shortened a bit and turned into wh4Rmeo? with very good results.
15
Chapter 1: Logging In and Poking Around

Adding punctuation is an easy way to increase security for any password. It’s
easy to start or end a password with !, ?, +, -, or &.
Working with the login panel
Enough chitchat. Log in!
When you turn on your Solaris system, you are presented with a blank screen
that contains the login panel.
The login panel confirms which computer you’ll be connecting to once you’re
logged in. 
If you’re impatient, you can type in your account name, press Enter, type in
your password, press Enter again, and log in, but first take a moment to see
what choices are available before you proceed. Patience, patience!
From left to right, the buttons along the bottom are 
 OK (which acts the same as if you’d pressed Enter on your keyboard)
 Start Over (if you get confused about where you are in the login process,
this’ll start you back at the beginning, ready for your account name)
 Options
 Help
Click the Help button, and you’ll see an informative reminder of the vari-
ous options available with the login panel, as shown in Figure 1-1.
The Options button of the login panel is where all the power of the screen is
hidden. Click it, and you’re presented with a range of alternatives:
 With a local connection, these items are on the Options menu:
• Language
• Session
• Remote Login
• Command Line Login
• Reset Login Screen
16
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 If you’re connected to a Solaris computer through the network, your
login is like Figure 1-2. (The remote login says “remote host aurora” to
tip you off: “aurora” is the name of the other system to which we’re con-
necting.) The Options menu on a remote login consists of these items: 
• Language
• Session
• Connect to Local Host 
Unlike Windows and other graphical environments, Solaris supports multiple
environments in a remarkably simple fashion. You can easily log in to a ses-
sion with GNOME running, give it a test drive, log out, change the Options➪
Session setting to the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), and log in again.
Poof — a completely different style of interacting with the environment.
Figure 1-1:
Help
available in
the login
panel.
17
Chapter 1: Logging In and Poking Around

All of these options are configurable, so your choices may be different from a
user in a different organization. On my system, for example, I have the follow-
ing list of available languages:
 POSIX
 Canada
 U.S.A.
 U.S.A. (Euro)
 Mexico — Spanish
 Canada — French
Your list may be different, depending on what languages are installed and
how your system is configured. 
It’s usually best not to change the default language. 
The most interesting of the options for logging in is changing the session, the
window manager, and the user environment. On a minimal Solaris 9 installa-
tion, you’ll have only CDE and Failsafe as choices, but on a full version you
should have these choices:
 Common Desktop Environment (CDE)
 GNOME 2.0 Desktop
 User’s Last Desktop
 Failsafe Session
By default, Solaris 9 logs you in to the session you most recently used on a
previous login. 
 If you’re a CDE nut, you can log in without checking the Session value.
Figure 1-2:
The remote
login panel
for Solaris 9.
18
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 If you’re interested in other desktop management environments, choosing
Options➪Session➪GNOME lets you try GNOME, and choosing Options➪
Session➪Common Desktop Environment puts you back in the older
legacy CDE environment. 
Chapter 2 addresses the differences between GNOME and CDE at length,
with lots of screen shots. You might want to preview that chapter before
doing too much experimentation.
Some installations are configured with even more sessions available, includ-
ing the K Desktop Environment, Motif, or even earlier versions of GNOME
(the latest is 2.0). If so, try them out when you have a few minutes to spare.
If you’d rather work in the raw, unadulterated Unix command line, skipping
windows, graphics, mice, and all that fancy jazz, you can choose Command
Line Login to shut down the windows environment temporarily. (This is only
an option on a local connection. If your configuration doesn’t have your dis-
play directly wired to the Sun computer, this won’t be a choice.)
The command line is a different sort of world. If you’re curious about the
many, many commands you can use at the command line, how they work,
and how you can use them for maximum efficiency on a Solaris computer,
please see Chapter 3.
Just log in already!
To log in to the Solaris system, follow these steps:
1. Enter your account name in the text box on the screen and then either
click the OK button or press Enter on your keyboard. 
Your account name (sometimes called login name) is case sensitive, so
make sure that you enter it exactly as given. Account name Taylor is not
the same as account name taylor in Solaris.
After you’ve successfully entered your account name, the login screen
changes to say “Welcome name,” and it reminds you what type of ses-
sion you have scheduled to start up, as shown in Figure 1-3.
2. Type in your password.
Your password isn’t echoed on the screen. This can be confusing when
you first start using a Solaris system, especially if your password is a
sequence of random letters, digits, and punctuation. It’s for your own
good. (Can’t you just hear your mother saying that?) You’re already
19
Chapter 1: Logging In and Poking Around

following good security by not writing down your password, so having it
in clear text on your computer screen where a passerby can see it is also
a bad idea.
If you enter the password incorrectly, the login panel informs you in a
pretty non-threatening way, giving you another chance to log in.
The password is case sensitive! If you’re having trouble logging in, make
sure that you don’t accidentally have the Caps Lock selected: It changes
the key sequence you’re sending.
If you can’t log in, call your system administrator for assistance.
Once you are successfully logged in, your screen will flash, the login window
will vanish, and you’ll see the splash screen and other parts of the window
manager you’ve selected appear as the system starts all the programs
needed.
Launching a Program
After you’ve logged in, a splash screen momentarily indicates what version of
CDE you’ve installed (probably Version 1.5). 
The results of the login depend on the windowing system you choose.
 If you start CDE, the startup screen shows the version of CDE, then quite
promptly switches to the default CDE view. 
Figure 1-3:
Continuing
the login
process.
20
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Although not glamorous or full of snazzy three-dimensional graphics,
CDE is quite functional and has a helpful control panel along the bottom
of the screen, making it easy to see what’s happening on your computer
(including the current time and system load). It’s also easy to launch
applications.
 If you start GNOME, the startup screen shows the launch of Metacity
(as shown in Figure 1-4).
GNOME starts lots of helper applications and has a transitional startup
screen called Metacity. On a Solaris system, it looks like Figure 1-4.
Watch the gradual progression of icons on your own screen as each
component of GNOME starts.
After all the components are running, GNOME takes over your window,
looking much more like Windows or the Macintosh than CDE does, as
shown in Figure 1-5.
Launching an application in CDE
If you’re running the Common Desktop Environment, you can launch applica-
tions by either of the following methods: 
 Finding them on one of the panels that emerge when you click on the top
edge above the icons on the control panel
 Typing the command into a terminal window at the command line
For the purposes of this first foray into CDE, click the globe in the lower-left
part of the control panel. It shows the current time, and it is the shortcut for
launching the Web browser. If your CDE configuration launches the browser
automatically, you’re ahead of the game and have saved an entire mouse
click.
After the browser starts up, it has a screen full of information about the plug-
ins and other configuration details.
After a few seconds, that vanishes, and your home page appears (probably
www.sun.com/). 
Congratulations! You’ve successfully logged in and launched a program
within the Common Desktop Environment.

Launching an application in GNOME
If you’ve opted for the world of GNOME, be assured that there aren’t little
people running around looking for geodes. It’s in a graphical environment
that should feel familiar if you’re used to Windows or Macintosh computers.
The little foot icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen is the GNOME
equivalent of the Start button in Windows. Click it, and a menu of choices
pops up.
As an example, choose Applications➪Games➪Gnometris to launch the
GNOME version of the computer game Tetris. 
Spend a few minutes playing Gnometris. It’s easy and also demonstrates
that moving from Windows or the Mac to the more powerful world of Solaris
doesn’t have to be all serious!
Logging Out
Whether you’re enjoying the simple legacy world of the Common Desktop
Environment or the more colorful modern graphical interface of GNOME, the
final task at the end of a workday is to log out of the system. You accomplish
this in different ways on different systems:
 CDE: Look for the small EXIT sign in the middle of the control panel.
Click it, and you’re asked if you really want to log out, as shown in 
Figure 1-6.
 GNOME: Log out by clicking the small computer screen with the little
moon icon on the lower left, just next to the GNOME footprint logo.
You’re asked if you want to log out., as shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-6:
Sure you
want to log
out of CDE?
23
Chapter 1: Logging In and Poking Around

Whether you’re using CDE or GNOME, click “yes” or “okay.” Everything shuts
down, the screen goes blank, and the login panel shows up again. The com-
puter is waiting for you or someone else to log in.
Done! Not too bad, was it?

to meet your needs, wants, and interests. Think of it as putting the per-
sonal into personal workstation.
The path you take depends on which desktop environment you’ve chosen.
This chapter explores the Common Desktop Environment, with an emphasis
on its powerful Control Panel, but focuses more on GNOME; it’s the future of
the Solaris environment. Either way, if you prefer a certain color scheme,
larger type, sound, or other changes, this chapter shows you how to make
those changes.
As with all subsequent chapters, log in to your Solaris system before you pro-
ceed with this material.
Digging Around in CDE
The most notable feature in the Common Desktop Environment is the large,
visually interesting Control Panel along the bottom of the screen, as shown in
Figure 2-1. It’s primarily a launch pad for applications. Almost every icon or
graphic that you click causes something to happen on your computer.

From left to right, these are the icons on the Control Panel:
 The butterfly represents the StarOffice components.
 The globe is a clock and launches the Netscape Web browser.
 The calendar page enables you to access a CDE calendar.
 The file cabinet offers a file and directory browser.
 The note with a pushpin and a pencil enables you to access the text
editor.
 The inbox is a shortcut to the e-mail client program.
 The small lock icon lets you lock your system if you leave it for any
amount of time. 
To unlock it, enter your account password.
 The four buttons labeled One, Two, Three, and Four represent four dif-
ferent workspaces, essentially four virtual computer monitors. 
This is a helpful feature because you don’t have any window overlap or
worries about the size of your monitor. For example, you can have the 
• Open files of a project in one workspace
• Your mail program in a second workspace
• A game running in a third workspace
• A fourth workspace available for other tasks
 To the right of the workspace buttons is a small icon of planet Earth.
Unlike the large Earth icon that launches Netscape Navigator, this
smaller icon opens a Go dialog box where you can type such infor-
mation as 
• Web site address
• Remote hostname
• e-mail address
 The small EXIT sign is the fast way to log out of the Common Desktop
Environment when you’re done for the day.
 The printer enables you to access the Solaris print management system.
Figure 2-1:
The CDE
Control
Panel.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 Next is a preferences area (a section I examine in closer detail later in
this chapter).
 The CPU disk icon enables you to access a CPU and disk usage monitor.
 The question mark icon enables you to access the online Sun document
library.
 The wastebasket, where you drag files that you don’t want to keep and
where you can also manage your trash, pulling out files that you
changed your mind about deleting.
Above each icon is a small button with a triangle pointing upwards. Clicking
this button opens a pop-up menu of choices in that category. 
The world of pop-ups
If you click the small rectangular button above the butterfly icon, a menu of
options slides up, as shown in Figure 2-2. Instead of pointing upwards (which
is a visual clue that there’s a menu underneath the button), the triangle now
points downward, indicating that clicking the same spot will close the menu
and change the triangle back to its initial state.
The Sun mouse has three buttons. In this book, unless stated otherwise,
always use the left mouse button to click things. The other two buttons are
primarily for copying and pasting.
Figure 2-2:
The
StarOffice
menu.
27
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

The menu stays open until you click the small triangle at the bottom. This is a
nice feature but can take some time getting used to if you’ve spent time using
Windows or Mac systems.
Figure 2-2 shows the StarOffice menu. StarOffice, included with the full Solaris 9
distribution, is a suite of terrific applications that give you the functionality of
Microsoft Office. StarOffice is covered in Part III of this book.
From this menu, you can launch 
 StarOffice central control area (the default item that’s highlighted in
Figure 2-2)
 Text document
 Spreadsheet
 Drawing palette
 Presentations 
 HTML (Web) document
 Templates
 File and configuration options for StarOffice
On the top left of this menu’s title bar is a small box that has what looks like a
dash or hyphen within. This is the window menu button. Click it to see a set of
options, as shown in Figure 2-3.
A variation of this window control menu shows up in almost all windows in
the CDE environment, though the options vary based on the application run-
ning in the window. For the Control Panel pop-up menu, the choices are 
 Restore: Restores the menu to full size. This option is grayed out in
Figure 2-3 because the menu is already restored — full size.
Figure 2-3:
The CDE
window

28
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 Move: Enables you to move the menu to your favorite spot on the screen.
Drag the menu to the desired location and then click the mouse to stick
it there.
 Lower: Doesn’t do anything in this context. 
Some applications support using Lower as a way to minimize the window
to a desktop icon (skip forward to Figure 2-5 to see desktop icon exam-
ples), but StarOffice does not let you minimize the floating menu, so
Lower won’t do anything here.
 Close: Closes the pop-up menu. The StarOffice menu slides neatly back
into the Control Panel, leaving things as they were in Figure 2-1.
If you click the window menu button in the top-left corner of the main Control
Panel (refer to Figure 2-1), you see similar choices, as shown in Figure 2-4:
 Restore (again, grayed out)
 Move
 Minimize
 Lower
 Refresh
 Log Out — enables you to quickly log out of the CDE environment
The most interesting option is Minimize. Poof! The Control Panel disappears,
and a small 1-x-1-inch icon appears in the top-left corner of the screen, as
shown on the right in Figure 2-5. The name One is the name of the current
workspace.
Figure 2-5:

29
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

This concept of minimizing, or iconifying, applications to get them out of the
way is a powerful aspect of the Unix environment because the application is
still running when minimized. You can minimize your Web browser (as shown
on the left in Figure 2-5), e-mail program, StarOffice applications, and any-
thing that you can run within CDE.
Clicking a minimized application opens another window menu (see Figure 2-6).
This time Restore is not grayed out. 
 Choose this option to change the icon to a full window again. 
 You can also restore iconified applications by double-clicking the icon.
For iconified applications, it’s helpful to see the expanded menu of options
for a regular program as compared to a special CDE application like the
Control Panel. Because Netscape Navigator is already iconified, that’s a good
place to start. 
Click the icon, and it changes, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Figure 2-6:

30
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

The Netscape icon name expands to show the name of the Web site that’s
currently loaded (Sun Microsystems, in this example).
Wandering through workspaces
The window menu options added for a regular application are
 Occupy Workspace
 Occupy All Workspaces
 Unoccupy Workspace (grayed out)
A workspace is a virtual computer screen available for use. The buttons One,
Two, Three, and Four represent the four workspaces.
To see how workspaces work, follow these steps to move the Netscape appli-
cation from Workspace One to Workspace Two:
1. Restore the Netscape window, as shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8:
The CDE
environment
Netscape

full size.
31
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

2. Click Two in the Control Panel to confirm that it’s a big, empty work-
space with no iconified applications, as shown in Figure 2-9.
It has a different background, so it’s not identical to Workspace One.
3. Click One in the Control Panel to return to Workspace One.
4. Click the window menu button in the top-left corner of the window to
reveal the window menu.
The options in the window menu are identical to Figure 2-7. In this case,
Restore is grayed out, and Minimize isn’t.
5. Choose Occupy Workspace.
You see the dialog box shown in Figure 2-10.
6. Select Two and click OK.
The application vanishes! Where did it go? To workspace Two, of course.
Click Two in the Control Panel, and you’ll find the wandering application
safe and sound.
Figure 2-9:
Workspace
Two with no
applications.
32
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Here are a few additional points to remember about workspaces:
 If you want an application to live in all workspaces, select the All
Workspaces check box in the Occupy Workspace dialog box.
 If you want an application in all but one workspace, use these steps:
1. Select All Workspaces in the Occupy Workspace dialog box. 
2. Jump to the workspace you want to exclude.
3. Choose Unoccupy Workspace from the window menu.
 To rename a workspace, use these steps:
1. Double-click the workspace name, which changes the color of the
icon and adds a cursor. 
2. Use the mouse to select the text 
3. Type a new name over the existing text. 
Change all four workspace names, and you might have something simi-
lar to Figure 2-11. (In Figure 2-11, the fourth workspace has been
selected, but no new name has been entered.)

names.
Figure 2-10:

Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

CDE remembers all of these customizations when you log out and log in
again. That’s what the message, “Your current session will be saved and
returned to upon your next login,” means when you log out of a CDE session.
Working with CDE windows
Clicking the top-left box on a CDE window produces a menu of options. Two
of these options are Minimize and Restore. 
Click the Text Editor icon (the piece of paper with the pushpin and the
pencil). A small edit window pops up, as shown in Figure 2-12.
On the top right, you see two boxes, one with a dot, and one with a large box: 
 The dot box is the Minimize button. Click it to minimize the application. 
 The box with the large square in it is the zoom box; click it to maximize
the application window, similar to the Microsoft Windows zoom feature.
More functionality is hidden in the window frame:
 To move the window: Click the title bar (where it says Text Editor), and
while holding down the mouse button, move the mouse. This is a simple
shortcut for moving windows in the Common Desktop Environment.
 To restore the window to full size: Double-click the title bar. Double-
click it again, and you’re back to the original small application window.
 To resize the window: Click carefully on one of the narrow edges of the
window and then move the mouse while holding the mouse button down.
This is a shortcut for resizing the window in that dimension. Click a
corner, and you can drag in two directions at the same time. You can
make a window any size and dimensions you want.
Most of this behavior is identical in Microsoft Windows. Try some of these
shortcuts next time you’re near a Windows 98, NT, or XP system.
Figure 2-12:
An empty
Text Editor
window.
34
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

The menu choices within the application window are controlled by the appli-
cation. File, Edit, Format, Options, and Help are all part of the Text Editor
application. The Text Editor is explored in Chapters 11 and 12.
Back to the Control Panel
This section takes a quick peek at a few other interesting menus that pop up
from the top edge of the Control Panel.
File Manager
One notable menu is the Applications menu. To open this menu, click the tri-
angle button just above the Text Editor icon. The choices shown in that menu
are 
 Text Note
 Text Editor
 Voice Note
 Applications
Click Applications to run the CDE File Manager, as shown in Figure 2-13. 
The folder opened by default is the applications and tools folder, causing File
Manager to label itself Application Manager instead. Underneath, it’s the CDE
File Manager.
Though not as glamorous as Windows and nowhere near as sexy as the puls-
ing three-dimensional look of Apple’s Mac OS X Aqua interface (let alone the
GNOME file manager, Nautilus), this is the basic file manager for the Common
Desktop Environment. Click a folder to open it. Click an application to launch
it. The name of the window is the name of the currently displayed folder.
Figure 2-13:
The CDE File
Manager
displaying
applications
and tools.
35
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

For example, click the Desktop_Apps icon in the top-left corner of the window.
The result is shown in Figure 2-14. You have 32 applications available to launch,
and a .. (go up) shortcut that takes you to the original Applications level.
The Control Panel is another way to access many of these applications. When
you click the globe clock, for example, you launch the Web Browser applica-
tion shown in Figure 2-14. Click the bookshelf with the question mark icon,
and you get the help viewer from this group.
To close the CDE File Manager, click the top-left box and choose Close from
the menu.
Style Manager
A more interesting area to explore is the CDE Style Manager. In the Control
Panel, click just above the Preferences icon (next to the printer) to open the
Tools menu, and then choose Desktop Controls. 
The resulting file manager window shows a variety of customization tools, as
shown in Figure 2-15.
The most useful choices here are
 Backdrop Style Manager, which makes it a breeze to change the wallpa-
per in any or all of the workspaces.
 Color Style Manager for picking different themes.
Figure 2-14:

36
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 Power Manager to customize when your system 
• Sleeps
• Spins down the hard disk
• Shuts off the display on inactivity
 Screen Style Manager to customize screen saver modules, as shown in
Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-16:

Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

In the Screen Style Manager, you 
• Select screen saver graphics
• Enable or disable having to enter a password when returning from
screen saver mode
• Access the Power Management features directly
The Common Desktop Environment Style Manager is automatically launched
when you select any of the customization tools, as shown in Figure 2-17. From
here, it’s easy to figure out how to customize your CDE environment for your
preferences and needs.
Go into the Color Style Manager and check out Mustard. It’s one of my
favorite color schemes for CDE. Then go to Backdrop and check out
Southwest. They’re a good combination of color and style.
If you want to change the number of workspaces in CDE, click Workspace
Manager Controls in the file manager window. You can choose from 1 to 50
workspaces. Select too many, and the Control Panel gets a bit wacky, as
shown in Figure 2-18!
There’s much more to customizing and using the Common Desktop
Environment than can be reasonably covered in this book, but the fundamen-
tal question is why? Sun Microsystems makes it clear that the future direction
of Solaris is with GNOME, covered in the next section. Although CDE will be
included for legacy support (“footdraggers who hate change”), CDE will be
less important as time passes.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

If CDE is your preferred windowing environment for Solaris 9, be prepared
for a big change. In fact, now’s a great time to get started! Ask your system
administrator to install GNOME if it’s not already part of your operating
system install. (System administrators can start by reading the latest infor-
mation and downloading the newest programs at www.sun.com/gnome/).
Then use it. Switch over. All CDE applications are still accessible within the
GNOME environment, and all the GNOME applications are there, too.
Getting Started with GNOME
By contrast with the CDE world, GNOME has a tendency to spread out and
use all the nooks and crannies of your desktop. 
Figure 2-19 shows GNOME, with a taskbar along the bottom and a menu bar
along the top of the window.
Figure 2-19:
The world of
GNOME.
39
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

Menu bar
Without changing the default settings, the main controls for GNOME are
along the top menu bar. The important details of the top menu bar are shown
in Figure 2-20 and described from left to right in the following list:
 The foot icon is the GNOME equivalent of the Apple icon on the
Macintosh. It’s the shortcut to the Applications menu, which enables
you to access all applications and functionality within GNOME.
 Adjacent to the Applications menu is the Actions menu, shown in
Figure 2-21. It enables you to 
• Run programs from a command line
• Search for files
• Take a screenshot
• Lock your screen
• Log out of GNOME
 The small house icon opens the Nautilus file manager at your home
directory.
 The tiny computer screen launches a terminal window for working at the
command line (as discussed in Chapter 3).
 The right side of the menu bar includes the following:
• The date and time.
• A small speaker icon for quick access to the audio controls within
GNOME.
Figure 2-21:
The GNOME
Actions
menu.
Figure 2-20:
The GNOME
menu bar.
40
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

• An icon showing the current application in the foreground. 
Known in the world of the X Window System as the application
with focus, it receives the information when you press keys on the
keyboard, and its window frame is usually a different color from
the others on the screen. Clicking the currently running applica-
tion icon shows all running applications, even those in different
workspaces. Figure 2-22 shows that three applications are running
in this workspace, and one in another.
Two different Netscapes are running in Figure 2-22, and the title of each Web
site being viewed is shown. This information is helpful when things are going
on simultaneously!
Taskbar
The taskbar at the bottom of the screen is useful even in the default configu-
ration. The taskbar shows which applications are running offering 
 An easy way to jump between applications
 Access to the Workspace Switcher
Figure 2-19 shows three applications running and a panel of small boxes on
the bottom right.
A closer look at the bottom-right corner of the taskbar is shown in Figure 2-23.
The small panel with six boxes is the GNOME version of workspaces; by
default, there are six. Because five are as-yet unpopulated in Figure 2-23,
they’re blank. (In the Common Desktop Environment, the default configura-
tion has four workspaces, initially labeled One, Two, Three, and Four.)

Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

To move to a workspace, click it. All your open applications vanish and move
to a new, clean desktop. You can start applications in each workspace and
move them between workspaces, but not quite as flexibly in GNOME as
within CDE: 
 A GNOME application can either run in either one workspace or all 
workspaces.
 CDE applications can be excluded from some workspaces and included
in others.
Customizing your taskbar
GNOME is easy to customize. Right-click just about anything, and you can
change it to your heart’s content.
Start by right-clicking the Workspace Switcher on the bottom right of the
taskbar. To change your Workspace Switcher preferences, choose Preferences.
The Workspace Switcher Preferences dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 2-24.
 To change the number of workspaces, enter the desired number in the
Number of Workspaces box.
 To change the name of a workspace, follow these steps:
1. Click the name in the Workspaces list on the right 
2. Type the new name.
3. Click the Show Workspace Names in the Switcher check box.
Click Close to close the preferences dialog box. Figure 2-25 shows a new,
improved Workspace Switcher.
Figure 2-24:

42
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Continuing to customize the taskbar, click the small vertical separator bar on
the far left of the taskbar. With your mouse button held down, move this bar
about two inches to the right so there’s a blank space to the left. Right-click
that blank space to see the menu of choices shown in Figure 2-26.
It’s easy to pick a few useful functions and add them to the left corner of the
GNOME taskbar. You have to re-launch the menu after each choice — that’s
just a right-click. For example, choose GNOME Menu, Log Out Button, and
Lock Button. The result is three small icons on the bottom-left corner, as
shown in Figure 2-27.
To change the order of icons, right-click an icon and choose Move from the
menu that pops up.

Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

I prefer to have the GNOME menu on the left, then the logout icon, and then
the lock icon. I also add a few shortcuts for commonly used programs:
Netscape and the terminal application. To add Netscape, for example, 
right-click on a blank spot and choose Add to Panel➪Launcher from
Menu➪Internet➪Netscape Web Browser.
You can also add or delete panels (menubars), because the same underlying
program controls the taskbar and the top menu. If you’d rather live in a more
Windows-like world, zap the top panel by right-clicking the menu and choos-
ing Delete This Panel; then customize the bottom to meet your preferences.
I like to add a weather monitor to either the taskbar or the menu bar. Just
Right-click a blank area and then choose Add to Panel➪Accessories➪Weather
Report.
By default, the weather is for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. If you’re not planning
a picnic in the Steel City, though, you can change the location with these
steps:
1. Right-click the little weather graphic and choose Preferences from
that menu.
The Weather Preferences dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-28.
2. Pick the appropriate city from the list (it’s organized by state) and
then click the General tab. 
This ensures that the default configuration is good — it usually is fine.
3. Click Close and right-click the weather forecast and choose Refresh
from the options.
Figure 2-28:
Customizing
the weather

44
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Now it’s your local weather forecast, updated every 30 minutes. Neat,
eh? And people say Solaris is dull!
The GNOME menu
Click the foot icon at either the top or bottom of your screen — depending on
how you configured things — and you’ll see a number of choices on the
Applications menu, including 
 Applications
 CDE Menu
 Run Program
 Search for Files
 Screenshot
 Lock Screen 
 Log Out
Of these, the CDE Menu is most worth mentioning because it offers access to
all CDE applications within the GNOME environment.
A neat trick!
This is one big reason why it’s easy for Common Desktop Environment users
to transition to GNOME. When running GNOME on Solaris, you have access
to all the great GNOME applications and still have easy legacy access to CDE
applications, too, all of which work fine. Figure 2-29 shows GNOME running
a typical CDE application, Text Editor, and also shows the CDE Menu➪
Applications list.
Not only do CDE applications run happily in GNOME, they look better and
more modern. Figure 2-29 shows the CDE Calculator in GNOME, which looks
nicer than in CDE.
The desktop menu
A hidden gem in GNOME is the menu that pops up on the main desktop area
when you right-click. The menu is shown in Figure 2-30. The following list
describes some of the options available from this menu:
45
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

 New Window: Opens a Nautilus file manager window with your home
directory shown. 
Nautilus is explored in depth, including day-to-day Nautilus tasks, in
Chapter 4.
 New Folder: Creates an unnamed folder, logically enough. You can
rename the folder by right-clicking the folder and choosing Rename.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 New Launcher: Enables you to tie a desktop icon to the invocation of a
specific program. Getting it to work properly is beyond the scope of this
book, so we’ll leave it alone.
 Clean Up by Name: A quick way to reorganize your desktop icons if
they’ve sprawled out of control. It’s analogous to the same function in
Windows.
 Disks: This submenu offers quick access to the floppy and CD-ROM
disks. 
Selecting a disk opens up Nautilus with the contents of the appropriate
device displayed. GNOME tries to show removable media on the desktop
automatically upon being inserted, but it doesn’t always work. This is a
fast and easy alternative.
 Change Desktop Background and Use Default Background: GNOME
includes several desktop backgrounds. It’s easy to change to a different
background picture or even a color or gradient.
1. Choose Change Desktop Background to access Background
Preferences.
2. Click the miniature version of the current desktop on the top left
to access a browser.
3. Move to either images or tiling_patterns to see your choices.
Figure 2-31 shows one of the images in the standard distribution
previewed. Nice!
One advantage that CDE has over GNOME is that you can have different desk-
top images for each workspace. In GNOME, workspaces share the background
Figure 2-31:
One of many
possible
desktop
images.
47
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

desktop image, which is one of the few disappointments for CDE users transi-
tioning into the brave new world of GNOME.
Customizing GNOME
You can poke around and tweak the visual characteristics of GNOME many
ways to meet your preferences, from weather forecasts to named work-
spaces, from duplicate GNOME menus to shortcuts for your favorite
applications. However, you can change a lot more under the proverbial hood of
the program.
Although you can reach each preference from the GNOME menu, stepping
through all the possible areas is awkward. A smarter way to accomplish this
is to click the Start Here map and compass icon on the desktop. This
launches a Nautilus file manager window, as shown in Figure 2-32.
Because this section focuses on GNOME, double-click Desktop Preferences.
You see the list of customizable elements shown in Figure 2-33. The icons that
list a certain number of items beneath the icon name (such as Advanced,
which lists 5 items) denote that those items are folders and that there are,
for example, five different items within the Advanced folder.
Ahhh. So many choices, so little time!
Start customizing by picking a different background:

48
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 Double-click the Background icon, and you’ll see the same Background
Preferences window you encounter from the desktop menu, as shown in
Figure 2-34. 
 To change the image, click the Select Picture box on the top left and nav-
igate to your preferred image.
Crazy pictures can seem fun, but simple, calm low-color background graphics
and solid colors offer the least invasive desktop for productive work. The best
choice is a gradient that gently transitions from one color to another; it’s
more attractive than a solid color background. Pick a gradient by following
these steps:
1. Click the white No Picture box.
Your desktop becomes, um, as pure as the driven snow.

49
Chapter 2: Graphical Window Managers

2. To change the background color, click the small Color button.
It opens a color chooser window, as shown in Figure 2-35.
3. To select a new color, click different spots on the color wheel or
within the color triangle, and then click OK to proceed.
You can go wild and have dark blue transitioning to bright pink, but a
nice low-key background can be a gradient from one dark color to
another, perhaps dark blue to dark purple.
Gradients can be oriented horizontally or vertically.
4. Click the Background Style pop-up menu, and you can choose from 
Solid Color
Horizontal Gradient
Vertical Gradient.
5. When everything is to your liking, click Close to make your change
permanent and return to the Desktop Preferences area.
Of fonts and mice
Two of the great improvements of modern graphical computing are 
 The ability to use a pointing device, like a mouse, for rapid and precise
cursor motion 
 The ability to change typefaces to improve the clarity and legibility of
information displayed on-screen
Choosing Typefaces
You can change the default typefaces used in applications and on the desk-
top, but you have less control in GNOME than in Windows or Macintosh

systems. Figure 2-36 shows the default font choices out of a relatively small
list accessible from the Font Preferences window.
Unless you have a strong desire to tweak things, I suggest leaving the
application and desktop fonts to their default values of sans 10 and sans 12,
respectively.
Sans means a sans-serif typeface. (Serifs are tiny feet on the bottom of letters.)
Sans-serif type is more readable on a computer screen. The text you’re read-
ing now in the book is in a serif typeface (like a newspaper) because it makes
letters this size easier to read when they’re printed on paper.
Running with Mouse Preferences
The mouse preferences are more interesting. Double-click Mouse in the
Desktop Preferences window to see the many ways you can customize the
mouse. Figure 2-37 shows both the Buttons and Motion tabs.
 Buttons tab: If you’re left-handed, you’ll be delighted by the first option
on the Buttons tab: Left-Handed Mouse. Choosing this option flips the
behavior of the left and right mouse buttons. The mouse will work better

with your left hand and ensure that no one else can use your system
without getting hopelessly befuddled!
 Cursors tab: This tab enables you to change cursors, but I don’t recom-
mend doing so.
 Motion tab: This tab enables you to customize the behavior of your
mouse. If you have a large screen, increasing the mouse acceleration is
often helpful and can save lots of dragging on-screen. Think of it as the
add/delete cat function (cat chases mouse, mouse goes faster, get it?).
When you’re done fine-tuning the behavior of your mouse, click Close to have
your changes take effect.
The rest of the preferences
Once you get up to speed with GNOME, one of the most enjoyable tasks is to
customize various facets of your workspace and desktop. 
Many additional preferences can make your workspace reflect your
personality.
Tweaking Menus and Toolbars
Menus & Toolbars enables you to change the Nautilus window, among others,
to look less like a Web browser (this visual similarity isn’t a coincidence, by
the way). 
If you’re working on a small screen, switching the toolbars to text-only can
save a lot of screen space in GNOME-controlled windows.
Listening for Sound Preferences
If you like audio feedback and aren’t in an office environment where people
will be annoyed by it, the Sound Preferences offer the ability to make GNOME
just as fun as a standard Windows configuration. You can get audio feedback
for such events as 
 Startup
 Shutdown
 Error messages
 Warnings 
52
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Make sure that you enable the sound server startup.
The Sound Events tab enables you to identify and fine-tune audio feedback
played for different events. Some Web sites have even more free sound sets
to download for the GNOME Sound Manager.
GUI Central, at www.guicentral.com/, is a great source for background
images, sound sets, screen savers, and lots of other Solaris system goodies.
Ensuring thematic consistency with Theme Preferences
The Theme Preferences window, shown in Figure 2-38, enables you to quickly
change colors and typefaces. What’s nice is that the changes occur instantly.
You can easily click each theme in the list to see how it looks.
If you really want to change the appearance of your GNOME Desktop, hop
onto the Internet. Freshmeat.net is a great place to download new themes to
make your GNOME experience fun. This developer site also has lots of techni-
cal content if you’re dying to know exactly what makes the wheels turn. Start
at themes.freshmeat.net/browse/930/ to see the themes organized in
categories. (Atomic is a great theme, particularly if you like green!)
By default GNOME makes a window your system’s focus (the window that
receives keyboard events and mouse clicks) when you click in the window. If
you prefer to have the focus change as soon as the mouse points at a window,
choose the Window Focus preference in the Desktop Preferences list.

ne of the most striking differences between the powerful Solaris operat-
ing system and Microsoft Windows is that Solaris has a crude but
tremendously powerful environment lurking underneath the pretty graphical
face. The Unix that’s the foundation of the Solaris operating system offers
hundreds of commands and thousands of options that can be combined in
millions of ways. Windows has, well, the DOS prompt.
For many Solaris users, the command line world is the interface of choice for
using the system. (I’m typing this chapter in the vi editor from a command
line, within a terminal program.) Although not as visually attractive or user
friendly as CDE or, especially, GNOME, the Solaris command line is a powerful
friend to have, whether you use it daily or once in a blue moon.
This chapter explores the basic idea of the command line and demonstrates
how to be most productive when faced with a % or $ prompt rather than a
window full of buttons, tabs, and icons.
Surviving the Command Line
To get to the command line, you need to launch a terminal program. You can
easily accomplish this in either CDE or GNOME:

 If you’re a Common Desktop Environment user, click the small rectangu-
lar region above the CPU and Disk performance graph to open the Hosts
menu, as shown in Figure 3-1. Choose This Host from the menu to open 
a terminal window, as shown in Figure 3-2. Now you can type in Unix
commands to your heart’s content.
 The path to finding a terminal in GNOME is trickier because it’s buried
deep in the menu path. Click the GNOME menu (the foot), and then
choose Applications➪System Tools➪Terminal, as shown in Figure 3-3. 
In a few seconds, a terminal window pops up on the GNOME desktop, 
as shown in Figure 3-4.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Think of the terminal as the wrapper. The program that runs within the 
terminal — the program that you interact with — is a command shell. Over a
dozen different shells exist in the Unix community. Solaris 9 ships with four
major choices:
 The ancient, primitive Bourne shell (sh)
 The Sun-favorite Korn shell (ksh)
 The powerful TENEX-inspired C shell (tcsh)
 The Bourne Again shell (bash)

Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

All shells follow the same concept. They’re empty vessels waiting for you to
type in an instruction and give them something to do. Leave them alone for a
weekend, and they’ll sit quietly, waiting for you to return and start typing.
When you type in a command, the shell invokes the specified program, feeds
it whatever input you enter, and sends its output to the terminal window.
For example, type ls, and the shell invokes the ls (list files) command, which
shows you what files are in the current directory. It looks like this:
$ ls
03.txt           Library   Perl:JS Complete    Uni Phoenix
Email Explained  Merrick  Shell Script Hacks  
The convention in this book is to show user input (what you type) in bold.
When faced with a $ prompt from the shell, type the letter l, and the letter s, and
then press Enter on your keyboard. The results won’t be the same as shown
here because you have different files and folders in your home directory.
After the shell finishes running a command, it prompts with another $ and
awaits the next instruction. (Of course, some shells use a different prompt:
csh uses % as its main prompt, for example.)
Leaving the shell
One of the most important commands to know is exit. It ends the terminal
program and lets you go back to the GUI world quickly and efficiently. Of
course, you can also simply switch the focus on your screen to another appli-
cation by moving the mouse and clicking in that window. Or you can
minimize the terminal window by clicking the Minimize button on the title
bar 
or choosing Minimize from the window menu. It’s okay to leave a terminal
running, even if you’re not currently using it.
Poking around the system
The Solaris file system is organized as a file tree, where your home directory
is located in /export/home, along with all other users on your system. You
can move up or down the file system tree at the command line. You can also
jump directly to other spots in the file system.
These are the commands to move around:
 pwd reveals your present working directory.
 cd changes the directory. Give cd a specific spot in the file system, and
it takes you there directly. Omit a specific spot, and it takes you back to
your home directory, wherever you are.
58
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

The commands work like this:
$ pwd
/export/home/taylor
$ cd /tmp
$ pwd
/tmp
$ cd
$ pwd
/export/home/taylor
The cd command on line three didn’t return any feedback to indicate that it
had successfully moved to the specified directory (/tmp). As is typical with
Unix commands, only an error generates output. When things work properly,
there is no output.
This lack of confirmation is one reason why the Solaris operating system
intimidates many users. There’s really no reason to be anxious. In fact, a
basic understanding of how to work with the shell can help you become a
power Solaris user!
When moving around, it’s useful to see what’s in a given location. That’s the
job of the ls command. Without any arguments, it displays the contents of
the current directory. Specify a directory, and it shows you what’s inside,
without taking you there:
$ ls
03.txt            Library   Perl:JS Complete    Solaris for Dummies

$ pwd
/export/home/taylor
$ ls /tmp
com.symantec.NAV_AP_LAUNCH.log          vi.zCGsqY
$ pwd
/export/home/taylor
The ls command can output its results in a variety of ways. You can change
the behavior of the program with command options, single-letter arguments
preceded by a single dash. For example, to see the files listed with their sizes,
use the -s flag to the ls command: 
$ ls -s
total 8

0 Library                 0 Shell Script Hacks
The -l flag has a different result, requesting the long output format for the
listing:
59
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

$ ls -l

drwxrwxrwx  26 taylor  staff   884 Oct 24 11:37 Uni Phoenix
This shows more of what’s going on with the contents of the home directory:
 The first column of the output (for example, “-rw-r—r—” for the file
“03.txt”) indicates the permissions of the file or directory. 
• If the first letter is a d, it’s a directory or folder. 
• - denotes a regular file or program.
 The third column shows the owner of the file or directory.
 The fifth column is either 
• Size of the file 
• Size of the folder’s directory
The size column of ls doesn’t show the summary size of the directory’s
contents. That’s generated by the du command.
 The sixth column shows the date the file or directory was last modified.
 The seventh column shows the name of the file.
To change to a specific directory, use the cd command and specify the direc-
tory by name. If the name has spaces in it, wrap the name in quotes, as
shown here:
$ cd “Solaris for Dummies”
$ pwd
/export/home/taylor/Solaris for Dummies
$ ls
539698-00.doc             539698-02.doc             Sync with TheBox
539698-01-Snaps           Older Material            Table of Contents.doc
539698-01.doc             SFD14 Snaps
539698-02-Snaps           SFD14.doc
A useful flag for the ls command is -F, which appends a / after each direc-
tory name so you can easily differentiate between files and directories in 
an ls output:
60
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

$ cd
$ ls -F
03.txt                    Merrick/                  Solaris for Dummies/
Email Explained/          Perl:JS Complete/         Uni Phoenix/
Library/                  Shell Script Hacks/
Now you can see that the home directory contains only one file — this 
chapter.
Many more command flags for ls are covered in depth in Chapter 4, if you’re
curious, but these three flags — -s, -l, and -F — are enough to explain how
flags work in Solaris.
Working with flags
Command flags should always appear after the command name and before
any filenames or directories you specify. Compare these examples:
 This form is valid:
ls -s /tmp
 This form is not valid and will generate an error message: 
ls /tmp -s
Where logical, you can also specify multiple flags at the same time as sepa-
rate arguments or all bunched together. The order in which you specify the
command flags counts only in rare situations. The following lines are func-
tionally identical:
ls -lF
ls -l -F
ls -F -l
Solaris is case sensitive. For example, ls and LS are not the same command. 
Be careful not to have the Caps Lock key down, which’ll change your input
and cause the Solaris system to get quite confused. Uppercase commands
almost never work at the shell.
Flags and filenames are also case sensitive, as with the ls command:
 A lowercase s shows the size of files.
 An uppercase F denotes directories with a trailing slash.
61
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

Some commands are oddballs that take full-word flags, not single-letter
abbreviations. The find command is the most commonly used of these 
commands. It’s common to see a command like this:
find . -name “*.c” -print
This is different from the typical Solaris flag usage. The find command and
its many usage options is covered more extensively in Chapter 14, giving you
an opportunity to truly master this powerful and helpful Solaris tool.
Wildcards
However, the asterisk (*) in the find command is one of a set of shell wild-
cards. Knowing how to work with shell wildcards can save you lots of typing.
There are two basic wildcard characters:
 matches zero or more characters.
 matches exactly one character.
You can use more than one wildcard in a pattern.
For example, an easy way to produce a long listing of all C source files is
ls *.c
If you want to limit that to files that start with the letter A, the correct 
pattern is
ls A*.c
To match a certain number of letters in the filename, ? comes into play. To
show all files that have exactly four letters in their names, you can use:
ls ????
The echo command is helpful for understanding how to work with shell wild-
cards because it expands as appropriate and lists the results:
$ echo *.c
cat.c dog.c long_filename_test.c
$ echo ???.c
cat.c dog.c
$ echo c*t*c
cat.c
62
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

The last echo example (echo c*t*c) works because it requests all files that
start with the letter c, have zero or more other characters, followed by a
letter t, followed by zero or more characters, and ending with a c.
Online documentation
For the graphical world, many documents are available to help you find out
more about Solaris, CDE, GNOME, and the like. The command line is not as
well documented. If you spend any time in the shell, the one super-important
command to know is man.
The Solaris documentation is divided into individual manual pages for each
command, all easily accessible with the man command. To find out more
about the echo command, for example, type this:
man echo
At the end of each page, press the spacebar to continue to the next page of
information, or type q to quit and go back to the shell prompt.
Because it’s impossible to always know which command is which, the man
command also has a -k flag for keyword searching. For example, use this to
discover which commands work with floppy disks:
$ man -k floppy
eject      eject (1)       - eject media such as CD-ROM and 
floppy from drive
fd         fd (7d)         - drivers for floppy disks and 
floppy disk controllers
fdc        fd (7d)         - drivers for floppy disks and 
floppy disk controllers
fdformat   fdformat (1)    - format floppy diskette or PCMCIA 
memory card
fdio       fdio (7i)       - floppy disk control operations
rmmount    rmmount (1m)    - removable media mounter for 
CD-ROM, floppy, Jaz drive, and 
others
volcheck   volcheck (1)    - checks for media in a drive and 
by default checks all floppy  
media
vold       vold (1m)       - Volume Management daemon to 
manage CD-ROM and floppy, 
ZIP/JAZ, and DVD-ROM devices
volmissing volmissing (1)  - notify user that volume 
requested is not in the CD-ROM 
or floppy drive
63
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

These results are a bit cryptic. They show the matching name, the matching
manual page entry name, and the one-line description of that command. In
the first example, the command eject is described as eject media such
as CD-ROM and floppy from drive.
The number in parentheses is the section of the online man page system
where the specific command was found. Here’s the lowdown on the different
sections:
 Section 1 is user commands.
 Sections 2 and 3 are for software developers.
 Section 4 is file formats.
 Section 5 is publicly accessible data files.
 Sections 7 and 8 are for system administrators.
A good place to start is by typing man intro at the command line.
Managing File Redirection
It’s useful to explore exactly how input for a command comes from the key-
board, and output goes to the screen, because this mechanism underlies
much of the power of the Unix command line.
Any command that’s run in the shell has two assigned I/O channels: standard
input and standard output. (They’re called stdin and stdout by the cognoscenti.)
They start out as the keyboard and the display screen (e.g., your monitor),
respectively, but you can change them depending on how you invoke the
command.
For example, you can save the output of a command to a file rather than 
display it on-screen. To do so, redirect stdout with the special > character,
followed by a new filename. The following command causes the output of 
the pwd command to be saved to a new file with the name my-present-
directory:
$ pwd > my-present-directory
You can verify this with a quick invocation of ls. The new file is included in
the output.
$ ls -sF

0 Library/                0 Shell Script Hacks/     8 my-present-directory
64
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

The > symbol causes the contents of the output file to be replaced, which
isn’t always the desired result. To append the results to the output file, not
replace it, use >> instead of >. The following command appends the results 
of the ls -l command to the existing output file from the pwd command:
$ ls -l >> my-present-directory
You can also change standard input with a similar redirection symbol, point-
ing the other way: <. Again, follow it with the name of the file you want to
replace stdin. Using the helpful wc (word count) command, here’s how you
can have it analyze the my-present-directory file:
$ wc < my-present-directory
11      91     600
The preceding output is a bit cryptic (typical Unix!). It shows the number of
lines, words, and characters in the specified file.
File redirection creates several challenges:
 What happens when you redirect the output to a file that already exists?
Depending on the settings of your shell, redirecting output to an existing
file can cause an error to be output instead, as demonstrated here:
$ ls > my-present-directory
my-present-directory: File exists.
Rather than stomp on what might be a useful file, the shell protects you
from your own zeal with this warning message.
 What happens when you want to append output to a file that doesn’t
exist?
An append can also generate an error instead of successfully finishing,
as demonstrated here:
$ ls >> doesnt-exist
doesnt-exist: No such file or directory.
Don’t disable this feature. Be safe. Ensure that you don’t want to keep the 
file in question, and then explicitly remove the file with the rm command if
it’s safe to delete. If you absolutely want to turn this behavior off, ask your
system administrator to help you disable the noclobber setting in your shell
configuration file.
The rm command is dangerous. Unlike Windows and Macintosh systems,
there’s no unrm or undelete capability. If you remove something with rm in the
shell, it’s gone, gone, gone. Note that this doesn’t apply to the GUI environ-
ment: in both CDE and GNOME, if you drag a file to the trashcan, you can still
retrieve it until you manually empty the trash.
65
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

Building Command Pipes
Unquestionably, the most powerful capability of the Solaris command line is
being able to easily build command pipes. By using a pipe (invoked by insert-
ing the ‘|’ symbol between two different commands), you can feed the output
of one program as the input to another. This is a tremendous addition to the
shell functionality, and well worth a detailed examination.
As a simple example, you can easily figure out how many files are in a large
directory by building a command pipe to do the job: couple the output of ls
to the input of the wc word count program:
$ ls /usr/bin | wc –l
575
As you can see, the | character is the magic incantation that enables Solaris
to hook input and output together. In the preceding example, a listing of the
files in /usr/bin is fed to the word count command, and the -l flag to wc
requests that only the number of lines are output, rather than lines, words,
and characters.
In less than a second, all 575 files in the /usr/bin directory are counted
(something you wouldn’t want to do by hand).
Here are a few key commands to use with pipes:
 grep lets you screen only those lines that match a specified pattern.
 sort lets you sort things alphabetically.
 tr lets you translate one set of characters for another on the input
stream.
 sed lets you substitute patterns in the pipeline data.
Finding matches with grep
grep is an oddly named command. You can think of it as match or find if you
want. (But there’s already a find in Solaris, so that might just be confusing.)
The basic use of grep is to produce only those lines in its input that match
the specified pattern. Typical grep usage is either grep pattern inputfile
or, as seen in this instance, grep pattern to search the input stream for
matches. To see which files in /usr/bin contain the letters sh, you could 
use this command:
66
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

$ ls /usr/bin | grep sh
bash
csh
glib-genmarshal
hash
jsh
ksh
pfcsh
pfksh
pfsh
remsh
rksh
rsh
sh
showrev
ssh
ssh-add
ssh-agent
ssh-keygen
tcsh
zsh
The preceding result can also be generated with ls /usr/bin/*sh*.
Here’s a slightly different example. It counts how many commands in
/usr/bin do not have the letter a as part of their name.
There’s no special wildcard pattern for the shell that does an exclusionary
pattern. It’s a perfect task for grep and the -v flag, which requests a “not”
match. The grep –v pattern only shows lines that do not have the specified
pattern, like this:
$ ls /usr/bin | grep –v a | wc –l
376
The preceding example is a three-command pipe. The output of ls is the input
of grep, and the output of grep is the input of wc.
For the next few examples, look at the text to Gulliver’s Travels, conveniently
saved as gullivers.travels.txt.
You can also download a copy of this story in text form from the Solaris For
Dummies Web site: www.intuitive.com/dummies/.
How many lines are in this file?
$ wc –l < gullivers.travels.txt
10064
67
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

That’s a long story! But of those 10,064 lines, how many have the word
Gulliver in them? It’s another job for grep:
$ grep –i gulliver < gullivers.travels.txt | wc –l
9
Amazingly few, eh? The -i flag to grep results in it ignoring the case in
matches. Gulliver and gulliver both match the specified pattern. Without 
the -i flag, there are no matches to gulliver as a pattern.
Here are the nine matches:
$ grep –i gulliver < gullivers.travels.txt
Gulliver’s Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my 
ancient and mother’s side. About three years ago, Mr.

that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied. But I was 
resolved
A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON
though earlier in the work, Redriff is said to have been 
Gulliver’s
One of the preceding matches is all uppercase, but the -i flag to grep caught
it anyway.
The following pipe is trickier: Screen out the occurrences of Gulliver’s from
the list of lines that contain the case-insensitive pattern ‘gulliver’:
$ grep -i gulliver < gullivers.travels.txt | grep -v “Gulliver’s”
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my

that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied. But I was

The same command can appear more than once in a pipeline, as in the pre-
ceding example.
68
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Changing text in the pipeline
Gulliver has always struck me as a funny name. I’ve wondered how it might
read as Miguel or Chin instead. With Solaris, you can test this with the sed
stream editor:
$ grep –i gulliver < gullivers.travels.txt | sed ‘s/Gulliver/Miguel/’
Miguel’s Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World

Definitely has a different vibe, doesn’t it? The all-capitalized GULLIVER didn’t
change because sed was only looking to substitute Miguel for Gulliver.
Instead of Miguel, what if in a perverse moment you decide you want to
change all occurrences of the letter l to an m? That’s easy to do, too:
$ grep -i gulliver < gullivers.travels.txt | tr ‘l’ ‘m’

The tr command can also remove specified letters from the input stream so
you can also quickly produce the shorthand version, Gllvr’s Trvls:
$ grep -i gulliver < gullivers.travels.txt | tr -d ‘aeiou’

Uppercase letters weren’t specified to tr, so they weren’t affected by the
translation.
More useful piped commands
Many pipes in Solaris have a very helpful part: wc. The wc command has
three possible flags: -w for words, -l for lines, and -c for characters. wc -l
only outputs lines, but wc -w can force just the number of words to be
shown:
$ wc –w < gullivers.travels.txt
104290
The final command to consider in a pipe is sort, which can sort alphabeti-
cally or numerically, ascending or descending.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 
But what’s the point?
Few people will monkey around with a novel like
Gulliver’s Travels on their Solaris box, so why
bother with all this stuff?
Because the capabilities demonstrated in this
example are quite powerful. If you have a series
of documents that reference a member of your
team, and the documents need to be identified
promptly, it’s much faster to use grep across a
directory of matching files than to laboriously
step through each possible file in StarOffice,
searching for the specified pattern. In addition
to removing vowels, tr can also easily trans-
late uppercase into lowercase, for example 
(tr ‘[A-Z]’ ‘[a-z]’). sed can make it a
breeze to correct the reference number in a set
of documents in a few seconds, rather than a
few hours.

Sorting Output
You’ve already seen that the -s flag to ls produces an indication of each file’s
size. Now sort that output and see what happens:
$ ls -sF | sort
0 539698-01-Snaps/
0 539698-02-Snaps/
0 539698-03-Snaps/

1136 gullivers.travels.txt
The directories are not useful information with their size indicated as zero.
You can screen them out with a grep command using a pattern of /$. (The $
is a special character that matches the end of the line, so this pattern only
matches lines where the / is the last character in the line):
$ ls -s | grep -v ‘/$’ | sort

Calculating disk usage
The du command shows disk usage for a given directory and any subdirecto-
ries, enabling you to see the size of directories. It is a perfect candidate for a
numeric sort, as shown here:

Does that look right to you? It shouldn’t. By default, sort considers the dic-
tionary order of entries. A line beginning with 1 comes before a line beginning
with 2, odd though that looks. The earlier sort of the ls -s output worked
because the numbers were prefaced by spaces so that they were right-
aligned. By lucky coincidence, it sorted as if they were numbers, but sort
was considering the lines only as dictionary-sorted strings.
To force sort to consider lines as numeric values, use the -n flag. Combined
with the -r flag to reverse the order of the sort, the output is now a listing of
files and folders, from largest to smallest:
$ du -s * | sort -rn

Korn versus Bash: Which Is Best?
A lot of power is available at the Solaris command line. And a number of
shells offer different interactive features. The grandfather of all shells is the
Bourne Shell, written by Steven Bourne at Bell Telephone Labs eons ago. It’s
good for simple scripts, but it’s not a user-friendly shell, lacking useful fea-
tures such as aliases, history, filename completion, and sophisticated control
structures.
From the seed of the Bourne Shell, over a dozen different shells, varying in
interactive features and programmability, have emerged. These are the most
popular:
 Bourne Again (/bin/bash)
In the Linux world, the Bourne Again Shell (bash) is the most popular
choice.
 Korn (/bin/ksh)
In the Solaris world, the Korn Shell (ksh) is the most popular choice.
73
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell
Shells left on the beach
When you have a couple of winners, you have
some also-rans. Whether their time has passed
or has not come to pass, these shells are
seldom used as login shell by Solaris users:
 Bourne (/bin/sh)
The grandfather of all shells. It’s good for
simple scripts, but not a very friendly user
shell, lacking useful features like aliases,
history, filename completion, and sophisti-
cated control structures.
 C (/bin/csh)
This is a graft of the C programming lan-
guage atop the Bourne Shell. Its
descendant Korn supersedes it and is a
better choice.
 Z (/bin/zsh)
This is an attempt to merge the best of 
the other shells into a coherent whole, but
it’s much less popular than the Korn 
and Bourne Again Shells in the Solaris 
community.

If you have a Linux system at home and a Solaris system at work, bash might
be a better shell choice shell; bash is the default with Linux systems, and it’s
available on Solaris 9. Korn Shell and the Bourne Again Shell both are fine
choices in the Solaris environment. The difference really comes into play if
you’re working in a multi-vendor environment. Whatever shell you choose, it’s
easier to use the same shell all the time. 
I use bash on all of my Unix and Unix-like systems, including Linux, Solaris,
and Mac OS X. This book uses bash for examples; none of them are different
for Korn Shell users.
One note: Solaris doesn’t let you change your own login shell; if you’d like to
switch to using Bash instead of the Korn Shell, you’ll need to ask your system
administrator to make the change. If you’re your own system administrator,
you can edit your account entry in the /etc/passwd file, changing /bin/ksh to
/bin/bash, or use the Solaris Management Console. See Chapter 16 for details.
Both the Korn Shell and the Bourne Again Shell have inherited such C Shell
features as job control, aliases, functions, and a command history. To this,
the Korn Shell and the Bourne Again Shell add:
 Command-line editing
This is critical to a useful and useable shell and saves vast amounts of
retyping commands to fine-tune your interaction.
 Integrated programming features including the incorporation of test,
echo, and getopt capabilities within the shell
 Additional programmatic control structures
 More sophisticated regular expressions
 Lots of environment variables to allow environment customization
74
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 
Which shell are you using?
To find out which shell you’re using is surpris-
ingly easy. Using the ps processor status
command, type the special shortcut $$ that
uniquely identifies your own shell in the operat-
ing system. The resulting information is the shell
you’re 
running:
$ ps -p $$
PID TTY   TIME CMD
3891 pts/6  0:00 bash
In this instance, the bash shell is responsible
for interpreting commands entered in the 
terminal.

 Security features
 Text manipulation facilities
 Additional built-in commands
Many of these features are important only if you’re developing scripts to run
in the shell environment itself — shell scripts — which is addressed briefly at
the end of this chapter. 
Korn Shell features
The Korn Shell has these features that are missing from the Bourne Again Shell:
 Floating point arithmetic.
 A more sophisticated pattern-matching language.
 Support for the += variable assignment operator.
 The –a flag to getopts is available.
Other differences are not significant for day-to-day use of the shell. 
Bourne Again Shell features
A few features in the Bourne Again Shell aren’t included in Korn Shell, but
they’re not important for casual shell usage:
 The prompt string PS1 can have dynamically expanded values like date,
current directory, hostname, and so on.
 The EMACS command history editing environment can be customized.
 You can remap keystrokes in vi command history editing mode.
Creating Aliases
A helpful way to refine your shell experience is to redefine commands to
include your favorite flags. You can even create new commands that have
more mnemonic names than the famously obscure Unix counterparts.
Fortunately, this is easy in the shell. The basic syntax is
alias command=”the specific Unix commands to run”
75
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

If you want the -F flag to always be specified when you run the ls command,
you can easily achieve this with:
alias ls=”ls –F”
Watch how this changes things:
$ ls
Dummies                      myspellscript
Mail                         nsmail
bin                          scripts
components                   snaps
errors                       test
gullivers.travels.txt        vnc-3.3.6-sparc_2.5
$ alias ls=”ls -F”
$ ls
Dummies/                      myspellscript*
Mail/                         nsmail/
bin/                          scripts/
components/                   snaps/
errors                        test
gullivers.travels.txt         vnc-3.3.6-sparc_2.5/
To find out what aliases you have defined, type alias without any qualifiers.
In both shells, the format for specifying an alias is identical.
 In the Bourne Again Shell, you’ll likely have just one defined alias, ls:
$ alias
alias ls=’ls -F’
 In the Korn Shell, about a half-dozen are already defined:
$ alias
autoload=’typeset -fu’
command=’command ‘
functions=’typeset -f’
history=’fc -l’
integer=’typeset -i’
local=typeset
ls=’ls -F’
nohup=’nohup ‘
r=’fc -e -’
stop=’kill -STOP’
suspend=’kill -STOP $$’
An alias like the redefined ls command only hangs around until you log out
or close the terminal window. To make it permanent, add it to your system.
The exact command depends on your shell:
76
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 If you’re using the Bourne Again Shell, enter this command: 
echo ‘alias ls=”ls –F” ‘ >> ~/.bashrc
 If you’re using the Korn Shell, enter this command: 
echo ‘alias ls=”ls –F”’ >> ~/.profile
Use the >> not > to append the alias to the end of the file. Don’t replace the
contents of your login file with the alias!
After you’ve added the alias to your file, launch a new terminal window and
type alias to confirm that the new, improved ls is available for use.
Advancing with Shell Scripts
Just as a commonly typed command can be turned into an alias to save time,
a sequence of commands can be dropped into a file and then saved as a shell
script for later use. Similar to Windows batch files, the different shells’ script-
ing environments are one area where the difference between ksh and bash
can sometimes matter.
The concept is straightforward. Say that every time you log in to your system
you want to check whether your friend Joan is logged in. To see everyone
who’s logged in, you’d use the who command. Because you’re only interested
in one user, Joan, this is a job for who and grep together, like this:
who | grep joan
Now I’ll make this a bit trickier. If it’s not a weekday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.,
you don’t want to check because you know that if she is logged in after hours,
it’s because she forgot to shut off her computer.
To determine the time, use the date command, with a special argument that
indicates that you’re only interested in the hour or the day of the week. You
specify the hour and day by using a special % notational format. You deter-
mine the hour of the day with date +%H and the day of the week date +%a
as shown:
$ date +%H
19
$ date +%a
Tue
You can use variables to assign a mnemonic name to values within scripts.
Create an hour and dayname variable like this:
77
Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell

hour=”`date +%H`”
dayname=”`date +%a`”
These variables can be used in conditional tests to see whether they’re a
value you want:
if [ $dayname != “Sat” –a $dayname != “Sun” ] ; then
if [ $hour –ge 9 –a $hour –le 17 ] ; then
it’s a weekday between 9 and 5
fi
fi
Read this as “if dayname isn’t Sat and dayname isn’t Sun, then . . .” and “if
hour is greater than or equal to 9 and hour is less than or equal to 17, then . . .”
All that’s left is to add the who command within the conditionals, and you
have a fully functional script that shows only if Joan is logged in if it’s a week-
day between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Here’s the entire script:
hour=”`date +%H`”
dayname=”`date +%a`”
if [ $dayname != “Sat” –a $dayname != “Sun” ] ; then
if [ $hour –ge 9 –a $hour –le 17 ] ; then
who | grep joan
fi
fi
This script isn’t something you’d want to type into the command line every
time you want to check if Joan’s online. It’s also too complex for an alias.
Instead, it’s a text file created with Text Editor, gedit, or even vi or emacs
(learn how to use both the command line-based text editor vi and the CDE
and GNOME text editors in Chapter 12 ) and saved to either your home direc-
tory or a subdirectory called bin in your home directory, with a mnemonic
name, perhaps joan or something similar.
To test if Joan’s online, you’d just type this to find out:
$ sh joan
Alternatively, mark the file as executable (with chmod +x joan) then you can
type in the script name directly on the command line:$ joan.

Chapter 3: Interacting with the Shell
The tip of the iceberg
Shell scripts are a remarkably complex topic. If
you need more information, the Sun documen-
tation suite is a good resource (start with the
AnswerBook material already included with the
Solaris operating system).
Learning how to write shell scripts is fun and
can help you customize your environment. It
can also make you more productive and effi-
cient when you delve into the world of the 
terminal program and the shell.
The next step in shell script mastery is to learn
more about functions, command flow, and 
variables, all of which are well explained in
Mastering Unix Shell Scripting, by Randal K.
Michael (Wiley). For more sophisticated exam-
ple scripts and a chance to learn by example
rather than explanation, my advanced Shell
Script Hacks (O’Reilly & Associates) is a very
good choice.

Managing Files and Directories
In This Chapter
 Managing your files and directories with File Manager and Nautilus
 Listings files at the Command Line with ls
 Understanding and changing File and Directory permissions
 Creating directories and Subdirectories
 Moving and copying files
 Compressing large files
Years ago, computer people talked about the “paperless office.” Although
it’s proven to be a bit of a myth (doesn’t your office still have lots of
paper laying around?), many documents have migrated online. In fact, a
modern Solaris desktop has analogs for quite a few different physical docu-
ment management systems, including file folders (directories), two-sided
printing to shrink documents (compression), and security mechanisms for
documents (file and directory permissions).
This chapter focuses on the key applications for managing your files and
directories — File Manager in the Common Desktop Environment and
Nautilus in GNOME — and shows keyboard equivalents for the shell com-
mand line. As always, the goal is to choose the environment that will enable
you to be efficient and productive.
Using File Manager and Nautilus
If you’ve spent any time on a Windows or Macintosh system, you have
worked with a file management system. The idea of clicking a directory and
having its contents shown as a set of clickable icons is an expected part of
interacting with a graphical desktop environment.
Whether you’re a CDE or GNOME aficionado, the graphical file manager is
one of the best-designed applications in Solaris. Many users more often use
the file manager than any other application because it offers an easy way to
explore the file system, rename files, move them from one directory to
another, make new directories, change file permissions, and much more.

The CDE File Manager
The CDE File Manager usually runs automatically after you’re logged in to the
CDE desktop. If it isn’t running, launch it by clicking the Home Folder icon
(the file cabinet) on the Control Panel. The icon is shown in Figure 4-1.
Exploring the File Manager window
The File Manager automatically displays your home directory, as shown in
Figure 4-2.
The top
Here’s a tour of the top of the File Manager window:
 Three menus are available within File Manager:
• File
• Selected 
• View

directory.
Figure 4-1:

82
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 The icons below the menus show you the path of the current directory.
The parent directories in Figure 4-2 are /, export, and home.
 A text box shows the directory path. In Figure 4-2, this path is /export/
home/taylor.
To change directories quickly, click in the current directory display box, type
in a new directory, and then press Enter. You’re whisked away to that direc-
tory without any fuss.
The main panel
The main panel of the window is the most interesting part. The view in Figure
4-2 shows 12 items; eight are directories. The first entry, .. (go up), is a spe-
cial entry because clicking it enables you to move up to the parent directory.
Double-clicking a directory such as Dummies moves you into that directory,
with the contents of that directory replacing the current set of icons.
The components directory icon in Figure 4-2 has a padlock. That means it’s a
read-only directory. It’s probably owned by CDE or another application.
Three files are shown in Figure 4-2:
 gullivers.travels.txt is a plain text file. It has tiny writing on its
icon to denote its content type.
 myspellscript is a shell script. A small seashell is superimposed on
the icon. The tiny box indicates what shell is required for the script. In
this case, it’s a B because the script is written for the Bourne Shell.
 test is an unknown format to File Manager, so it shows a generic plain
grey icon. The only thing you can conclude is that it’s not a directory.
The bottom
The bottom of the File Manager window indicates how many items are in the
directory and how many of those items are hidden. In Figure 4-2, 48 items are
in the directory (the home directory), and 36 are hidden.
Any file or directory name that starts with a period is a hidden item, so there
are 36 entries with names like .gnome and .bash_login. To see these dot
files (as they’re colloquially called), modify the Show Hidden Objects setting
on the View menu. By default, hidden files, are, well, hidden. Most of the time
you can safely ignore them.
Changing view and configuration settings
To access view and configuration settings, choose View➪View Options to
open the Set View Options dialog box, shown in Figure 4-3. Here’s a rundown
of some options in this dialog box:
83
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

 Headers: These are your options:
• Iconic Path: Select this option to show the current path as a series
of icons at the top of the File Manager.
• Text Path: Select this option to show the current path in a text box. 
• Message Line: Select this option to display how many entries are
in the current directory and how many are hidden.
 Representation: The default view is large informative icons that enable
you to quickly identify the content type. You can choose a name-only,
small icon, or full informational listing view format. Regardless of what
view you choose, you can change how icons are organized.
 Order: You’ll almost always stick with Alphabetically as the sort order.
You also have the option to sort by date (to see which files are newest)
or by size (to see which are largest).
Examining file properties and permissions
The Selected menu in File Manager is contextually sensitive (its contents
depend on what icon you’ve selected). Figure 4-4 shows the options with the
gullivers.travels.txt file selected.
This menu is the heart of the File Manager. You can move or copy files,
rename them, drop them into a workspace (that is, have them show up on
the desktop of the selected workspace), delete them, print them, or change
their properties.
Choosing the Properties option on the menu opens the File Properties dialog
box. This dialog box has two main views: Information and Permissions.
Information view
The Information view, shown in Figure 4-5, reveals such useful information
about the file as
Figure 4-3:
View
options in
the CDE File
Manager.
84
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

 Who owns it
 Which group owns it
This is the group ownership of the file, not the group that your account has
been assigned, that is, in addition to an owner, each file and directory in the
file system is assigned to a group, and this is showing us that datum. Usually
all your files will be owned by the group you’ve been assigned, but files and
directories beyond your own home directory have different owner and group
values as part of Solaris system security.
 The size of the file
 When it was last accessed
 When it was modified
Permissions view
The Permissions view is also important because it controls whether others
can read and even alter or delete your files and directories, as shown in
Figure 4-6.

Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

Solaris has a three-level permissions model for files and directories, with the
owner of the file, the group that the file is a part of, and the rest of the
accounts on the system (also known as other). Files can have any combina-
tion of read, write, or execute permission for each of the three possible
groups (owner, group, and other), for a combination of 27 different permis-
sions. Usually, you’ll stick to a few typical combinations, one of which is
shown in Figure 4-6:
 Read and write permission for the owner
 Read-only permission for other members of the group and everyone else
on the system
Execute permission is reserved for things that can be executed (run) by the
system, such as shell scripts and executable programs. You probably won’t
need to worry about execute permission for files. You’ll learn more about file
permissions and how to ensure that your private files are private and public
files are public later in this chapter.
In the Permissions view, you can apply changes to either the current file or
multiple files or directories. This is a quick shortcut to changing lots of file
permissions at once, but be sure to make these changes carefully. The
choices for the Apply Changes To option are
 This File Only
 All Files in the Parent Directory
 All Files in the Parent Directory and its Subdirectories
Working with GNOME’s Nautilus
The CDE File Manager is a capable program, but one of the gems of GNOME is
its equivalent program, the Nautilus file manager. To launch Nautilus, double-
click your home icon on the GNOME desktop. The Nautilus window is shown
in Figure 4-7.
Figure 4-6:
File
properties,
Permissions
view.
86
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Nautilus is more like the Windows and Macintosh file management displays,
which isn’t a big surprise because the programmers who created Nautilus
were from the Apple user interface team.
As you can see in Figure 4-7, each folder icon lists the number of items in that
folder, and each text icon has the first few words of the file’s text and lists the
file’s size. Like File Manager, different types of files have different icons. The
interface is similar to a Web browser, with Back, Forward, Up, Stop, Reload,
and Home buttons along the top, as well as a zoom feature with zoom in (+)
and zoom out (–) shortcuts on either side of the magnifying glass.
Adjacent to the zoom feature is a menu of view options. Your options are
View as Icons (the default), View as List, and View As. The View As option
enables you to customize views and change which icons are associated with
which file types.
To fine-tune the current view, choose from a variety of options on the View
menu, as shown in Figure 4-8.
Choose the Arrange Items options to customize how items are arranged in
the directory. Here are some of your choices:
 By Name, By Size, or By Modification Date: These options are identical
to those of the CDE File Manager.
 By Emblems: Emblems are unique to GNOME. They let you associate
files and directories with a graphical symbol.
Figure 4-7:
Nautilus, the
GNOME file
manager.

Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

To further explain GNOME Emblems, go directly to the Properties window for
the gullivers.travels.txt file. To change the properties of an individual
icon, you can either
 Select the icon and then choose Properties from the File menu.
 Right-click the icon and choose Properties from the pop-up menu that
appears.
Either way, you end up with the Properties dialog box shown in Figure 4-9.
The Properties dialog box has three views:
 The Basic view is shown in Figure 4-9. You can see the filename (which 
is editable), type, size, current location, and modification and access
times. You can also set a custom icon if you’re feeling creative or eager
to spice up the Nautilus display of your home directory.
 The Emblems view is shown in Figure 4-10. Emblems enable you to orga-
nize and categorize files just as a doctor might use colored dots on file
folders to denote certain characteristics about a patient. Some of the
emblems are just for fun (like the Oh No unhappy face), and others are
quite useful.
To see how this feature works, designate the gullivers.travels.txt
file as Cool: Click the check box adjacent to the Cool icon (the one 
with the sunglasses) and then click Close. Figure 4-12 shows the new
Nautilus view of the directory with the nifty sunglasses displayed on 
the gullivers.travels.txt file icon.

 The Permissions view, which is similar to the CDE File Manager, is
shown in Figure 4-11. The only important change is that if you’re a
member of more than one group, Nautilus makes it easy for you to
change the group associated with the specified file. To change settings
across all files in the same directory, you must select all the files before
launching the Properties dialog box.
Whether you opt for Nautilus and GNOME or File Manager and CDE, both
applications make it a breeze to move around the file system and manage
files and directories.

Listing Files with ls
By contrast with the attractive and easy-to-use graphical file managers, the
shell requires you to type in every request.
To get to the shell, you need a running terminal program:
 In CDE, select This Host from the Hosts menu (just above the perfor-
mance meter).
 In GNOME, right-click on the desktop background and then choose 
New Terminal.
Many of the file managers’ functions are accomplished on the command line
with the combination of ls for listing files and directories, cd for changing
directories, and pwd to show the current directory:

This output arranged the files and directories in alphabetical order, with the
contents sorted down the columns. To sort by date, use the -t option:
$ ls -t
snaps/                  vnc-3.3.6-sparc_2.5/    nsmail/
Mail/                   myspellscript*          scripts/

components/             gullivers.travels.txt
This output shows that the snaps directory was most recently accessed, and
test was least recently accessed. The ls command can’t sort by size, but you
can accomplish the same net result with a command like
ls –s | sort –rn
To find out more about a specific file, the -l flag offers more information.
Specify a directory, and the ls output will show you the information about
every file in that directory, like this:
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     592673 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt
In an abbreviated form, the file permissions are read and write for the owner
and read-only for the group and everyone else. (I address file permissions
fully in this chapter.) The file is owned by taylor, is assigned to group
other, is 592,673 bytes in size, and was last modified on 4 October at 16:31
(4:31 p.m.).
It might be more convenient to have this output across multiple lines in a
more readable format, but what would happen if you wanted to see permis-
sions for a bunch of files at once? It would take oodles of space. The -l
output to ls offers the same information succinctly, like this:
$ ls -l scripts

To see all the otherwise hidden dot files, the –a flag makes them all suddenly
visible, as in this new listing of the home directory:

By default, ls wants to show you what’s inside each directory specified on
the command line, as shown when I used the command ls –l scripts.
Want to see the scripts directory entry itself? Here’s where the -d flag to ls
is a valuable addition. It forces ls to show you directories, not their contents.
In the following example, the first command output (without the -d option)
shows the contents of the directory; the second command (with the -d
option) shows the directory entry, not its contents:
$ ls -l .

The combination of ls and cd enable you to move around in the file system.
Without any arguments, cd takes you directly to your home directory, a fail-
safe if things get too confusing.

Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Using and Changing Permissions
File and directory permissions are critical for being a successful Solaris user. 
Interpreting file permissions
File permissions are straightforward. The Solaris world has three classes of
users:
 Owner
 Group 
 Everyone else
Figure 4-13 illustrates the overlapping relationships between the user classes.
Figure 4-13:
The
concentric
circles of
access.
93
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories
Using file to ascertain file type
The file command tries its best to tell you
what kind of file you’re asking about:
$ file gullivers.travels.txt
test scripts/available.sh
gullivers.travels.txt:  English
text
test:           empty file
scripts/available.sh:   exe-
cutable shell script

The owner of the file is the center of everything, then the group, and, finally,
on the outside, the rest of the people who use and access the computer.
You’re the owner of all files you create, but you may not be the owner of
everything in your home directory. You probably won’t be either the owner
or in the group that owns system commands.
To better understand the nuances of file and directory permissions, dissect
the permissions string shown at the beginning of each line of ls –l output.
Start with the gullivers.travels.txt file, and then consider the ..
directory. It’s the directory that’s the parent of your home directory. 
The .. (go up) icon in File Manager represents the .. directory.
First, a simple file:
$ ls –l gullivers.travels.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     592673 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt
The file is owned by taylor, is a part of group other, and has the permis-
sions string -rw-r—r— . Figure 4-14 shows how to interpret this permissions
string properly.
Permission strings are always composed of a single letter that indicates
whether it’s a file (-) or a directory (d), followed by three letters that indicate
read, write, or execute permission for each of the three classes of owner,
group, and other. With gullivers.travels.txt, the permission string
denotes a regular file (the first character is -), with read and write permis-
sion for the owner (r and w, but not x in the next three characters), followed
by read-only permission (no w for write, no x for execute) for group and
other.
Here’s another example:
$ ls -ld ..
drwxr-xr-x   9 root     root         512 Dec 12 13:09 ../
Figure 4-14:
Deciphering
permission
strings.
94
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

This directory is owned by root and is also part of the group root. The per-
missions string is interpreted as a directory (the first character is d) with
read, write, and execute permission for the owner, but only read and execute
permission for group and other.
File permissions allow different operations. Some make sense, and others are
a bit weird:
 Read allows such operations as printing the file and using grep to
search the file for patterns.
 Write lets you change the file.
 Execute lets your shell run the file as if it were a program. This is only
for shell scripts or other software programs.
The preceding example shows that the owner (taylor) has read and write
access to the gullivers.travels.txt file. He can scan through it and
change it, as wanted. Members of the group other, and others on the system,
can only read the file. 
Permissions can change. If this were a private message, perhaps a memo to
the boss, it might have either of these permissions:
-rw----- grants read and write permission to the owner, but no access
to anyone else.
-rw-r--- grants read access to other members of the group, but no
access to the rest of the local Solaris user community.
Understanding directory permissions
Directory permissions are trickier than file permissions. Unix differentiates
between permission to see
 The list of directory entries (names of files and subdirectories)
 The content of the directory entries (the data in the files)
To see (list) the directory entries, you need read permission on the directory.
That permission doesn’t mean you can access the file’s contents, but you can
see that the file exists. Here’s a quick cheat:
95
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

 Read allows you to view the contents of the directory record but not the
contents of the directory itself. 
It’s an incredibly subtle difference. You can find the names of files in the
directory, but you can’t list them or access them in any manner. Almost
always, directories either have both read and execute permission, or 
neither.
 Write allows you to 
• Delete entries from the directory
• Modify files through editing or appending data
• Delete files
If read and execute permissions are denied, you’ll need to already know
the name of the file to accomplish these tasks. You’ll never encounter a
directory with write-only permission.
 Execute allows you to view the contents of the directory if you already
know its name. 
If you don’t and you can’t read the directory contents (read permission)
then you can’t list the contents of the directory to find out what’s inside.
Almost always, directories either have both read and execute permission,
or neither.
To demonstrate the nuances of different directory permissions, use the
chmod (change permission mode) command, which is explained in detail in
the next section:
$ ls -ld scripts
drw-r--r--   2 taylor  other  512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
$ ls scripts
scripts/available.sh: Permission denied
scripts/myquota.sh: Permission denied
scripts/lotsofparams.sh: Permission denied
scripts/junk.sh: Permission denied
scripts/changepositional.sh: Permission denied
scripts/DIR.sh: Permission denied
scripts/validate.sh: Permission denied
scripts/normdate.sh: Permission denied
Read-only permission on the directory enables you to see information about
the directory itself, but doesn’t give you permission to see any information
about each entry. You can, puzzlingly, see an error for each filename and
therefore extrapolate the filenames therein. Does this mean you can list those
files, though? No:
$ ls -l scripts/available.sh
scripts/available.sh: Permission denied
96
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

Now change permissions to have execute but not read permission. The
results are just as peculiar:
$ chmod a-r scripts
$ chmod a+x scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
d-wx--x--x 2 taylor  other    512 Oct 4  16:31 scripts/
$ ls –l scripts
scripts: Permission denied
$ ls -l scripts/available.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 taylor  other    240 Oct 4  16:31 scripts/available.sh
With read-only permission, you can view the individual contents of a direc-
tory, but you cannot view the directory contents itself.
If this makes about as much sense as a fish on a bicycle, the good news is
that you really don’t have to worry about this too much. By convention, Unix
people either set both read and execute, or neither.
A couple of common permission strings are really useful:
 To create a directory where you can make whatever changes, deletions,
and additions you want, but keep it from prying eyes, a good permission
string would be rwx------.
 Want to let other people in your group see the directory but not change
its contents? Use rwxr-x--- to accomplish the job.
Changing permissions with chmod
The chmod command changes permissions. These are the most important and
most common permission modes.
You can use this command a couple of ways, the easiest of which is a
mnemonic equation (yes, it really is the easiest!). You must assemble the
string from all three of these sets of options:
 One of these user specifications:
u (user)
g (group)
o (other; everyone who isn’t the owner and isn’t in the group that owns
the file or directory)
a (all, a shorthand way to specify user + group + other)
97
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

 One of these modifier options:
+ (add)
- (remove)
= (make exactly)
 One or more of these permissions:
r (read)
w (write)
x (execute)
 To add write permission for the user, use u+w. 
 To remove write permission from group and other, use either of the 
following pairs of equations, separated by a comma: 
go-w 
g-w,o-w
 To turn off all permissions, specify 0
Here are a few examples:
 In the following example, chmod 0 turns off all permissions for anyone,
making this a very secure directory: Even the owner can’t see what’s
inside.
$ ls -ld scripts
drwxr-xr-x   2 taylor   other        512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
$ chmod 0 scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
d---------   2 taylor   other        512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
 In one somewhat complex call to chmod, the following example adds
read, write, and execute permission for the user, and read and execute
permissions to group. 
$ chmod u+rwx,g+rx scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
drwxr-x---   2 taylor   other        512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
 This example gives everyone else read and write permission:
$ chmod o+rw scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
drwxr-xrw-  2 taylor   other        512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
 When everyone on the system has been granted different permission to
access this directory, you can alter the permission to have the file mode
a bit more normal with this example:
98
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

$ chmod a-w scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
dr-xr-xr--   2 taylor   other        512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
$ chmod u+w,o+x scripts
$ ls -ld scripts
drwxr-xr-x   2 taylor   other        512 Oct  4 16:31 scripts/
You can change the permission on lots of files at the same time with a shell
wildcard. For example, chmod go-rw * takes away read or write capabil-
ities to group or everyone else for each file and directory matched by the *
wildcard.
Making Directories
To make new directories, use the mkdir command. If you have write permis-
sion in your current directory and the requested directory name doesn’t yet
exist, you can create a new directory with the command:
$ mkdir newdir
$ ls -ld newdir
drwxr-xr-x   2 taylor   other        512 Dec 18 17:43 newdir/
By default, the permissions of newly created directories give you read, write,
and execute permission and everyone else read and execute permission. As
expected, the new directory is owned by taylor, the person who created it.
You can change the default permissions of newly created files and directories
by altering your umask setting. See the man page for more information.
What if you don’t have write permission in the current directory? The mkdir
command fails, of course:
$ mkdir /mydir
mkdir: Failed to make directory “/mydir”; Permission denied
$ ls -ld /
drwxr-xr-x  44 root     root        1536 Dec 14 15:26 //
To confirm your user ID (which is the same as your account name) and pri-
mary group membership, use the id command. To get a list of all groups
you’re in, use the groups command:
$ id
uid=100(taylor) gid=1(other)
$ groups
other
99
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

In the preceding example, the / directory has write permission for its owner,
root, but only read and execute permission for everyone else, hence the
error.
Try to make a directory that already exists, and you’ll see a slightly different
error:
$ mkdir newdir
mkdir: Failed to make directory “newdir”; File exists
To remove a directory, use rmdir. (For your protection, rmdir only removes
empty directories. )
Moving and Copying Files
The two commands explored in this section allow you to gain control over
which files live where. 
Absolute control of file copying is surprisingly difficult to accomplish on a
GUI-based interface. Sometimes, dragging an icon to a new directory moves
the file; other times, it copies the file. 
On the command line, you have more precise control: to move files, use mv,
and to copy files, use cp.
Copying files with cp
Using the command line, you can copy files just as easily as you can in the
File Manager or Nautilus:
cp gullivers.travels.txt newdir
This creates a copy of the gullivers.travels.txt file in the directory
newdir, with the same name:
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt newdir
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     592673 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt
newdir:
total 1184
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     592673 Dec 18 18:06 gullivers.travels.txt
100
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

These are two distinct copies of the file, though they are identical. If newdir
didn’t exist, however, the cp command would have created a copy of the
gullivers.travels.txt file called newdir, which would doubtless be 
confusing.
To copy a file to a new area of the file system, use a directory path along with
a filename:
cp gullivers.travels.txt /tmp/swift.txt
This copies the file into the /tmp directory and renames it swift.txt at the
same time.
Where the shell shines is when you want to copy a group of files. To copy
everything from the current directory into newdir, use:
cp * newdir
To copy just those files that have the .txt filename suffix, use
cp *.txt newdir
Moving files to new directories with mv
The mv command works similarly, the only difference being that a copy of the
file isn’t left upon completion, of course. What might not be obvious is that
the mv command is also the Unix rename function. To rename gullivers.
travels.txt in the current directory, for example, the following command
does the trick:
mv gullivers.travels.txt swift.txt
With both commands, you can ensure a slightly safer operation by adding a -
i flag, which blocks the command from overwriting an existing file:
$ cp -i test gullivers.travels.txt
cp: overwrite gullivers.travels.txt (yes/no)? no
If you like that capability, create two aliases that make it an automatic part of
your future interaction with the shell:
alias mv=”mv –i”
alias cp=”cp –i”
101
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

You can find out more about aliases in Chapter 3.
To remove a file, use rm.
Solaris doesn’t have any sort of undelete or unrm function. After the file or
directory is deleted, it’s gone.
Compressing Big Files
Running out of disk space is a constant concern for Solaris users. As with 
any computer operating system, Solaris likes to take lots of space to run 
efficiently and maintain a historical archive of activity. (Unix folk call these
archives logs or log files.)
As a result, many Solaris installations have system administrators who pay
very close attention to individual disk usage and might even have set up a
quota for your personal disk space. Type the following to see if you have a
quota set up:
$ quota -v
Disk quotas for taylor (uid 100):
Filesystem     usage  quota  limit    timeleft  files  quota  limit    timeleft
In the preceding example, there’s no quota, which you can determine by the
lack of data after the column headers. (Yes, Unix isn’t always friendly!)
Whether or not you have a disk space quota, if you have large data files or
graphics that you don’t need for a while, it’s good manners to compress
these large files so there’s more free disk space for other files.
You can compress files in Solaris 9 three ways:
 compress
 gzip
 bzip2
They all do the same basic task. Give them a big file, and they shrink it down
to a smaller file. Which one works best? The difference is more historical:
bzip2 tends to do the best job of compression and it’s also the newest of the
three.
In general, bzip2 is best. Sometimes gzip or compress shrink a file further. 
102
Part I: Getting Acquainted with Solaris 

All three of these compression tools are zero loss compression systems.
Whatever you compress, the restored original will be identical to the file you
started with, whether it’s a JPEG graphic, a StarOffice .doc file, or a humble
.txt file.
The following example compresses the gullivers.travels.txt file with
each tool and shows the size of the compressed file:
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     592673 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt
$ compress -v gullivers.travels.txt
gullivers.travels.txt: Compression: 59.32% -- replaced with
gullivers.travels.txt.Z
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt.Z
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     241071 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt.Z
The example shows which compression tool saves the most disk space. The
compress utility saved almost 60% of the disk space, shrinking down the
592,673 byte file to only 241,071 bytes. The newly compressed file has a .Z
suffix added, which indicates that it’s been compressed with compress. 
Follow these rules to name and recognize compressed files:
.
Z is a compress file
.gz is a gzip file
.bz2 is a bzip2 file
To restore a file that’s been shrunk with compress, use the uncompress
command:
$ uncompress gullivers.travels.txt.Z
Compressing a file with gzip is accomplished in a manner identical to the
compress command:
$ gzip -v gullivers.travels.txt
gullivers.travels.txt:   62.3% -- replaced with gullivers.travels.txt.gz
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     223139 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt.gz
Not bad, it’s even a little smaller. This time the newly compressed file has a
.gz suffix, indicating that it has been compressed with gzip. To uncompress
a gzip file, use gunzip. Then compress it one more time, with the more 
powerful bzip2 program:
103
Chapter 4: Managing Files and Directories

$ gunzip gullivers.travels.txt.gz
$ bzip2 -v gullivers.travels.txt
gullivers.travels.txt:  3.589:1,  2.229 bits/byte, 72.14% saved, 592673 in,
165126 out.
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt.bz2
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     165126 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt.bz2
This compression tool has done the best job, shrinking the file considerably
more than the two alternatives. This time, the filename suffix is .bz2, and the
tool to uncompress it is bunzip2:
$ bunzip2 gullivers.travels.txt.bz2
With any luck, the file ends up the same size:
$ ls -l gullivers.travels.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other     592673 Oct  4 16:31 gullivers.travels.txt

In this part . . .
W
ith a Sun computer, The Network really is The
Computer. It’s no surprise at all that Sun systems
have excellent and quite easy-to-use Internet utilities.
Starting with a chapter on the true killer application of the
Internet, email, this part continues by looking at the latest
version of Netscape’s venerable Navigator browser and
then touches on a worthy alternative, Mozilla. We then
switch gears and look at how to build Web pages in
Solaris, run a Web server, and even analyze Web log ﬁles
to see who is visiting and what they’re viewing. The last
chapter considers ftp, telnet and the superior alternative
to both, ssh, the secure shell.

Doin’ That E-Mail Thing
In This Chapter
 Working with CDE’s Mailer
 Using Netscape Messenger for e-mail
 Reading and sending e-mail at the command line
E
-mail enables users to instantaneously communicate with family and
friends throughout the world. E-mail is the so-called killer app of the
Internet.
From its humble beginnings in the 1970s in the Unix community, e-mail has
become the main reason many folks are connected to the Internet. Because
Sun has always believed the network is the computer, it’s no surprise that
Solaris includes a number of different e-mail applications.
You may also want to check out some wonderful graphical and command-
line-based mail programs that aren’t included in the standard Solaris 9
distribution. If you’re interested, ask your system administrator to download
these free alternative applications that are ready to go on Solaris 9.
Regardless of which mail program you choose, sending and receiving e-mail
is a “killer skill” for anyone using the computer. This chapter offers an intro-
duction to working with e-mail from all three major environments: the
command line, the Common Desktop Environment, and GNOME.
Getting to Know Mailer
Within the Common Desktop Environment, Mailer is the only mail program.
Easily accessible from the Control Panel (click the inbox icon), it’s likely that
the program will launch the first time without any inbox or configuration, as
shown in Figure 5-1.

Configuring the program
To configure the program, choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox. This opens the
dialog box shown in Figure 5-2.
You can set up a local mailbox, as discussed in this section, but Mailer will
probably automatically recognize a local mailbox without any additional
effort.
An IMAP connection
Many Solaris users have their mail centrally stored on an IMAP server. 
To configure an IMAP connection, click the IMAP Server button near the top
of the configuration dialog box. This opens the IMAP configuration dialog
box, shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-1:
Mailer 
with no
messages.
108
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

 Password: If you’re concerned about security, you don’t have to enter
your password in this dialog box. Mailer will prompt you for a password
each time it checks your incoming mailbox.
 Retrieve Attachments: You have the option to retrieve attachments
automatically, or leave these potentially large additions on the server
until you determine whether they’re worth downloading. 
On most systems, your connection to the mail server is sufficiently
speedy that there’s rarely any visible slowdown for retrieving all attach-
ments. You can configure this option either way without a problem.
E-mail within Solaris is less susceptible to viruses than Windows pro-
grams — a reason to cheer, and a reason to be less paranoid about the
possible dangers lurking in e-mail attachments.

configura-
tion dialog
box.

109
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

Using a local mailbox instead
If you don’t have an IMAP account, you can specify your mailbox with these
steps: 
1. Click Local in the configuration dialog box. 
2. Search for the specific mailbox in question, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Viewing the mailbox
After the mailbox is identified, the program 
 Opens the mailbox
 Scans through all the messages
 Presents an attractive and easy to navigate view of all the messages, as
shown in Figure 5-5.
In this default mailbox view, here’s what you see:
 The top pane is a table of contents of all messages.
 The middle area shows 
• A summary of the mailbox 
• A set of control elements
The mailbox in Figure 5-5 contains 575 messages and message 568 is cur-
rently shown.
From left to right, the Mailer toolbar contains these controls:
Figure 5-4:
Finding a
local
mailbox.
110
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

• Delete
• Move down the list to the next message
• Move up the list to the previous message
• Reply
• Forward
• Compose a new e-mail message
• Print message
 The bottom pane of the window is the specific message in question, for-
matted in an attractive manner.
In the top pane, each message lists 
 Sender
 Subject
 Date and time sent
 Size 
Mailer offers other sophisticated display options:
Figure 5-5:
Viewing a
mailbox in
Mailer.
111
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

 An optional status indicator of a diamond or N indicates new messages. 
 By default, the message list pane sorts the messages by date sent, oldest
to newest.
 The message view window shows almost all headers in an e-mail mes-
sage, screening out a few by default. If you want to hide more of the
headers (such as X-UIDL and MIME-Version), search for message view
preferences in the Help system (see the top-right corner of the Mailer
menu bar).
 Mailer doesn’t understand how to display messages using fancy format-
ting (typically HTML). If you receive lots of newsletters from Web sites,
some messages may be unreadable in Mailer. Mailer recognizes and acti-
vates all Web site addresses it encounters in messages: In Figure 5-5, the
URL for the Frontier Airlines Web site is in a different color. Click that,
and the site opens in the Web browser.
 If the message has an attachment, the bottom pane shows the attach-
ment in icon form, indicating the file’s 
• Name 
• Type
 Right-click on the attachment to see a variety of options for the file
processes: 
• Saving
• Opening
• Editing 
In Figure 5-5, Mailer recognizes an HTML format attachment and displays it.
Changing the sorting order
You can organize your message display in several ways:
 The default setting of sorting messages from oldest to newest is usually
a good choice. 
 If you want to sort the messages by sender, subject, and so on, click the
View menu, as shown in Figure 5-6.
If your mailbox contains a ton of messages, it may be useful to sort the mes-
sages by sender and then select all of those messages and save them in a new
mailbox for that sender: 
1. Right-click the set of selected messages. 
2. Choose the option to save to a new mailbox.
112
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

Sending mail
Sending mail and responding to messages from others are the two most
common Mailer tasks.
Responding to a message
To respond to a message, follow these steps:
1. Select the original message.
For example, I selected a Frontier Airlines message. I want to reply to
thank the airline for its lovely holiday wishes.
2. Click the reply icon (the one with the letter and the blue arrow point-
ing to the person) or choose Compose➪Reply.
A message window opens, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7:
Responding
to an e-mail
message.
Figure 5-6:

options for

113
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

3. By default, the Reply button includes the text: If you don’t want to
include the original text with your reply, choose Reply from the
Compose menu.
The original message text is included at the top of the new message. The
original text is prefaced by a > on each line, by convention. 
As a matter of good form and netiquette, I deleted the extraneous mater-
ial in my response, as shown in Figure 5-7, before typing in a response.
4. Fill in the appropriate fields as desired.
The compose window has five input areas:
• To
• Subject
• Cc
• The message body
• An attachment area for dragging and dropping attachment files or
pictures
When you reply to an existing message, the To and Subject fields
are automatically filled in. Both the message body and attachment
windows have useful pop-up menus; just right-click in the appro-
priate space. This is also an easy way to add attachments.
5. When the message is ready to send, click the Send button, and away it
goes.
Creating a new message
Creating a new e-mail message is just about as simple as replying to one:
1. Click the Compose icon on the toolbar. (It’s the icon that looks like a
blank piece of paper with a pencil laying on top.)
A blank New Message window opens.
2. Type in an address, subject, message, and so on.
Figure 5-8 shows an example message.
3. When you’ve finished composing the message, click Send.
Mailer is a good, simple e-mail program that lets you manage a simple flow of
incoming and outgoing e-mail. However, its inability to render HTML mes-
sages and lack of sophisticated filtering and other modern amenities make it
feel dated compared to many of the other choices available.
114
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

Using Netscape Messenger
The alternative mail application for GNOME users (and CDE users, if desired)
is a part of Netscape Navigator, as included with Solaris 9.
Configuring an e-mail account
Follow these steps to configure an e-mail account:
1. Launch Netscape 7.
2. Click the Window menu.
This menu offers a variety of options, as shown in Figure 5-9.
If you don’t have Netscape 7 on your Solaris system, it’s an extremely
worthwhile download. Go to www.sun.com/netscape to get started.
Figure 5-8:

115
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

3. Choose Mail & Newsgroups.
A window opens, indicating that you haven’t configured the e-mail 
preferences yet, as shown in Figure 5-10.
4. Choose Create a New Account. 
A window asks what type of account you want to create.
5. Select the default value, Email Account. Click Next to proceed.
6. In a manner similar to Windows task wizards, Netscape prompts you,
window by window, for the information needed to create the new
e-mail account. Follow the prompts.
Figure 5-11 shows the first window, asking for your 
• Name 
• E-mail address.

116
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

7. Once you’ve entered the appropriate information, click Next again to
configure your 
• POP or IMAP server 
• Outbound mail server information
In Figure 5-12, the wizard recognized that I configured my outbound mail
server when I first set up the Web browser. It shows me that the out-
bound mail server is set to mail.attbi.com instead of prompting me to
specify a new server.

117
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

8. To configure an incoming mail server, enter the server name as sup-
plied by your ISP or system administrator.
9. Specify the type of server you’ll be accessing (POP or IMAP) and click
Next to somewhat redundantly enter your e-mail account name.
10. Label this account, if you want.
Netscape 7 supports multiple e-mail accounts, but you’ll probably leave
the default user@host value shown.
After you deal with the label, a summary of all values is shown.
11. Click Finish to set up the account.
I also set up an account that allows easy access to an America Online mail-
box. Figure 5-13 shows how the mailbox is displayed.
Examining the Netscape window
Netscape 7 has an attractive display, as shown in Figure 5-13. The main
window consists of four main areas by default:
Figure 5-13:
Netscape 7
displaying
new e-mail
in the Inbox.
118
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

 A list of folders and accounts in the upper-left pane
 A sidebar in the lower-left pane
You can remove the sidebar by clicking the X button.
 A list of messages in the current folder or mailbox in the upper-right
pane
 The current message in the lower-right pane
Netscape can render complex HTML e-mail messages, as shown in the mes-
sage at the bottom of Figure 5-13. This display of portable fishing scales,
while perhaps a bit lame, is more attractive than the primitive display of the
Frontier Airlines message in the CDE Mailer program (see “Working with
incoming mail,” later in this chapter).
These are some of the folders in the upper-left pane:
 Sent Mail: By default, a copy of all messages you send are saved in the
Sent Mail folder.
 Old Mail: Messages you’ve read but haven’t filed or otherwise disposed
of can later be found in the Old Mail folder.
 Recently Deleted Mail folder: This folder stores messages that you have
marked for deletion. You can retrieve them if you change your mind.
Similar to Mailer, the main Netscape 7 toolbar offers quick access to the main
functions of the mail program, as shown in Figure 5-14. Most of these buttons
should be familiar if you’ve sent e-mail and used a Web browser. Netscape
checks for new mail every ten minutes by default. (You can change that set-
ting in your Preferences.) You can force a quick check by clicking the Get
Msgs button. 
Figure 5-14:

Netscape
toolbar.
119
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

Menu options and sorting
The available menus in Netscape are 
 File
 Edit
 View
 Go
 Message
 Tools
 Window
 Help
Sorting is one of the many options available on the View menu, as shown in
Figure 5-15. If you thought Mailer had a lot of mailbox sorting options, you’ll
be even more impressed with Netscape, which has 22 ways to organize your
view. As with Mailer, the default sorting order in Netscape is likely to keep
you happy for years of e-mail activity.
 The Message menu, shown in Figure 5-16, offers options for creating a
message. 
The most interesting and unusual option on this menu is Edit Message
as New, which lets you edit messages you’ve received. This sounds kind
of wacky, but I find it quite useful to improve subject lines on messages
before I save them to an archive folder: “Skylight Bid from Outlook
Renovation, without painting” is a much better subject than “Re:
Remodeling” when you’re later digging around the folder.

Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

 You can access your Address Book by using the Tools menu (refer to
Figure 5-9). The Address Book is a handy feature that enables you to
manage a list of everyone with whom you send and receive e-mail.
Sending and responding to e-mail
To respond to an e-mail message, click the Reply button on the navigation
bar, or choose Message➪Reply (refer to Figure 5-16). Figure 5-17 shows the
beginning of my response to the note about the fishing scale.
A remarkable number of options are available to customize your e-mail message:
 The most important thing to notice about the composition window is
that, by default, messages are composed and sent in HTML format. If
your recipient is using Mailer, well, there’s a mismatch. For many user
communities, HTML-friendly e-mail programs are quite common, and the
most popular Windows and Mac e-mail applications all support rich, col-
orful HTML.

Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

 An important capability in Navigator is the spell checker. Click the Spell
button on the navigation bar, and the program helps you avoid looking
foolish with spelling hiccups. It can’t help with grammar and word
choice, but it is a terrific addition to the mail program.
 In the panel with the To address, the To button is actually a pull-down
menu. You can specify that an address should actually be a Cc or Bcc
address instead.
Choose the Options menu, and you’ll see a number of useful message
options, as shown in Figure 5-18. You can 
 Encrypt and digitally sign messages
 Request a return receipt
 Assign various priorities
If you’re sending attachments, you can specify how the attachments should
be packaged to ensure that they arrive at their destination in a useable
format. You can safely leave the default configuration unless you’re getting
complaints from colleagues, in which case I recommend working with your
system administrator to determine the ideal settings.
The Format submenu lets you choose 
 HTML-only messages (the default)
 Text-only messages (no different typefaces, no colors, and so on)
 A hybrid of both plain text and fancy HTML. 
Recipients are shown one or the other based on the sophistication of
their mail program.
The hybrid option might sound ideal, but remember this means that two
copies of every message are sent to each recipient:
• A fancy HTML version 
• A plain text version
If your messages are a half-dozen lines, that’s no big deal. But if you reg-
ularly send friends or colleagues 10 to 20-page messages, they might get
testy about the waste of bandwidth and disk space.

To write a new message, you just follow a simple process:
1. Create the new document with one of these steps:
• Click the Compose icon on the toolbar 
• Choose Message➪New Message
2. Add the information to the document:
• Address
• Subject
• Message text.
Figure 5-19 shows an example message.
The Netscape mail program is very sophisticated and has many options: 
 If you opt to use this e-mail program, I suggest using the Help menu to
explore the program’s capabilities. 
 You may also want to go through the different panels of the Preferences
area to customize the program to your liking.
Command-Line Communication
I stick with Berkeley mail, mailx, because it is included with Solaris 9 and has
long been a part of the Sun operating system. It’s not sexy but offers a sur-
prisingly efficient mechanism for working with electronic mail.
Figure 5-19:
A new
message,
partially
composed.
123
Chapter 5: Doin’ That E-mail Thing

Without additional software, mailx cannot interact with POP or IMAP mail-
boxes. If you’re using Solaris to process mail that comes via an ISP or is
sequestered on a central mail server until you grab it, you need to move up
to a graphical mail application.
Freeware POP and IMAP applications, most notably fetchmail, are available
for Solaris, but you need to have your system administrator install them from
the Internet. To find out more about fetchmail, go to www.tuxedo.org/
~esr/fetchmail/.
Sending mail with mailx
Whether or not you can receive your e-mail at the command line, it’s likely
you can send a quick message using mailx. 
By default, Solaris 9 is configured properly to send out messages if your
system is on the Internet.
To send a message, follow these steps:
1. Type mailx followed by the e-mail address of the intended recipient or
recipients. 
It’ll then prompt for a subject
2. Enter as much text as you’d like, ending with a Ctrl-D:
$ mailx taylor@intuitive.com
Subject: Thanks for all the fish!
Just wanted to send a quick note saying “thanks” for ...
This is part of a sample message. 
• The mailx program lets you type in as much material as you’d like.
• You can cut and paste other text from other messages.
3. When you’re done entering the message, press Ctrl+D (press the Control
key down and, while it’s depressed, press D) on its own line to complete
the message:
... all the fish.
Dave  
EOT
$
The EOT (end of text) is output when you press Ctrl+D. That’s it. The
message is now on its way to the recipient somewhere on the Internet.
124
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

The mailx program offers some additional message capabilities, and you can
generate a list of them with the sequence ~? on its own line. These are the
most useful of the escape commands:
~?
-------------------- ~ ESCAPES ----------------------------
~b users        Add users to Bcc list
~c users        Add users to Cc list
~e              Edit the message buffer
~f messages     Read in messages, do not right-shift
~h              Prompt for Subject and To, Cc and Bcc lists
~m messages     Read in messages, right-shifted by a tab
~p              Print the message buffer
~q,~Q           Quit, save letter in $HOME/dead.letter
~r,~< file      Read a file into the message buffer
~r,~< !command  Read output from command into message
~R              Mark message for return receipt
~s subject      Set subject
~t users        Add users to To list
~v              Invoke (vi) display editor on message
~w file         Write message onto file (no header)
~x              Quit, do not save letter
~!command       Run a shell command
~|,~^ command   Pipe the message through the command
~?              print this help message
-----------------------------------------------------------
To include the file gullivers.travels.txt at the end of a message, for
example, type ~r gullivers.travels.txt on its own line. The commands
~e and ~v are useful for editing the message. (One uses your default editor,
and the other uses the vi editor, as discussed in Chapter 12.)
Working with incoming mail
If your system is configured so that your e-mail lives in a local mailbox, you
can read and respond to your e-mail from the command line and never have
to take your hands off the keyboard.
To check your e-mail, use the mailx command but don’t specify any 
arguments:
$ mailx

hether you’re looking for a wedding dress, a spouse, or a hubcap for
your Yugo, you can find it on the Web.
Working with the Web in the Solaris environment is slightly different from on
a PC or Macintosh system; the browsers and the windowing system are differ-
ent. Worse, many Web sites are designed for Windows-specific browsers —
particularly Microsoft Internet Explorer, which isn’t available on Solaris —
and don’t always work as intended in other environments.
For most Solaris users, encountering a Web site that doesn’t work is cause for
some grumbling, sending an occasional e-mail message to the site’s
Webmaster, and exploring other places online.
This chapter covers Netscape 7 (the Web browser shipped with Solaris 9). I
introduce you to some interesting Web sites along the way — I can’t resist —
but primarily focus on the tools themselves.
This chapter doesn’t differentiate between the Common Desktop
Environment and GNOME because Netscape works fine in both environ-
ments. The only differences are button layout and window colors. Outside of
those superficial elements, the browsers are identical in either environment,
with the same dialog boxes, menus, and configuration oddities.
Starting Netscape 7
Netscape first released the Version 4.7 browser in September 1999.
Subsequent to that release, the Internet standards groups agreed on a differ-
ent core architecture for Web browsers. Netscape has since released Version
6 and Version 7 browsers for most platforms. I focus on the newer and more
sophisticated Netscape 7.

If you don’t have Netscape 7, ask your system administrator to download it
from www.sun.com/netscape/. Netscape 4.78 is the version that might be on
your Solaris 9 distribution; this version is nearly an orphan.
The process for starting Netscape 7 depends on your interface:
 If you’re running CDE, launch Netscape 7 by clicking the clock icon (the
picture of planet Earth), as shown in Figure 6-1.
 In the GNOME environment, you have a couple of options:
• Click the foot icon to pop up the GNOME menu and then choose
Applications➪Internet—Netscape Web Browser, as shown in 
Figure 6-2.
• If you personalized GNOME as described in Chapter 2, you can click the
small N on the control panel.
The Web browser loads the Sun Microsystems home page as the default
home for the browser. It looks like Figure 6-3.

Changing Preferences
You can customize Netscape 7 a million different ways. 
To get to the Preferences area, choose Edit➪Preferences. You see the
Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-4, by default.
The small boxes on the left side of the category indicate subcategories under
that category. 
 Click the tiny plus signs to see hidden subcategories.
 Click the tiny minus signs to hide subcategories.

• Cache
• Proxies
• HTTP Networking
• Software Installation
• Mouse Wheel
• Offline & Disk Space
Adjusting your appearance
“Please brush your hair!” might be the first thing that comes to mind when
you think about appearance. Fortunately, it’s easier to configure Netscape 7,
and it remembers every change, too!
Figure 6-4 shows appearance options that allow you to specify which ele-
ments of Netscape 7 should be launched when the program is started. By
default, it launches only Navigator (the Web browser).
Netscape 7 is the name for the entire suite of tools. Navigator is the Web
browser itself.
If you’re using Netscape Mail as your e-mail program, select the Messenger
Mail check box to have that automatically open, too.
You can also easily launch any of these tools by clicking the appropriate icon
on the bottom left of the main Netscape window, as shown in Figure 6-5. From
left to right, the icons launch 
 Navigator
 Mail
 Instant Messenger
 Composer
 Your e-mail Address Book.
Leave the ToolTips option checked. It makes Navigator pop up helpful little
yellow notes if you leave the cursor over an icon for a second or two.

Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

Fonts
Click the Fonts subcategory listing under Appearance on the left pane of the
dialog box to see a new set of font options, as shown in Figure 6-6. Usually,
you won’t have to change these options. 
If you’d prefer to have both the variable width and fixed-width (typewriter)
text on the browser page a bit larger, you can change the options here:
Choose the next size up from the current setting for both 
 Proportional (the default text on most pages)
 Monospace (code listings and other fixed-width material)
By convention, the fixed width font is always smaller than the variable
width font, but you can change it to whatever is pleasing for your eyes.

Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

The other option here — Allow Documents to Use Other Fonts — is to option-
ally override fonts included by Web sites. Don’t change this setting; many
sites use technology for text presentation that enhance the layout and pre-
sentation.
Colors
The Colors subcategory is shown in Figure 6-7. If you’ve surfed the Web,
you’re familiar with the standard color scheme of black text, blue underlined
hypertext reference links, and purple underlined links for places you’ve previ-
ously visited. Here’s where you can change this scheme and fine-tune things
to your heart’s content!
To change a color, click the little color box. This produces an attractive set of
colors in a grid, as shown in Figure 6-8. Click the desired color. The selected
color replaces the previous color for links, background, or whatever you
wanted to alter.

136
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

You can change other colors and turn off the underlining of hypertext refer-
ences if you want, but most modern Web sites already do their own alterations
of the appearance to ensure the best possible design.
If you prefer a specific color scheme, or you don’t like it when Web pages
hide the hypertext references by disabling underlines, changing colors, and
so on, then check the radio button adjacent to Use My Chosen Colors,
Ignoring the Colors and Background Image Specified. Keep your fingers
crossed that it always works!
Navigating preferences
Preferences under the Navigator category control the internal behavior of the
browser. As shown in Figure 6-9, the default Navigator preference lets you
specify whether to 
 Start new windows with the home page or a blank page
 Alter your home page
 Fine-tune what’s shown in the toolbars
Figure 6-9:
Navigator
preferences.
137
Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

You can change your home page several ways:
 Click in the Location box, select the current URL therein
(http://www.sun.com/), and replace it with your preferred home page
address.
 Move in the browser to the page you want, choose Edit➪Preferences to
jump to this Preferences dialog box, and click the Use Current Page
button.
History
History is a useful setting. Click it to see the dialog box shown in Figure 6-10.
The History settings are important, especially if you have precious little disk
space. By default, Navigator saves a copy of every Web page and every
graphic on every page in an area called the cache. The actual cache settings
are part of the Advanced Preferences category; the history setting in Figure
6-10 specifies how long the browser remembers sites.
By default, Navigator remembers nine day’s worth of surfing; the program
automatically deletes cached Web pages and graphics more than nine days
old when you quit. Make the history long enough, and you’ll eventually run
out of room on your computer when everything hangs around forever.
138
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 
There’s no place like your home page
It’s useful to visit Sun.com sporadically, but the
content doesn’t change often enough to make it
an exciting choice for your home page. Instead,
I recommend some alternatives:
 Slashdot (www.slashdot.org) is a pop-
ular discussion and news site for computer
aficionados, with an entertaining mixture of
news, science, technology, and, well, just
weird stuff.
 Google News (news.google.com) offers
a terrific overview of the latest news as
reported in a wide variety of news and
information outlets. It changes all the time
and offers easy access to the terrific
Google search engine.
 ESPN (www.espn.com) is a great choice
for the sports junkie, with its constantly
updated tickers for football, basketball,
baseball, NASCAR, and whatever else is
happening in the sports world.
 BBC News (news.bbc.co.uk) offers a
European perspective on news and the
events of the day. It’s updated all the time,
too, but might seem a bit stark compared to
a site like Yahoo! or MSN.
 eBay (www.ebay.com) if you’re a collec-
tor, or just like shopping, there’s no better or
more compelling site online than eBay, an
enormous, chaotic online auction site.
Whether it’s a second SPARC system or
new clothes for your baby, someone’s prob-
ably selling it on eBay.

Is nine the correct setting? It’s difficult to say and probably depends just as
much on how many sites you visit as your disk space allocation.
 If you spend hours each day visiting sites you’ve never visited before,
you’ll be building a substantial history list and cache, so you might need
to reduce this to seven days, or five.
 If you read The Wall Street Journal when you log in, and then use only
e-mail and StarOffice for the rest of the day, a nine-day history is fine.
Languages
If you’ve installed several languages with your Solaris setup, you should see
more than one language listed in the Languages subcategory dialog box.
Otherwise, it just lists English, which is fine as-is.
Internet Search
The Internet Search subcategory is where you can choose which search
engine will, by default, process search queries entered into the Location box.
My personal preference is Google, as shown in Figure 6-11.
Figure 6-10:

Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

Tabbed Browsing
One of the coolest features in Netscape 7 is tabbed browsing. Using this fea-
ture, you can have a bunch of Web pages open simultaneously, and simply
click the appropriate tab to jump to the page you want to view. Figure 6-12
shows the options. If you haven’t tried tabbed browsing, I recommend it!

Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

Smart Browsing
Smart Browsing is a neat idea from Netscape that has fallen on hard times.
The concept is great: For each site you visit, the browser presents a What’s
Related button that pops up a menu of Web sites ostensibly related to the
current site.
Smart Browsing is buggy. My experience is that the browser crashes not infre-
quently with this enabled.
Advanced options
The Advanced preferences category, shown in Figure 6-13, gives you control
of such enhanced capabilities as 
 Fine-tuning your privacy settings
 Disabling cookies
 Allowing or disabling Java or JavaScript
The default configuration is probably fine for you unless you know you need
changes. For example, I enable Java and XSLT (as shown in Figure 6-13)
because lots of the content on the Sun Microsystems Web site is Java-enabled.
You maintain a more restrictive — and secure — browsing environment by
disabling Java.
Figure 6-13:
Advanced
preferences
in 
Netscape 7.
141
Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

The only other Advanced preference worth considering is the Cache. This
subcategory is where you can fine-tune how much disk space the browser
can use for its breadcrumb trail of sites you’ve visited. Figure 6-14 shows this.
Check the location of the disk cache folder:
 If you’re having problems using more than your quota of disk space in
Solaris, this directory is a good place to start your exploration. 
 You can also ratchet back the amount of space allowed on the disk (the
default is 50MB) if necessary by typing another value into the Disk
Cache box.
Working Effectively
In the interest of becoming an effective Web surfer, you need to know about a
few buttons and links in the main browser window. Figure 6-15 shows the
window.
 The Help menu is rightmost on the top menu bar. Click it for direct links
to a number of useful Web sites within Netscape.
Figure 6-14:
Cache
preferences

Netscape 7.
142
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

My favorite of this list is the Security Center, where you can find tips on
improving the security of your Solaris Web browser.
 On the Navigation bar, in addition to the usual Back, Forward, Reload,
and Home buttons, there is one more to highlight: Search takes you
directly to the search engine you’ve specified in the Internet Search pref-
erence dialog box (refer to Figure 6-11). If you type a search pattern into
the Location box, instead of a URL, and then click Search, the Web
browser feeds that pattern to your specified search engine and shows
you the results instead. A very cool feature!
When you find a Web page that would make a great home page, choose
Preferences—Navigator and click the Use Current Page button to set it
as your new home page.
 The next row down on the Web browser is known as the bookmarks bar
because it offers one-click access to your favorite bookmarks. Netscape 7
is preloaded with a bunch of useful bookmarks, including 
Figure 6-15:
Google
News in
Netscape 7.
143
Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

• Radio
• My Netscape
• Shop
• WebMail
• Calendar
This feature is worth exploring. My Web browser has a customized set of
bookmarks including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and
Slashdot, among others.
You can hide or display any or all toolbars a couple of ways:
 Select the appropriate option on the View➪Show/Hide menu.
For example, to hide the Personal toolbar, simply select it from the View
menu, and it vanishes.
As a general rule, anything preceded on the menu with a checkmark is
visible, and anything missing the checkmark is hidden: every time you
select an item on the Show/Hide menu it’ll flip from visible to invisible,
or back.
 Click the narrow vertical bar on the leftmost edge of the toolbar in ques-
tion; it shrinks to a tiny vertical bar.
I’ve shrunk the Personal toolbar in Figure 6-15 and the Navigation bar in
Figure 6-16. 
 To restore toolbars to full size, simply click the tiny horizontal element.
The final element to explore in Netscape 7 is the padlock icon on the bottom-
right corner of the window. For any given Web site, the padlock icon shows
whether the site’s secure or insecure:
 Secure sites have closed padlocks.
 Insecure sites have open padlocks.
Click the padlock icon (or choose View—Page Info and then click the Security
tab), and a dialog box pops up with lots of security information for the cur-
rent page, whether the page is secure or not. 
Figure 6-16 shows the security information for the PayPal.com home page
(https://www.paypal.com/).
Figure 6-16 shows that the PayPal site is secure (both because the padlock is
closed and because the Security page says the page was encrypted). This is
particularly important if you’re entering personal data, such as 
144
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

 Account and password information 
 Credit card data
It’s a good idea to make it a habit to check whether a Web site is secure
before providing personal information.
In terms of shopping, you might ask yourself, “How trustworthy is an online
store if it doesn’t bother to encode the transmission between me and its
server?” I personally avoid doing business with online stores that do not
encrypt payment pages, regardless of how big and well established they are.
While I’m talking about Security, pop back to the Preferences dialog box
(choose Edit—Preferences) and then move to Privacy & Security and click
the subcategory SSL. You see a new dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-17.
SSL is a secure alternative to the regular Web transfer system. Information is
encrypted and decrypted by your browser and the remote server. While in
transit, the information is in an unreadable format; when you’re checking
your bank balance, no one can use the information if they intercept it.
Figure 6-16:
Security
Info for
PayPal.com.
145
Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

You won’t have to configure either SSL2 or SSL3, but you need to enable
them, as shown in Figure 6-17. 
I disable all the warning dialog boxes because I check for secure sites by
glancing at the padlock icon; if you don’t, you can leave the warnings enabled
by leaving all the boxes checked (as shown).
Going back in time
One great feature of Web browsers from the very first introduced is that they
keep track of where you’ve surfed prior to the current page. You can then
easily back up to a previous page by clicking on the Back button or, on the
more recent browsers, viewing and selecting from your surfing History. But
the History window is quite a bit more useful than a way of avoiding multiple
clicks on the Back button, because unlike the Back button, the History
window remembers sites you’ve visited on previous invocations of the
browser too.
Figure 6-18 shows my current history list. Choose Go➪History to access your
list.
Figure 6-17:
Netscape 7

settings.
146
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

In Figure 6-18, the entries are organized by date and sorted by frequency of
visit. Unsurprisingly, Sun Microsystems is the most visited site. 
 You can change the sort column by clicking the column name. 
 Click it a second time to reverse the order of the sort. 
To sort by page title, for example, click Title. Now it’s sorted in a to z order.
Click Title again, and it’s reversed, in z to a order. Click a third time, and
you’re back to a to z order.
The History window lists all sites you’ve visited in the last week or two, not
just since you started your current session. It’s like a super Back button. How
far back does it keep the list? That’s what the History setting in the
Preferences adjusts; by default, it’s nine days.
The History feature presents a privacy challenge. To understand why, con-
sider what your boss would see if she sauntered over to your Solaris system,
opened this History window, and sorted by Visit Count. Are you secretly
spending time visiting “cuteguys.com” or “singles.net” during work hours? To
minimize the privacy problem, some Web surfers set their History preference
to a very small value. On the other hand, if you’re at work, you’re supposed
to be working, so maybe changing the browser isn’t the best way to solve the
problem!

Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

Managing bookmarks
If you’re like most Web surfers, you either don’t use bookmarks at all, or
they’ve taken over, and your bookmark menu has dozens, or hundreds, of
entries. Knowing how to manage your bookmark list is well worth a few min-
utes of time and makes surfing more fun.
The Personal toolbar comes with a set of bookmarks preloaded, including 
 WebMail
 Calendar
 Radio
Here’s how to add a few useful additional locations. 
First, go to a Web site you like to visit. I’ll pop over to the Dummies.com
home page at www.dummies.com/, as shown in Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19:
The
Dummies
Press home
page.
148
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

To add the Dummies.com site to my Personal toolbar, I choose Bookmark➪File
Bookmark. The default action is to add the bookmark to my Personal Toolbar
Folder. I click OK, and the new element is added to the folder, but is not dis-
played in my Personal toolbar. Why not? Because it’s at the end of the list in
the folder.
What if, in addition to moving the Dummies bookmark to make it visible, you
also want to get rid of the Radio bookmark because you already have a radio
and don’t need one on your Solaris system?
To solve both problems, you need to open the Bookmark Editor: 
1. Choose Bookmarks➪Manage Bookmarks. The Bookmark Editor is shown
in Figure 6-20. The highlighted line in the figure is the Dummies.com
bookmark. 
2. To change the label for this entry, right-click anywhere on the line.
A small menu pops up with many choices. To rename it as the bookmark
name choose Rename, and the Bookmark Properties dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 6-21.
Here you can 
 Type a new title
 Fine-tune the location URL
 Add a description to help remember why you found the site so 
compelling
Figure 6-20:

Chapter 6: Exploring the World Wide Web

Bookmarks can be adjusted to make your system efficient and convenient:
 To move a bookmark to the top of the Personal Toolbar Folder, simply
click and drag it to the top.
 To delete a bookmark, right-click it and choose Delete from the pop-up
menu. 
 You can also create new bookmark folders and drag specific bookmarks
around, which is a boon for the well-organized surfer.
When you’re done fine-tuning your bookmarks, choose File➪Close. Now
you’re back at your Web browser, with the new improved Personal toolbar, as
shown in Figure 6-22.

 Working with the Apache Server on your Solaris system
A
lthough it’s entertaining to surf the Web, discovering what everyone
else has produced, nothing is as exciting as publishing your own Web
site, fiddling with the hypertext markup, and checking the server log files to
see how many people read your material while you were at lunch!
Creating complex, sophisticated Web sites like the Sun.com site is obviously
beyond the scope of this book (although I share some recommendations in
this chapter for other Web design books), but one of the real beauties of the
Web is that it’s egalitarian. If you can work in either a CDE- or GNOME-based
editor or launch a terminal window and edit in vi — all of which are dis-
cussed in Chapter 12 — you’re ready to go.
Naming Files
It’s easy to build a simple Web page using the GNOME Text Editor application.
If you’re using the Common Desktop Environment, Text Edit is functionally
identical and can be easily used instead.

The first issue to consider is the name of the file. But you can’t just name a
file anything you’d like. There are specific rules about well-formed HTML file
names on the Web:
 Spaces aren’t allowed in Web filenames.
 Solaris differentiates between uppercase (capital) and lowercase letters
in a filename. Welcome and welcome are actually two different files. 
Some operating systems (notably Microsoft Windows) ignore case differ-
ences. 
Use all lowercase letters for your Web page filenames. That sidesteps
the problem completely.
 Use .html as the filename suffix. 
• Web browsers know what they’re looking at.
• Web servers know what kind of information they’re feeding to visi-
tors who ask for your new page.
A good first Web page name is welcome.html.
Entering Content
Web pages with content are obviously more exciting than blank pages
(though blank pages can be curiously relaxing at times), so you probably
want some. 
154
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 
HTML essentials
Whether you’re using your Solaris system as a
Web server, or you have Web space on a differ-
ent server (perhaps America Online or another
Internet service provider), you can easily learn
the basics of HTML and get started. HTML is the
HyperText Markup Language: the set of nota-
tions within all Web pages that tell the Web
browser how to present information.
Here’s an example of HTML:
<P>This is a paragraph with a
word in <B>bold</B></P>
As the preceding example shows, HTML is
straightforward: To have the word bold format-
ted in bold, wrap the word in tags:
 The open bold HTML tag (B) at the start
 The close bold HTML tag at the end (it’s like
the open, but with a / added). 
All HTML tags start with an open angle bracket
and end with a close angle bracket, and most,
but not all, HTML tags are pairs; they start and
then end a particular presentation characteris-
tic, like bold.

The process depends on the environment you’re working in:
 In CDE, launch the CDE Text Edit application. Just click the Text Note
icon (the little piece of paper with the pencil and red pushpin icon) on
the main control bar.
 In GNOME, go to the GNOME menu on the bottom-left corner and then
choose Applications➪Accessories➪Text Editor, as shown in Figure 7-1.
When the GNOME Text Editor — gedit — first opens, it looks like Figure 7-2.
Try entering some text into this new as-yet-unborn Web page:
We’ve come a long way since the days when Sun was
just four university students with an idea.
Twenty years down the road, much to our own surprise,
we have nearly 40,000 employees in offices around
the world. In fact, from humble beginnings as 
builders of engineering workstations, we’ve become
a leading supplier of network servers, data storage
systems, system software, network infrastructure
applications, and much more.
But with all the changes--all the ways we have
reinvented our products and our company over
the years--one thing remains the same:
The idea that started it all.
Open network computing is still our passion,
still the driving force behind each of our
technologies, products, and services.
This passage is from a retrospective written by Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun
Microsystems. You can find it online at www.sun.com/2002-0225/feature/.

Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages

After you enter the text, your text editor should look like Figure 7-3.
This looks fine in Text Editor, but it’s not yet a Web page. To see why, save the
text to a file and then open the file in Netscape Navigator. To save the file,
either

The Save As dialog box pops up. By default, the dialog box should open to
your home directory, with the filename Untitled 1. Figure 7-4 shows how
that looks.
The default location of my home directory is fine, but the filename Untitled 1
is unacceptable: I use welcome.html. To change the filename, I use these
steps:
1. Select Untitled 1 in the bottom text area and replace it with 
welcome.html. 
2. Click OK to save the file.
The Text Editor window should now show the name of the file in both

 The small tab below the New and Open buttons on the toolbar
Viewing Local Pages 
You can open a Web page in Netscape Navigator several ways, including drag-
ging and dropping the icon onto the browser. To open the file you’ve created

It may surprise you that the page you created isn’t laid out at all like it appears
in the editor. Figure 7-8 shows what I mean. Although the file contains text, it
doesn’t contain any HTML markup tags, so the Web browser has no idea how
to present it. 
The following section explains how to add some simple HTML.
Improving Layout
The real pleasure of developing Web pages is learning the HyperText Markup
Language and applying its many formatting and layout tags to improve the
appearance of your Web page, regardless of content.
You can significantly improve this particular page with some common format-
ting options:
1. Add a few paragraph break tags: <P> and </P> (they’re a pair so you
need to start and end each paragraph). 
Wrap each paragraph of text with these two tags.
2. Add a document title, something to make it clear that Scott McNealy
wrote these words. 
To accomplish this, use the H tag, which supports headers ranging
between 
• Level one, the largest and most important, 
A typical level one header might look like this:
<H1>This is my important header</H1>
• Level six header, which is tiny and reminiscent of the proverbial
small print in a contract.
Figure 7-8:
The words
are right,
but the
presen-
tation
is poor.

Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages

The title of Scott McNealy’s note containing these paragraphs of text is
“Sun at 20: A look back on the future of network computing.” That’s what
I used in this document, too. With the appropriate additions, Figure 7-9
shows the new, improved, HTML page.
The window title now says (modified). This is a reminder that although
you have entered the changes into the editor, you haven’t written them
to the disk and saved them. 
3. Click the Save button (the little floppy disk) to write all the changes. The
word (modified) should vanish from the window title.
Follow these steps to check your work:
1. Flip over to Navigator. 
• You can do this in GNOME by clicking the correct button on the
bottom window bar. 
• In either GNOME or CDE, you can do it by clicking somewhere in
the Web browser window itself. 
2. Click the Reload button on the toolbar.

HTML by the bucketful
If you prefer to get your hands dirty building
Web pages, you can find dozens and dozens of
books on all things HTML. I recommend these
books (all published by Wiley Publishing):
 Creating Cool HTML 4 Web Pages is a book
I first wrote at the very beginning of the
Web craze and have since updated and
revised extensively, year after year. It’s a top
selling introduction to everything you need
to know about HTML and how to use it.
 Dynamic HTML Weekend Crash Course is
another book I wrote that goes into consid-
erably more detail on two key modern Web
technologies: 
Cascading Style Sheets 
JavaScript
These technologies are required knowl-
edge for cutting-edge Web design.
 HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed
Tittel and Natanya Pitts, is another good
starting point, with coverage of the latest
HTML tags and a helpful section on plan-
ning your site and design.
 Building a Web Site For Dummies, by David
and Rhonda Crowder, is a good companion
to HTML 4 For Dummies, with more of an
emphasis on such site-design issues as 
Interactive elements
Organizing your pages on the server

Working with Apache Server
A Solaris system can be used as a fast and complete Web server, right out of
the box. 
For a basic configuration, follow these steps: 
1. Ask your system administrator to copy the file /etc/apache/httpd.
conf-example to /etc/apache/httpd.conf, and then make the few
simple changes to the configuration file detailed therein. 
2. After that’s done, the system administrator can start up the server by
typing /usr/apache/bin/httpd.
That’s it. Your system is now running as a Web server!
To test whether the server is running, open Netscape Navigator and go to
http://127.0.0.1/, a special address known as the loopback address for
your computer. You see the welcome page shown in Figure 7-11.
Figure 7-11:
Welcome
to your
Apache
Web server.
162
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

Publishing a Web page
Publishing the Web page is surprisingly easy. 
1. Go into Text Editor and choose File➪Save As. 
You’re presented with the same dialog box shown in Figure 7-4. 
2. Make sure you’re in your home directory and then click the New Folder
button. 
The New Folder dialog box pops up, as shown in Figure 7-12.
3. Type in public_html (yes, that’s an underscore between the two words;
remember, the Web doesn’t like spaces) and click Create.
You return to the Save As dialog box. This time, the Folders list should
have the new public_html folder listed. 
4. Double-click the folder to move into that subdirectory. 
Now the Save As dialog box looks like Figure 7-13.
Figure 7-13:
Moving into
the new
public_
html folder.
Figure 7-12:
Create a
new folder.
163
Chapter 7: Creating Web Pages

The default name for the new file is still welcome.html. 
5. Click OK, and the Web page is saved in the new directory.
6. Go back to the browser and open http://127.0.0.1/~taylor/
welcome.html (where taylor is replaced by your account name,
as necessary). 
You should see the same Web page shown earlier, but this time the page
is being fed through the Web server, which means that it’s accessible to
other systems on your network and, possibly, the entire Internet.
One more touch can customize your system:
1. Ask your system administrator for your system’s fully-qualified domain
name.
It’s probably something like aurora.intuitive.com or wk32.cs.
colorado.edu. 
2. Change the loopback address to the correct hostname. 
Figure 7-14 shows the result for my system, with the address
http://aurora.intuitive.com/~taylor/welcome.html
displayed.
Figure 7-14:
The Web
page is

to all.
164
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

If you rename the file index.html within the public_html folder, it’s
the default page that’s shown if a visitor requests
http://yourhost/~youraccount/ without specifying a filename.
Some systems are configured so you see a permission denied error, not your
new page. If that happens, these steps should correct the problem:
1. Open a terminal window. 
Chapter 3 explains how to work at the command line. 
2. Type these commands:
chmod a+rx ~ ~/public_html
chmod a+r  ~/public_html/*
It should work just fine.

etween e-mail and the World Wide Web, it probably doesn’t seem like
there’s much else on the Internet. But that’s not the case. The Internet
is also a vast repository of files, documents, and other data, free for the taking.
Additionally, there are thousands of machines online where you can obtain a
shell account (though mostly for a fee) and then connect directly to the system
as if it were under your desk, not — perhaps — halfway around the world.
When I started working in the computer field in 1980, every few months my
company’s software vendor would send a “release tape,” a big magnetic tape
reel that we’d mount on a player and unpack onto our system. If something
was broken, we’d have to either try to reverse the update or wait months for
the next tape to fix the problems. The process was unimaginably slow and
clunky!
Today, it’s astonishingly easy to update systems and install new software. Need
a new version of Netscape 7? Just connect to either the Sun Microsystems or
Netscape file server and download it yourself, on demand. This tremendous
improvement has helped the computer industry speed up development a
hundredfold.
Understanding FTP and Telnet
Capabilities
If you’ve only spent time surfing the Web and passively receiving electronic
mail, you might not realize that there’s more to interactivity on the Internet. 

For example, rather than being constrained to your computer’s hard disk,
you can connect to thousands of disks elsewhere on the Internet and copy
files as needed. FTP, the File Transfer Protocol, allows you to do either from 
 The primitive but powerful ftp interface 
 A Web browser
Web browers are read-only for ftp
You already know that Solaris includes a powerful command-line interface.
Using the telnet program (or its secure big brother ssh), you can connect
to command shells on remote computers anywhere in the world.
FTP capabilities
The best way to imagine FTP is that it’s a mechanism for attaching new hard
disks to your computer, on demand. 
Depending on the permissions you’re granted upon connection, you can 
 Read and explore content
 Upload and deposit your own files for safekeeping and storage 
Most FTP connections are read-only; you explore the contents and copy any-
thing you desire onto your hard disk, but you can’t add your own material.
The more important limitation of the ftp program is that it isn’t secure: Any
account and password information required is sent in the clear, so malicious
users who might be monitoring the network connection can easily “sniff” and
copy your private connection details. 
The secure alternative to ftp is sftp, a part of the Secure Shell (ssh) pack-
age. Other than the security issues, ftp and sftp are functionally identical.
I strongly recommend that you use sftp whenever you can as a superior
alternative to the ftp program.
Telnet capabilities
The telnet program offers a simple method for connecting to command
shells on remote computers, either elsewhere on your network or halfway
around the world. 
168
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

For reasons of system integrity and security, telnet accounts are always
assigned per-person, so you have to enter your assigned account and pass-
word information. But telnet has the security limitations of the ftp
application: Malicious users can potentially identify your account and pass-
word and then use them for unsavory purposes. The alternative to telnet,
offering the same basic functionality, is the Secure Shell (ssh).
The ssh program (which I highly recommend) or the more widely available
telnet program both offer the same functionality: 
 After you’ve connected and logged in, using the command shell on the
remote system is the same as working locally. 
 If it’s a Solaris system, any command-line program discussed herein will
work on the remote system just as it does on your own. 
If you want to find out more about how to ensure maximum security on your
Solaris system, check out Chapter 17.
Exploring the Net with FTP
Remote file access, primarily done using a protocol called FTP (File Transfer
Protocol), can be accomplished two ways:
 At the command line: Many people use the command-line shell inter-
face to access FTP archives. 
This is particularly useful because it supports both 
• Downloads (where files are brought to your system from the
remote server) 
• Uploads (where files are copied from your local system to the
remote server).
 Through a graphical FTP tool: Some people don’t realize that just about
every Web browser is a terrific download-only FTP browser. 
Exploring FTP with a browser
A Web browser can work with an FTP-style URL, which looks something like
this: ftp://ftp.sec.gov/. Open Netscape, choose File➪Open Web
Location, and enter this URL. The result looks like Figure 8-1.
169
Chapter 8: Accessing Internet Services

An FTP archive is like a remote hard disk that you can explore and download
material from, as allowed by the system’s file permissions. 
Figure 8-1 shows that at the topmost level, this FTP server offers 
 Six folders 
 Three files:
README.html
robots.txt
welcome.msg
Click the welcome.msg file, and you see a brief introductory message, like
this:
-------------------------
Welcome to FTP.SEC.GOV!

Information Server. This file contains introductory

information and will be periodically revised. This server 
features SEC public documents, information of interest to the 
investing public, rulemaking activities, and access to the 
Commission’s electronic filing database, EDGAR. The public 
will be able to query the EDGAR database for any company 
currently filing electronically with the SEC. These filings 
are updated 24 hours after they are filed with the 
Commission. This server will support WWW and anonymous FTP 
and can be reached at “http://www.sec.gov” and “ftp.sec.gov” 
respectively.

FTP supports both logging in to 
 A specific account 
 An anonymous FTP server. 
With an anonymous server

Your e-mail address as the password (usually, by convention)
Netscape defaults to an anonymous FTP connection when it displays FTP
archives. It all happened invisibly with this SEC connection.
You’ve already accomplished a lot. You’ve connected to an FTP archive on a
computer in Washington, D.C., requested the download of a specific file, and
had that file displayed within the browser, all with just a few mouse clicks.
Click the Back button to go back to the list of folders, and then click edgar to
move into the main directory of corporate filings, as shown in Figure 8-2.
This is getting more interesting! You see many folders, including historical
corporate filing folders for 1997–2000, and more.
In fact, the SEC changed its FTP archive structure; in a moment, you see more
recent corporate filings on this server too.
To start, click in this order:

The full path is
ftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/full-index/2003/QTR1/
The results are shown in Figure 8-3. Now, click company.idx to see a long
list of all corporate filings archived on the EDGAR system, as shown in
Figure 8-4.
If you’re an active investor, EDGAR is a great place to do research! From this
document, you can 
 Get the filename of the specific report on EDGAR
 Use Netscape to navigate to the correct file — all free, all via FTP.
Command-line FTP
Although accessing FTP archives via Netscape is a breeze, there’s one
significant limitation: You can’t transfer files from your local system to
the server.

Chapter 8: Accessing Internet Services

With the command-line ftp program, you can do either, or both: 
 Download files from the server
 Upload your files to the server
The server must have appropriate permissions to allow uploads: 
 You might have an account on an FTP server that allows uploads, but
requires you to use your own account and password. 
For example, many Web servers expect file uploads via FTP. 
 If not, you see a permission denied error when you try to upload
something. 
If that happens, seek advice from your system administrator on how to
correct the permission error.
The ftp program requires a terminal with a command shell running. Chapter
3 explains how to launch it.
Type ftp at the command line, followed by the name of the FTP server you
want to explore. The result looks like this if you go back to the SEC site:
$ ftp ftp.sec.gov

type the ftp command ascii first to tell the program that it’s a text file, and
the appropriate end-of-line sequences should be rewritten as the material
arrives.

Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

Connecting by Telnet
Many Solaris users work happily year after year without ever having to use
the command shell to reach out and connect to a remote system. When you
do need to log in to a remote system, though, you’ll probably use the awk-
wardly named telnet tool. When you open up a terminal window to your
own computer, you establish a Telnet-like connection. Imagine the same basic
thing, but connecting to another server a few yards, miles, or even thousands
of miles away.
To accomplish this, type telnet remotehostname at the command line. You
need an account on the remote server to log in, but you can get the Telnet
connection and initial login prompt without any sort of connection.
To demonstrate the concepts, the following example is a connection to a
server at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The first line is the only time
you interact directly with the telnet program rather than the remote
system:
$ telnet spot.colorado.edu
Trying 128.138.129.2...
Connected to spot.colorado.edu.
Escape character is ‘^]’.
*************************************************************
ATTENTION: This service has been disabled as part of the move 
toward encrypted authentication for the Boulder campus. You 
will need to switch to a secure login client, such as ssh.
For more information, step-by-step instructions, or if you 
need any help, please go to 
http://www.colorado.edu/its/security/encauth or call
*************************************************************
Connection closed by foreign host.
$
The preceding example showed an error message then logged you out, drop-
ping the connection and quitting the telnet program completely. That’s
okay; the example shows generally how it’s done.
As another example of how telnet lets you connect to a remote server and
work as if you were directly connected, I’ll let you have a peek at my own
server, which I can only connect to via telnet when I disable some security
software. 
The following example shows how, if you have an account, working with a
remote system via telnet is a breeze:

Once you’re connected with a telnet session, it’s just like having a terminal
window open on that machine directly, except it’s distant: My office is in
Boulder, Colorado, whereas the intuitive.com server is located in Baltimore,
Maryland. Quite a distance!
Connecting Securely with SSH
The only problem with both ftp and telnet is that they’re not secure. In
fact, ftp is notoriously insecure, and modern Unix system administrators
recommend avoiding ftp for any account-specific activity. Why? Because
both programs send their passwords in the clear — unencrypted. If a bad
guy, delinquent, or even malicious hacker happened to be listening on the
network wire (which can be done), he’d see your account and password pair
visibly travel past. In fact, a packet sniffer can be programmed to look for the
string login: and capture the next 100 characters sent in either direction,
which would include the account and password pair.
178
Part II: The Inevitable Internet Section 

ssh (Secure Shell) is a secure replacement for both telnet and ftp.
 The ssh program itself is a replacement for telnet. 
 The ssh package also includes sftp, a secure ftp program.
Outside of the invocation steps, they are pretty much functionally identical to
their insecure cousins. The biggest difference is that both require you to
specify the account name and server name as part of the invocation of the
program.
Instead of ftp intuitive.com and then typing in taylor, you’d use:
$ sftp taylor@intuitive.com
Connecting to intuitive.com...
authenticity of host ‘intuitive.com’ can’t be established.
RSA key fingerprint in md5 is: 
d0:db:8a:cb:74:c8:37:e4:9e:71:fc:7a:eb:d6:40:81
Are you sure you want to continue connecting(yes/no)?
If you have the ssh package, and it’s supported on the remote system to
which you’re connecting, use it. Don’t use ftp or telnet. If ssh isn’t an
option, complain to your system administrator about the security problem,
and hope it’ll be fixed. 
 If you’re using anonymous FTP, it’s no big deal. 
 If you’re connecting to another system over the public Internet, encryp-
tion is critical.
Because the ssh system uses public key encryption, the first step involved
in any connection is to swap encryption keys. You don’t have to be involved
other than to acknowledge that you’re visiting a site for the first time, hence
the need for the public key. 
Type yes at the prompt, and you’ll see:
Warning: Permanently added ‘intuitive.com,128.121.96.234’

StarOfﬁce

In this part . . .
This part of the book introduces you to the key compo-
nents of StarOfﬁce, an excellent alternative to Microsoft
Ofﬁce, with a particular emphasis on StarOfﬁce Writer, the
document processing system. By the time you’re done
with this section, you’ll have a very good idea of the
power and capabilities of StarOfﬁce and will be ready to
begin your own exploration.

F
or many years, the most notable absence within Solaris was the lack of
Microsoft Office or a compatible suite of applications that would let
Solaris users share documents, read spreadsheets, view presentations, and
so on. With the introduction of StarOffice, and subsequent release of the
open source OpenOffice variant on StarOffice, this problem has been solved.
Included for free with Solaris 9, StarOffice is a remarkably capable, easy to
use set of programs that work well in both the Common Desktop Environment
and the GNOME environment. These programs offer a high degree of inter-
changeability with Windows and Mac office documents.
The showcase application of StarOffice is Writer, the document preparation
and word processing environment. Clearly inspired by the interface and capa-
bilities of Microsoft Word, Writer offers an elegantly designed and powerful
environment for producing documents, whether they’re just a few pages or
hundreds of pages.
This chapter covers some of the most exciting parts of StarOffice, including
document editing and working with styles. (Chapter 10 examines the key
additional applications included with the StarOffice suite.)

Creating New Documents
After StarOffice is installed, you can launch Writer directly from either 
 The GNOME menu (choose Applications➪Office➪StarOffice) 
 The Common Desktop Environment taskbar (click the butterfly icon). 
If that doesn’t work, you should be able to move into the StarOffice directory
and launch the program from the terminal:
/export/home/staroffice6.0/program/soffice &
Whichever way you start Writer, you get a blank Writer screen, as shown in
Figure 9-1. 
 The main section is a virtual piece of paper upon which you can type 
(or cut and paste) whatever you want.
 Other screen features include 
• A menu bar along the top
• Two toolbars
• A ruler
• A toolbar running down the left side of the window
Rather than start from scratch, I’m reading in the contents of the book
Gulliver’s Travels, which I already have on my system. 
To accomplish this, choose Insert➪File, as shown in Figure 9-2.
The file selection dialog box is different from the normal Solaris selector, but
the basic concept is the same: 
1. Click the Up One Level button (it has a folder with an upward pointing
arrow on it) to step up the directory tree
2. Click a folder in the main view to move into a directory. 
When you’ve found the desired file, click it to select it, as shown in Figure 9-3.
After selecting the file, click Insert. You’re taken back to the original docu-
ment, with the new file incorporated.
When the file is imported, Writer shows the bottom of the page, the last line
of the inserted material. Jump back to the top by scrolling, or try one of the
Writer shortcuts: Press Ctrl+Home to move to the first line of text. The new,
more interesting document, is shown in Figure 9-4. The bottom-left corner of
the window in Figure 9-4 shows that this is Page 1 of 204 total pages.

Chapter 9: Composing Documents with Writer

Altering the appearance of text
You can make a title appealing by making the text bold, centered, or larger:
 To apply bold, follow these steps:
1. Select the text with the mouse (click+drag with the left button). 
2. While the text is highlighted, click the Bold button (with the B
on it) on the Formatting toolbar. 
Figure 9-4:

Figure 9-3:

188
Part III: Becoming Productive with StarOffice 

The toolbar is shown in Figure 9-5, split into two lines to make it
easier to read.
 To center the material, click the Center Text button on the same toolbar.
(The button looks like four tiny lines, center-aligned.)
 To make the text larger, select a font size from the Font Size menu. (In
Figure 9-4, the menu says 12 to indicate that the text is 12 points in size.)
A variety of font sizes are shown in the pop-up menu; choose your
favorite to select it.
With the addition of a judiciously placed carriage return to make the center-
ing look good, the title looks much better. 
You can make many additional changes in Writer. For example, you can select
THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER and then choose Format➪Paragraph. 
The resulting Paragraph dialog box is complex, as shown in Figure 9-6.

The many

Figure 9-5:

189
Chapter 9: Composing Documents with Writer

The Paragraph dialog box in Figure 9-6 has many more options than the
Microsoft Word equivalent. It features eight tabs along the top: 
 Indents & Spacing
 Alignment
 Text Flow
 Numbering
 Tabs
 Drop Caps
 Borders
 Background
StarOffice has an extensive, well-written online help system accessible from
just about anywhere in the program. It’s well worth using, whether you’re a
Writer neophyte or pro. Just click the Help button.
Tweaking colors
Tweak the paragraph spacing, with the intent of applying a background color
to make the head “THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER” stand out even more on
the page. 
The default top and bottom spacing (the spacing above and below the cur-
rently selected paragraph) is 0.00cm. 
To change the inter-paragraph spacing, click on the tiny up arrow adjacent to
the current spacing indicator to increase it to the desired amount. For example,
to change the current value to 0.20cm, click the tiny up arrow twice.
1. Click the Background tab to access an attractive color selection section
of the Paragraph dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-7.
2. Select a color from the bottom row.
The large blank box on the right fills with the selected color. In this
example, I selected dark violet.
3. Click OK.
You see the colorful, but slightly confusing results, as shown in Figure 9-8.
Because the original text is selected, it’s shown in the inverse color to
the background of the paragraph. Your display should have a weird light
green for the text selected and dark violet for the rest of that line.
190
Part III: Becoming Productive with StarOffice 

Change the color of the text to white so it has more contrast with the dark
violet and is therefore easier to read. 
Because the text is still selected, click the Font Color button (with the small 
A on it), which is third from the right on the Formatting bar. (If you move your
mouse over the button, the pop-up says Font Color to confirm it’s the correct

Chapter 9: Composing Documents with Writer

selection.) You see the same color palette shown earlier in the Paragraph
Background selection (and also shown here in Figure 9-9). This time choose
white instead of dark violet.
While the text is still selected, click the Bold button to make it bold and then
click the Typeface Selection pop-up (it probably says Thorndale by default). 
The resulting menu lists all known typefaces, in each typeface (a helpful way
of seeing which typeface is best for your needs). Choose Arial Black.
Click somewhere on the page other than the headline you’ve been improving.
The headline text is deselected, enabling you to see the attractive white on
dark violet headline, as shown somewhat less colorfully in Figure 9-10.

Part III: Becoming Productive with StarOffice 

Using Styles
If you apply formatting to every word individually in a large document, it
might take a bit of time to turn a plain text file into an attractive and highly
readable document. You can speed up this process with styles.
The most common task with styles is to apply a given style to a passage of
text. To create styles, you have to define them. This, fortunately, is easy.
Go back to the new colorful headline and select the text on that line, then
open the Stylist window with either of these steps:
 Press the F11 key 
 Choose Format➪Stylist
The Stylist window opens, as shown in Figure 9-11.
Presented in very small type, this window can be a bit baffling, but the
mouseover pop-ups are a lifesaver here: Move the cursor over any of the tiny
buttons to see a short description of the corresponding function.
Figure 9-11 shows about 20 predefined styles, including ten levels of headers,
First Line Indent, Hanging Indent, Signature, and Marginalia.
To create a new style, follow these steps:
Figure 9-11:
Working
with the
Writer
Stylist
window.
193
Chapter 9: Composing Documents with Writer

1. Click the New Style from Selection button, which is the second button
from the right.
The Create Style dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-12.
2. Type in the style name — for example, “White on Purple Head” —
and click OK.
Now the Stylist window includes the new style you’ve just defined. 
3. Close the Stylist window by clicking the small Close button in the top-
right corner of the window.
Applying a style to text
Using styles to ensure consistency across a document is a tremendous boon
to both the speed and accuracy of your document production.
You can also create special documents that are simply a collection of prede-
fined styles by reading the Template section in the online help.
To apply a style to text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text.
2. Click the Apply Style pop-up menu on the left edge of the Formatting
toolbar (it probably says Default).
The pop-up menu shows styles defined for this document only. It’s
rather short currently, as shown in Figure 9-13.
3. Select a style.
To apply a defined style to the selected text, click on the correct style
name. For example, I select White on Purple Head. All the character and
paragraph styles (typeface, size, bold, text and background color) are
applied to the new material, as shown in Figure 9-14.
Figure 9-12:
Create a
new style in
Writer.
194
Part III: Becoming Productive with StarOffice 

Saving Documents
When you’ve finished entering, editing, and formatting a document, save 
the document to your disk. There are a couple of easy ways to save the 
document: 
 Click the small floppy disk button on the Function toolbar.
 Choose File➪Save. 
Either way, the Save As dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-15.

195
Chapter 9: Composing Documents with Writer

As with the Open dialog box, the buttons on the top right enable you to 
 Move up one directory level
 Create a new directory at the current location
 Jump to the default directory (usually your home directory). 
You can create a new subdirectory if needed, by clicking on the New Folder
button to open the Create New Folder dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-16. 
In this example, I’m going to create a new folder called Library for the newly 
formatted version of Gulliver’s Travels. 
1. Type in the name, as shown in Figure 9-16, and then click OK. 
The directory is created and now shows up on the directories list. 
2. Move to the new directory and double-click on it to move into the new
location. 
For example, I double-click Library to move into it. It’s empty, so no files
or directories are shown.
Picking the optimal document format
Click the File Type pop-up menu to see a rather bewildering array of docu-
ment format options. Of these, the most useful formats are

Part III: Becoming Productive with StarOffice 

 StarOffice 6.0 Text Document (the default)
 Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP (the most modern Microsoft Word format). 
With this format, include a .doc filename suffix so Microsoft Word recog-
nizes the file. 
 Rich Text Format, which many e-mail readers and word processing 
systems can read. 
With this format, include an .rtf filename suffix so other programs 
recognize the file.
If you save a Writer document as Web Page, the quality of the HTML
(Hypertext Markup Language, lingua franca of the World Wide Web) is poor.
Testing Cross-Platform Compatibility
I’ll use the ftp program to transfer the document from the Solaris system to
a PC running Windows XP. On that system, the file appears with the Microsoft
Word icon. 
Double-clicking the icon produces the result shown in Figure 9-17.

The Rest of StarOffice
In This Chapter
 Balancing your accounts with Calc
 Creating graphics with Draw
 Building great presentations with Impress
 Designing quick-and-dirty Web pages with Writer
T
his chapter offers an overview of some terrific tools included in the
StarOffice suite, including Calc, the spreadsheet program; Draw, the
graphics editor; Impress, the presentation development tool; and the Web
page builder within Writer. (Chapter 9 covers the Writer word processing 
program in detail.)
More than just a bunch of office-related programs thrown together, StarOffice
has more integration than most Unix programs. Each program has hooks to
allow invocation of the other programs, graphics and text elements can often
be copied and pasted without loss of format, and the interfaces are consis-
tent and coherent.
In addition to Writer, Calc, Draw, and Impress, the full set of programs in
StarOffice includes some shortcut applications for writing specific types 
of documents in Writer (Agenda, Fax, Label, Letter, and Memo); the mathe-
matical formula editor Math; V Card, a tool for making business cards; and a
macro programming language called Star Basic for customizing the appear-
ance and behavior of the StarOffice applications.
Balancing Accounts with Calc
When I started using computers, I remember thinking that word-processing
was clearly useful, but spreadsheets? Why would I ever need one of those?
Time passes, and now I spend almost as much time creating and tuning com-
plex multisheet spreadsheets as I do creating word-processing documents.
Once you get the hang of working with spreadsheets, they’re fun. Honest!

Here’s how to use Calc to create a straightforward checkbook manager. A
checkbook ledger has a small number of fields: For each transaction, you
need to track the date, the check number, whether it’s cleared the bank and
shown up on your statement, to whom the check was written, the amount of
the check, and a running balance for the account.
A few other transactions can appear in the ledger, too: 
 An initial balance
 Deposits made
 Bank service charges
For those transactions, create a Credits column, and for the check amounts,
create a Debits column, just to sound like financial mavens!
After you start Calc — probably by choosing it off the GNOME menu or CDE
toolbar — the initial view is busy, as shown in Figure 10-1.
I prefer to dismiss the Navigator window floating atop the main spreadsheet.
After doing that, you can get into the serious business of building the check-
book ledger.
Figure 10-1:
Calc starts

Part III: Becoming Productive with StarOffice 

Text and numbers
To enter data into a spreadsheet, click a box and then type the words or 
numbers. Press Tab to move horizontally to the next field, or Enter to move
to the next spreadsheet line. Enter the following words into the columns in
the first row: 
 Check Number
 Date
 Description
 Cleared?
 Credit
 Debit
 Balance
Next, move the cursor to the edge of the column labels and drag the columns
to maker them wider or narrower so that each has a sensible amount of
space (for example, the Description column is nice and wide, whereas
Cleared? is narrow). To widen the Description column, move the cursor 
over the line between the C and D boxes and then click+drag to the right.
You can center all the column headers by selecting them all and clicking the
Center Data button on the Formatting toolbar (it’s the button with four little
lines, centered, in a box), and you can make them all bold by clicking the B
button. Finally, to jazz up the spreadsheet, click the Background Color button
on the Formatting toolbar (it’s the fourth button from the right). Choose
Green 8 as a background. (Green is a better color to associate with a check-
book balance than red!)
The end result, with an initial balance and single check entered, looks like
Figure 10-2.

201
Chapter 10: The Rest of StarOffice

Formulas
The Balance field isn’t a value; it’s a formula. Formulas are the heart of
spreadsheets because they allow changes in a value to ripple through the
entire set of calculations. Formulas are simply an equation composed of con-
stant values, functions, and references to other cells in the spreadsheet. The
balance is always the balance from the previous line plus any credits, minus
any debits. Spreadsheets tend to think in terms of column x row terms.
Because the current cell is G3 (row 1 is the column titles, row 2 is the starting
balance), the balance in the cell above is G2, the credits value for this row is
E3, and the debits value for this row is F3. Here’s the actual formula you need
to enter in the cell:
=G2+E3-F3
The = at the beginning tells Calc that you’re entering a formula. You can also
have numbers in a formula. If you want to pretend your balance is better than
it is, you can use =G2+3*E3-F2 to triple any deposit!
Add a few more checkbook entries, and perhaps a deposit, and you can dis-
cover a fabulous capability of Calc. If you copy the formula cell in G3 (from
the first checkbook entry) and paste it into each subsequent balance box,
The spreadsheet will adjust the cell reference values appropriately. No fuss,
no hassle. The result is shown in Figure 10-3.
I could talk about spreadsheets for at least the next 150 pages. You can add
more format, layout, and mathematical sophistication to your spreadsheet if
you opt to learn more. Calc interoperates gracefully with Microsoft Excel and
Lotus 1-2-3, among other popular spreadsheet programs.

Creating Graphics with Draw
Whether you’re a talented digital artist or just need to create a crude diagram
for a presentation, StarOffice Draw offers the power and capabilities you
need. Launched from the GNOME startup menu or CDE toolbar, it starts up
with almost as many toolbars and buttons as Writer, as shown in Figure 10-4.
Gallery
If you aren’t an artist, you’ll be glad to know that Draw has a gallery of clip
art and other graphical objects that you can drop into an existing drawing.
To access it, choose Tools➪Gallery. A new Gallery window pops up with
many categories of graphics and sound files, as shown in Figure 10-5.
To add a graphic from the gallery to an existing page in Draw, right-click the
graphic and choose Insert➪Copy from the pop-up menu. I chose the ambu-
lance cartoon from the Problem Solving images in the gallery.
Closing the Gallery window is a bit confusing. If you click the close window
icon, you close the entire Draw application. Not good. If you want to have it
almost vanish but still linger a bit, click the upward-pointing triangle button
Figure 10-4:
StarOffice
Draw offers
a cornu-
copia of
drawing
tools.
203
Chapter 10: The Rest of StarOffice

in the lower-left corner of the Gallery window. That minimizes the window
and leaves a small additional toolbar just below the function bar. Click that,
and the gallery reappears instantly. If you want it to just go away, choose
Tools➪Gallery again, and it’ll vanish.
Main toolbar
Confusingly, the main toolbar in Draw is the set of functions down the left
side of the window. It includes such tools as 
 Text
 Rectangle
 Ellipse
 3-D Object
 Rotate
 Draw Arrow (or Line)
 Connect Objects 
To add text to my picture, I click the T button to bring up the Text tool. The
Object bar (the second horizontally oriented toolbar) changes to reflect 
text-editing options, including 
 Typeface
 Size
 Style
 Alignment
 Spacing
Figure 10-5:

I’ll stick with the Thorndale typeface, bump up the size to 36 points, add
bold, and then click the spot in the drawing where I want text. A blob of drag
handles (the tiny green boxes on the edges of a rectangle in Draw) appears;
just type and ignore that momentarily. I’ll type in National Ambulance Drivers
Association Picnic. Then, while the text object is still selected, I left-click and
drag an edge of the box to the desired spot in the drawing. The result is
shown in Figure 10-6.
To wrap the new text with a rectangle with rounded corners, click the
Rectangle tool on the main toolbar and hold down the mouse button. A
tiny pop-up menu shows the various rectangle choices; choose the unfilled,
rounded-edge rectangle. Then release the button, move the mouse to the 
top-left corner of the desired rectangle, and click and drag the rectangle to
surround the text. The size marks are replaced by the rounded-corner
rectangle.
If elements are squished together, click an element to select it. (When selected,
the object gets drag handles and a bounding rectangle.) Then click and drag
the object to its new place on the page.
Cool backgrounds
To add a background fill to the entire page, use the Rectangle tool (with 90-
degree corners) to define a rectangle the exact size of the page. Then click
the Fill button on the Object toolbar (it’s a tiny paint bucket spilling blue

paint), which opens the Area dialog box. Click the Bitmaps tab and select the
sky graphic, as shown in Figure 10-7.
The sky graphic completely covers the text and graphic, but don’t panic!
With the new area still selected, click the Arrange button (two tiny gray
boxes on the corners of a larger yellow box) and hold down the mouse
button until the layering options appear. Select Send to Back, and watch 
what happens.
To finish up, let’s apply a color fill to the newly created button shape, then
ensure that the button label is visible over the new fill. Click the rounded-
rectangle that’s surrounding the text and then click the Fill button (the paint
bucket). Click the Colors tab, select White, and click OK. Again, you need to
push the graphic back so it’s behind the text. This time, don’t send it all the
way to the back. Just choose Send Backward. 
Building Presentations with Impress
If you work in a business environment or are an educator, you’re used to pre-
senting complex ideas to colleagues or students. Whether it’s the history of
the Plantagenet family or the latest budget projections, knowing how to pack-
age your material as an attractive presentation is a great boon. That’s the
purpose of Impress. It’s the equivalent of Microsoft PowerPoint and borrows
many ideas from that ubiquitous application.
The easiest way to start StarOffice Impress is by starting Writer. Really.
In many ways, Writer is the core StarOffice application. The Impress program
is really Writer in disguise.

Starting a presentation
With Writer running, choose File➪New➪Presentation, which starts the
AutoPilot Presentation wizard. (Sun doesn’t actually call it a wizard. That’s
either because of a philosophical disagreement with Mr. Potter or Mr. Gates;
I’ll let you decide.)
1. Decide whether you want to create a new presentation or open an
existing presentation, as shown in Figure 10-8.
Because I want to create a new presentation, I opt for the Empty
Presentation choice and click Next. The next window offers various slide
designs. 
2. Select a slide design, ensure that the output medium is correct 
(probably Screen), and then click Next.
I suggest one of the wonderful designs already defined in this library. 
My favorites include Celestial, Film Strip, Mondrian, and Mountain. For
this presentation, Celestial will work just great. 
3. Choose the slide transition effects and the type of presentation, as
shown in Figure 10-9. 
Because the new presentation is for a group of students, I opt for
Dissolve. There are some more exciting transitions here, including my
favorite, Spiral Inward Clockwise. 
Depending on how fast your Solaris system is, you might also adjust the
speed of the transition: Too fast, and it’ll be missed, but too slow, and
annoyed members of your audience will be yelling, “Just get to the next
slide already!”

Entering data 
When you’re ready to begin composing the Impress slides, click Create to
build the skeleton of the new presentation.
Impress knows how to work with many types of slides, but usually the Title,
Text Slides option works best. Choose it and then click OK. Now you can
enter some data into this first slide.
1. Click the text Click to Add Title and type in the title of the first slide. 
2. Click to Add an Outline and add a few points; use Tab to move points
to subpoints, and Enter to move to the next point. 
I’ll use a title of “All about Tintin” and an introductory outline, as shown
in Figure 10-10. This figure also shows the slide layout and automatically
applied text size and layout.
3. To add other slides, click Insert Slide in the Presentation mini-
window, or choose Insert➪New Slide. 
4. You can preview the newly created slide show with the many options
on the Slide Show menu. 
One notable option is Slide Show, which launches a full-screen presentation
of every slide, perfect for when you give the presentation.

Developing Web Pages 
The Web page editor in StarOffice, sometimes called StarOffice Web for the
command-line script sweb that launches the program, is really just Writer
wearing yet another hat.
Chapter 9 covers other aspects of Writer.
StarOffice Web produces obsolete HTML (as does Writer). While consistent
with HTML 3.2, most of how StarOffice approaches formatting specific ele-
ments (such as the extensive use of the FONT tag) has been replaced with
the more powerful Cascading Style Sheets of HTML 4.0. If you’re planning a
complex Web page, you would do well to consider a more sophisticated tool.
If you’re building something simple, this is probably not a big deal.
The best way to begin editing an HTML page is to choose File➪New➪HTML
Document. This pops up a blank page in Writer that appears almost identical
to a blank document. The only difference is that the default text style is Text
Body instead of Default.
Figure 10-10:
The first

209
Chapter 10: The Rest of StarOffice

Simply enter the text you want, formatting normally in Writer, centering, and
so on.
 To create HTML-specific items, choose the text as appropriate and then
apply the proper style.
 To add a horizontal rule, move the cursor to an appropriate spot and
then choose Horizontal Line from the Style pop-up menu.
 To create a level one header, select the desired text and then apply the
Heading 1 style.
 To insert a hyperlink, move to the desired spot and then choose
Insert➪Hyperlink, which brings up the Hyperlink dialog box, shown in
Figure 10-11.
I filled in the two key fields in Figure 10-11: 
• URL to reference 
• Text displayed on the page
Enter the link information and click Apply to have the link added to the
Web page. (The dialog box doesn’t go away. Just click the Close button
to close it.)
One annoyance is that the link is included in tiny text. Again, simply select
the hyperlink and then change the typeface size. You can also center the link,
as I’ve done on my page. The result of my efforts is shown in Figure 10-12.
To view the HTML source of the page, choose View➪HTML Source. The
source HTML is shown for the developing page, as shown in Figure 10-13.

T
here’s not much value to having lots of ﬁles in your
Solaris account if you can’t work with them, so this
part introduces you to the key command line tools and
GUI-based applications for viewing ﬁles, analyzing ﬁle con-
tent, editing ﬁles with vi, CDE Text Editor or the GNOME
Text Editor. In addition, you’ll get to explore some of the
internals of Solaris to understand what processes are run-
ning and how to interact with them or — if you’re feeling
particularly aggressive — kill them. The last chapter in
this part discusses two commands near and dear to every
Solaris guru: ﬁnd and grep. Both are deﬁnitely worth
study, as you’ll see!

Chapter 11
Exploring Text Files
In This Chapter
 Viewing files within the graphical user interface (GUI)
 Viewing files at the command line
 Analyzing files with wc and spell
O
ne of the most common tasks that you’ll encounter working with a
computer is viewing and editing text files. Whether they’re Web pages
written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), e-mail messages written in
plain text, or programs written in Perl or C, you’ll probably find yourself
spending an awful lot of time reading material on your screen and digitally
manipulating words.
To that end, in this chapter, I focus on ways to view and analyze the contents
of files by using standard Solaris tools, starting with the graphical user inter-
face–based Text Note application. Then I jump directly to the command line
and the remarkable capabilities available at your disposal there. Read on
here to garner the basic tools you need to maneuver these tools before you
begin editing within them. (Get the skinny on editing in Chapter 15.)
Viewing Files within the GUI
The easiest way to view the contents of a file is, logically enough, to double-
click it while in the graphical user interface (GUI). Unlike Windows and Macs, a
couple of graphical environments are available within the Solaris environment:
 My preference is the GNU Network Object Management Environment
(GNOME). 
 You may personally prefer either of these environments:
• Common Desktop Environment
• The stripped, minimalist TWM (think nihilist, and you’ll have the
basic idea of TWM)

When you double-click a text file icon (typically visually identified as a small
rectangle with dots that looks like a piece of paper with writing, from about
25 feet away), the window manager launches the program it thinks is the best
match for that file type. Sometimes files have different icons and can also be
identified by their suffixes. Many text files are for specific purposes and
might have different icons, including
 .html for Web pages
 .c for C Programming Language source code files
 .sh for shell scripts
Viewing in GNOME
Suppose that you’re perusing your file system with Nautilus (the file system
browser if you’re running GNOME) or the Common Desktop Environment
(CDE) file viewer, and you see a file that’s worth a quick peek. (Chapter 2
explains the Solaris window managers.) Figure 11-1 illustrates how that file
might look in GNOME. Just what is this gullivers.travels.txt file, and
how can you see what’s inside?
In Nautilus, view the contents of a file by simply double-clicking its icon.
Nautilus displays the contents of the file directly in its own window, as shown
in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-1:
Peruse files
with the
GNOME
Nautilus file
browser.
216
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

In Figure 11-2, the text displayed under the file icon on the left side is slightly
chopped off because of a mismatch between screen regions and typeface
size. This doesn’t always happen, but you’ll find this sort of glitch time and
again with GUIs in Unix for reasons that are a bit of a mystery to me. Just grin
and get used to it!
Pay attention to the list of buttons on the left side of the text under the file
icon. Although you can view the contents of the file via Nautilus, you can also
edit it or perhaps feed it to a formatter, compiler, mailer, meat grinder, or
what have you. For a text file, your choices are 
 gedit (the GNOME text editor)
 vi (the default screen-oriented editor used with terminals and xterm
connections) 
 Open With (an open-ended choice that lets you specify whatever pro-
gram your heart might desire, such as emacs or even Netscape
Navigator)
To move into an environment where you can edit this file, select one of the
preceding choices. For example, click the Open with gedit button to open the
file in gedit, as shown in Figure 11-3. Fortunately, your journey of discovery
has had fewer perils than that of Gulliver!
Figure 11-2:

this.
217
Chapter 11: Exploring Text Files

If you choose Open With rather than Open with gedit and enter vi as the
program to use, the file opens in the vi editor, as shown in Figure 11-4.
Browsing in CDE
The CDE file browser, shown in Figure 11-5, is undeniably less attractive than
Nautilus but offers the same basic functions. One of the options on the login
screen is to switch window managers, if you want to use CDE instead of
GNOME for a test run. (Chapter 2 covers this in more depth, if you’re curious.)

218
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

Similar to Nautilus, the CDE file browser displays different icons based on file
type to help you differentiate content. Common icons that you’ll find here
enable you to differentiate between plain text files, HTML documents, and
directories.
Double-clicking the icon for gullivers.travels.txt reveals the contents of
the file, as shown in Figure 11-6.
There is a subtle but important difference between how GNOME and CDE
work: 
 In GNOME, Nautilus displays the file directly without having to launch a
separate program.
 CDE file browser is purely a file-browsing tool. It needs to open Text
Editor to let you see the contents of the file.

219
Chapter 11: Exploring Text Files

Text Editor is a fairly rudimentary text editor, but it works for lightweight
(think quick) editing jobs. If you’ll be doing more complex edit work, consider
a more powerful tool like StarOffice for formatting (see Chapter 9), or vi or
emacs (Chapter 15) for lots of text massaging.
Viewing Files at the Command Line
The command line is plebian, mundane, and visually uninteresting. It’s also 
 Fast
 Flexible
 Capable
Get to the command line by opening a terminal window with either of these
steps: 
 From the GNOME menu within GNOME
 On the CDE control bar, the Local Computer option on the pop-up menu
above the CPU monitor
Solaris is case sensitive. Ls and ls are two different commands; only one will
work as you want.
To view a directory, for example, use the handy ls (list files) command with
the -F flag to have directories marked with a trailing / character. Why bother
with -F? Because if you’re looking at a large directory, being able to immedi-
ately see which are directories and which are files can be helpful. You’ll see
the following display ($ is the shell prompt; your shell prompt may be differ-
ent, but the command you type is identical):
$ ls -F
gullivers.travels.txt   README                  snaps/
nsmail/                 scripts/                test
As shown in Figure 11-1, there’s no question that exploring the file system
with a GUI-based tool is more attractive and probably easier to understand.
But what if you want to see all the files with their exact size, permissions, and
date of creation? How do you accomplish that in the GUI browser? It’s not so
easy.
At the command line, you simply add an additional command flag — -l — for
long listing format:
220
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

$ ls -lF
total 1192
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other  592673 Oct  4 09:56 gullivers.travels.txt
drwx------   2 taylor   other     512 Oct  4 13:26 nsmail/
-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other      75 Oct  4 12:52 README
drwxr-xr-x   2 taylor   other     512 Oct  4 13:26 scripts/

-rw-r--r--   1 taylor   other       0 Oct  4 10:02 test
The preceding example gives the important information about the file:
 You can see how big gullivers.travels.txt actually is: 592,673 bytes
(line 3). 
 Only the owner (taylor) can write to the file (edit its contents). 
 It was created on October 4 at 9:56 a.m. (line 3).
The sequence of characters at the beginning of each line of output is the per-
mission string:
 The first character indicates the file type in the first space:
• - is a regular file.
• d is a directory.
 The following characters are interpreted in three-character sets: 
• Owner read, write, and/or execute
• Group
• Everyone else
In the preceding example, the gullivers.travels.txt file is read + write
for owner, and read-only for group and everyone else. Chapter 4 has a
detailed discussion of this important topic.
To see the contents of a file, use the cat command. Two of its most useful
features are the ability to
 Number all the lines of input (-n) 
 Show all the otherwise hidden and mysterious control characters (-v),
such as ^M and ^J
A typical use of cat is to peek inside an executable file or graphics file.
221
Chapter 11: Exploring Text Files

Here’s what happens when I peek into the contents of one of the XPM (X
Windows Pixel Map) format screen shots for this chapter. For this example, I
start by using cat and then enlist the head command to constrain the results
to only the first ten lines so that I’m not drowned in output:
$ cd snaps
$ cat -v ch1101.xpm | head -10
/* XPM */
static char * ch1101_xpm[] = {
“811 576 76 1”,
“       c #000000000000”,
“.      c #00002020AAAA”,
“X      c #000000005555”,
“o      c #000020200000”,
“O      c #333340405555”,
“+      c #000020205555”,
“@      c #333320200000”,
Adding the -n flag changes this output:
$ cat -nv ch1101.xpm | head -10
1  /* XPM */
2  static char * ch1101_xpm[] = {
3  “811 576 76 1”,
4  “       c #000000000000”,
5  “.      c #00002020AAAA”,
6  “X      c #000000005555”,
7  “o      c #000020200000”,
8  “O      c #333340405555”,
9  “+      c #000020205555”,
10  “@      c #333320200000”,
222
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 
Of cats and dogs
The cat command is short for concatenate, not
named after one of our feline friends. The Unix
command biff is named after a dog, but that’s
another story! Don’t try to use cat with lengthy
files because invoking the cat command has a
very important characteristic: It doesn’t stop
until it’s done showing you the entire file.
Of course, you can try it on a very long file if you
have some patience. When I used the cat com-
mand on the gullivers.travels.txt file,
it only took approximately nine seconds on my
high-speed connection. With a slow modem,
well . . . you could easily pop into the kitchen for
a quick cup of tea while you’re waiting for the
file display to finish scrolling.

Adding the -n flag adds line numbers.
Consider what tools you want to be able to read text here at the command
line.
The basic shell program for displaying a file one page at a time is more,
named after its ever-present prompt at the end of each screenful. Just specify
the program and the name of the file to view. In this example, enter the fol-
lowing line:
more gullivers.travels.txt
The results are shown in Figure 11-7.
To proceed to the next screenful of information, press the spacebar. To move
down only a single line, press Enter.
The more program seems pretty simple, but it has quite a few options, includ-
ing starting options and commands available at the more prompt. The most
useful starting flags are listed in Table 11-1.
Table 11-1
Useful Starting Flags for more

Use
-s
Squeezes multiple blank lines to one. Very helpful if
you’re viewing files that have lots of empty lines.
-n
Shows only n lines per screenful. For example: -20.
+n
Starts at line n in the file. For example: +120.
+/ptrn
Starts a few lines above the first line in the file that
matches ptrn.

Chapter 11: Exploring Text Files

When you’re at the more prompt, you have oodles of options. You can see
them all by pressing ? (the question mark key). The list is a bit cryptic, so let
me note that when it references ‘k’ lines of text, it means that you can type in
a numeric value, then the command to have the command use the specified
value rather than the default. For example, 8f will skip forward eight screen-
fuls of information, while f by itself skips one screen.
Most commands optionally preceded by integer argument k.  Defaults in brackets.
Star (*) indicates argument becomes new default.

.                       Repeat previous command
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The most useful of these commands available within the more program are
 space: Shows the next screenful of information
 q: To quit without seeing the rest of the file
 /ptrn: To search for a pattern (and n to search for it again)
 v: To drop the file into vi and allow editing
 :n: To move to the next file if you specify a list of files to the program
Although it might not seem like there’s much you can do with the more com-
mand, a number of different text file pager programs are available in Unix,
although not all are available in all versions. For Solaris 9, functionally similar
commands include
 less
 pg
 page
224
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

To use them, your best bet is to check out the man pages (type man less at
the shell prompt, for example) or just try them on a file.
Using more and page move you forward in the file, and using less and pg can
let you go back screenfuls if you decide that you want to either
 Start over
 See what’s been displayed earlier
If you’re in a terminal or xterm that has scrolling and a scrollback buffer, this
capability is probably irrelevant because you can always move back through
that mechanism.
Analyzing Files with wc and spell
Although you have little apparent advantage to viewing files at the command
line when compared with a slick graphical interface like GNOME, the ability
to analyze and understand the contents of files through command utilities is
part of what makes the command line shine as an interactive environment.
You can count lines, words, and characters, discover spelling errors, and list
all spelling gaffes in your documents.
Like the proverbial multitude of ways to skin a cat (which is a rather disgust-
ing image if you think about it), you have a wide variety of ways to slice and
dissect a text file by using the Unix command line and the hundreds of avail-
able commands. You can do much more here than just view a file page by
page — you can calculate the most commonly used word in the file, the aver-
age length of a word, the average sentence complexity, the number of words,
and even words that seem misspelled.
Making every word count with the wc
command
To find out how many words are in the file gullivers.travels.txt, use the
wc (word count) command:
$ wc gullivers.travels.txt
10382  106405  592673 gullivers.travels.txt
225
Chapter 11: Exploring Text Files

This output tells you that the file has 10,382 lines, 106,405 words, and 592,673
characters. If you imagine that you’re on a 25-line terminal window, you’d have
a rather exhausting 416 screenfuls to read the entire story (10,382 ÷ 25 = 416).
(Be glad that you’re not reading this file over a typical cell phone with about
a 6-line display because you’d have to wade through 1,700 screens to read
this short novel on your favorite Nokia or Ericsson!)
Counting words can also be important if you’re a writer or student. As a
writer, you often receive assignments similar to “write 500 words about . . .”
or “your article can’t be more than 900 words total.” Now you know an easy
way to ascertain this number without having to count by hand. In fact, you
can specify -l, -w, and -c for lines, words, and characters, respectively. In
the following, I only want to find the word count (wc -w) for this file:
$ wc -w gullivers.travels.txt
106405 gullivers.travels.txt
Korect yur speling with spell
Assuming that you can correctly type the name of the command, you can
extract a list of misspelled words on the command line by using the spell
command. 
Drop the more command at the end of a pipe, and you can stop the flow of
information before it begins scrolling off your screen.

Spelling-wise, well, the spell program isn’t too bright with words that it 
doesn’t know. The ordinals (11th, 20th, and so on) are all flagged as misspellings
even though they’re really not. The word acquitted is spelled correctly, so seeing
it flagged as a misspelling is curious, too.
Regardless of whether every match is ideal, the program does generate lots
of useful information. In combination with wc, you can quickly figure out how
many spelling errors you have: The -l flag outputs only the number of lines
in the input stream.
$ spell gullivers.travels.txt  | wc -l
500
Five hundred spelling errors! Gack!
One way to address this overly generous listing of spelling mistakes is to use
a filter that automatically removes files that match a certain pattern. For
example, you can chop out any word that begins with a capital letter and any
word that contains a digit.
The easiest way to accomplish this is to use egrep, which is a cousin of the
grep command. egrep works with regular expressions, a powerful, albeit
arcane, set of pattern notations that look like gobbledygook but can detail
just about anything. Here’s how you can set it up:
1. Start with the (a|b) notation to indicate that you want to match
either pattern A or pattern B. 
For the first pattern, there are two elements:
• Specify a capital letter — [A-Z]. 
• Indicate that it should appear at the beginning of the line by pref-
acing the set with the special character ^. 
Put them together, and your first pattern is ^[A-Z]. 
2. The second pattern is a range of digits in a set that looks like this: 
[0-9]
3. An important egrep flag is also required: -v.
The -v flag reverses the logic of the match so that all lines that don’t
match the pattern (or patterns) are allowed.
227
Chapter 11: Exploring Text Files

It all combines to look like this:
$ spell gullivers.travels.txt | egrep -v ‘(^[A-Z]|[0-9])’ |
more
abstersives
acquitted
adamantine
analysed
aperitives
apophlegmatics
arbitress

bedchamber
beeves
behaviour
bemired
bevil
biassed
bliffmarklub
blustrugs
bolus
burthen

calentures

--More--
This clearly removes some of the false errors. How many? That’s a job for wc
and its ever-helpful -l line-count-only flag:
$ spell gullivers.travels.txt | egrep -v ‘(^[A-Z]|[0-9])’ |
wc -l
293
This output is useful, but only a tiny portion of the screen is being used
because of the one-word-per-line output format. To turn this output into a
multiple column format, use the paste command.
Unlike most Solaris commands that have all their flags prefaced by a dash (or
minus symbol or hyphen, depending on how you want to look at it), the
paste command uses the dashes as a format request:
 Use two dashes to create a two-column output. 
 Use four dashes to create a four-column output.
228
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

Here’s an example:
1. Save the list of spelling errors into a temporary file so that you don’t
have to scan through the entire novel each time you test a command.
You can easily do this with the > file redirection, which saves all the
spelling errors in a new file errors instead of streaming them on your
screen:
$ spell gullivers.travels.txt | egrep -v ‘(^[A-Z]|[0-9])’
> errors
$ wc -l errors
293 errors
2. Feed that file to the paste command and see what happens.
This step streams the file contents without pausing for screenfuls by
using these commands:
• cat
• paste
One column of data changes to four (count the number of dashes speci-
fied to the paste command to see where four came from):
$ cat errors | paste - - - - | more

This isn’t the most attractive output (because it isn’t in neatly aligned
columns), but if you can handle the messy results, it lets you review 100 of
the 293 errors on a single screen.
If you want to learn Perl or awk, there are relatively straightforward ways to
turn this into a neat page of aligned columns: 
 For the skinny on Perl, check out Perl For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Paul
Hoffman (Wiley Publishing). 
 The best awk reference is online (it’s for GNU awk, but it’s functionally
identical to Solaris awk):

GUI versus the Command-Line Interface
Every time that I talk about how to do things in Solaris, I seem to get stuck on
the same crazy debate: graphical interface versus command-line interface: 
 Which is faster? 
 Which is easier? 
In this case, consider viewing text files because that’s a nice, constrained cat-
egory for discussion. In a nutshell, the advantages to using a GUI interface are
the following:
 You can change the typeface used to display the text.
 You can fine-tune the colors and typeface size to make them as legible
and readable as possible.
 You can position your cursor over the down arrow and then read page
after page with a simple click of the mouse.
 You can manage graphics.
Obviously, you can’t display a lovely new JPEG image of your dad’s new
motorcycle in a text-based environment. The main advantages of a graphical
interface really don’t surface until you step beyond simple text and get into
either 
 Formatted text (like this book, with bold, italics, different type faces, dif-
ferent sizes of type, and so on) 
 Graphics 
230
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

The advantages of a command-line interface are
 You can change the typeface, colors, and size to make the terminal
window itself as readable as possible.
Well, that’s not entirely fair because a number of people connect to
Solaris systems through simple terminal interface programs or even
dumb terminals (ya know, physical hardware, the kind of things you saw
geeky engineers with gleaming pocket protectors staring at in horror in
those 1960s sci-fi thrillers), and they definitely aren’t very customizable.
 You can use a paging program (like more) to view text so each time you
press the spacebar, you move forward a screenful.
 The command-line interface is way faster than a GUI.
One of the main arguments for a command-line interface is speed. Even
with the fastest new Solaris system, the command line and its text-based
interface are markedly faster than working in a graphical environment.
Speed might not matter if you’re scrolling a novel page by page, but if
you frequently work with text files, being able to get that extra perfor-
mance boost due to the increased efficiencies and power of the
command line might prove to be worthwhile.

Editing Files
In This Chapter
 Working with the CDE Text Editor
 Editing with the GNOME Text Editor
 Using the vi text editor
I
n the world of Solaris, most files are plain text without fancy typographic
material, whether text, shell scripts, Web pages, or even C programs. No
bold, no multiple font colors, no included graphics. Just text.
As a result, most Solaris users use vi, a powerful — albeit tricky to learn —
text-only editor that lets you enter and modify text quickly.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of the text-editing tools in both
CDE and GNOME and focuses primarily on how to work with the vi editor. 
Working with the CDE Text Editor
To launch Text Editor in the CDE environment, you can double-click an exist-
ing text file or start with a blank palette, an empty file. To start with a blank
palette, click the arrow button immediately above the note icon on the CDE
navigational bar (as shown in Figure 12-1) and then select Text Editor from
the pop-up menu.
The editor starts with a blank window, as expected. Notice in Figure 12-2 that
the new document has no name yet — (UNTITLED) is listed in the window’s
title bar — and that five menus are available.

From the left, the menus are File, Edit, Format, Options, and, far on the right,
Help. The content of these menus is as follows:
 File: New, Open, Include, Save, Save As, Print, and Close
 Edit: Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Clear, Delete, Select All, Find/Change, and
Check Spelling
 Format: Settings, Paragraph, and All
 Options: Overstrike, Wrap to Fit, Status Line, and Backup on Save
 Help: Overview, Tasks, Table of Contents, Reference, On Item, Using
Help, and About Text Editor
To start, begin typing in some text. Because I’m working with the text from
Gulliver’s Travels, I’ll begin with a brief introductory sentence.
Save yourself a lot of typing. Get a copy of the file gullivers.travels.txt
from the Web at www.intuitive.com/solaris/.

234
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

If you make a mistake when typing in your text, you can either fix it with the
keyboard or mouse: either backspace and fix it, or move the mouse to the
problem spot and either click and erase characters to the left of the cursor
with the Backspace key, or click and drag to select a problem passage, then
either Backspace to delete it, or simply type the correct replacement.
Text wrapping
By default, Text Editor expects you to press Enter each time you want to
move to the next line. That’s why in Figure 12-3 you can only read the last
passage of the introduction I entered. By contrast, most modern text entry
systems wrap the lines of text so that you can see all of your text at once.
Fortunately, you can change this behavior through the Options menu. Choose
Options➪Wrap to Fit. The text is instantly wrapped so that you can see every-
thing entered so far. While you’re working with the Options menu, also choose
Options➪Status Line to enable the editor to show you a useful and informa-
tive status line at the bottom of the window. The result of these two changes
is shown in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4:
Now you
can see all
the text and

Chapter 12: Editing Files

Including content from other files
You can include the content of a file by choosing File➪Include. This opens a
standard CDE file selection dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-5. The example
includes the content of the file gullivers.travels.txt.
If you choose Open rather than Include, the specified file replaces the current
file being edited.
Find the file gullivers.travels.txt (if you haven’t downloaded it yet,
there’s a tip earlier in this chapter telling you where you can find it on the
Web) and then click OK to open it.
The contents are almost instantaneously included into the existing edit
buffer, and you’re dropped down to the last line of text. Drag the scroll bar
marker to the top of the file, and you’ll see how the new material has been
included after the existing text typed in earlier, as shown in Figure 12-6.

Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

Searching and replacing
It’s easy to change all the occurrences of a pattern in text: Choose Edit➪Find/
Change and then enter the old and new patterns in the Find/Change dialog
box. Figure 12-7 changes Gulliver to Kaelin to update an old story a tiny bit.
Click Change All, and voilà! All changes are applied. Mr. Swift might be a wee
tad appalled by this modification of his work, but I’ll claim artistic license and
keep going forward, okay? If you prefer to have Gulliver’s Travels instead of
Kaelin’s Travels, simply choose Edit➪Undo to reverse the changes.
Saving files
Saving the file is easy. Choose File➪Save As, to open the CDE Save As dialog
box, as shown in Figure 12-8.
Figure 12-8:

new
document
as a file.
Figure 12-7:

237
Chapter 12: Editing Files

Figure 12-8 shows that in addition to the standard filter, folder, and files win-
dows, the Save As dialog box contains two unique options regarding how this
file should be saved. You need to choose between these options: 
 Add Newline Characters to the End of Wrap-to-Fit Lines. Select this
option if you don’t want to end up with a lot of extremely long lines.
 Do Not Add Newlines. Only Line Breaks Created by [Return] Will Be
Preserved. If you’re planning to open this file with a program like
StarOffice Writer, you might want to deselect this option so that Writer
can do its own line wrapping based on your formatting options.
Enter the filename, double-check that it’s in the directory you want, and then
click OK to save it. You’re done!
Editing with the GNOME Text Editor
The GNOME Text Editor (often called gedit) works much like the CDE Text
Editor, as will become clear when you follow the same steps with Gulliver’s
Travels within the GNOME environment.
To launch the GNOME Text Editor, either double-click a text file icon or
launch it from the GNOME menu by choosing Applications➪Accessories➪
Text Editor, as shown in Figure 12-9.
The GNOME Text Editor is more visually attractive than the CDE Text Editor,
as shown in Figure 12-10. It’s also more powerful, as suggested by the menu
options. The most obvious difference is the toolbar icons, which are reminis-
cent of StarOffice Writer. From left to right, they are New, Open, Save, Close,
Print, Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Find, and Replace.

One of the most useful menu options is File➪Open Location. As its name sug-
gests, this option enables you to easily open a Web page and examine its
HTML source. You can make edits, but you can’t save the Web page back to
the remote server. Figure 12-11 shows the source to www.sun.com/ as an edit
window.
Figure 12-11:
The GNOME

240
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

gedit offers a tabbed interface element under the toolbar: 
 The original blank document is shown as Untitled 1
 The HTML source is shown as RO – www.sun.com. 
If you guessed that RO is read-only, you’re right!
To get back to the original blank edit window, click Close on the toolbar.
Including other files
Although gedit has more capabilities than the CDE Text Editor, it doesn’t
have any facility to include the file’s source in the existing document. To
work around this, you can use cut and paste.
Click the Open button on the toolbar to open the gullivers.travels.txt
file. You’re presented with a typical GNOME Open File dialog box, as shown in
Figure 12-12. Select the file and click OK.
You now have both the original file, with the one sentence typed in, and the
gullivers.travels.txt file open. Each file has its own tab. 
To copy and paste Gulliver’s Travels, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you’re viewing gullivers.travels.txt (the file you want
to copy)
2. Choose Edit➪
➪Select All to select all the text
3. Click the Copy button on the toolbar to copy the text into the buffer.

4. Click the Untitled 1 tab to switch to the other window
5. Move the cursor below the text that’s typed 
6. Click the Paste button on the toolbar. 
The result is shown in Figure 12-13.
Doing a global search and replace
The basic process of globally searching for a pattern and replacing it with
another is identical to the CDE Text Editor. This time, change Gulliver to Terri
instead of Kaelin. Click the Replace button on the toolbar to open the
Replace dialog box, shown in Figure 12-14.

Figure 12-13:

contents.
242
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

In the Search For box, enter Gulliver, and in the Replace With box, enter
Terri. You also need to decide whether to search from the beginning of the
document, or from the current cursor position through the end of the docu-
ment. Because this is a global search and replace, select the option to search
from the beginning.
Searches in the GNOME Text Editor can be case-sensitive. (For example,
Gulliver will match, but gulliver and GULLIVER will not.) Usually, you want to
select the Case Sensitive option — which is selected by default.
Now you’re ready. Click Replace All, and you’ll see a small results window
that, in this case, shows the message Found and replaced 9
occurrences. A great addition!
Click OK to dismiss the information box, and click Close to dismiss the
Replace dialog box. The new, perhaps improved, Terri’s Travels into Several
Remote Nations of the World is shown.
Saving files
When the file is the way you want it, save it by following these steps:
1. Click the Save button on the toolbar.
Although the graphic makes it look like the Save function is grayed out
(unavailable), pay attention to the word Save instead: If it’s black, you
can use this button.
The Save dialog box pops up, as shown in Figure 12-15.
2. Enter the name you want and ensure that the directory location is 
correct.
3. Click OK.
The file is saved. You’re done!

Chapter 12: Editing Files

Using the vi Text Editor
If you’re a die-hard Solaris user and think that mice and graphical interfaces
are for wimps and newbies, you’re not alone. For those folks seeking speed
over appearance, the vi editor — originally written by Bill Joy while at the
University of California, Berkeley (and now a VP at Sun Microsystems) — is
an excellent answer.
Working with vi is unlike anything you’ve seen so far in this chapter because
you must do everything, from cursor motion to search and replace, from the
keyboard. If this suggests that there’s a bit of a learning curve, you’re right.
But persevere, and you’ll find yourself in excellent company as you discover
how to be a Solaris power user!
The vi editor runs in a terminal window. Chapter 3 explains how to open one.
Understanding modes
Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of vi is that it is a modal editor. These are
the two modes of operation:
 Insert mode: If you’re in insert mode and type an x, the letter is added
to the document at the current cursor point.
 Command mode: If you’re in command mode, the x command causes
the letter under the cursor to be deleted, not added.
Fortunately, there’s a trick to starting up vi that enables a mode display
function on the bottom line of the screen. This display quickly tells you
whether you’re in insert or command mode. Rather than specify the show-
mode feature manually each time you start vi, open a terminal window
and type the following:
echo “set showmode” >> ~/.exrc
Do that once, and you’ve created a custom preferences file for vi (yes, it
should be called .virc, but that’s a long story). You don’t have to ever
think about it again.
Chapter 3 explains the terminal and command shell in depth.
244
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

Starting vi
You can start the vi editor from the command line several ways:
 Type vi on the command line:
$ vi
 Specify the name of an existing file to edit or a new file to create:
$ vi my.new.file
 You can also specify a list of filenames if you want. You can finish editing
the first file, and then move to the second, and so on to modify a batch
of files in sequence.
To parallel the tasks done earlier in this chapter, start vi by specifying the
name you want to create:
$ vi ashley.travels.txt
The result of this command is shown in Figure 12-16.
The File, Edit, View, and other menus are for the terminal application, not vi.
The vi program has no fancy interface elements, just whatever you type at
the keyboard.
Figure 12-16 shows that vi is bare bones. There’s no menu at the bottom, just
a cursor at the top-left corner and a bunch of tilde symbols (~) running down
the left side. The lines prefaced with tilde symbols are placeholders, not part
of the file. They’re beyond the end of the file being edited.
Figure 12-16:

up with a

file.
245
Chapter 12: Editing Files

Entering text 
By default, the editor starts out in command mode: Type an x, and you’ll hear
a beep as the editor tells you that there’s nothing to delete. You can move
into insert mode several ways, depending on where you want to insert text.
In fact, vi has dozens and dozens of commands, enough that I could proba-
bly write vi For Dummies. But I won’t!
I’ll stick with the basics. At the end of this chapter, I suggest some places you
can go online to find out more about vi if you’re interested.
 To insert just before the current cursor location (where the flashing
block is sitting), press i.
 To insert just after the current cursor location, use a to append text.
 To insert just above the current line by creating a new blank line, use O
(capital o).
 To insert into a new blank line just below the current line, use o (lower-
case o).
Jump into this by pressing i and typing in the introductory sentence used
earlier in this chapter. After you type it in, the screen looks like Figure 12-17.
To make this interesting, add a few random nonsense characters at the end of
what you type in.
Notice that the bottom-right corner says INSERT MODE. That’s the show
mode feature giving a visual clue of what mode you’re in.
Figure 12-17:
I just
entered
some text in
insert mode.
246
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

To leave insert mode and get back to command mode, press the magic key —
Esc. Intelligently, the Esc key has no function in command mode. You can
press it any time you want to be in command mode and aren’t sure what
mode you’re in. It just beeps.
Moving in the file 
Because vi has no scroll bars and no mouse support, it has a set of keys that
you can use in command mode to move around. 
On Solaris, you can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard unless you’re
connected remotely, in which case they may or may not work.
The four key movement keys are h, j, k, and l:
 h moves one character to the left.
 j moves one line down.
 k moves one line up.
 l moves one character to the right.
Try using these four keys to move around. If these letters start to appear in
your document, you’re still in insert mode and need to press the Esc key.
 You can move one word at a time with w or b, depending on whether
you want to move forward one word or backward one word. 
 You can jump to the beginning of the line with 0 (zero) and to the end of
the line with $.
 To move page by page, when the file is sufficiently large to have pages of
text, use
• ^F to move forward a page
• ^B to move back a page
• ^D to move down half a page
• ^U to move up half a page
 You can jump to the first line of the file with 0G (zero followed by G) and
to the end of the file with G by itself.
Use motion keys to move to the first letter of the extraneous stuff you added
to the file. Now press the x key a few times. Each time you press it, you
should see the letter under the cursor deleted and the text slide left to fill the
now open hole. Figure 12-18 shows my results after five x commands.
247
Chapter 12: Editing Files

Finish up the delete process so that there are no stray characters. Then use
the a append function to add a few carriage returns immediately after the
period ending the sentence. The cursor should now be on the last line, with
at least one blank line separating it from the text in the file.
Including other files
To include the contents of another file, you need to jump to the vi command
line. 
 You do this by typing :, at which point the cursor immediately jumps to
the bottom-left corner of the screen. 
Type in the following command:
r gullivers.travels.txt
This is shown in Figure 12-19.
Figure 12-19:
Reading a
file into the
buffer.
Figure 12-18:
A few
characters
have been
deleted.
248
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

 After pressing Enter, the contents of the file are injected into the buffer,
exactly as you saw in the GNOME Text Editor and CDE Text Editor. This
result is shown in Figure 12-20.
Doing a global search and replace
One of the ugliest parts of vi is that it’s difficult to perform a global search
and replace without seeing the pistons and oil stains under the hood. Just as
reading in a file required a : prefix to jump to command mode, so does the
search and replace.
The basic idea is that you want the editor to 
 Search for an old pattern 
 Replace it with a new one
In vi terms, this is
s/old/new/
However, this command by itself will only do one replacement on the current
line. 
 You need to preface it with an address selector that specifies the range of
lines from the first to the last. The first line, unsurprisingly, is 1, and the
last line is $. Now you have:
1,$s/old/new/
Figure 12-20:
With
Gulliver’s
Travels
included in
the file.
249
Chapter 12: Editing Files

This is almost what you need. This will replace the first occurrence of
old with new on every line. To have it replace every occurrence of old
with new, add the g suffix to request that the substitution occur globally
on the line. Now, finally, the command:
1,$s/old/new/g
 To specifically change all occurrences of Gulliver to Ashley, the com-
plete command from command mode is
:1,$s/Gulliver/Ashley/g
Type this in, and almost instantaneously you’re looking at Ashley’s
Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World.
 If you don’t want this change applied after all, type u to undo it.
The Solaris version of vi can only undo the most recent command. It’s a little
quirk of vi that takes some getting used to.
 If you apply a global search and replace and then insert some text, the
undo reverses the insertion. 
 If you type u again, it will undo the undo (redo the insertion). 
Saving files
The final step on this journey is to save the new file. You started vi with the
new filename. To save the file with that name, type one of these commands:
 :w writes the file and stays in vi.
 :wq writes the file and quits vi.
ZZ writes out the file if it has changed and then quits, without the command
line (:) sequences.
If you entered more than one file, use :w to write out this file and then :n to
move to the next file on your list.
To quit and discard the changes that you have made, add a ! to the end of
the command, like this:
:q!

Learning more about vi
Although vi might seem too much hassle to
learn, there are a million and one capabilities in
this remarkable editor, including the ability to 
 Feed paragraphs of text to the Solaris com-
mand line and replace the text with the
output of the command
 Read in the output of commands like ls and
uptime into the file buffer
I have used vi for over 20 years and find it at
least five times faster than any mouse- and
cursor-oriented editor. If you’re looking for
speed and are okay with skipping the frosting
and whipped cream of the graphical interface,
it’s worth learning. 
Here are several fine online resources:
 A good start is docs.sun.com. Start with

Controlling Processes
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the top processes
 Identifying running processes
 Managing running processes
T
his chapter delves into the system administration side of Solaris. It
explores processes and the various tools in Solaris that enable you to
identify what programs are consuming the most resources on your system,
how to figure out who is running those processes, and how to manage them
for maximum performance on your Solaris system.
If you’re used to working with a Windows system, you are probably under the
impression that when you’re running a program like Adobe Photoshop that’s
the only thing happening on the computer. That’s far from the truth, though
Windows does go out of its way to hide the rest of the active processes. You
can tell that they’re there if you leave an MP3 player running — it continues
to play music even while you are busy editing photographs — and sometimes
you’ll get pop-ups from other programs like Norton AntiVirus letting you
know an upgrade or update is available.
Solaris, coming from the Unix world, has the same ability to run multiple
tasks simultaneously, but it doesn’t try to hide anything from you. A number
of commands can show you how many things are going on behind the scenes.
As a fundamental building block, though, Solaris works with processes, pro-
grams that are running or sleeping, waiting for a specific event to occur. The
entire operating system and graphical interface are designed around this con-
cept. If you have X11 and GNOME running, you might well have more than 50
processes active.

Finding Top Processes
To figure out the busiest processes, and much more, use the prstat com-
mand. By default, it shows you the state of all processes, sorted by CPU
usage, and updates the screen every ten seconds, as shown in Figure 13-1.
In Figure 13-1, the last line of the output shows that 81 processes are active.
That’s a lot of activity on a single-user workstation! In addition, some
processes have more than one subprocess, called a lightweight process (lwp),
and a total of 146 lwps are running.
In the default output of prstat, all processes are shown, sorted by CPU
usage. In Figure 13-1, the GNOME window manager Metacity is the most
active process, with 2.0% of the CPU time.
The Xscreensaver process is taking up CPU time (only 0.2%) even though no
screensaver is currently being displayed. This is symptomatic of some poorly
behaved applications that can consume computing resources even though
they’re invisible to the user.
If you leave prstat running, it updates the computer usage snapshot every
five to ten seconds, giving you a rolling view of how your computer is being
used. There are ten columns of prstat output:
 PID: The process ID (unique to each process running).
 USERNAME: The login name or real user ID of the process owner.
 SIZE: The total virtual memory size of the process.
 RSS: The resident set size of the process (the amount of real memory
taken by the process).
Figure 13-1:
Output of
the prstat
command.
254
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

 STATE: The current state of the process. Values can be 
• cpuN (the process is running on CPU N)
• sleep (the process is waiting for an event to complete)
• run (the process is in the run queue waiting to be executed)
• zombie (the process has been terminated; the parent is not waiting)
• stop (the process has been stopped).
 PRI: The priority of the job: Larger numbers mean higher priority.
 NICE: The nice value used in priority computation. It can be used to
raise or lower the priority of a given process.
 TIME: The cumulative execution time for the process.
 CPU: The percentage of CPU time used by the process.
 PROCESS: The name of the executable file running.
 NLWP: The number of lightweight processes in the process.
The information in Figure 13-1 shows that Metacity has these properties: 
 It’s being run by user taylor.
 It has PID 933
 It has a virtual memory size of 13MB 
 It has an RSS of 10MB. 
 It’s in a sleep state (although it is using some CPU cycles), 
 It has a relatively low priority of 53 (system jobs have a priority of 59, 
for example), 
 It has no nice value
 It has used a cumulative seven minutes and 27 seconds of execution
time. 
 It’s using 2.0% of the CPU time 
 It has one lightweight thread (meaning that it doesn’t use threads).
Processor Usage, by User
prstat has an output format that’s particularly useful if you’re trying to iden-
tify which users are hogging the CPU resources: -t. As shown in Figure 13-2,
the -t flag produces a list of processor usage summarized by user.
255
Chapter 13: Controlling Processes

In Figure 13-2, most of the processes are owned by either taylor or root. The
root processes are probably demons and other processes intended to run in
the background. Notice the cumulative execution time for the root processes:
a rather impressive 77 hours, 25 minutes, and 16 seconds.
Another useful flag is -s sortkey, which enables you to change the sorting of
the output. Possible keys are 
 cpu
 pri
 rss
 size
 time
Couple this flag with the -n flag (which lets you limit the number of lines
output) to ascertain 
 Which applications are using the most physical memory:
$ prstat -s rss -n 5
PID USERNAME  SIZE   RSS STATE  PRI NICE      TIME  CPU PROCESS/NLWP      
826 root       40M   29M sleep   49    0  76:39:49 0.0% Xsun/1

939 taylor     19M   13M sleep   49    0   0:01:21 0.0% gnome-terminal/1
Total: 79 processes, 144 lwps, load averages: 0.03, 0.04, 0.10

Understanding Running Processes
Everything that’s happening on your Solaris system, every program running,
visible or not, is a process. Here’s how individual processes are utilizing the
system resources.
What’s your uptime?
To further understand how a Solaris system is being used or overused, as the
case may be, use uptime, another terrifically useful command:
$ uptime
9:17am  up 28 day(s), 22:25,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.02, 0.08
In this humble one-line output, it shows you 
 Current time
 How long the system has been running since its last reboot
 How many users are connected
 Load average
The load average numbers — an average count of the number of jobs in the
run queue (either running or ready to run) for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes —
can be confusing for users. 
Watch these values to get a sense of how busy the system is. 
 The larger the value, the busier the system. 
 Changes in workload can be found by comparing values:
257
Chapter 13: Controlling Processes

• If values are increasing left-to-right, then your system was busier in
the past than it is currently. 
• If values are decreasing left-to-right, your system is busier than it
has been for a while.
 Uptime load averages of less than one or two are the norm on a work-
station and demonstrate that there’s plenty of horsepower to run the
necessary processes and manage the current demand on the system. 
 If you get into two-digit load averages, things are busy. 
 Three-digit load averages are one way that the Solaris operating system
might be gasping for help, requesting another CPU or even a second
computer to offload some of the busiest processes.
Other processor status tools
Although prstat is a great program, it’s a Solaris-only application. Other
Unixes have commands to offer similar information, such as 
top
monitor
What they all rely on is an underlying command called ps, which shows
processor status and a lot more.
Like many Solaris commands, ps has a plethora of command line arguments,
but these are the most useful:
 -l offers a long output format.
 -L shows information on each lightweight process.
 -U userid only lists processes for the specified login name, and you can
always specify a process ID to get information about just that process.
For example, in Figure 13-1 most processes have only a single lightweight
process within, whereas a process called mibiisa has 7 lwps. Now you can
look inside this process to see what’s what:
$ ps -L -l -p 305
F S   UID   PID  PPID   LWP  C PRI NI   ADDR     SZ  WCHAN TTY  LTIME CMD
8 S     0   305   277     1  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?     0:00 mibiisa
8 S     0   305   277     2  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?    22:21 mibiisa
8 S     0   305   277     3  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?     3:54 mibiisa
8 S     0   305   277     4  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?     4:00 mibiisa
8 S     0   305   277     5  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?     4:08 mibiisa
8 S     0   305   277     6  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?     3:54 mibiisa
8 S     0   305   277     7  0  40 20      ?    292      ? ?     4:04 mibiisa
258
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

Frankly, nothing here is that revealing, other than that some threads seem to
get more execution time than others. If you were involved with the develop-
ment of this task, you could use this information to go back into the program
and try to see why lwp #2 is using almost ten times the execution time of any
other lwp.
A more common usage of ps is to see all processes associated with a specific
user:

Solaris Management Console
Solaris includes a powerful, graphically oriented
admin tool that encompasses many of the capa-
bilities already shown in this chapter, and much
more. 
To launch the Solaris Management Console,
type smc on the command line. After stepping
through some configuration and login windows,
the System Status – Processes view appears,
as shown in this figure.
You can find out more about SMC at the Sun
documentation site docs.sun.com. In partic-
ular, the System Administration Guide at
docs.sun.com/db/doc/806-4073 is a
good place to start. Don’t forget that if you’ve
installed the AnswerBook system on your own
Solaris system, the documentation is already on
your computer.

8 S 60001  4136  4128  0  40 20      ?    595       ? ?     0:00 httpd
These are the processes owned by user nobody. The processes are all owned
by parent process (PPID) #4128, which means that process 4128 started up all
the other httpd (Web server) processes.
Managing Running Processes
How do you change what’s running on your computer, either changing priority
or killing a process or set of processes? It turns out that — unsurprisingly —
a set of commands offers these very capabilities to you, whether you’re a
system administrator or not. They work differently for a regular user, but if
you need to kill a process, for example, these are fine.
Changing job priority 
By default, all user processes have a nice level of zero: They are neither more
nor less important than all other user jobs.
To start a process with a specific priority level, use the eponymously named
nice command:
$ nice +5 batchjob.sh
This would start the named shell script with a priority that’s (ready for this?)
five lesser than a normal user job. This is a polite way of invoking long, com-
pute-intensive processes that would otherwise monopolize the CPU. If it
doesn’t matter whether this batchjob.sh script finishes in three minutes 
or five, this is unquestionably the way to go.
Regular users cannot raise the priority of a task — that’s only for root — but
the full range of priorities accepted by nice are –19 to +20, where zero is the
default priority. Again, higher values are lower priority processes, whereas
lower values are higher priority processes.
260
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

If the process is already running, you can use renice to adjust its priority
accordingly. If you have mpg123, an MP3 audio player, running and you ascer-
tained that its PID is 5238, you can lower its importance to the system with:
$ renice +1 5238
You cannot raise its importance as a regular user:
$ renice +1 5238
renice: 5238: Cannot lower nice value.
Adjusting nice values appropriately is a smart way to stay in good standing
with the central system administration team if you’re part of a large shared
Solaris environment.
Killing unwanted processes
If you can change the priority of a running process, it should be no surprise
that you can also kill a process. 
 If you’re a regular user, you can kill only your own processes
 If you’re root, you can kill anything, even if it’ll stop the entire computer
dead in its tracks.
Generally, you kill processes by referencing their process IDs. To kill the MP3
player mentioned earlier, you’d use:
$ kill 5238
The kill program just sends a signal to the process; some processes ignore
certain signals. A general rule is to repeat the kill command any time you
use it to ensure that you get an error that indicates the process really was
killed:
$ kill 5238
kill: (5238) - No such pid
This means that the first kill worked. If it hadn’t worked, there would be no
output, in which case it’d be time to escalate the signal to one that is more
likely to work. In order, you should use the default signal, then a signal 15,
and then a signal 9. Specific signals are listed with a leading dash. For example,
the following command sends signal 15 (SIGINT, an interrupt signal) to
process 5238:
$ kill –15 5238
261
Chapter 13: Controlling Processes

Killing processes by name
Killing processes by name is risky. If you match the wrong process, it’s killed,
and that’s that. In Solaris, pgrep is a useful front end to pkill (the kill by
name tool). It accepts all the same flags and just shows you a list of matching
processes:
$ pgrep -l sh
3 fsflush
894 sdt_shell
756 bash
302 sshd
920 sh
896 bash
4155 bash
3463 bash
This lists the process ID and command name for all processes that match the
pattern sh. To kill all the bash processes, for example, use:
$ pkill bash
If you kill your login shell, you’ll be logged out!

Finding Files
In This Chapter
 Finding files in graphical environments
 Searching by content with grep
 Specifying search attributes with find
O
ne of the most curious things about how people use computers is 
that although the system supports descriptive filenames, directories,
and subdirectories, most users still end up with hundreds of files named
Joe-2.doc, sample.from.mr, and similar, leading to crazy, impossible-to-
navigate home directories.
The best way to address this is to impose some self-discipline, with logi-
cally organized folders and, at the least, well-named files. (Consider how
much easier it is to understand Eco, Umberto, 5 Feb 03 as a filename —
particularly if it’s in a directory called Letters — than a file cryptically
called ltr-eco-5.3 or similar.)
Whether or not you can accomplish this great file-naming feat, it’s a sure bet
that at some point you’ll need a specific file without knowing where it is in
your file hierarchy or perhaps without remembering the filename. That’s
what the various tools explored in this chapter address: finding files by 
 Name
 Attributes
 Content
Finding Files with File Manager
If you’re still in the world of the Common Desktop Environment, the CDE File
Manager offers some useful file search capabilities, though they are relatively
hidden. 

Launch the File Manager by clicking the Home Folder button (with the file
cabinet on it) on the CDE taskbar, as shown in Figure 14-1. The File Manager
pops up, displaying an icon for each file or folder in your home directory, as
shown in Figure 14-2.
To search for a specific file, choose File➪Find, which opens the complex Find
dialog box, shown in Figure 14-3. Here’s a rundown of some options in this
dialog box:

Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

 Find Items In: The default setting for Find Items In (at the top of the
dialog box) is to search in the current directory. This setting is a pop-up:
Click it to select another starting location for the search.
 Whose Name: This search pattern option offers the choices highlighted
in the pop-up shown in Figure 14-3. You can search for files that 
• Contain the pattern specified
• Don’t contain the pattern specified
• Are exactly equal to the pattern specified
 More Criteria: This option offers more ways that you can search, as
described in the next section.
 Follow Links: The Follow Links check box is in the top-right corner. 
Links are the Solaris equivalent to Windows shortcuts or Mac aliases
and are essentially shorthand ways of jumping to specific files or folders
elsewhere on the Solaris system. Sometimes they point to a separate
area of the file system that is huge, so the Find feature in File Manager
enables you to decide whether it should ignore the links in its search.
More find criteria in CDE File Manager
Clicking the More Criteria button opens the More Criteria dialog box, shown
in Figure 14-4. This dialog box offers a variety of criteria by which you can
search, as detailed here:
 Name: The name of the file
 Content: What’s actually in the file. It can be either 
• A word 
• A phrase
Figure 14-4:
Find, with
even more
criteria!
265
Chapter 14: Finding Files

 Size: The size of the file. You can search for one of these:
• An exact file size
• Files larger than a specified size
• Files smaller than a specified size
 Date Modified: The last date modified. You can search for one of these:
• An exact date
• Files modified before a specified date
• Files modified after a specified date
 Owner: The owner of the file (probably you; not too helpful)
 Type: The type of the file. It’s one of these:
• File
• Directory
• Special type of file used by the operating system only
 Permissions: The file permissions, such as 
• Read
• Write
• Execute
Of these choices, the most useful are 
 Content
 Size
 Date Modified
Select them all and click OK to go back to the Find dialog box. The Find dialog
box now looks like Figure 14-5.
This time the form is filled out. I’m searching for files with these attributes:
 Names contain html 
 Contain the text McNealy
 Are less than 10,000 bytes in size
 Were modified in the current year
The Date Modified is tricky to figure out. The shortcut that appears in the
text input box is [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss], but I bet that doesn’t help you
much! 
266
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

 The default information to enter is 
• Month
• Day
• Hour
• Minute
Figure 14-5 shows that I’ve entered 01 01 00 00, or January 1 of the 
current year, at 00:00, midnight.
 You can also specify these values:
• Seconds (although I can’t imagine anyone would know file modifi-
cation dates down to that level of specificity) 
• Years
To find files that haven’t been modified since 2001, you can use Is Before 
as the modifier, and 2001010100 as the Date Modified string (got it? 2001,
January 1, 00:00).
You can search many ways by combining these attributes. 
 To find a list of all Writer .doc files that have been modified more
recently than February 15, you can combine these attributes:
• Whose Name Contains doc
• Date Modified Is After 02150000. 
 You can find all files modified since a certain date by leaving the Whose
Name box blank.

Chapter 14: Finding Files

Figure 14-5 is interesting for another reason. It shows the results of my click-
ing Find to search my entire folder area. The two matching files are 
 welcome.html in my home directory 
 My public_html subdirectory
Although the Find function works well, you can’t open resulting files directly.
You must double-click the matched filename, or select it and click Go To. A
new File Manager dialog box opens, showing the directory that contains the
file. Double-click the file to see what’s inside.
Finding Files with GNOME
In GNOME, the Nautilus file system offers a separate Search for Files capabil-
ity from the GNOME menu.
To launch Search for Files, follow these steps:
1. Click the GNOME menu.
The Search for Files window pops up, as shown in Figure 14-6.
2. To add more search constraints, click the small triangle to the left of
Additional Constraints.
An additional search constraint section opens.
3. Click the Available Search Constraints pop-up to see the available 
constraints.
A remarkable number of constraints are available for the search, as
shown in Figure 14-7.
Figure 14-6:

4. Select a constraint type from the Available Search Constraints pop-up
and then click the Add button. Continue this until you’ve specified all
desired constraints.
I want to search for files that 
• Have the pattern html in their name 
• Have the pattern McNealy in the file itself
• Are less than 10,000 bytes in size
• Have been modified since the first of January
My Search for Files dialog box looks like Figure 14-8.

Chapter 14: Finding Files

There are a few differences here from the CDE file find options:
• Instead of searching for filename fragments, you need to specify a
wildcard pattern: *.html matches all files that end with the .html
suffix. (By comparison, *html* matches all files with the sequence
html in their filename.) 
• The Date Modified parameter is challenging because you specify
the number of days, but in a somewhat backwards fashion. To
check for files modified within the last 45 days, either specify that
you want them modified after –45 or before 45. It isn’t logical,
but it works.
5. After you select all the desired constraints, click the Find button to
see the results.
My search results are shown in Figure 14-9.
 If you double-click a match, Nautilus opens that file. 
 If you right-click on a matching line, a pop-up menu opens with these
options: 
• Open
• Open Folder
• Save Results As
I double-clicked welcome.html to open it, as shown in Figure 14-10. From this
display window, you can open the HTML file in Netscape or any other pro-
gram (including a text editor). You can find more coverage of Nautilus in
Chapter 4.

Searching by Content with grep
Although CDE and GNOME have graphical file search utilities, both are attrac-
tive front-ends for two Solaris command-line tools: 
 The grep command searches a specified set of files for a pattern. The
resulting matched lines, if any, are shown as its output.
 The find command can search by specific criteria, such as 
• Size
• Owner
• Modification date 
grep gets its name from g/re/p — global regular expression print — a com-
mand commonly used in the ex editor when Unix was developed.
I want to use the grep command to confirm that the file welcome.html con-
tains the pattern McNealy. As with every other command-line utility, you need
to open a terminal window or pull up a shell. My shell is ready to go, so I
enter:

Chapter 14: Finding Files

In the preceding example, the output of grep — if there’s a match — is the
filename, a colon, and the matching passage. By default, grep is case sensi-
tive; nothing happens if I type Scott McNealy’s name in all lowercase, like
this:
$ grep mcnealy *
$
The -i flag tells grep to ignore the case. This flag is helpful if the pattern you
seek might occur in either all lowercase, mixed case, or all capital letters.
The following example shows how you can cast a wider net by either 
 Shrinking the pattern down 
 Looking through more files by replacing the * filename wildcard with
one that also looks in all immediate subdirectories
$ grep -i scott * */*      
gullivers.travels.txt:{3}  Britannia.--Sir W. Scott.
gullivers.travels.txt:{4}  London.--Sir W. Scott.
kaelins.travels.txt:{3}  Britannia.--Sir W. Scott.
kaelins.travels.txt:{4}  London.--Sir W. Scott.
mailbox:        “Scott Gillam” <sgillam@glenraven.com>,
welcome.html:<H3>by Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems</H3>
newdir/gullivers.travels.txt:{3}  Britannia.--Sir W. Scott.
newdir/gullivers.travels.txt:{4}  London.--Sir W. Scott.
public_html/welcome.html:<H3>by Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Micro
systems</H3>
The -l flag (lowercase L) offers the same basic filename pattern matching on
the command line that both CDE and GNOME offer. It shows the names of the
files that match, not the names and matching lines. Here’s an example of the
command:
$ grep -li scott * */*
gullivers.travels.txt
kaelins.travels.txt
mailbox
welcome.html
newdir/gullivers.travels.txt
public_html/welcome.html
Using grep with mailboxes
If your e-mail is stored in various mailbox files, the grep command is an inter-
esting way to search for addresses. In addition to simple text patterns, you
can also specify some fairly complex patterns:
272
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

 Place a ^ at the beginning of the pattern to match lines with the pattern
at the beginning of the line.
 Specify a $ to match the end of the line instead.
For example, “^kumquat$” will only match lines that contain the word
kumquat, with no spaces, tabs, or other characters.
For exploring a mailbox, a natural pattern is “^From: “ (with the trailing
space) to extract all the From: lines in the mailbox:
$ grep “^From: “ mailbox

To organize your matches, you can call on two additional Solaris commands: 
 The sort command alphabetizes lines of input.
 The uniq command shows only one of each unique line. 
Couple these commands together, and things improve considerably:
$ grep “^From: “ mailbox | sort | uniq

Because you can have multiple invocations of a command in a pipe (Chapter
3 explains pipes), you can now have an easy tool for finding a specific e-mail
address in a mailbox file:
$ grep “^From: “ mailbox | sort | uniq | grep -i ricardo
From: Ricardo Dunlap <ricardo@earthlink.net>
More tricks for using grep are detailed in the online documentation at
docs.sun.com, among other places. It’s a wonderful command to know, espe-
cially when coupled with the find command.
Specifying Search Attributes with find
Though a bit more complex than grep, the find command is a great way to
search through your files and directories for specific files that match certain
criteria, including filename, size, owner, modification date, and much more.
 The standard usage for the find command is
find directory-or-directories flag value
The find command searches the specified directories for files or direc-
tories that match the specified set of flag/value criteria. For example, the
following sample produces a list of all files that end with .html in (and
below) the current directory:
$ find * -name “*.html” -print
public_html/welcome.html
welcome.html
274
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

Unlike almost every other Solaris command, find uses full-word flags,
such as -name and -print. The flags and their values mingle in an
English-like manner.
A common way to use find is to specify . as the directory to search.
The program searches
• All the visible filenames 
• All directories whose name start with . (the invisible files in
Solaris)
For the following example, many more matches are found:
$ find . -name “*.html” -print
./.mozilla/taylor/kz3toqua.slt/bookmarks.html
./.mozilla/Default User/8wungi1j.slt/bookmarks.html
./welcome.html
./public_html/welcome.html
./.netscape/bookmarks.html
One neat result of this search is that I can see where my bookmark files
are for both Netscape and Mozilla.
Searching by size and date
To match the search criteria used earlier, you mostly need to know about the
flags that find uses to specify file size and modification date: 
 When specifying the value to a flag such as -size, you need to take into
account that a specific number will only match files of that exact size. 
 Preface the number with a - to match anything smaller than the size
specified, and use + to match anything larger. 
 Size also wants a trailing c on the value if you’re indicating bytes; other-
wise, it’s interpreted as 512-byte blocks.
For dates, find uses the basic unit of days. Although the CDE File Manager
uses month, day, hour, and minute, the GNOME Search for Files utility that
uses days ahead or behind is more like the find command. (In fact, Search
for Files uses find behind the scenes.) 
To check a modification date, the flag is -mtime.
The following command checks for files with 
*.html as their filename
A size less than 10,000 bytes
A modification time of less than 45 days
275
Chapter 14: Finding Files

$ find . -name “*.html” -size -10000c -mtime -45 -print
./.mozilla/taylor/kz3toqua.slt/bookmarks.html
./.mozilla/Default User/8wungi1j.slt/bookmarks.html
./welcome.html
./public_html/welcome.html
./.netscape/bookmarks.html
Searching by content
The easiest way to search by content is to wrangle grep into joining the find
parade! Instead of doing it as a pipe, use the -exec flag to find, and specify
the grep command as the argument:
$ find . -name “*.html” -size -10000c -mtime -45 -exec grep -
i mcnealy “;”
./welcome.html:<H3>by Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun
Microsystems</H3>
./public_html/welcome.html:<H3>by Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun
Microsystems</H3>
The straightforward approach in this first example has a couple of draw-
backs:
 It takes forever to run, because grep is invoked once for each file in your
subtree, which can drag things down. 
 The ; at the end of the line tells find where the exec expression ends. 
Odd though it looks, you must include this if you use the -exec flag, so
that it knows when the specified command to execute ends.
Fortunately, there’s a smarter and faster way to invoke find, although it’s
more peculiar looking:
$ find . -name “*.html” -size -10000c -mtime -45 -exec grep -
i mcnealy “{}” +
./welcome.html:<H3>by Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun
Microsystems</H3>
./public_html/welcome.html:<H3>by Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun
Microsystems</H3>
The {} sequence is replaced by the individual filenames and is optional in
the default -exec expression, as shown in the first example. In this second
example, replacing the ; with a + tells find to give a bunch of filenames to
grep each time it’s called, with the {} replaced by all the names each time.
276
Part IV: Editing and Controlling Programs 

The difference in speed is remarkable. 
 The first example took almost 20 minutes to run on my system
 The second example finished in a second or two. 
You can work with the find command many ways, but discussing them all is
beyond the scope of this book. There are other directions for using find.
Start with the find man page:
man find
and then referencing docs.sun.com/.

Security Issues

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book addresses something that might
be beyond your individual responsibility: system
administration and security. However, if something goes
wrong on your computer, they’re your ﬁles that’ll be lost,
corrupted or stolen, so whether you have a top-notch
system administrator or not, it’s wise to learn something
about how to keep your system running optimally, with as
many hatches battened down as possible.
The three chapters start by exploring different ways to
hook a Solaris system to an existing network, including
the popular Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) and
the creaky Point to Point Protocol for modem access.
Once that’s hooked up, you’ll explore the Solaris
Management Console and learn the proper and safe way
to stop your computer so you can unplug it. Finally, you’ll
learn some of the key ideas behind system security and
how to ensure your system is as secure as possible.

 Quick reference for working with PPP
You may have a systems administration or information technology group
at your organization that manages all the “under the hood” aspects of
Solaris. Even if that’s the case, it’s worthwhile for you to have a basic under-
standing of the technologies underlying the Solaris user experience.
This chapter addresses how a Solaris system connects to the network,
exploring the three major protocols: 
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
 Fixed IP
 Point-to-Point Protocol (for dial-up connections).
Terminology and Concepts
A few definitions make things easier for you in the world of networking.
 The Internet is a network of networks, all sharing a set of common lan-
guages, or protocols:
• At the lowest level of networking, Internet Protocol (IP, the denomi-
nator of the common TCP/IP protocol pair) allows machines to
exchange streams of data between them. 
Internet Protocol assigns each computer a unique numeric
address, typically expressed as four numbers separated by dots
(for example, 128.216.22.103).

• Transmission Control Protocol (TCP, the numerator of TCP/IP)
ensures that the communication between two computers (which is
broken into individual packets) goes to its destination and is
assembled in the order it was sent.
Without TCP, the middle of your e-mail messages, the last 30 lines
of a Web page, and the last message from your favorite instant
message buddy could be lost en route while bouncing from com-
puter to computer.
 Other protocols on top of the TCP/IP protocol stack provide specific
Internet services, including these:
• HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) for Web browsers and
servers
• Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for e-mail interchanges
• Domain Name Service (DNS) for mapping domain names to their
unique IP addresses
A computer on a public or private network needs a few essential snippets of
information:
 A unique IP address
 The address of a router or gateway to the rest of the network
 A netmask (which tells the computer how many other IP addresses are
in the local network space)
 One or more DNS server addresses to resolve name-to-number queries
Configuring Solaris Networking
Although you can certainly muck with system configuration files — and will
do that in this chapter — the recommended method of configuring or recon-
figuring a network connection is to erase the existing system configuration
file and reboot. 
After restarting, the system detects the missing configuration file and
prompts for the necessary values, including network configuration.
It’s worthwhile to take a snapshot of the essentials of your current configura-
tion by running the network interface configuration utility ifconfig, with 
its -a (show all interfaces) flag specified:
282
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

# ifconfig -a
lo0: flags=1000849<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4> mtu 8232 index 1
inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000
eri0: flags=1004843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,DHCP,IPv4> mtu 1500 index 2
inet 192.168.1.107 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
ether 0:3:ba:10:dd:47
This shows two interfaces on this system:
 lo0 is the loopback interface. 
It’s a convenient way for applications on the computer to communicate
via the network system, but without actually having to go out to the
network.
 eri0 is the Ethernet (network) interface.
The preceding listing shows the addresses for the network card on this
Solaris system:
 The interfaces list these addresses:
• The current IP address for the system (192.168.1.107)
• The netmask (ffffff00)
• The broadcast IP address (192.168.1.255). 
 UP and RUNNING show that the network is currently set up correctly.
 DHCP in the list of eri0 flags shows that the system is running DHCP.
Unconfiguration: how to repeat the 
out-of-box setup sequence
The easiest way to change the Solaris network configuration is to delete the
existing configuration then reboot. 
 Solaris checks the configuration settings during the boot process
 If Solaris finds there are no default settings, it launches the system con-
figuration utility.
To remove the system configuration information, complete the following
steps:
283
Chapter 15: Connecting to the Network

1. Run sys-unconfig as root:
# sys-unconfig
The output shows that this is a fairly dramatic step to take with a 
computer!
WARNING
This program will unconfigure your system. It will cause
It to revert to a “blank” system - it will not have a
name
or know about other systems or networks.
This program will also halt the system.
Do you want to continue (y/n) ?
Rather than running the current network connection protocol, I’m going
to change it. Keep your fingers crossed!
2. To continue and really delete the existing configuration, type y and
then press Enter.
All the existing network services are stopped. Without any further
prompts, the system is halted.
3. Type boot at the Ok? prompt to reboot from the halt state.
With luck, this is the only time you ever see the Ok? prompt during 
boot-time. 
A series of prompts follows from this point, starting with selecting a lan-
guage from those installed on the system.
4. Enter the numeric value from the list for your preferred language.
Usually, English is choice 0.
Locale choices appear now.
5. Enter the numeric value from the list for your locale.
Here’s what I have on my computer at this point:
Select a Locale
0. English (C – 7-bit ASCII)
1. Canada-English (ISO8859-1)
2. U.S.A. (en_US.ISO8859-1)
3. U.S.A. (en_US.ISO8859-15)
4. Go Back to Previous Screen
Please make a choice (0 – 4), or press h or ? for help:
After entering the locale, the system moves to network configurations. It
284
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

begins by informing you that you’re configuring the Ethernet interface:
Configuring network interface addresses: eri0
6. When the program asks whether your system has a network card, 
confirm it by entering “Yes”. The following instructions appear on the
screen:
On this screen you must specify whether or not this
system
should use DHCP for network interface configuration.
Choose Yes if DHCP is to be used, or No if the interfaces
are to be configured manually.
NOTE: DHCP support will not be enabled, if selected,
until
after the system reboots.
Use DHCP
--------
[X] Yes
[ ] No
7. Select either DHCP-based configuration or a fixed IP address based on
the configuration of your network (ask your system or network admin-
istrator if you’re not sure).
For a DHCP-based configuration, select Yes here. (This is the default). 
For a fixed IP address, select No for the DHCP configuration and then
enter the following values when prompted:
• Your hostname (mine is aurora).
• Your fixed IP address.
If you’re running a fixed IP network, your network administrator
will have given you a unique number to enter at this point.
My IP address is 192.168.1.107.
• Your subnet, if you are part of one (you probably are). Answer yes
to that prompt and then enter the netmask as supplied by the net-
work administrator.
My netmask is 255.255.255.0.
When you complete this step, you are prompted for any additional infor-
mation required by the setup program.
8. Enable IPv6 support if you need it. 
It’s a more advanced IP addressing scheme; it can be safely enabled
without adversely affecting the older IP address scheme used on most
networks.
I’ll skip it. You should too, unless you have been told by your network
285
Chapter 15: Connecting to the Network

administrator that you must have IPv6 to be able to participate fully on
the network.
At this point, your settings are summarized.
• For a DHCP configuration, it’s succinct:
Networked: Yes
Use DHCP: Yes
Enable IPv6: No
• For a fixed IP configuration, it’s lengthier:
Networked: Yes
Use DHCP: No
Host name: aurora
IP address: 192.168.1.107
System part of a subnet: Yes
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Enable IPv6: No
Default Route: Find one
• If the settings look good, you can proceed with the rest of the con-
figuration options. 
• If not, enter “No” and the setup program will let you alter individ-
ual settings until it is correct.
9. Accept the default values for the remaining configuration options
(unless you want to experiment, in which case you can enter a new
value for the specific field by typing it rather than accepting the
default), except for Name Service. 
Unless your system administration group gives you other instructions,
choose None for Name service.
The system automatically reboots. After a moment or two, it should
boot up with your new networking options.
To check that your new network configuration details are correct, open a
Web page with your browser. 
 If your browser doesn’t run correctly, try these steps to check whether
your system is able to see the network at all:
• Check whether ifconfig indicates UP and RUNNING. 
• Use the ping utility to ping your own system (which shows that
the loopback works). Then try pinging your gateway or router
(which shows that your system is still connected to the gateway).
286
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

 If things are still working improperly, it’s time to either 
• Rerun sys-unconfig to try some other options.
• Call your network administrator or favorite computer whiz for
help!
Fixing DHCP Glitches
The DHCP protocol is one of those fundamentally great ideas in computing:
Instead of associating a specific address with each computer, have a pool of
addresses and assign them on an as-needed basis for the network. 
There are some advantages to this scheme:
 You don’t need to match the number of available addresses with the
number of computers. 
 Dozens of computers can feed into a router and then one address com-
municates to the Internet.
My office network is configured with multiple computers sharing a single
Internet IP address through a router. I pay for one IP address from my net-
work provider, and my cable modem box also acts as a router, gateway, and
DHCP server. The dozen-odd computers in my office then receive individual
IP addresses within the DHCP namespace, and all invisibly share the single IP
address to the outside world. Instead of taking a dozen IP addresses from the
public Internet, the computers in my office only need one external IP for all
systems to connect.
 DHCP is an open industry standard. 
Just about every modern computer supports DHCP, including 
• Macintosh
• Windows
• Other Unix and Linux systems
 You can run DHCP on your network if you’re directly hooked up to the
Internet via one of these services:
• High-speed network line (a T1, T3, and so on)
• Digital subscriber line (DSL)
• Cable modem 
I have a cable modem supplying connectivity for all the computers in my
office, for example.
287
Chapter 15: Connecting to the Network

Hostname unknown 
After you’ve reconfigured your system to work with a DHCP service, it’s not
uncommon to find that the computer has been renamed unknown, not the
hostname you want. A surprisingly simple change to one of the configuration
files fixes this.
This change isn’t for the faint of heart. You’ll be editing an essential part of
the Solaris boot process. Be careful with the following steps. They’re not diffi-
cult, but you’ll want to ensure that you are very accurate with the changes to
ensure nothing breaks.
The problem with hostname unknown is that Solaris expects the DHCP server
to assign it a hostname. Many DHCP servers expect each computer to already
have an assigned name. The result is an unknown hostname. To fix this
annoying hostname unknown problem, here’s what you do:
1. Make a backup copy of the configuration file /etc/rcS.d/S30net-
work.sh, just in case, like this:
$ cd /etc/rcS.d
$ cp S30network.sh s30network.sh
Because filenames are case sensitive in Solaris, these are two different
files. Only files in this directory that start with the letter S are run as the
system boots up.
2. Open the S30network.sh file in an editor and find the following line
near the end of the file:
hostname=”unknown”
(Chapter 12 explains how to edit files in Solaris)
A fast way to get there with vi is to type ?unknown while in command
mode. Using ? searches backwards, from the end of the file to the begin-
ning. Because you know the patter you seek is near the bottom, it gets
you there fast.
3. Replace the line hostname=”unknown” with the following line:
hostname=”`shcat /etc/nodename 2>/dev/null`”
Be careful: 
• Double quote, back quote at the beginning of the line.
• Back quote, double quote at the end of the line.
4. Write and quit the edit session (in vi you can use the :wq command).
288
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

5. Double-check that the file /etc/nodename contains the name you gave
the system when first configuring it, like this:
# cat /etc/nodename
aurora
If there’s no nodename file or it’s empty, use an editor to create it. Just
put your one-word hostname in it.
6. Open the S30network.sh file in an editor and find the following line
near the end of the file:
hostname=”unknown”
7. Replace the line hostname=”unknown” with the following line:
hostname=”`cat /etc/nodename 2>/dev/null`”
Again, it’s 
• Double quote, back quote at the beginning
• Back quote, double quote at the end of the line.
8. Double-check both changes to ensure that the back quotes are prop-
erly inserted, by entering the following:
# grep “cat /etc/nodename” S72inetsvc ../rcS.d/S30network.sh
S72inetsvc:             hostname=”`cat /etc/nodename 2>/dev/null`”
../rcS.d/S30network.sh: “none”) hostname=”`shcat /etc/nodename
2>/dev/null`” ;;
../rcS.d/S30network.sh: hostname=”`shcat /etc/nodename 2>/dev/null`”
In the preceding example, the S30network.sh script already had the
hostname set from /etc/nodename in the script. All three should look
the same. If they don’t, edit as appropriate.
9. When you’re ready, reboot.
You should have a proper hostname!
DNS resolution problems
When DHCP servers aren’t up to snuff for a Solaris client, they might not send
any DNS server information, leaving you with a system that can connect to
the network, but can’t do any name lookups with the domain name service.
This is easy to fix if you have the DNS server information from your ISP or
system administrator (probably two or three systems identified by IP
address).
289
Chapter 15: Connecting to the Network

1. Go to the /etc directory and open a file called resolv.conf.
Yes, there’s a missing e in that filename. No one knows why!
2. If DNS isn’t working, the file will be empty. Add the following lines,
albeit with the DNS servers that your network administrator or
Internet service provider has given you, not my AT&T IP numbers:
domain attbi.com
nameserver 216.148.227.68
nameserver 204.127.202.4
My ISP supplied this information; your values will doubtless vary.
3. Save the file, and run the following command to double-check that
everything looks good and matches the supplied information: 
# more /etc/resolv.conf
domain attbi.com
nameserver 216.148.227.68
nameserver 204.127.202.4
Ensure that there are no spaces before or after any periods.
If that looks good, you can immediately do hostname lookups. Try open-
ing a Web site in Netscape, if you want.
Great job! You’re not only becoming a Solaris power user, but you’re also
doing pretty well in the system hacker department! Fun, eh?
PPP
It’s rare in the Solaris world for users to have modems as their main connec-
tion to the outside world. However, it’s possible to configure a Solaris system
to use the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to work with a modem and automati-
cally dial up a remote Internet service provider on demand. The
configuration is tricky and beyond the scope of Solaris 9 For Dummies (think
Super-Detailed Solaris System Configuration Nitpicky Details For Dummies
instead).
The main program for working with PPP is the Solaris pppd command. A good
place to start is to read the pppd man page with the command man pppd.
290
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

PPP client configuration
To configure a dial-out PPP system, take the following steps:
1. Gather preconfiguration information.
You want to make sure you have all the information you need from the
ISP, including telephone number, modem speeds and protocols sup-
ported, account name, and password.
2. Configure the modem and serial port.
You can find good documentation on this at docs.sun.com if you need it.
3. Configure the serial line communication.
You want to ensure that the serial line talks properly to the modem at
the right speed, using the right number of bits and parity, and so on.
4. Define the conversation between the dial-out machine and the peer
(or server).
This is one of the most essential steps; you can read about it in the chat
man page.
5. Configure information about a particular peer — PPP options for a
specific server.
6. Call the peer. Type in the pppd command (as root) to hopefully initiate
the connection.
All of these steps are documented in great detail at the URL referenced at the
end of this chapter.
PPP server configuration
One great Solaris feature is that it can be a PPP server for remote systems
just as easily as it can be a client. This means that you can easily set up your
server as a mini-ISP, or even create an easy (and secure) mechanism for con-
necting from your home computer to the Solaris system at work.
However, as with the PPP client configuration, server configuration is tricky
but, fortunately, well documented at the Sun Web site.
The necessary steps for configuring a server are
291
Chapter 15: Connecting to the Network

1. Gather preconfiguration information, including
• Peer hostnames
• Phone numbers
• Modem speed
2. Configure the modem and serial port. 
If you’ve configured the system as a PPP client, this may already be
done.
3. Set up the PPP options and user environments for every dial-out
machine that’s allowed to connect to the server. (This is the calling
peer information)
4. Configure the serial line communication. 
Again, this might already be done if you’ve set up the system as a PPP
client.
Accounts that are allowed to connect from a remote PPP connection have the
default login shell of /usr/bin/pppd to ensure that the handshake between
the two occurs properly. It’s not possible with the standard Solaris configura-
tion to have guest or anonymous PPP clients (which you wouldn’t want
anyway for security reasons); PPP users must have their own login and pass-
word on the dial-up system.
One final step that you (or, more likely, your system administrator) should
take is to set up either Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) or Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) for the PPP server. Again, that’s
detailed at the following docs.sun.com URL.
The best reference for all the nitpicky details of configuring PPP on a Solaris 9
system is docs.sun.com/db/doc/806-4076/6jd6amqu6?a=view. Twelve
chapters in this online Sun document discuss configuring modem-based
Internet access!

lthough you may have an information technology group or system
administrator who manages the oil changes, wheel balancing, and other
messy jobs under the hood of your Solaris computer, you might still be left
with some administrative tasks. Even if you never learned the root password
for your system, it’s helpful to have an idea of some of the tasks required for
configuring and maintaining a Solaris system.
The special account ID root has maximum permissions. As a result, any
system administration task that will read or write protected files will require
you to know the root password. If you don’t, many administrative tools won’t
even start, and certainly none will work properly.
If you need the ins and outs of root accounts and root account access, that’s
in Chapter 17.
Exploring the Solaris Management
Console
One of the best tools available with Solaris 9 is the Solaris Management
Console (SMC). Consolidating the tasks of many command-line administrative
tools, SMC makes working with your Solaris box remarkably easy, once you
get the hang of it.

You have a couple of options to start SMC:
 In GNOME, choose GNOME Menu➪CDE Menu➪Tools➪Solaris
Management Console. 
 In CDE, follow these steps:
• Click the small rectangular button above the Tools icon (which
looks like a page with some check boxes)
• Choose Solaris Management Console from the pop-up menu. 
 From the command line while logged in as root, use this command:
/usr/sbin/smc &
When SMC starts up, you may see a display that indicates the console is ana-
lyzing the system to ascertain its initial configuration, as shown in Figure 16-1.
Although it can take as long as five minutes for the program to analyze the
configuration of a complex system, usually it’s about a 60 to 90 second
process. The main SMC view says “Welcome to the Solaris Management
Console,” as shown in Figure 16-2. You can now begin to explore the
capabilities of SMC.
Figure 16-1:

Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

Briefly exploring SMC
To see what the program knows about your system, click the tiny circular
icon adjacent to This Computer (Aurora) in the top-left window. This
Computer is expanded in Figure 16-2. 
The main categories in SMC are
 System Status
 System Configuration
 Services
 Storage
 Devices and Hardware
 LegacyAppTool.client.Launcher
Select System Status to get a taste of SMC. It expands to show four options: 
 System Information
 Log Viewer
 Processes
 Performance
Figure 16-2:
Welcome to
the Solaris

ment

295
Chapter 16: Essential System Administration

The Performance option sounds of most interest, so click it. You then have to
verify that you know the root password, as shown in Figure 16-3.
Enter the correct password for root and then click OK. After a moment or
two, the Performance option expands to show a System choice. Open that by
clicking the tiny circle icon to its left. You’ll see three subcategories: 
 Summary
 Projects
 Users
Select Summary to get a summary of the system performance levels, as
shown in Figure 16-4.

The output shows several interesting statistics, though it’s mostly up to you
to know how to interpret them. For example, you can see that 394MB of phys-
ical memory is in use, and 654MB is available. Is that a ton of free memory, or
would more physical memory improve system performance? Are 4,630
system calls per second indicative of a busy system, or a typical value for a
Solaris machine that’s mostly idle?
Follow these guidelines to review the utilization of your system:
 As long as you have unused physical memory and the Page Rate is low,
you’re in great shape. 
 When you have processes demanding lots of physical memory, then 
• Swapping (Page Rate) goes up
• Performance rapidly degrades
Examining System Configuration
Open the System Configuration category by clicking the circle icon to the left
of its name. This reveals four subcategories: 
 Users
 Projects
 Computers and Networks
 Patches
Choose Users to see additional choices: 
 User Accounts
 User Templates
 Rights
 Administrative Roles
 Groups
 Mailing Lists
Start by examining User Accounts. Click User Accounts to see a display simi-
lar to Figure 16-5.
297
Chapter 16: Essential System Administration

Each person icon on the right side of the window represents an account on
the system. 
You should leave most of the functionally named accounts unchanged, such as
bin
sys
adm
uucp 
The individual user accounts are worth examination. In Figure 16-6, I’ve clicked
the account dave to see what permissions and access he has been granted.
As you can see in Figure 16-6, this SMC area shows lots of helpful information
for this particular account. Tabs along the top indicate its sections: 
 Password
 Password Options
 Mail
 Rights
 Roles
 General
 Group
 Projects
 Home Directory
Figure 16-5:

Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

On the General tab, these are some of your options:
 User Name: You can change a user’s name.
 Login Shell: You can specify which shell the user should have upon
login. (Here, it’s /usr/bin/bash.)
 Account Availability: You have a couple of options for controlling the
time of account availability:
• Lock the account immediately.
• Configure the account to automatically lock on a specific date
which is helpful if you have students, contractors, or other users
who don’t need system access forever!
Figure 16-7 shows the great Password Options tab of the User Properties
window. The account dave is configured as follows:
 User Must Keep For: Each time the password is changed, the user can’t
change it again for 14 days.
 Before Change, Alert User: The user receives a two-day warning to
change the password.
 User Must Change Within: This account requires a new password every
30 days.
 Expires If Not Used For: If the password isn’t used for a period of 60
days, it automatically expires, and a new password must be entered.
Figure 16-6:

Chapter 16: Essential System Administration

Thoughtful use of these options can significantly improve security. 
Be mindful not to set timeframes too short. Users will get cranky if they’re
forced to change their passwords every few days.
If you’re interested in exploring other aspects of the Solaris Management
Console, your best bet is to start with the Sun documentation on SMC. You
can find it in the System Administration Guide: Basic Administration located at
docs.sun.com/db/doc/806-4073.
Starting and Stopping Your System
A straightforward but incredibly important Solaris administrative task is
shutting down or restarting your system in a manner that’s operating
system–friendly. Cycling power or unplugging a running Solaris system can
be catastrophic, and you never want to do that!
Three commands that are mnemonically named and important to know are 
shutdown
halt
reboot

Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

Shutting down the system with shutdown
The shutdown program is most typically used to change the system state
from multiuser to single user for administrative purposes.
As with all the commands in this section, shutdown must be run as root.
The command has a small number of options:
shutdown [-y] [-g grace period] [-i init state]
 The grace period allows users to log out and otherwise gracefully shut
down their running applications before the change in state is invoked. 
 The init state allows specification of a different state if the default
action of moving to single-user mode where 
• All users are shut out 
• Only the console is enabled 
 The -y flag skips the “Are you sure?” prompt for certain state changes
and is usually used within scripts rather than from an interactive shell.
Table 16-1 defines the different init states in Solaris.
Table 16-1
Init States in Solaris
State
Definition
0
Stop the operating system.
1
Administrative or single-user state, also
known as s or S state.
2
Multiuser state (default run time state).
5
Shut down so that it’s safe to remove the
power or otherwise physically disassemble
the system.
6
Stop the system and reboot it into the default
state (usually init state 2).
As an example, drop the system into init state 5 before physically transport-
ing it to a new cubicle:
301
Chapter 16: Essential System Administration

# shutdown –g 30 –i 5
Shutdown started.    Mon Feb 10 16:13:07 MST 2003
Broadcast Message from root (pts/0) on aurora Mon Feb 10
16:13:07...
The system aurora will be shut down in 30 seconds
Thirty seconds later, all processes are terminated, and the system halts.
Stopping the system with halt
The halt command has one purpose in life: to stop the operating system. 
Here are a few instances when you may want to use this command: 
 You are suddenly notified that the power is going out in your facility.
 You realize that someone has unauthorized access, and you want to stop
the system immediately.
 You just need to reconfigure or install some new hardware.
For a simple program, halt has a surprising number of command line
options, as shown in Table 16-2.
Table 16-2
Options for halt
Option
Meaning
-d
Force a system crash dump before rebooting. Can
be useful for debugging OS performance issues.
-l
Suppress sending a message to the system log
daemon, syslogd, about who executed halt.
-n
Prevent the sync before stopping. Use with cau-
tion: The disks will not be in sync with the
operating system 
-q
Quick halt. No graceful shutdown is attempted.
-y
Halt the system, even from a dial-up terminal.
302
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

To quickly halt a system, you can use:
halt –qy
but most likely, you’ll use halt either without any options, or with the -d
option if you’re trying to debug what’s causing the operating system to get
into a state where it requires a halt.
I recommended using shutdown –i 5 rather than halt because shutdown is
more graceful in terms of how running applications are stopped.
Rebooting with the reboot command
The third choice for changing the state of your Solaris system is to use the
reboot command, which, logically enough, forces an immediate reboot by
default. (It’s identical to shutdown –i 6.) 
Another straightforward utility, it has four important options, as highlighted
in Table 16-3.
Table 16-3
Options for the reboot Command
Option
Meaning
-d
Force a system crash dump before rebooting.
-l
Suppress sending a message to the system log daemon,
syslog, about who executed reboot.
-n
Avoid calling sync and do not log the reboot to syslogd
or to /var/adm/wtmpx. The kernel still attempts to sync
file systems prior to reboot, except if the -d option is also
present. If -d is used with -n, the kernel does not attempt
to sync file systems.
-q
Quick. Reboot quickly and ungracefully, without shutting
down running processes first.
The most important reboot option is that any additional arguments are
handed to the boot loader. (The boot loader is the program that controls how
the operating system starts up. If you see an Ok? prompt on boot-up, that’s
the boot loader running.) 
303
Chapter 16: Essential System Administration

For example, if you have two disks (Solaris8 and Solaris9) and a different ver-
sion of Solaris on each, you can switch from Solaris 9 to Solaris 8 by invoking:
reboot Solaris8
As with the halt command, Sun recommends that you use shutdown rather
than reboot to ensure that all running applications are shut down gracefully.
Adding User Accounts
A common system administration task is adding new users to a Solaris
system. 
 You can do most of the work with the Solaris Management Console,
which has many options for account configuration
 You can use the command-line alternative useradd.
The useradd command has perhaps the most complex usage message of any
Solaris command:
# useradd
UX: useradd: ERROR: invalid syntax.
usage:  useradd [-u uid [-o] | -g group | -G group[[,group]...] | -d dir |
-s shell | -c comment | -m [-k skel_dir] | -f inactive |
-e expire | -A authorization [, authorization ...] |
-P profile [, profile ...] | -R role [, role ...]]
-p project [, project ...] login
useradd -D [-g group | -b base_dir | -f inactive | -e expire
-A authorization [, authorization ...] |
-P profile [, profile ...] | -R role [, role ...]] |
-p project
Fortunately, you don’t have to specify every option every time!
To understand how this works, suppose that you want to create the account
sjobs for your friend and colleague Al Joe. The key information you’ll want
to know is 
 Desired account name
 Full user name
 Home directory
 Login shell
304
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

If Al wants the default login shell ksh and his account home will be in
/export/home along with everyone else, then the account addition com-
mand is
useradd -s /usr/bin/ksh -c “Al Joe” -d /export/home/ajoe ajoe
Unfortunately, useradd is a lazy command, so although this created an
appropriate entry in the password file /etc/passwd, it hasn’t built Steve’s
home directory or set an initial password. 
Creating a new home directory
Because you must be root to run useradd, it’s straightforward to create
Steve’s home directory:
# mkdir /export/home/sjobs
# chown sjobs /export/home/sjobs
If you use the -m flag to useradd, the home directory is created. However, the
files from the /etc/skel directory are not copied into the new directory.
To do the job well, copy in some of the files from the /etc/skel directory,
which contains standard account configuration files:
# ls /etc/skel
local.cshrc    local.login    local.profile
Copy each of these files into Steve’s new home directory, with the local
prefix stripped (so they become dot files):
# cd /export/home/sjobs
# cp /etc/skel/local.cshrc .cshrc
# cp /etc/skel/local.login .login
# cp /etc/skel/local.profile .profile
The next step is to ensure that Steve owns the files. (The wildcard pattern
matches all files that begin with a dot and are followed by a lowercase letter
and any subsequent sequence of letters, numbers, and punctuation.)
# chown sjobs .[a-z]*
Now double-check that all is well:
# ls -al
305
Chapter 16: Essential System Administration

total 10
drwxr-xr-x   2 sjobs    other   512 Feb 10 17:10 .
drwxr-xr-x  12 root     root    512 Feb 10 17:08 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 sjobs    other   136 Feb 10 17:10 .cshrc
-rw-r--r--   1 sjobs    other   157 Feb 10 17:10 .login
-rw-r--r--   1 sjobs    other   174 Feb 10 17:10 .profile
Looks great. The one remaining problem is that Steve’s account doesn’t have
a password set.
Setting the account password
To set an account password as root, specify the name of the account as an
argument to the passwd command and then type in the desired password
twice:
# passwd sjobs
New Password: 
Re-enter new Password: 
passwd: password successfully changed for sjobs
You can also fine-tune the account password settings with the passwd com-
mand, something that’s unique to Solaris in the Unix world. The important
flags — all of which overlap the Password Options shown in Figure 16-7 —
are described in Table 16-4.
Table 16-4
Important Password Settings with passwd
Option
Meaning
-f
Forces the user to change the password at the next login by expiring 
the password for name.
-l
Locks the password entry for name.
-n min
Sets the minimum field for name. The min field contains the minimum 
number of days between password changes for name. If min is 
greater than max, the user may not change the password. Always 
use this option with the -x option, unless max is set to 1 (aging turned
off). In that case, min does not need to be set.
-w warn
Sets the warn field for name. The warn field contains the number of 
days before the password expires and the user is warned. 
-x max
Sets the maximum field for name. The max field contains the number 
of days that the password is valid for name. The aging for name will 
be turned off immediately if max is set to -1. If it is set to 0, the user is 
forced to change the password at the next login session, and aging is
turned off.
306
Part V: Administration and Security Issues 

To give Steve the same password settings shown in Figure 16-7, the command
would be
# passwd -n 14 -w 2 -x 30 sjobs
passwd: password information changed for sjobs
You can quickly delete an account several ways:
 Use the -d flag to passwd.
 Use -l to lock the account.
 Change the password to something you know but the user doesn’t know.

Keeping Your System Secure
In This Chapter
 Ensuring account password security
 Identifying proper file permissions
 Disabling unnecessary Internet services
A
n important underpinning of any system security efforts is how 
Solaris views users and user permissions. If you’re used to Windows 
or a Macintosh computer, you’re familiar with a structure where — 
fundamentally — anyone who uses the computer has complete access to 
the system. Any user can add device drivers, delete programs, explore the
file system and open any files found, and so on.
The newest Windows and Macintosh operating systems are more sophisti-
cated, but their security models are less robust than a Solaris system. Sun
Microsystems and the Unix development community have spent decades
trying to find the perfect balance between high and reliable security, and 
non-intrusive barriers for users. And they’ve done a pretty darn good job!
Accounts and Permissions
The core idea behind Solaris security is that different users have different
sets of permissions on the system.
If you’re user taylor and you use ls to compare your ID against the owner-
ship and permissions of a specific file or directory, you can immediately
determine whether or not you can access it. For example:
$ id
uid=100(taylor) gid=1(other)
$ ls -ld .
drwxr-xr-x  35 taylor   other       2048 Feb  8 11:33 ./
$ ls -ld /
drwxr-xr-x  44 root     root        1536 Feb  7 17:21 /

You can see that my user ID is taylor and I’m part of group other. Here’s a
look at the permissions as revealed in the preceding example:
 My home directory: You can see that the directory is also owned by
taylor, so I have full permissions to read, write, and otherwise fiddle
with that directory.
 The top-level / directory: The owner doesn’t match my user ID, and the
group doesn’t match my group. Therefore, my permissions on this direc-
tory are read and execute only. I can list the contents of the / directory
but cannot alter it.
One special user is exempt from this permission model: the root user. The
administrator ID root bypasses all permission issues and can read, write,
and execute any file or directory regardless of its permissions. Much of Unix
system security revolves around trying to ensure that only authorized users
can access the root account.
More fundamentally, security is often about trying to ensure that
 All accounts are secure
 Users cannot access the data or files of others without the owners grant-
ing explicit permission.
Don’t think of security as a box that can be built and nailed down around
your computer.
 Your system security is more akin to a specific point along the no-security-
maximum-access and maximum-security-no-access continuum.
 The more secure you make the system, the harder it is to use.
 It’s impossible to make any system on a public network completely
secure.
This chapter deals with making a Solaris system secure enough for most
users. If you need an level of increased security, you’ll want a more advanced
book; start by checking out the Solaris online library at docs.sun.com/. You
can ratchet up security many ways, including using 
 Firewalls
 Proxy servers
 Security monitoring systems like Tripwire 
310
Part V: Administrative and Security Issues 

Ensuring Account Password Security
The most obvious way to increase security is to make sure that all the user
accounts are set up properly. An account without a password, or an account
entry in the /etc/passwd file that’s malformed, can lead to
 Unauthorized users on your system
 Authorized users gaining more permissions than they’ve been formally
granted.
Solaris has two useful tools for checking the password file:
pwck to check the file format
passwd to see a summary of account configurations.
Validating the password file
The password file check program pwck doesn’t have much to say if the file is
formatted properly:
# pwck
#
Without any output, one can presume that everything in the password file
looks fine. But see what happens if a user somehow ends up with a colon in
the fullname (gecos) field of his or her entry in the password file:
# pwck
hacker::0:1: ::hack the planet!:: :/:/usr/bin/bash
Too many/few fields
Clearly even a visual inspection reveals that the hacker account is suspicious:
 There’s no password. 
In the password file, colons separate fields, and the second field should
have an x to indicate that the encrypted password is in a shadow file for
additional security. By having no value in this second field, you know
that this account has no password!
 More importantly, the fifth field contains the illegal value ::hack the
planet!:: rather than the user’s name. The additional colons throw
Solaris for a loop.
311
Chapter 17: Keeping Your System Secure

To fix this, you need to edit the password file to delete the bad entry. The
best way to do this is with the vipw program. This ensures that another
administrator doesn’t corrupt the password file while you’re changing it. The
password file has an entry for every account on the system, as shown here:
# cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:1:Super-User:/:/usr/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1::/:
bin:x:2:2::/usr/bin:

Summarizing account data with passwd

inappropriate password entries:
# passwd -sa

taylor    PS 
dave      PS 
sjobs     PS    02/11/03    14    30     2
Steve, with account sjobs, has password aging enabled (see Chapter 16), so
the output for his account is
 Date of the last password change
 Minimum days between password changes
 Maximum days without a password change
 Number of days prior to expiring a password that the user should be
warned.
The second column for every account listed is the status:
 PS means it’s password-protected.
 LK means it’s locked.
 NP stands for no password.
In the output of the /etc/passwd file in the preceding section, you’ll see that
the passwd command did not identify the account crack, which has no pass-
word. This is not good at all!
To ensure that every account is checked, do something more sophisticated
on the command line:
# for name in `cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd`
> do
>   passwd -s $name
> done
This shell loop performs a couple of steps:
 Extracts each account name in the passwd file. (It uses cut, which uses
the : as the field delimiter and lists only the first field — the account
name — in the output.)
 Test each account explicitly with the passwd –s command.
The output is

passwd: User unknown: crack
Permission denied
The User unknown error is troubling because the account name crack came
from the /etc/passwd file. This is something you need to investigate further!
Checking for additional root accounts
Another way to find the crack account is to search for accounts with the
user ID value of zero. The fastest way to do this is to use grep and “:0:” as
the pattern:
# grep “:0:” /etc/passwd
root:x:0:1:Super-User:/:/usr/bin/bash
crack::0:hacktheplanet:/:/bin/sh
There’s that bad account, crack. Not only does it not have a password, 
but it’s also set up as another root account. (Any account with user ID 0 is
considered a root account, with all access and privileges that implies.) You
need to remove this dangerous, unauthorized root account entry as soon as
possible!
Tweaking default password settings
A Solaris configuration file controls the default setup of passwords for new
accounts. It’s worth a quick peek:
# cat /etc/default/passwd
#ident  “@(#)passwd.dfl 1.3     92/07/14 SMI”
MAXWEEKS=
MINWEEKS=
PASSLENGTH=6
314
Part V: Administrative and Security Issues 

MAXWEEKS and MINWEEKS are password aging options. Eight and one are good
values for these options. These options put the following restrictions on
passwords:
 Passwords are good for only a maximum of eight weeks
 Passwords cannot be changed for a week after they’ve been updated.
Identifying Proper File Permissions
It’s important to ensure that files and directories have appropriate 
permissions. 
To check and ensure that users have reasonable sets of permissions for 
their home directories, for example, list all the directories in long format 
by using ls:
# ls -l /export/home
total 38
drwxr-xr-x   2 root   root    512 Oct  4 17:01 TT_DB
drwxr-xr-x  11 root   other   512 Dec 10 19:32 adabas
drwxrwxrwx  12 dave   other   512 Feb  6 14:59 dave
drwxr-xr-x   3 root   other   512 Dec 19 14:11 gnome
drwxr-xr-x   8 root   other   512 Dec 12 13:10 imagemagick
drwx------   2 root   root   8192 Oct  2 11:45 lost+found
drwxr-xr-x   9 1010   staff  1536 Oct 24 17:56 mozilla
drwxr-xr-x   2 sjobs  other   512 Feb 10 17:10 sjobs
drwxr-xr-x   6 root   other   512 Oct  2 16:22 staroffice6.0
drwxr-xr-x  35 taylor other  2048 Feb 11 10:38 taylor
You can see that permissions vary between these extremes:
 The relatively closed permissions of lost+found (which turns out to be
used by the low-level file system recovery utility fsck and should be left
alone)
 The completely open directory for account dave.
Most likely, dave would be upset if other users stored huge files in his
account or deleted his mailbox, both of which could happen with a com-
pletely open permission setting.
To fix this, you may have a couple of options:
 As root, simply change the permissions.
 Send an e-mail notification to users who may have problematic settings.
You can fix the permissions yourself, this time:
315
Chapter 17: Keeping Your System Secure

# chmod go-w /export/home/dave
# ls -l /export/home/dave
total 0
Oops! If you’re just listing a directory, the contents are shown by default. 
To force the directory itself to be shown, add the -d flag:
# ls -ld /export/home/dave
drwxr-xr-x  12 dave  other  512 Feb 6 14:59 /export/home/dave
Fixing individual directories is one solution, but the better strategy is to
ensure that files and directories are created with the correct permissions in
the first place.
Working with umask
The umask setting controls the permissions granted to a new file or directory
when created, and each user can have a different setting. Unfortunately,
umask isn’t a permission setting to duplicate; it’s the opposite of what you
want. 
If you want to have permission -rwx-r-x-, then you want octal permission
750. (Chapter 4 covers file permissions.) For a umask that would produce that
permission, you need to specify the opposite of 750, the value that results if
you subtract the desired mask from 777:
777
- 750
———-
027
That’s the umask setting desired: 027.
To identify the current umask value, type umask:
# umask
022
Subtract this value from 777 to get the resulting permissions: 777 – 022 = 755,
which can also be expressed as -rwx-r-xr-x.
To change the umask, enter a new value. It’ll stick until the next time you log
in, at which point it’s set to the default system value and possibly reset based
on the contents of a login configuration file.
316
Part V: Administrative and Security Issues 

Create a file and directory with each of these two umasks to see the 
difference:
# umask 027
# touch testfile1
# mkdir testdir1
# umask 022
# touch testfile2
# mkdir testdir2
# ls -ld test*
drwxr-x---   2 root     other     512 Feb 11 11:19 testdir1
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     other     512 Feb 11 11:19 testdir2
-rw-r-----   1 root     other       0 Feb 11 11:19 testfile1
-rw-r--r--   1 root     other       0 Feb 11 11:19 testfile2
The preceding example illustrate a couple of common permission cases:
 testdir1 has these permissions:
• Read and execute permission for group 
• None for any non-group users on the system
testdir2 has read and execute permission for both group and every-
one else.
 testfile1 has these permissions:
• Read and write permission for owner 
• Read-only for group
• No access for everyone else
umask 022 produced testfile2, which has read permission granted to
everyone on the system.
You can change the umask for users directly, but it’s best to e-mail them. To
change the umask of accounts yet to be created, make the appropriate set-
tings in the /etc/skel files. (See Chapter 16 for an explanation of how these
files come into play when creating new accounts.)
Finding files and programs with 
inappropriate permissions
Other potential security problems can be identified by checking 
 File permissions 
 Ownership
317
Chapter 17: Keeping Your System Secure

Overly write-enabled files
Files that are writeable by users other than the owner can be a tip-off that
something’s not right. You can find these files with the wonderful find
command.
To test the files within user home directories, you can use:
# find /export/home -type f -perm -o+w
#
Looks good!
The dangerous SetUID
Executable programs or scripts may have the so-called setuid (set user ID)
bit set. If it’s set, anyone running that program will have the same permis-
sions as the program’s owner.
A setuid program that’s owned by root is dangerous, so quickly scan all the
directories in your PATH to see what’s there:
# find `echo $PATH|sed ‘s/:/ /g’`  -type f -perm -4000 | head
/usr/sbin/sparcv7/whodo
/usr/sbin/allocate
/usr/sbin/sacadm
/usr/sbin/traceroute
/usr/sbin/deallocate
/usr/sbin/list_devices
/usr/sbin/sparcv9/whodo
/usr/sbin/lpmove
/usr/sbin/pmconfig
/usr/sbin/ping
#
The preceding output shows numerous matches, of which only the first ten
are shown here.
Immediately after you do a new installation of the operating system, I recom-
mend saving this output in a new file called something similar to /export/
home/taylor/.ok-setuid. Then on subsequent runs, you can omit listing
all known setuid files by using the slightly more complex command:
# find `echo $PATH|sed ‘s/:/ /g’`  -type f -perm -4000 | \
grep –vf /export/home/taylor/.ok-setuid
#
The output of this command is definitely worth keeping an eye on: I’d recom-
mend running this at least once a week on a busy system, and more often if
you have lots of guest users or students.
318
Part V: Administrative and Security Issues 

If you’re thinking this might make a good shell script, good for you! Chapter 3
shows how to turn this command into a simple script.
Disabling Unnecessary Internet Services
One of the best ways to improve the system security is to shut off all Internet
services that aren’t vital to your work. If you don’t plan on offering files via
FTP, for example, why have it enabled?
Starting inetd
Solaris uses the straightforward inetd service to manage which services are
made available, all of which is defined in the /etc/inetd.conf file. Any line
that doesn’t begin with # lists an active service. (I’ve cleaned up the other-
wise ragged paste output.)
# egrep -v ‘(^#|^1)’ /etc/inetd.conf | \
cut -f1 | paste - - - -

walld/1
sprayd/1
name
telnet
ftp
rquotad/1
uucp
319
Chapter 17: Keeping Your System Secure

The inetd.conf file is well documented if you want to see what all of these
services are doing enabled on your system. Some are obvious. If you don’t
want ftp running, you have a couple of options:
 Disable the ftp line by inserting a # at the beginning of the line.
 Better yet, insert #DAT# (with your initials) so that if a problem occurs,
you can easily go back to see which services you disabled and which
services Sun disabled.
Of these listed services, you can probably safely disable everything except
these:
dtspc, which is used by the CDE login subsystem
fs, which is the X Window System font server utility.
Users on other computers don’t need to know your system status or which
users are logged on to your machine. If you disable nothing else, disable
these three. You’ll never miss them:
Finger
Systat
netstat
Restarting inetd via kill
After you’ve made any desired changes to the inetd.conf file, make the
changes on your running system, too, by sending a SIGHUP to the running
inetd process. This is a two-step activity.
1. Identify the process ID of inetd, like this:
# ps -ef | grep inetd
root  166     1  0   Feb 07 ?      0:00 /usr/sbin/inetd -
s
root 7450  6943  0 12:03:45 pts/4  0:00 grep inetd
PID 166 is the job you seek.
2. To send a specific signal by using the kill program, specify the latter
part of the signal name as an option (that is, to send SIGHUP, use -HUP
as the option):
# kill –HUP 166
#
You don’t see any confirmation that it worked. But if you do another ps
-ef, you should not see the daemons and Internet services you’ve
turned off in the inetd.conf file.

Ten Best Web Sites
In This Chapter
 Finding the best Solaris documentation and information online
 Fixing and running a big Solaris system or a small PC-based installation
 Pointers to everything at Everything Solaris
 Finding cool, Sun-endorsed software, GNU tools, GNOME, and games
I
t goes without saying that one of the best places to explore Solaris
resources, documentation, and product announcements is the official Sun
Microsystems Web site at www.sun.com/. But there’s a lot more on the Web,
including three specific areas within the enormous Sun site that are well
worth bookmarking in your browser.
Excellent Online Solaris Documentation
Compared to most Unix operating systems, Solaris is well documented with
both the man pages and AnswerBook system included with the distribution.
However, the Sun experts have spent a lot of time exploring, analyzing, fixing,
and documenting just about every facet of every Solaris version, even earlier
SunOS releases. You can access all of this information online, in an easy-to-
browse layout, at:
docs.sun.com
If you’re running Solaris 9, click the Solaris 9 link upon entering the site to see
information that applies to your version of the operating system. If you have
a different version of the OS, you can find lots to explore here, too.

Big Iron Administration Assistance
You will inevitably have to do some sort of administration on your Solaris
system. The Sun Big System Administration site is the best resource for
administration information:
www.sun.com/bigadmin/
The resources area and the discussions are worth noting. Some of the discus-
sions on this site will blow your socks off with the authors levels of technical
expertise, but others will offer a good venue for asking even rudimentary
Solaris system administration questions.
More Sysadmin at Sys Admin Magazine
Sys Admin has long been one of the best magazines for a Unix system admin-
istrator, and it should be no surprise that the popular Solaris servers are a
common topic of discussion and feature articles. On the Web, Sys Admin
neatly organizes its Solaris material in an area called the Solaris Corner:
www.samag.com/solaris/
The Solaris Administration “Best Practices” column is worth checking out.
The author explores a variety of topics and offers thoughtful and oft-novel
solutions to common sysadmin problems.
Small but Helpful Reference Site
A modest Web site, Everything Solaris offers valuable articles and tutorials,
along with some neat free applications downloads and a discussion area:
everythingsolaris.org/
The same Web designer runs similar sites for Linux and Mac OS X, so if you’re
interested in comparing Solaris to these other popular Unix operating sys-
tems, they too can make for interesting reading.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Squeeze Solaris on the Intel Platform
One cool hidden capability of Solaris 9 is that it can be installed and run hap-
pily on an Intel-based personal computer. (And yes, even a slim laptop
computer can run Solaris 9.) If you’re interested in this option, the Solaris on
Intel site is a great place to find information:
www.sun.drydog.com/
Start by reading the extensive Frequently Asked Questions material. And con-
sider signing up for the site’s highly informative — and sporadically busy —
mailing list for people trying to ensure that their Solaris 9 systems live on
Intel systems happily and efficiently.
An Extensive Collection of Solaris Info
Stokely Consulting’s Unix System Administrator’s Resources site offers a ton
of great information about Solaris and many other Unix operating systems,
focused primarily — but not exclusively — on system administration. 
www.stokely.com/unix.sysadm.resources/
Be sure to check out the article about setting up and configuring e-mail so
that it’s secure and spam is minimized; look for it on the main page. Also
don’t miss the listing of Unix and system administration mailing lists.
Keep Up-To-Date on Solaris News
Solaris Central sports a wonderful design, and its main page is a log of news
and coming events for the Solaris community. It’s a great resource for every
Solaris user, administrator or otherwise:

Cool, Sun-Endorsed Software
Although not the largest repository of Solaris-compatible software for your
Sun computer, the Sun software download area is an excellent place to get
well-tested applications like the latest version of the Java runtime environ-
ment, StarOffice, or the Sun ONE Application Server.
www.sun.com/software/download/
To see what freeware is redistributed by Sun, visit
www.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/
Even More Cool Solaris Software
The Sunfreeware site offers a repository of Solaris software, primarily from
the GNU Project (www.gnu.org/). Specify which Solaris version you’re run-
ning to see an extensive list of software packages available: 
www.sunfreeware.com/
As with the Sun documentation site, select your operating system and
processor (for example, SPARC/Solaris 9) and then look through the some-
what cryptically named package list to see what’s available.
If you don’t have a fast Internet connection, you can order a CD-ROM of the
site’s top downloads for a small fee. It’s well worth the savings in sanity for
some Solaris users!
Yet More Great Freeware!
Freeware4Sun offers an extensive list of downloadable software for your
Solaris system. The site has a distinctive and rather funky appearance. You’ll
find specific areas for patches, software, GNOME, and even games! Check it

Ten Key Security Features
In This Chapter
 Safer remote connectivity with secure shell, encryption and secure directory access
 Limiting remote access, per application or with a firewall
 Protecting your system from buffer overflow 
 Limiting access through roles
 Strengthening your system with smart cards and one-time access security
N
o universal panacea exists for making a Solaris system completely
secure, but Solaris 9 has some technologies and tools that you need
to know about, whether you’re administering your system or just want to
ensure people don’t mess with your files. You can also find more discussion
of security in Chapter 17 of this book. Sun offers an excellent top-level fre-
quently asked questions document, the Sun Solaris Security FAQ, at www.
sun.com/software/solaris/faqs/security.html.
Secure Shell
One of the best improvements you can make to your Solaris system is to shut
off telnet, rlogin, and ftp, and replace these Internet services with the
Secure Shell (ssh) package. Although the former services send the account
and password information in the clear (that is, unencrypted), the ssh equiva-
lent programs use point-to-point public key encryption, making it much harder
for someone to peek into your transactions and extract account information.
IPSec and IPK
Oddly named, IP Secure (IPSec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) are critical
components of a Virtual Private Network, and enable encrypted IP traffic
between two systems by using a robust 128-bit encryption scheme. IPSec
increases security between servers so that only authorized parties can 
communicate. 

SunScreen Firewall
One of the most important security features of a modern Solaris system is a
firewall, a program that screens all incoming connection requests to ensure
that they’re legitimate and acceptable. The excellent Solaris solution for this
is Sun’s SunScreen tool, which features a state-sensitive packet filter, support
for IPSec/IKE, centralized management, proxy services with built-in antivirus
checking, and network address translation for hiding internal IP addressing
schemes.
Secure LDAP Implementation
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) offers access to a central-
ized directory, but not without some security risks. Sun’s LDAP
implementation has been enhanced for Solaris 9 and now supports both
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and DIGEST-MD5 encryption. Secure LDAP allows
you to name objects and ensure secure access to the naming service. It pro-
vides a flexible attribute-mapping mechanism and is designed for complete
password management support via the directory server. 
TCP Wrappers
If you don’t replace standard Unix communications utilities telnet, rlogin,
and ftp with their Secure Shell counterparts, you can increase the security of
the tools by using the access control method known as TCP Wrappers. Think
of it as an authentication and authorization layer between the client and
server systems. It doesn’t encrypt the communication, but it helps ensure
that only authorized users are accessing the identified services.
Buffer Overflow Protection
One of the most common ways for hackers to break into a Solaris system is to
exploit buffer overflows. Imagine it this way: You write a program that
expects no more than a 20-letter password to be entered. But a wily hacker
enters a 15,000-character entry, overflowing the space allocated for the pass-
word variable. With some apps, the overflow can end up being an executed
code snippet, which clearly is very bad! Solaris 9’s enhanced buffer overflow
protection goes a long way toward solving this problem.
330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Role-Based Access Control
Unix has always had three categories of access control: owner, group, and
other. But on a modern multiuser system, a more sophisticated tool is needed;
that’s what role-based access control offers. By defining as many roles as
needed, you can give a printer tech access only to the areas on your system
that require updates for new printers being installed. Role-based access con-
trol is well worth learning about, whether you’re a system administrator or
just a Solaris 9 user.
Smart Card Support
One of the most secure methods of controlling access to a Solaris system is
through smart cards. By coupling traditional account passwords (known in
security circles as “what you know” security) with smart cards (which oper-
ate on the basis of “what you have”), you have a solid method of limiting
access, particularly from a remote location.
Kerberos v5
Invented at MIT, Kerberos is a popular authentication scheme on a widely dis-
tributed network, particularly for single sign-on setups. The latest version of
Kerberos includes improved system security and replaces the formerly sepa-
rate Sun Enterprise Authentication Mechanism product. Kerberos also
interoperates gracefully with MIT Kerberos and Microsoft’s Active Directory,
which is a boon if you have a multi-OS network.
Solaris Resource Manager
Although it may not seem to be a security tool, the Solaris Resource Manager
(SRM) is a great boon for controlling access and use of system resources. It
controls resource allocation, monitoring, and control, including an improved
accounting capability. For example, disabling writing to the CD-ROM device
can help ensure that critical system or company files aren’t copied.
Preventing guest users from printing is another example of where SRM is
helpful.

Chapter 20
Ten Great Free Add-Ons
In This Chapter
 Editors and more editors
 Graphical tools and desktop environments
 Web browsing without pictures
 Watching TV and, if you must, editing Word Documents 
S
olaris 9 includes a wealth of tools and a CDROM full of open source and
other freeware from the Internet, but there’s always room on a computer
disk for just one more great piece of software. That’s what this last chapter
explores: some truly wonderful software that is sure to enhance your Solaris
experience. Though it’s not all guaranteed to make you more productive!
Everything and the Kitchen Sink: Emacs
Many Solaris users swear by emacs, a powerful alternative to the vi editor. It
was developed by Sun’s own James Gosling, and later updated and enhanced
by Richard Stallman, head of the GNU Project. If you like small, modular appli-
cations, macs isn’t for you. But if want an editor that can do just about
anything you desire, from helping you browse man pages to auto-formatting
your programs, it’s well worth a look. You can find it at www.sun.com/
software/solaris/freeware/.
Digging for GNOME
GNOME is one of the best things to happen to Solaris in a long time, from a
user perspective. You can get the latest version of this powerful graphical
environment, including many prebuilt GNOME applications, at www.sun.com/
gnome/.

GNOME is covered throughout this book, but particularly in Chapter 2.
An Attractive Alternative Desktop
A capable and arguably more visually attractive alternative to GNOME, the K
Desktop Environment is a different way of looking at your desktop. It includes
a suite of KDE-compatible applications, including the slick Konquerer Web
browser and file system browser. 
You can find KDE online at www.kde.org/ and download it for Solaris at www.
sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/.
When Surfing Speed Is All That Counts
Although the latest version of Netscape Navigator (a worthy free download at
www.netscape.com/) makes surfing the Web attractive and easy, sometimes
it’s useful to have a command line–based alternative. That’s where lynx
comes in. 
Operating in a text-only mode, lynx not only is great for people with visual
disabilities, but also is scriptable so you can include calls to Web sites within
your shell scripts. This powerful capability makes tasks like calculating a
current stock price a breeze.
Download the package at www.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/.
A Powerful and Free Database
Alternative
Many database applications are available for a Solaris system — including
phone books, project archives, and data catalogs — but the included choices
are weak, and commercial offerings like Oracle and Syngress are expensive. 
The solution is MySQL, a free and surprisingly robust database alternative,
available for downloading at www.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/.
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Watch TV on Your Solaris System? Sure!
ShowMe TV enables you to switch to working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day
by having a small window on your screen showing the latest from ESPN,
TechTV, Bloomberg Financial TV, or even HBO. This capability is most useful
for videoconferencing and broadcasting training materials throughout a
subnet or intranet. You need some hardware for video stream capture, but
the software’s free, and it’s incredibly cool! 
The ShowMe TV software and docs are available at www.sun.com/desktop/
products/software/showmetv/.
StarOffice: A Great Alternative
One of the best recent developments in the Unix community is the emergence
and continued evolution of StarOffice. It’s a viable alternative to the Microsoft
hegemony of MS Office. Whether working with Word documents, Excel
spreadsheets, or PowerPoint presentations, you can stay firmly tucked into
the Solaris environment of your choice and interoperate like a guru. See
www.sun.com/staroffice/.
StarOffice is covered in Chapters 9 and 10.
Interactive Multimedia Collaboration
If you’ve checked out ShowMe TV and decided that it’s only solving part of
the distributed training and collaboration problem, a more powerful and inte-
grated alternative is SunForum. 
This amazing suite of tools is available at www.sun.com/desktop/
products/software/sunforum/.
Vi on Steroids!
For many Solaris users, vi is the editor of choice. But some capabilities are
missing in vi, including 
335
Chapter 20: Ten Great Free Add-Ons

 Support for multiple edit windows
 An undo capability that can back up to the original file
 Support for the X Window System, with pull-down menus and more. 
All of these have been addressed in the excellent vim package. You can find it
at www.vim.org/.
Games, Games, Games
If you spend a lot of time using your computer for work, it’s nice to occasion-
ally take a short break and play a game. Because of the ubiquitous nature of
the X Window System underlying both GNOME and CDE, a ton of games are
available, from Tetris clones to Chess, from Backgammon to Mahjongg, and
even an air-traffic-control game. 
To check out the range of offerings (though not every game is built for
Solaris), start at www.gnu.org/directory/games/.
