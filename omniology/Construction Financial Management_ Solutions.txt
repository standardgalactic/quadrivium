Exercise Questions for Chapter 2
Exercise Question 1
Base on the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet shown on Tables 2.1 and 2.2 respectively in 
Chapter 2. Calculate:
a)	 the three Profitability Ratios,
b)	 the three Liquidity Ratios,
c)	 the three Working Capital Ratios,
d)	 the two Capital Structure Ratios, and
e)	 the seven Activity Ratios.
Solution:
(a) Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios measure the construction company’s ability to earn profit from its operation. The 
three most commonly used profitability ratios are:
Gross Profit Margin Ratio = Gross profit / Revenue
For 2012, 9,921,256 / 40,875,351 = 24.27%
For 2011, 10,319,606 / 34,701,250 = 29.74%
(The goal for net profit margin ratio is 25% minimum; if subcontractors (pay-as-paid basis) occupy a 
significant portion of the cost of revenue, the goal can be reduced to 20% minimum)
Net Profit Margin Ratio = Net profit before tax / Revenue
For 2012, 1,333,440 / 40,875,351 = 3.26%
For 2011, 2,814,730 / 34,701,250 = 8.11%
(The goal for net profit margin ratio is 5% minimum)
Return on Equity Ratio = Net profit before tax / Owners’ equity
For 2012, 1,333,440 / 5,431,345 = 24.55%
For 2011, 2,814,730 / 5,694,202 = 49.43%
(The return on equity ratio should be between 15% and 40%)

(b) Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios indicate the construction company’s ability to pay its obligations as they come due. The 
three most common liquidity ratios used are shown below.
Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities
For 2012, 12,697,745 / 7,679,247 = 1.65
For 2011, 11,685,952 / 6,177,005 = 1.89
(The current ratio should be higher than 1.3 for a financially healthy construction company)
Acid Test Ratio (or Quick Ratio) = (Cash + Accounts receivables) / Current liabilities
For 2012, (2,305,078 + 6,124,992) / 7,679,247 = 1.10
For 2011, (1,877,676 + 5,837,658) / 6,177,005 = 1.25 
(The acid test ratio or quick ratio should be higher than 1.1 for a construction company)
Current Assets to Total Assets Ratio = Current assets / Total assets
For 2012, 12,697,745 / 14,591,105 = 87.02%
For 2011, 11,685,952 / 13,772,652 = 84.85% 
(The current assets to total assets ratio should be between 60% and 80%)
(c) Working Capital Ratios
These ratios measure how well the construction company is utilizing its working capital. The three most 
commonly used working capital ratios are shown below.
Working Capital Turnover = Revenue / Working capital
For 2012, 40,875,351 / (12,697,745 – 7,679,247) = 8.14 times
For 2011, 34,701,250 / (11,685,952 – 6,177,005) = 6.30 times
(The working capital turnover should be between 8 and 12 times per year)
Net Profit to Working Capital Ratio = Net profit before tax / Working capital
For 2012, 1,333,440 / (12,697,745 – 7,679,247) = 26.57%
For 2011, 2,814,730 / (11,685,952 – 6,177,005) = 51.09%
(The net profit to working capital ratio should be between 40% and 60%)

Degree of Fixed Asset Newness = Net depreciable fixed assets / Total depreciable fixed assets
For 2012, 1,893,360/ 3,945,260 = 47.99%
For 2011, 2,086,700/ 3,750,100 = 55.64%
(The degree of fixed asset newness should be between 40% and 60%)
(d) Capital Structure Ratios
Capital structure ratios indicate the ability of the construction company to manage liabilities. These 
ratios also indicate the approach that the company prefers to finance its operation. The two major capital 
structure ratios are:
Debt to Equity Ratio = Total liabilities / Owners’ equity
For 2012, 9,159,760 / 5,431,345 = 1.69
For 2011, 8,078,450 / 5,694,202 = 1.42
(The debt to equity ratio should be lower than 2.5)
Leverage = Total assets / Owners’ equity
For 2012, 14,591,105 / 5,431,345 = 2.69
For 2011, 13,772,652 / 5,694,202 = 2.42

Or
Leverage 	
= Total assets / Owners’ equity
	
	
= (Total liabilities + Owners’ equity) / Owners’ equity
	
	
= (Total liabilities / Owners equity) + 1
	
	
= Debt to Equity Ratio + 1
For 2012, 1.69 + 1 = 2.69
For 2011, 1.42 + 1 = 2.42
(The leverage should be lower than 3.5. Some construction companies prefer to use leverage of 3.5 or 
close to it but some conservative ones prefer to use a lower leverage. This relates to, of course, the use 
of a higher or lower debt to equity ratio by the company.)
(e) Activity Ratios
Activity ratios indicate whether or not the construction company is using its assets effectively, and if 
yes, how effective they are. There are quite a number of activity ratios, and the seven commonly used 
ones are shown below.
Average Age of Material Inventory = (Material inventory / Materials cost) × 365 days
For 2012, (942,765 / 20,732,506) × 365 = 16.60 days
For 2011, (761,763 / 15,925,567) × 365 = 17.46 days
(The average age of material inventory should be shorter than 30 days)
Average Age of Under Billings = (Under billings / Revenue) × 365 days
For 2012, (581,221 / 40,875,351) ×365 = 5.19 days
For 2011, (486,472 / 34,701,250) × 365 = 5.12 days
(The average age of under billings should be the shorter the better)
Average Age of Accounts Receivable = (Accounts receivable / Revenue) × 365 days
For 2012, (6,124,992 / 40,875,351) × 365 = 54.69 days
For 2011, (5,837,658 / 34,701,250) × 365 = 61.40 days
(The average age of accounts receivable should be shorter than 45 days)

Cash Conversion Period = Average age of material inventory + Average age of under billings + Average 
age of accounts receivable 
For 2012, 16.60 + 5.19 + 54.69 = 76.48 days
For 2011, 17.46 + 5.12 + 61.40 = 83.98 days
(The cash conversion period should be shorter than 75 days)
Average Age of Accounts Payable = [Accounts payable / (Materials +Subcontracts)] × 365 days 
For 2012, [3,930,309 / (20,732,506 + 6,417,407)] ×365 = 52.84 days
For 2011, [3,481,330 / (15,925,567 + 4,721,312)] × 365 = 61.54 days
(The average age of accounts payable should be shorter than 45 days)
Average Age of Over Billings = (Over billings / Revenue) × 365 days
For 2012, (560,847 / 40,875,351) × 365 = 5.01 days
For 2011, (495,167 / 34,701,250) × 365 = 5.21 days
(Usually there is no guideline on average age of over billings)
Cash Demand Period = Cash conversion period – Average age of accounts payable – Average age of 
over-billings 
For 2012, 76.48 – 52.84 – 5.01 = 18.63 days
For 2011, 83.98 – 61.54 – 5.21 = 17.23 days
(The cash demand period should be shorter than 30 days)
Exercise Question 2
By referring to the ratios calculated in Exercise Question 1 above, are there any things you would like 
to add to Section 2.2 of the chapter to remind the new general manager that he has missed but should 
have considered?

Exercise Question 1
The pavement of a road requires $400,000 per year to maintain. The feasibility of a new pavement is being 
considered for reducing maintenance costs. If the new pavement needs no maintenance in the first three 
years, then $200,000 per year for the next seven years, and then $400,000 per year thereafter, what is the 
immediate expenditure for the new pavement that is justifiable? (Assume a discount rate of 10% p.a.).
Solution:
The present value of maintaining the new pavement in the first 10 years:
Let PV3 = the equivalent sum of money at the end of Year 3 for the uniform series of payments of 
$200,000 per annum from Yr 4 to Yr 10 (a total of 7 years)

Exercise Question 2
A contractor borrowed $500,000 from a bank to buy earth-moving equipment with an estimated service 
life of 10 years. The bank charged the contractor 12% interest p.a. and required him to pay back the 
loan in 10 years’ time.
a)	 Assuming that the contractor paid back the bank in 10 equal instalments (once every year), 
calculate the amount of each end-of-year payment.
b)	 The contractor at the end of year 4 wished to make an early redemption (i.e. pay all the money 
that he owed the bank). How much should he pay?
c)	 The bank negotiated with the contractor and reduced the interest rate to 10% p.a. at the 
beginning of the 5th year in order to attract the contractor to stay borrowing. What would be 
the contractor’s repayment schedule if he chose to pay back the bank in the form of six uniform 
payments from the end of years 5 to the end of year 10?
d)	 If the bank changed the interest rate back to 12% p.a. at the beginning of the 8th year, what would 
be the amount of the contractor’s last payment (i.e. payment at the end of year 10) if he kept 
on paying the bank the same instalment as calculated in (c) above at the end or years 8 and 9?
Solution:
(a) Amount of each end-of-year payment

Exercise Question 3
There are two alternatives to construct a storage house. Both serve the purpose of allowing construction 
materials to be stored in the house. However, due to different construction methods (one is made of 
wood and the other made of bricks), different life spans and cash flow patterns are associated with each 
alternative as follows:
Alternative 1 (wood)
Alternative 2 (bricks)
Life
10 years
15 years
Initial capital cost
$900,000
$1,300,000
Operation and maintenance cost
$80,000 p.a.
$20,000 p.a.
Assuming the discount rate to be 16% p.a., choose the better alternative by:
a)	 the present value method, and
b)	 the equivalent annual cost method.
(Hints: compare the alternatives based on the same number of years, i.e. 30 years)

Exercise Questions for Chapter 3
Exercise Question 4
We have seen from Section 3.5 (or Example 3.6) of Chapter 3 that no matter which method we use to 
pay back the loan, the present values of the payments are always the same, equal to the principal sum. 
Prove mathematically to show that such a phenomenon is always true.
Solution:
Let	
P = principal borrowed,
	
A = principal amortization in year i,
	
R = 1 + i (i = borrowing interest rate, % p.a.), and
	
n = number of years.
Then, from Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in the book, we can derive that:

Exercise Question 5
We have seen from Section 3.6 (or Example 3.7) of Chapter 3 that the number is zero at the bottom-
right corner of the table in Part a) of the example. Prove mathematically to show that this is always true 
for all cases.
Solution:
In Example 3.7, the periodical payment A is calculated by (see Eq 3.5 of Chapter 3):
$  =  P1  ×

where P1 is the principal amount borrowed at the beginning.
This time we do a backward proof. We first assume that the remaining principal at the end of period 
n is zero. Then, the unpaid principal at the beginning of period n can be calculated as shown below:
Pn

  ------------------------------------- (2) 
where Pn is the unpaid principal at the beginning of period n, and A is the final payment at the end of 
period n, which consists of the interest (iPn) and the unpaid principal Pn in that period.
Hence, the unpaid principal (Pn-1) at the beginning of period n-1 can be calculated as follows:
Pn-1 = Pn + (A – iPn-1) -------------------------- (3)
Note that iPn-1 and (A – iPn-1) equal the interest payment and the principal amortization respectively paid 
at the end of period n-1. Substituting (2) into (3) and by algebraic transformation, we obtain:
Pn-1

Similarly, the unpaid principal at the beginning of period n-2 is:
Pn-2 = Pn-1 + (A – iPn-2) ----------------------------------------------- (5) 
where iPn-2 and (A – iPn-2) equal the interest and the principal amortization paid at the end of period 
n-2, respectively. Substituting (4) into (5), we have:

Note
The above proof also proves that the total amortization (sum of all amortizations) is equal to the principal 
amount P1.

Economic indicator NPV and financial indicator IRR
Economic indicator NPV and 
financial indicator IRR
S.L. Tang and H. John Tang
Abstract
The NPV (net present value) and the IRR (internal rate of return) are the two most common and important 
indicators for capital investments. These two indicators, however, have intrinsic differences between one 
and the other. It has been proposed since 1991 that NPV is an economic indicator and IRR a financial 
indicator. The former (NPV) indicates the economic value of an investment from a society’s point of 
view and the latter (IRR) indicates the financial return of an investment from a private investor’s point 
of view. The value of IRR varies with the change of financial arrangement of an investment. The NPV, 
however, remains constant no matter how the financial arrangement changes. This is a very fundamental 
discovery on NPV and IRR, and a very useful knowledge and great contribution to the field of Economics, 
Finance and Management.

Economic indicator NPV and financial indicator IRR
Introduction
The evaluation of net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) is well developed and 
documented in many publications. Some representative ones are Muro (1998 Chapters 4 and 5) and 
Lang and Merino (1993 Chapters 6 and 7). Although NPV and IRR are both discount cash flow methods, 
they have intrinsic differences between one and the other. Tang (1991, 2003 Chapter 5) and Robinson & 
Cook (1996) illustrated that the ranking of investment alternatives is not necessarily the same obtained 
by the two methods. Differences in rankings between NPV and IRR are further exhibited by Asguith and 
Bethel (1995), who reported that IRR may be preferred to NPV under certain circumstances. Evans and 
Forbes (1993) also reckoned that IRR is more cognitively efficient than NPV, because IRR is expressed as 
a percentage (or a rate of return) while NPV is just a monetary value cognitively inefficient to decision 
makers. Other researchers, such as Lefley and Morgan (1998), and particularly the academicians (Evans 
and Forbes, 1993), however, took the view that NPV is more conceptually “correct” despite the fact that 
IRR is more popular than NPV, and that NPV is more theoretically sound as IRR may be too “capricious” 
or “fickle” and may not rank some projects in the same order as NPV.
The authors, on the contrary, have the view that all such controversies and arguments about NPV and 
IRR might not be necessary if their basic functions could be better defined. It has been pointed out by 
Battaglio et al. (1996) that IRR is meant for a consumer’s point of view and NPV for a banker’s point of 
view. This is close to the true definition as consumers usually have relatively limited money and banks 
relatively unlimited money. The authors, however, reckon that an even more fundamental definition 
can be given. The definition is: NPV is an economic indicator and IRR a financial indicator. In other 
words, NPV gives the society’s point of view and IRR the private investor’s point of view. Because IRR 
functions as a financial indicator, its value varies with the change of financial arrangement (e.g. change 
of equity-loan ratio) of a capital investment. NPV, however, does not vary when financial arrangement 
varies, because it functions as an economic indicator. This is analogous to the fact that the Financial-
IRR changes but the Economic-IRR remains constant for investing in a capital project whose financial 
arrangement changes (Tang 2003 Chapter 8).
An Illustrative Example
If an investor has an all-equity case investment in which an initial capital outlay of $10,000 leads to a 
receipt of $5,000 each year for three years as shown in Table 1, the investor obtains an IRR of 23.4% p.a.

Economic indicator NPV and financial indicator IRR
If the investor uses $4,000 as equity and borrows $6,000 as loan (paying 10% interest per annum), 
making a total of $10,000 serving as the initial capital outlay of the same investment as above, then the 
net annual receipts in the next three years, having deducted the three annual principal amortizations 
and the annual interest payments from the gross annual receipts, are calculated to be $2,400, $2,600 and 
$2,800 as shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Net Annual Receipts for Uniform Principal Amortization of $2,000 for Loan $6,000
In other words, the investor will obtain $2,400, $2,600 and $2,800 in Years 1, 2 and 3 respectively if he 
initially invests $4,000 (the equity). The cash flows of the investment become those as shown in Table 3. It 
should be noted Table 1 and Table 3 represent the same investment, although they have different financial 
arrangements. Any one of the two should have no advantage over the other as far as the economic value 
of the investment is concerned.

from those shown in Table 1. This indicates that the financial arrangement of $4,000 equity and $6,000 
loan is financially better than the all-equity case, although the economic value of the investment is 
unchanged (see below). If the NPV method is used to compare these two sets of cash flows, namely, Tables 
1 and 3, or (-10,000, 5,000, 5,000, 5,000) and (-4,000, 2,400, 2,600, 2,800) respectively, using i = 10% p.a. 
(the borrowing interest rate), the NPVs will be the same as shown in the following calculations:

Now, a further case is to be investigated. If the investor uses only $1,000 as equity and borrows $9,000 
as loan at 10% p.a. interest rate, the cash flow will become (-1,000, 1,100, 1,400, 1,700), and the IRR 
calculated will be 113.1% p.a. This is much higher than 23.4% p.a. (calculated from Table 1) and also 
41.2% p.a. (calculated from Table 3). The NPV, however, is the same, that is, $2,434.26.
It can be seen that the IRR becomes higher if a bigger loan is borrowed, although the economic value 
(indicated by the NPV) of the investment remains the same in all situations. This is because the borrowing 
interest rate 10% p.a. is smaller than the all-equity case IRR 23.4% p.a. If the borrowing interest rate is 
not 10% p.a. but higher than the all-equity IRR, then an exactly opposite effect will occur, that is, the 
higher the loan is, the lower the IRR will be.
The Mathematical Proof
The example illustrated above that NPV is a constant value in all situations can be proved mathematically. 
Mathematical Induction is used in the proof.

    which is the original definition of NPV.
It can be seen that NPV is independent of B (i.e., the amount of loan) and is only dependent on the all-
equity initial capital outlay C and the all-equity cash-in Ii Hence, the NPV is a constant value.
Conclusion
It has been shown that the NPV of a capital investment is constant in all situations and is not affected 
by the variation of financial arrangements. NPV is an economic indicator for a capital investment, as 
the economic value of an investment does not change when its financial arrangement changes. The IRR, 
however, is suitable for use as a financial indicator, since private investors usually like to play around 
with financial arrangements to optimise their rates of return.

Further information
The above describes the discovery of a fundamental difference of the functions between NPV and IRR. 
The first author proposed such a difference the first time in 1991 in his book published by McGraw-
Hill (Tang 1991). He and H. John Tang then provided a mathematical proof for it in 2003, which was 
published by The Engineering Economist (Tang and Tang 2003). This discovery is believed to be a great 
contribution to the field of Economics, Finance & Management.
Acknowledgement
The author thanks his son H. John Tang for helping him solve a fast knot in the mathematical proof. 
John is a very intelligent young man and the author is proud to be his father.

At break-even point, 880,319,000 = 50,615,897y
Hence, y =
880,319,000
= $17.39
50,615,897
The minimum toll paid by each vehicle initially is $17.39 in order not to lose money. A toll of, say, $20.00 
is reasonable if one wishes to make a profit.
Note: The effect of inflation (3% p.a. on average) has not been taken account of in the above calculation. 
It is in fact not necessary to do so because constant base year prices are used (based on money value 
of year 2014). It is easy to see that they are constant base year prices. If we look at an example, say, the 
annual operation and maintenance cost, it is $15,000,000 every year. How can it be $15,000,000 without 
change for 25 years? So it must be a constant base year price – based on the money value of year 2014 
alone. In practice, the cost of $15,000,000 will increase at a rate of 3% p.a. (on compound basis) in the 
next 25 years. Inflation indeed may influence both revenues and costs to differing degrees, but such 
impacts are only of short duration. Usually, its effect on both revenues and costs will cancel out each 
other in the long run to regain a balance.
Therefore, if f = 3% p.a., simply increase the toll also 3% p.a. on average in principle (on compound basis 
with skillful price-increase technique of course) to adjust the effect of inflation.
Mathematically:
Toll after n years = 	
$17.39 × (1 + 3%)n
or	
	
=	
$20.00 × (1 + 3%)n if profit is desired
	
	
	
where n = 1, 2, ….. 25.

concrete yard. These are his current data:
Precast concrete
p
v
% of total sales
Roof panel
$600
$400
30%
Window panel
$1,000
$600
20%
Seawall panel
$2,000
$1,200
50%
Total fixed cost per year is $7,500,000 and total sales this year is $25,000,000.
The change being considered is to drop the window panel production and replace it with wall panel 
production with following percentages of total sales:
Precast concrete
p
v
% of total sales
Roof panel
$600
$400
50%
Wall panel
$1,600
$700
10%
Seawall panel
$2,000
$1,200
40%
Total fixed cost per year is $7,500,000 and the estimated total sales next year is $26,000,000. Is this 
change viable?
Solution:
Profit on the present product line is calculated as follows:
$60 – $40
× 30% 
 = 0.10
$60
100 – 60
× 20% 
 = 0.08
100
200 -120
× 50% 
 = 0.20
200
 
∑ = 0.38
(contribution in %)
Contribution in $ = $2,500,000 × 0.38 = $950,000
Profit = $950,000 – $750,000 = $200,000

Profit on the proposed product line:
$60 – $40
× 50% 
 = 0.17
$60
160 – 70
× 10% 
 = 0.06
160
200 -120
× 40% 
 = 0.16
200
 
∑ = 0.39
(contribution in %)
Contribution in $ = $2,600,000 × 0.39 = $1,014,000
Profit = $1,014,000 – $750,000 = $264,000 > $200,000
The proposed change appears to be attractive.

Exercise Question 1
A construction company is considering setting up a new precast concrete yard. To do so, a new equipment, 
which has a life of four years and costs $1,000,000 has to be purchased. The revenue generated is estimated 
to be $500,000 per year. The total expenses associated with this precast concrete yard are estimated to 
be $120,000 per year. The profit tax rate is 25%.
a)	 Assuming straight line depreciation and ignoring salvage values, carry out a financial analysis 
for the company. (You are expected to create an income statement and derive a cash flow table 
for IRR calculation, and then to compute the IRR).
b)	 Carry out a new financial analysis and find the new IRR if the total capital of $1,000,000 is 
made up of $250,000 equity and $750,000 loan. The loan has to be paid back in three years 
(i.e. principal amortization of $250,000 per year) at an interest rate of 8% p.a.
c)	 Compare the internal rates of return in (a) and (b) above and give comments on them. If the 
NPV method at a discount rate of 8% p.a. (the borrowing interest rate) is used in (a) and (b), 
what results will be expected? And why?

Apparently, The two NPVs differ to a certain extent. It is true that the two NPV values appear not to 
be close enough to each other, but in theory they should have values very similar to each other (see 
Exercise Question 2 of Chapter 4). However, the tax deduction has contributed to the disturbance of 
mathematics and has resulted in a difference between the two NPVs. The bigger the loan is, the bigger 
the interest payments are, and that will result in a bigger disturbance of the mathematics and hence less 
stable NPVs. Readers may verify it by using other loan values such as $450,000 and $600,000.

The positive finance area, from Month 0 to Month 10, is equal to 6,537,000 $-month. The negative 
finance area, from Month 10 to Month 12, is equal to 400,000 $-month. The total (or net) finance area 
is therefore 6,137,000 $-month.
Since the interest rate is 12% per annum, or 1% per month, the interest charge therefore is $61,370. This 
amount is the cost to the contractor of borrowing the working capital necessary to finance the project. 
By the way, we can see from the graph that the maximum working capital required by the project occurs 
at the end of Month 6 and the amount is $1,400,000 (i.e. $1,800,000 – $400,000).
Exercise Question 2
The expenditure per month for a small-medium scale building project scheduled for 5 months are given 
below. The mark-up is 5%. The retention money of the billed cost is 10% if the cumulative payment is less 
than half of the total value of work (contract value) and then 0% thereafter. The retention money will be 
released at the end of month 6, one month after the completion of the contract. Payment is billed at the 
end of each month and received one month later by the contractor. The finance charge is 1% per month.

The contract period is 6 months, from commencement up to the release of retention money. There 
is only positive finance area in that period, and it is found to be approximately 16.0 million$-month. 
Since the finance charge is 1% per month, the total financial charge on the working capital is therefore 
approximately $0.16 million (i.e. 16.0 × 1%), or $160,000.

Interim measurements are made monthly and payments of the amount certified less 10% retention are 
paid the contractor one month later. 50% of the retention money is released one month after substantial 
completion (i.e. end of month 11, since completion is at end of month 10), and the other 50% retention 
is released 6 months later (the defect liability period is 6 months). 
However, the client desires to decrease his administration duties and proposes to the contractor that 
interim payments be made bi-monthly. The contractor wishes to know the financial implications of 
this proposal. In other words, he wants to know how much more he has to pay for the cost of the 
working capital.
Assuming the contractor can delay paying his expenditures by an average of one month due to the 
availability of trade credits, calculate the extra financial charge for borrowing the working capital if 
interest rate is at 9% p.a. and interim payments are made bi-monthly.

Finance areas 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent extra financing required if interim payments are paid to the 
contractor bi-monthly by the client.
Total area of finance areas 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
= 1.7 × 1 + ( 8.1 – 4.5 ) × 1 + ( 20.7 – 14.4 ) × 1 + ( 32.4 – 27.0 ) × 1 + ( 40.5 – 36.9 ) × 1
= 20.6 million$-month
The interest charge on the extra finance needed to fund bi-monthly interim payments
= 20.6 × 0.09/12
= 0.1545 million dollars
= $154,500
