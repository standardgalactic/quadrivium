Dedication
Larry dedicates this book in memory of his mother, Hazel M. Helyer (1916–2000).
Her love for the Bible, large portions of which she knew from memory, left a
legacy far beyond what she could have imagined.
Rich also dedicates the book to his mother, Carolyn, for her lifelong testimony
of Jesus Christ as well as her tireless, selfless example of living as a disciple.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the helpful people at Wiley Publishing who shepherded
us through this entire process. Their expertise and encouragement made this
book possible. Special thanks go to our indefatigable project editor, Stephen
Clark, and our most congenial and efficient acquisitions editor, Lindsay
Lefevere. Stephen’s many, helpful suggestions and comments — and timely
encouragement — greatly improved this book. Danielle Voirol, our sharp-eyed
and savvy copy editor, and our two technical editors, Dr. Robert Berg and
Rev. Ken Cavanagh, saved us from more mistakes than we’d like to admit. In
short, we’re better writers because of this collaboration.
We’re grateful to our literary agent, Matt Wagner, for his efficient handling of
contract, schedule, and financial matters. 
Finally, we acknowledge our indebtedness to former teachers, biblical schol-
ars, colleagues, friends, and fellow travelers on the way to the New
Jerusalem. Their contributions are too numerous to list. May they all join in
for the final chorus: “Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the
throne, and to the Lamb!” (Revelation 7:10).

Introduction
A
common cartoon theme involves a person wearing a sandwich sign or
carrying a poster that proclaims, “Repent! The end is near!” What’s
implied is that some sudden, violent event is just around the corner and that
people need to brace themselves for whatever’s coming. And usually, the end
that’s near involves something nasty, if not totally devastating.
The idea of a dramatic and destructive end to the earth has been around for
ages. It’s the stuff of some really great sci-fi movies, and a lot of the elements
that go into these stories come right out of the Bible. In fact, terms such as
repent and Antichrist and Armageddon are direct references to messages, char-
acters, and events that make up the book of Revelation. When you examine
these themes and images in the context of religion, faith, and biblical history,
things get even more interesting.
But the book of Revelation is no easy read. Some people, after slogging
through Revelation, seem to suffer from what we call PTRRD: Post-Traumatic
Revelation Reading Disorder. Maybe you’ve had this experience. You start
reading with a rush of enthusiasm, and all goes well through the first three
chapters and their letters to the seven churches. Then things start to get
hairy: visions from heaven, creatures with eyes covering their bodies,
plagues, horses of different colors, angels everywhere. Seven seals are
opened, seven trumpets are sounded, seven bowls are poured out, and things
get really confusing. Throw in grapes of wrath, red dragons, giant hail, and
something called the rapture, and, well, you get the idea. Lost becomes more
than just the name of a television series — it’s the perfect descriptor of your
mental state.
Our intent is to help you avoid PTRRD. We act as your tour guides to help
you navigate the amazing book of Revelation. Even if you can’t figure out
every single detail, clues that open up large chunks of the text abound. We
promise you’ll come away with a better understanding of what Revelation is
about, as well as a ton of cool information that you can sprinkle into conver-
sations and impress your friends!

About This Book
The first thing you may discover is that there’s no one dominant or right way
to interpret the book of Revelation. About the only thing all serious students
of Revelation can agree on is that in the end, good wins over evil. Theological
views about what happens, when it happens, and to whom it happens vary
widely. In The Book of Revelation For Dummies, we introduce the leading
views and point you to some of the most likely meanings.
Revelation is arguably the most perplexing book in all the Bible, so our 
goal is to be clear and concise. Therefore, we aim for an easy-to-understand,
approachable discussion, without trying to bombard you with a lot of 
theological gobbledygook.
The topics in the book are logically ordered, so you can read from start to
finish if you want to. But this is a reference book, so don’t feel you have to
read it from cover to cover. You may prefer to browse the Table of Contents,
flip through the pages, or thumb through the index to locate a topic that you
find particularly engaging.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make sure you get the most out of this book, keep the following conven-
tions and definitions in mind.
Apocalypse
The word apocalypse has become associated with a devastating event,
including the end of the world. But the term actually means “to unveil” or 
“to reveal.” And so, Revelation is a revealing (apocalypse) of the biblical view
of how all things come to an end. People often refer to any literature that
addresses the end of the world as apocalyptic.
Bible references
The Bible verses we quote are from the New Revised Standard Version trans-
lation, unless otherwise noted. We cite passages using the standard conven-
tion, Book chapter:verse. For example, John 3:16 refers to John as the book of
2
The Book of Revelation For Dummies 

the Bible, 3 as the chapter of the book, and 16 as the verse of the chapter. If
you don’t see a colon in a Bible reference, the number refers to an entire
chapter; in other words, Rev. 4–5 means chapters 4 through 5 of the book of
Revelation.
When we refer to the Old Testament, we’re talking about those sacred scrip-
tures that Christianity shares with Judaism. Jews refer to these scriptures 
as the Tanak, or Hebrew Bible. For Protestants and Jews, these scriptures
consist of the same 39 books; Catholics include several additional books, 
collectively called the Apocrypha.
We occasionally refer to Jewish works that aren’t part of the Bible, such as 
1 Enoch. If you’re really interested in reading the book of 1 Enoch, check out
the English translation with introduction and notes by E. Isaac in James H.
Charlesworth, ed., Volume 1. The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: Apocalyptic
Literature & Testaments (Doubleday).
Christianity
For the purposes of this book, historical Christianity, biblical Christianity, and
orthodox Christianity are interchangeable terms. Each speaks of beliefs that
the church has historically upheld for some 2,000 years. Simply, Christianity
is monotheistic (believing in one God), is based on the teachings of Jesus,
and embraces the entire Bible as truth.
Dates
When we refer to dates, we use the newer designations BCE (before common
era) and CE (common era) rather than the more traditional BC (before
Christ) and AD (Anno Domini, in the year of the Lord). If you’re unfamiliar
with the newer terms, no sweat. The year 34 BCE is the same as 34 BC, and
1050 CE is equivalent to AD 1050.
Names of God
Although God has many names, we generally use God and Lord in this book.
Also, in accordance with historical usage, we use the traditional masculine
pronoun he to refer to God.

Introduction

Prophecy and prophesying
People often think of prophecy as being limited to future events. But from 
a biblical perspective, prophecy is a noun that refers to something more 
general: the act of speaking the mind and counsel of God. Biblical prophets
were, in a sense, the mouthpiece of God, delivering important information 
to God’s people. Biblical prophecy, among other things, addressed current
events, offered guidance on behavior, revealed elements of the character of
God, reassured God’s people, and often predicted future events. Sometimes,
prophecy about the future was conditional: If bad behavior continued, bad
things would happen; if behavior was brought back in line with God’s will,
bad things would be averted. The point is that biblically speaking, all 
prophesy isn’t just about foretelling the future.
Note that prophesy is the verb usage of the word: Prophets prophesy
prophecy!
Formatting
In order to draw your attention to particular words and phrases, we use 
the following formatting conventions:
 Italics highlight terms that we define.
 Boldface indicates keywords in explanatory bulleted lists.
 When we provide a cross-reference to another chapter within this 
book, we capitalize the word Chapter before the chapter number; 
however, when we’re referring to a book of the Bible, the word chapter
is lowercased.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we focus on what you need to know about the book of Revelation,
we also include some additional topics that, although informative, you can
skip during your first read-through of the book. These include sidebars, the
shaded boxes that show up every so often throughout the book. Sidebars
deal with subjects related to the chapter, but they aren’t necessary reading.
You can also bypass text with a Technical Stuff icon beside it — this icon indi-
cates technical, theological, or historical bits of info that’s helpful but more
advanced. If your eyes start to glaze over in reading them, you can pass over
them without missing the basics.

Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we didn’t assume any particular religious faith leanings
for the reader. You may be a Christian, Muslim, Jew, or atheist. But regardless
of your faith background, we believe you’re generally curious about biblical
prophecy and the book of Revelation.
Although we don’t assume you have previous knowledge of the Christian
Bible, we figure you have access to one — either in print or online — so you
can check out our references to specific Bible passages.
How This Book Is Organized
The Book of Revelation For Dummies is divided into four parts. Here’s a
glimpse of each one.
Part I: Revealing the End 
of the Biblical Story
Part I begins with an overview of Revelation and its major themes, side
detours, and often-confusing symbolism. You then explore who the book’s
author is and when he likely wrote it. Rounding out the discussion, Part I
helps you better understand the prophecy of Revelation by diving into the
Old Testament prophetic writings and exploring the characteristics of apoca-
lyptic literature, a genre of Jewish and Christian literature that claims to fore-
tell catastrophic events that’ll transpire during the last days of the world.
Part II: Interpreting the 
Book of Revelation
In Part II, we introduce you to the sticky topic of interpreting Revelation.
Within the Christian church, four views on how to understand Revelation
have been long dominant. We explain each of these perspectives and com-
pare and contrast them, noting their strengths and weaknesses. After that, we
begin to show you how to make sense of all the symbolism that runs through-
out the book’s 22 chapters.

Introduction

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour 
of the Book of Revelation
Part III is, in many ways, the heart of this book. In it, we take you on a guided
expedition through each and every chapter of Revelation. We identify the key
themes and explain the likely meaning of the underlying symbolism along 
the way.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In the final part, we explain ten confusing terms that often stymie people
when they read Revelation. We then give you ten practical tips to think 
about when you’re reading and studying Revelation and the Bible as a whole.
A glossary of terms follows the Tens chapters for easy reference.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book help you quickly identify specific kinds of information
that may be of use to you:
The Remember icon highlights important ideas for you to keep in mind to
deepen your understanding of Revelation.
This icon draws attention to important points that help you make sense of
Revelation’s prophecy.
Steer clear of the pitfalls we flag in the Warning paragraphs.
The Technical Stuff icon indicates more-advanced or scholarly information
about the topic being discussed. It’s useful but not essential for an overall
understanding of the discussion.

Part I
Revealing the End
of the Biblical Story

In this part . . .
T
he book of Revelation may be about the “end of all
things,” but we have to start somewhere. This part
gets your apocalyptic feel wet, so to speak, by introducing
you to the book’s author, the original recipients of the
book, and the world in which it was written. 
After you’ve immersed your feet in the waters around
Patmos (where the author wrote the book), you’re ready
to dive into biblical prophecy, which is essential to a solid
understanding of the symbolism in Revelation. We introduce
you to biblical prophecy, taking it step-by-step so you don’t
get the bends. After that, we provide a first look at
Revelation, giving an overview of the book’s structure and
timeline. So come on in, the water’s fine . . . though we do
seem to recall a certain beast that may be lurking in the
sea! (But you have to wait for Revelation 13 for that.)

M
any people love fantasy stories populated with strange apparitions.
Others love a good mystery. And still others love an adventure story
full of action and battle scenes. If you fall into one of those camps, you’re in
luck. The book of Revelation is all these and more.
But Revelation is a challenging book. Those fantastic beasts and creatures
are symbols for individuals, nations, governments, and the like. The storyline
of the book twists and turns in on itself, not following a straight, chronological
narrative. And the whole package is a prophetic vision that’s related to what’s
actually supposed to happen when the world comes to an end, at least from a
biblical perspective.
This chapter doesn’t try to explore the symbolism behind the events that are
chronicled throughout Revelation (we save that for Chapter 5). It also doesn’t
pore over the details of these events, personalities, and issues (that’s what’s
Part III is all about). In this chapter, we get you started in the right direction.
We begin by painting broad strokes of the structure and content of the final
book of the Bible. As we do so, we point you to parts of this book where you
can find more details on each specific subject.

Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 
Why Read Revelation, Anyway?
Humans have always had an insatiable curiosity to know their future and
what’s going to happen in the “last days.” That’s at least part of the reason
the Left Behind series was popular and why new Nostradamus documentaries
show up almost every year. For many, the appeal in reading and understand-
ing Revelation is, quite frankly, not altogether different from the desire to
peek into a fortuneteller’s crystal ball. Understanding how it all ends can give
you a sense of what your purpose is now.
Revelation can be tough going because of its structure and symbolism and
the many ways in which scholars interpret the book. You can easily become
discouraged and wonder why you should read Revelation, anyway. Here are
several reasons many people consider Revelation to be essential reading:
 It helps explain the biblical view of God and his relationship with
humans. Many people turn to Revelation in search of definitive answers
about what will happen. But Revelation is far more about grasping the
nature of God and the close relationship that exists between God and
people who believe in him.
 It gives readers a glimpse of heaven. The Bible offers few specifics on
what heaven will be like. The Old Testament says very little. Jesus and
Paul offer more in the New Testament. As if saving the best for last, the
final chapters of Revelation offer a rare glimpse into the new heaven and
new earth (see Chapter 14).
 It offers a message of hope. It’s easy to be a little freaked out by the gloom
and doom warnings of the book. But in spite of all of the battles and judg-
ments depicted, Revelation is really all about hope. It portrays, in vivid
detail, the biblical view of good triumphing over evil and suffering.
Taking a Whirlwind Tour 
through Revelation
A major challenge in reading Revelation is sorting out and identifying the
overall themes and messages while images — seals, trumpets, bowls, beasts,
witnesses, and so on — are ever coming at you. But if you take a step back
and get a solid understanding of the big picture, you can begin to dive into
the details and make sense of how they all fit together.

Although Revelation contains a lot of confusing symbolism and has many
interpretations (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of these interpretations), the
book actually divides up rather nicely. At the most basic level, you can split
Revelation into five major parts, as illustrated in Figure 1-1. We discuss each
of these parts in this section, so read on.
Introduction (Rev. 1)
The first chapter of Revelation serves as a prologue or introduction to the
entire book. Its purpose is to provide a context to help you make sense of the
rest of the chapters (also see Chapter 6). Within the first several verses, you
discover that
 This is an unveiling of the plans of Jesus (from God) (1:1).
 The author is John (1:4).
 The audience is the seven churches of Asia (1:4).
 It was written on the island of Patmos, a Mediterranean island belonging
to modern-day Greece (1:9).
 Its purpose is to give readers a sneak peek of what’ll take place (1:1).
As Revelation 1:1 underscores, this book is Jesus’s revealing of God’s plans
for the world. In this opening section, John provides explicit details about
how his words came to appear in print: God gave the revelation to Jesus, who
communicated the message to John through an angel, who was sent for this
specific purpose. John wrote these series of visions as an extended letter,
which he then sent to the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 2–3).

Chapter 1: One Man's Visions, All Humans' Fate

Today’s readers are a secondary audience for this book because the original
readers passed John’s letter both to other churches and to their descen-
dents. Figure 1-2 shows the chain of communication.
One of the keys to understanding Revelation is in 1:19. In this passage, Jesus
instructs John, “Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now, and what
will take place later.” Scholars offer various assessments on how to interpret
this verse. However, the interpretation that seems to best fit the original
grammar of the passage as well as the structure of the book itself is a three-
fold timing of events: past tense, present tense, and future tense. In other
words, Jesus tells John to write about
 The vision he has already seen (Rev. 1)
 The current state of the seven churches (Rev. 2–3)
 The events that will take place in the future (Rev. 1–22)
Figure 1-3 shows how Revelation 1:19 provides a broad chronology for looking
at the entire book.

Letters to the seven churches of Asia
(Rev. 2–3)
Revelation 2–3 details the individual letters that Jesus dictates for the seven
churches in Asia (see Chapter 8). Each of these churches is in a different spir-
itual state. For the faithful churches in Smyrna and Philadelphia, Jesus offers
only encouragement for their steadfast faith. For the churches in Sardis,
Ephesus, Pergamum, and Thyatira, he commends them for some aspects of
their faith but also rebukes them for specific areas of failure. Finally, for the
church in Laodicea, he offers no encouragement at all and simply calls for
their repentance from a lukewarm, middle-of-the-road faith.
Judgments and vignettes (Rev. 4–20)
The primary plot of Revelation 4–20 is a series of progressively severe judgments
that are unveiled through seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. These
judgments climax with the return of Jesus, the ensuing battle of Armageddon,
the Millennium, and the Last Judgment (see Chapters 9–14).
As you read Revelation 4–20, don’t expect a single, linear storyline. The nar-
rative includes a series of vignettes that make up a secondary plotline. These
scenes help fill in the details of the main story, but they’re not necessarily tied
to the judgments that surround them. As such, commentators sometimes refer
to these vignettes as parentheses, interludes, or insets.
Read on for an overview of the main plot and these interludes.
The primary storyline: Judgments and the last battle
The judgments in Revelation consist of three sets of seven judgments each,
symbolized by the opening of seven seals, the sounding of seven trumpets,
and the pouring of seven bowls. The three sets are tiered: The seals provide a
partial judgment, the trumpets grow more severe, and the bowls show no
restraint at all:
 Seals: Judgments begin in Revelation 6 when the Lamb (Jesus) opens
seven seals on a heavenly scroll. As each seal is opened, a judgment
occurs (see Chapter 9).
 Trumpets: As soon as Lamb opens the seventh seal, seven angels begin
to play seven trumpets in succession. As each is played, a more severe
judgment occurs (Chapter 10).
 Bowls: More judgments take place when seven angels pour out seven
bowls of wrath on the earth (Chapter 12).
15
Chapter 1: One Man's Visions, All Humans' Fate

As Figure 1-4 shows, the seals, trumpets, and bowls seem to be interrelated.
Some scholars hold that the seventh seal triggers the sounding of the trum-
pets (8:1), and then the seventh trumpet seems to kick off the pouring of the
bowls (16:1). As Chapter 9 explores, others suggest that the judgments
happen at the same time. Note: Figure 1-4 is not a timeline; it merely maps
where Revelation mentions specific events. The events, in some instances,
may occur simultaneously or in very rapid succession.
The pouring of the final bowl sets the stage for the Second Coming of Jesus (the
first coming was his earthly life) and the battle of Armageddon, in which Jesus
leads his angelic army to victory over Satan’s forces (see Chapter 12). Satan is
bound for 1,000 years, commonly known as the Millennium (see Chapter 13).
During this time, Jesus and his faithful reign on earth. At the end of this period,
Satan is let loose one final time to deceive the world. However, Jesus defeats
Satan again and permanently throws him into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10).
Finally, Jesus judges each person. Believers in Jesus — those whose names
are found in the book of life — are welcomed into heaven (see Chapter 13).
Those whose names don’t make the guest list get thrown into the lake of fire
(Rev. 20:15).
The secondary storylines: Vignettes
Interrupting the primary narrative of Revelation is a series of vignettes that
help form a secondary storyline. Some of these interludes may be related to
the events that immediately surround them, though others seem not to have
any chronological relationship at all to the main story. These vignettes
include the following:
 Seals are placed on the foreheads of 144,000 believers from the 12 tribes
of Israel (Rev. 7:1–8).
 A “great multitude” is delivered from the Great Tribulation (Rev. 7:9–17).

 John encounters an angel and eats a little scroll (Rev. 10).
 Two witnesses prophesy for 3.5 years and are then martyred (Rev. 11:3–12).
 A woman and a dragon (Satan) appear, and a war in heaven occurs (Rev. 12).
 A beast out of the sea and a beast out of the earth arrive (Rev. 13).
 Jesus appears with 144,000 believers on Mount Zion (Rev. 14:1–5).
 Three angels proclaim messages of repentance and warning (Rev. 14:6–13).
 The harvest of the earth separates the believers from nonbelievers 
(Rev. 14:11–20).
 The saga of the great prostitute on the beast (Babylon) and her eventual
fall unfolds (Rev. 17:1–19:3).
Figure 1-5 shows how these vignettes fit into the flow of the judgments.
New beginnings (Rev. 21–22:6)
The last you hear of Satan and nonbelievers is at the end of Revelation 20,
when they’re thrown into the lake of fire. Revelation 21, however, tells the flip
side: the future that reportedly awaits those who believe in Jesus. It tells of
the “new heaven and new earth” that God will create as the permanent home
for his children. But this new world is more than an improved version of their
current surroundings. It’s a perfect world in which God will live alongside
humans (Rev. 21:3–5). See Chapter 14 for details.
Epilogue (Rev. 22:7–21)
John closes out Revelation with an epilogue that marks the end of the prophecy
(see Chapter 15). The major refrain in this final section of the book is Jesus’s
reiterating three times, “Behold, I am coming soon!” (Rev. 22:7, 22:12, 22:20).
Each of these alerts precedes a call:
 Obedience: A call to “keep the words contained in this book” (22:7)
 Action: A call to act because he will “give to everyone according to what
he has done” (22:12)
 Faith: A call to believe Jesus when he says he is coming and to be able
to testify to that claim to the rest of the world (22:20)

Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Monitoring the Book’s Timeline
One of the biggest problems most people have with the book of Revelation is
that they expect a traditional, linear model of storytelling. A linear story begins
at a particular point in time and then uses progressive scenes to move the
characters to some sort of destination. Other stories start out with the char-
acters looking back at something, tell what happened in the form of a flash-
back, and return to the present. For the vast majority of films out of Hollywood,
these two tried-and-true formulas are almost always used, primarily because
they’re a natural way to tell a story and are easy for audiences to understand.
19
Chapter 1: One Man's Visions, All Humans' Fate
Getting in the Spirit
As you read through Revelation, the curious
phrase “in the Spirit” may jump out at you. John
uses in the Spirit to mark the specific visions he
has when writing Revelation. The Apostle Paul
actually uses that same phrase in his epistles
(Romans 8:9), but the way in which John uses
the term is altogether different. John is referring
to the mysterious state that he’s in as he expe-
riences these visions. In John’s view, God
somehow frees him from his normal human lim-
itations and enables him to tangibly experience
these visions in his mind and spirit.
In the Spirit appears four times in Revelation:
1:10, 4:2, 17:3, and 21:10. Every time John uses
this phrase, he is documenting the details of one
of these four visions (see the table). Each of
these visions “transports” John to a new geo-
graphical location — the island of Patmos,
heaven, a desert, and a mountaintop. John
never clarifies whether these locations are part
of the vision he has on the island of Patmos or
whether he is somehow supernaturally beamed
to these locales.
You can think of John’s in-the-Spirit experiences
as something like a four-part miniseries. Each
experience is a separate installment, but
together, they form a cohesive storyline.

However, once in while, a story comes along that — like the book of
Revelation — doesn’t fit into this storytelling model. Snow Falling on Cedars
and The English Patient are two prime examples. Both have multiple story-
lines with flashback sequences involving different characters. If you don’t
want a mental workout, stories like these can be quite frustrating. But if you
persevere and stick with them, you can find the increased texture worth-
while, adding to the overall experience.
As you read through Revelation, prepare yourself: The book of Revelation
may start out linear for several chapters, but various vignettes or interludes
interrupt the main story. When you equip yourself for that reality, you’ll be in
a much better position to deal with the timing of events.
As you consider the how the various pieces of the book fit together, keep in
mind the following two topics: transition phrases and parallel events.
And then some: Interpreting 
transition phrases
Revelation is littered with scores of transition phrases that imply timing. The
primary examples include “then I saw,” “and I saw,” “after this,” and “after
these things.” Strictly speaking, these transitions may not always translate to
the order of prophetic events. For example, you can find 53 instances of the
word then in the book. Although some of them imply a connection between
one event and the next, others reflect the author’s technique of relaying his
story, interweaving the content of his visions with his own experiences. In
other words, the narrative has two layers:
 John’s experience of having a vision while on Patmos
 The content of the visions — horsemen ride, beasts arise, angels fight,
and so on
With this kind of setup, a transition may apply to the outer layer (the order of
John’s visions) or to the order of prophetic events themselves. For example,
suppose I were to tell you, “I saw the season finale of 24. Then I saw reruns of
the rest of the episodes over the summer.” In this example, the then relates
wholly to the timing in which I saw the episodes. It says nothing about the
logical order of episodes for the series.
Although some transitions may be open to interpretation, you shouldn’t just
dismiss all transitions, either. In particular, the phrases “after this” and “after
these things” are noteworthy. Combined, these two phrases appear just six
times and don’t always seem to relate to the order in which John received the
visions. For example, its usage in Revelation 4:1, 15:5, 18:1, and 19:1 seems to
20
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

easily imply a logical sequence of events. However, its usage in 7:1 (which
introduces the 144,000 believers of Israel) seems more of a writing device posed
to answer the question raised at the end of chapter 6: Who can withstand the
wrath of God? (6:17). John uses the term again in 7:9; in this context, the
phrase seems to imply the order in which he received the visions rather than
a sequential flow of events.
The four major interpretations of Revelation and the different perspectives
on the Millennium all weigh in on the timing of events in the book. See
Chapters 4 and 13 for details.
Parallelism: Watching things 
go down at the same time
Revelation has a flow of events, but how each section fits into the timeline
isn’t always apparent. Although commentators disagree on the particulars,
most agree that at least a few of the portions of the book parallel each other.
Perhaps the most obvious example is Revelation 12’s story of the woman in
the desert, which is told in two ways in different places in the chapter (12:6
and 12:13–17). A second example, though more contested, is the 3.5-year
period mentioned several times throughout the book (11:3, 12:6, 12:14, and
13:5). Some hold that these references indicate that the associated sections
parallel each other.
Many futurists (who believe Revelation describes real events that are going
to occur — see Chapter 4) downplay parallelism. They think that, by and
large, the book progresses in a linear fashion from beginning to end, except
for the vignettes (see the earlier “Judgments and vignettes” section). Other
futurists view Revelation 1–11 and 12–19 as parallel accounts of the Great
Tribulation. Offering a different take, people who embrace a symbolic inter-
pretation of the prophecy (once again, see Chapter 4) see up to seven parallel
sections in the book.
The issue of parallelism is also key factor in the interpretation of the
Millennium, which appears in Revelation 20:
 Premillennialists hold that all the events from Revelation 1–19 will
happen before the Millennium.
 Amillennialists see the discussion of the Millennium as a parallel section
that describes the entire church age; this church age goes from 
before Revelation 1:1 even starts up until the Second Coming of Jesus 
in Revelation 19.
Chapter 13 dives into the interpretations of the Millennium.

B
ooks — perhaps with the exceptions of dictionaries and instructional
manuals for gas grills — often reflect the personality of the author.
What’s inside a book has a lot to do with who the author is, the times in
which he lives, the place where he lives, and the experiences that have
shaped his life. So usually, the more you know of the author’s story, the
greater the understanding and appreciation you have for the book itself.
The books of the Bible are no exception. Although Christians believe the
Bible to be the word of God, most still recognize that each book of the Bible
retains the personality, writing style, and experiences of the individual
author. Take the Gospel of Luke as an example. You don’t have to know any-
thing about the author to get something out of reading Luke’s account of
Jesus. However, when you discover Luke was a gentile (non-Jew) and was
educated as a physician, you get a new appreciation for his Greek-oriented
perspective and his keen attention to detail.
In this chapter, you get to know John, the John most scholars believe is the
author of Revelation, as well as explore the world in which he lived. You gain
insight into the man himself, as well as understand his reasons for writing the
book. You also discover his unique textured style of writing for this final book
of the New Testament.

ID-ing John Doe, Author of Revelation
When you walk into your local bookstore and scan the bestsellers display,
you see the author’s name spread out in large letters on each book. The more
successful the author is, the larger the font. In fact, for super-selling authors
like John Grisham and Tom Clancy, their names appear so large that you
often have to search for the title. But regardless of whether you’re dealing
with a bestselling author or a first-time writer, you can usually pick up a book
and find a biography telling you at least a snippet of the author’s credentials.
Even if the author is using a pseudonym (writing under an assumed name),
someone somewhere knows the author’s true identity — after all, the pub-
lisher needs to know where to send the royalty checks!
Unfortunately, the books of the Bible were written before there were even
printing presses, let alone large publishing companies. Frankly, we wish the
biblical authors would’ve been as outspoken about biographical details as
they were in spreading their messages. It’d make our lives far easier by elimi-
nating any debate about who exactly wrote a particular book.
In many instances, at the time of the writing, everyone knew who the author
of a book was, whether the author’s name was attached to it or not. In fact, a
lot of the books in the New Testament part of the Bible were written as let-
ters; when you write a letter to a friend, do you add a detailed biographical
note at the end? Of course not! The recipient knows who the letter is from
even if you merely sign off with your initials.
The authors of the books of the Bible had more important things on their minds
than identifying themselves — namely, accurately communicating what was
believed to be the word of God. Downplaying their role out of genuine humility,
the biblical authors sometimes included their names and sometimes did not.
The author of Revelation identifies himself four times (Rev. 1:1, 1:4, 1:9, and 22:8)
by simply referring to himself as John. No last name. No title. No biographical
data. Because John was a popular name of the day, he could be any old John.
The general consensus of the church since the second century has been that
the author is the Apostle John. Yes, this is the John. He and his brother James
were two of the original 12 disciples of Jesus, and John was viewed as Jesus’s
“best friend.” He’s the author of the Gospel of John and the three letters bear-
ing his name (referred to as the Johannine epistles). In fact, the list of church
fathers who credit the Apostle John as the author of Revelation reads as a vir-
tual who’s who of the early church, including Justin Martyr, Irenaeus,
Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Origen.
As you consider the question of authorship today, be careful not to commit
what a logician would call chronological snobbery, believing that modern people
are more knowledgeable and sophisticated than people were in the past.
24
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Doubting the Apostle John’s authorship
Not everyone through the centuries has agreed that the Apostle John is the
author. Dionysius, who was the pope of the influential Alexandrian church in
the mid-third century, argued that the author was actually an obscure first-
century church leader named John the Presbyter. He based his argument on
internal evidence, or evidence found in the text itself, that he believed pointed
to a different author. Dionysius claimed that the vocabulary and style of the
book were so different from the Gospel of John and the Johannine epistles
that it couldn’t have been written by the same author. According to Dionysius,
there are several discrepancies, including the following:
 The author of Revelation identifies himself by name. Although the
author of Revelation names himself four times (Rev. 1:1, 1:4, 1:9, 22:8),
the Apostle John generally avoids doing so in his other writings. In the
Gospel of John, he identifies himself only as the “disciple whom Jesus
loved” (John 13:23, 21:7, 21:20), and in two of his three epistles, he calls
himself the “elder” (2 John 1:1; 3 John 1:1).
 Revelation is written in a sloppier style of Greek than the other works
of the Apostle John. Clearly, the author of Revelation is highly knowledge-
able in the Old Testament books, probably knowing both the original
Hebrew texts and the Greek-translated Septuagint (an ancient Greek version
of the Hebrew Scriptures). But his writing skills aren’t always as sharp as his
explanation of Scripture. Although John’s Gospel and epistles are written in
refined, polished Greek, Revelation is scribed in a Semitic Greek style that
some scholars argue is slipshod in comparison. In other words, if you were
to say the Apostle John’s other writings were composed like a John Grisham
novel, then Revelation seems more in the style of a hastily cobbled together
term paper.
 The vocabulary and writing style (the author’s voice) of the acknowl-
edged Johannine writings contrast with Revelation. Most authors fall
into similar writing patterns. If you have favorite authors, you can often
discern their tone and voice, even if the topics they’re writing about vary.
The sentence structure, vocabulary, rhythm of the paragraphs, and so on
tend to be similar from article to article and book to book. The Apostle
John’s Gospel and epistles have this common feel to them. For example,
the Gospel of John begins with, “In the beginning was the Word” (John 1:1),
and 1 John starts with a similar tone: “We declare to you what was from
the beginning” (1 John 1:1). This type of similarity doesn’t carry over to
Revelation.
Dionysius’s position gained a few followers over the centuries, including Martin
Luther. However, not until recent times did his opinions gain momentum. Modern
scholars in some circles have jumped on the Dionysius bandwagon and worked
to expand on the issues originally raised by the third-century church leader.
25
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived

Defending the Apostle John as author
As some modern scholars have rejected the Apostle John as author of
Revelation (see the preceding section), other contemporary scholars have
vigorously defended the traditional view of apostolic authorship. As we
explain in this section, proponents of Johannine authorship raise several
internal and external issues (evidence outside of the book itself) to back their
claim.
The text: Addressing Dionysius’s challenges
Here’s how scholars have responded to Dionysius’s claims that the Johannine
epistles and Gospel differ too much from Revelation to have the same author:
 John may have had a purpose in specifically naming himself in
Revelation. Though the Apostle John never identifies himself by name in
his other books, the fact that he does so in Revelation doesn’t necessarily
eliminate him as its author. In fact, there are reasonable explanations for
his doing so. In particular, keep in mind that Revelation is a completely
different type of book from the other New Testament books. Authority is
particularly important for prophetic writing, so he may have felt oblig-
ated to name himself to eliminate any question about the book’s credibility.
 John doesn’t feel compelled to qualify himself. When the author does
give his name, he doesn’t attempt to give himself a title. He’s simply John.
Given the Apostle John’s preeminent role in the early church, he would’ve
been able to simply drop his name and provide no further explanation.
 John consistently stresses eyewitness testimony. In his Gospel and epis-
tles, the Apostle John stresses his eyewitness testimony. Revelation carries
over this theme, such as in Revelation 1:1–2 (“He made it known by sending
his angel to his servant John, who testified to the word of God and to the
testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw”) and in Revelation 22:8
(“I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things [. . .]”). Compare this
to a similar emphasis in the Gospel of John (John 19:35, 21:24).
 Details are consistent with what scholars know of the Apostle John’s
ministry. The writer speaks of the churches in western Asia Minor in a
way that clearly demonstrates that he had a relationship with them before
the writing and was knowledgeable of its geography. Credible second-
century historical records state that the Apostle John lived in Ephesus
from 70–100 CE. While there, he had a thriving ministry that spread
throughout the region. Scholars generally believe that he wrote his three
epistles while he lived there, sometime between 80 and 100 CE.
26
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

 The texts share some common words and phrases. In spite of some
stylistic differences between Revelation and the Gospel of John and
John’s epistles, many common words and phrases are actually scattered
among all these books. The Gospel of John refers to Jesus as Logos (“Word”)
in John 1:1. The only other reference to Jesus as Logos in all the Bible is
in Revelation 19:13. In addition, only John 1:29 and Revelation 5:6 refer to
Jesus as a “Lamb.” Moreover, both the Gospel of John (19:37) and
Revelation (1:7) refer to the same Old Testament verse, Zechariah 12:10.
 Teaching sections of Revelation are quite similar to the Gospel of John
and Johannine epistles. Although much of Revelation is obviously focused
on the prophetic visions of John, the book contains some expository
sections (text that presents information or explanations) as well 
(Rev. 1:1–8, 1:17–3:22, 22:18–21). Careful analysis of these sections reveals
a similar style to Johannine books. The major differences, therefore, lie in
the other, apocalyptic portions of the book.
 Revelation’s sloppier style has an explanation. Although proponents of
the Apostle John’s authorship of Revelation fully agree that the book
isn’t as well-written as his other works, they suggest three possible
explanations:
• The Book of Acts describes John as an “uneducated,” “ordinary” man
(Acts 4:13). He may have, therefore, used a well-educated secretary
(called an amanuensis) when he wrote his Gospel and epistles.
However, because he was exiled on the island of Patmos (Rev. 1:9)
when he wrote Revelation, a secretary wouldn’t have been available
for him.
• Because of the way in which John received the prophetic visions of
Revelation (see the later “Revelation as extraordinarily inspired”
section), he may have hurriedly scribbled what he saw in what lit-
erary critics call a stream-of-consciousness manner. If so, then to
ensure the contents of the original vision stayed intact, he may not
have wanted to edit his writings afterward.
• Some suggest that John wrote Revelation around 65 CE. If the early
date is correct (see the upcoming section “Playing the Dating Game”),
it would’ve been the first book he wrote — years before he wrote
his Gospel and epistles. Therefore, his rough writing skills may
have improved over time.
Siding with the early church leaders
People may never be certain whether the Apostle John wrote Revelation.
Getting a conclusive answer based on in-text clues is difficult because both
sides can supply plenty of supporting evidence. So if the debate over internal
evidence ends as a draw, then perhaps the view of the early church leaders
can sway the balance.
27
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived

Except for Dionysius, all the other respected church fathers in the second
and third centuries claimed the Apostle John as author. In fact, adding even
more weight to their claims, some of the original readers of Revelation (mem-
bers of the churches to whom the book was addressed) were still alive during
the lifetimes of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus.
Understanding the Troubled 
Times in Which John Lived
As the longest living Apostle, John saw a rapidly changing world and experi-
enced major spiritual transformation (see Figure 2-1). After all, John went
from a lowly, spiritually immature Average Joe to perhaps the disciple closest
to Jesus — and ultimately, he became a major torchbearer for the Christian
church. Throughout his long life, he saw extraordinary political, economic,
social, and religious changes. This section explains some of what John wit-
nessed back in the day.
Increasing Roman domination: Rise 
of the emperor-gods
Rome was at the peak of its military and political power during John’s life-
time, expanding in territory like never before. Complete domination of the
known world seemed like only a matter of time. The empire was also growing
increasingly rich. And for the first time, wealth was flowing to more than just
the emperor and the aristocratic patrician class. An upwardly mobile middle
class, comprised of former slaves and skilled craftsmen, was developing.
What’s more, the stability created by the powerful empire enabled trade to
flourish throughout the region. As a result, people of all socioeconomic levels
became more and more focused on money and material goods.
Rome also had an increasing spiritual influence over the region, especially
during the reign of the emperor Domitian (81–96 CE). Many people were
beginning to view the former Greek and Roman gods as passé, replacing them
with the tangible deity of the emperor himself. Table 2-1 lists some early
Roman emperors.

Rome was the model of a modern nation-state, looking for answers horizontally
rather than vertically. In other words, Rome sought human solutions to human
problems instead of looking for divine answers from above. Revelation 13
reflects this attitude by portraying humanity at war with God. As time went
on, the emperors increasingly named their predecessors (and themselves!) 
to be gods, demanding worship and persecuting the people who refused.
Deification — god-making — usually required approval from the Roman
Senate following the death of an emperor. However, Gaius Caligula, Nero, and
Domitian demanded that they be worshipped as gods before their deaths.
Significantly, the Senate denied them that honor because of their arrogance in
making the claim while still living. On the other hand, each of the seven cities
in Asia Minor competed for the honor of building and maintaining temples
dedicated to Roman emperors such as Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, and
even Livia Drusilla (Augustus’s wife). And in Asia, Domitian was indeed
addressed as “master” and “god” during his lifetime.
30
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Jewish population fleeing 
ancient Palestine
The Jewish population was undergoing a major transition during John’s life-
time. Before 70 CE, Jews lived in a relatively self-governing state within the
Roman Empire. As such, they enjoyed special privileges. For example, if you
were a Jew by birth, you didn’t have to participate in state-related worship or
serve in the military.
However, after the Jewish rebellion and the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, every-
thing changed. With their independent Jewish state in Palestine a relic of the
past and Jerusalem utterly destroyed, staying put seemed like a really bad
idea. The Jews were forced to scatter across the empire as refugees or slaves
(this scattering is commonly known as the Diaspora). The special privileges
they previously enjoyed gradually fell by the wayside.
A widening gap between 
Jews and Christians
The gap between Jews and Christians grew during the last part of the first
century. The rapid growth that was occurring in the Christian church during
this time was coming largely from the gentile population rather than from the
original Jewish base that developed immediately after the death and reported
resurrection of Jesus. As a result, the common heritage that the Jews and
Christians enjoyed in the 40–50s CE was increasingly ignored or forgotten.
The book of Revelation expresses this new reality but also retains ties to
Christianity’s origins. The target readers for the letter were gentile, not
Jewish, and the book (like all other New Testament books) was written in
Greek, not Hebrew. At the same time, not all ties to Judaism were gone. The
book of Revelation is rooted in Jewish symbolism from Old Testament books
like Daniel, Ezekiel, and Zechariah. What’s more, John mentions the Jewish
nation many times in his book, clearly noting that the futures of the Christian
church and Israel are intertwined (see Rev. 2:9, 2:14, 3:9, 5:5, 7:4–8, 11:1–2,
21:12).
Growing persecution of Christians
Jews scattered around the Roman Empire probably still enjoyed some of their
former privileges even after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Old religions, after
all, were still legal, but new ones couldn’t be practiced. As the Christian church
began to distance itself from Judaism and old Israel, it increasingly came to
31
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived

be viewed as a new religion, not enjoying its former more-favored status
under the umbrella of Judaism. Persecution inevitably increased the more
this separation became apparent.
Becoming a Roman target
Roman-sponsored persecution, imprisonment, and even death were becom-
ing distinct possibilities. For example, John tells of a man named Antipas who
was killed for his faith (Rev. 2:13). John, too, likely experienced this persecu-
tion firsthand. He wrote the book of Revelation when he was staying on
Patmos (see Figure 2-2), an island in the Aegean Sea where the Romans may
have maintained a penal mining colony — a Roman version of a chain gang.
John says he was on Patmos “because of the word of God” (Rev. 1:9). Like
Paul and Peter before him, John was probably on the island as punishment
for speaking out for his faith (although others suggest that John’s wording
may leave room for his being there as an evangelist instead).
Refusal to worship the emperor resulted in harsh punishment (see the earlier
section “Increasing Roman domination: Rise of the emperor-gods”). Initially
within the city of Rome, Nero persecuted Christians who challenged his
authority by refusing to worship him. But during the reign of Domitian — who

demanded to be worshipped as “lord” and “god” — Christians were starting
to experience persecution throughout the empire, which included all of the
Mediterranean region and Asia Minor. In fact, some evidence suggests that
Domitian may have tried to massively exterminate Christians during this period
(though most scholars doubt this was the case; most of the persecution was
local in nature).
When John wrote Revelation, he was addressing a church that was faltering
under increasing persecution from Rome. In our view, especially in Asia Minor,
society’s popular response to promote emperor worship resulted in increasing
persecution of dissenters such as the Christians. Heavy state-sponsored per-
secution came later — it’s more of a second-century phenomenon.
Encouraging the suffering church through Revelation
John wrote the book of Revelation to a group of seven churches in western
Asia Minor (see Figure 2-3), part of modern-day Turkey. The churches in this
region had a rare and unique privilege: Over the last half of the first century,
Apostles Paul and John visited them personally. (Paul wrote his epistles of
Ephesians, Colossians, and 1 and 2 Timothy to churches in the same western
part of Asia Minor.) This region also served as the home base for some of the
best-known church leaders in the second century. Irenaeus and Ignatius, for
example, grew up in Asia Minor area and eventually served as bishop in other
parts of the region.

Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived

John wrote the book of Revelation to churches that were on the verge of
coming under full-scale assault by the state. Many of the believers in the
early church were undoubtedly wondering whether the church could survive
an all-out attack by the Roman Empire.
Revelation was designed to encourage Christians to persevere during these
difficult times. The writing shows that the church was having major internal
problems (Rev. 3), but John is clear that God’s hand remains over the “Body
of Christ” (the church) and will ensure its survival. John proclaims that jus-
tice will triumph in the end and the church will persist, no matter how diffi-
cult, until Jesus returns. Through Revelation, John presents a wake-up call to
early Christian believers, underscoring that their faith is under an assault
that, although carried out by the state and other religious and political enti-
ties, is actually fueled by forces under the control of Satan.
Even though John’s primary audience is the seven churches in western Asia
Minor, his letter communicates what he and his target audience believed to
be God’s word to future generations of readers — including people today!
Playing the Dating Game
If a murmur of debate surrounds the authorship of Revelation, there are outright
grumblings regarding the timeframe in which John wrote the book. John sure
would’ve saved a lot of hot-winded debate if he’d simply added a “Copyright ©
whatever-the-heck-year-he-wrote-it” line to the opening verse of Chapter 1. But
he didn’t.
34
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 
Speakin’ New Testament slang
John either read other books of the New
Testament or perhaps picked up lingo from
other Apostles. Revelation’s writing reflects a
vernacular that’s consistent with the other New
Testament books. For example, the first chapter
of Revelation has some notable expressions
that parallel Paul’s epistle to the Colossians:
 Revelation 1:4 (“Grace and peace to you from
him who is, and who was, and who is to
come”) closely mirrors Colossians 1:2 (“Grace
and peace to you from God our Father”).
 Revelation 1:5 (“Jesus Christ, who is the
faithful witness, the firstborn from the
dead”) looks similar to Colossians 1:18
(“And he is the head of the body, the
church; he is the beginning and the firstborn
from among the dead”).

Therefore, you need to look at both external and internal evidence for answers.
Over the years, two major camps have developed, dating the book either
sometime in the 60s CE or sometime in the 90s CE. We examine the arguments
on both sides.
The rebel rousin’ 60’s
In the twentieth century, the 1960s were a time of social change, hippies, and
disorder. But that recent decade is nothing in comparison with the centuries-
ago rebel-rousing era of the emperor Nero’s reign in the 60s CE. This decade
was marked by widespread discontent among the Jews in Palestine, leading
to an outright revolt. In response, the Roman army, led by General Titus,
invaded and destroyed Jerusalem in 70 CE. Some scholars believe that John
penned his book in the midst of this decade of strife, probably around 65 CE.
The major arguments for an early date include the following:
 A still-standing Temple in Jerusalem: Revelation 11:1 refers to the
Temple in Jerusalem: “Come and measure the temple of God and the
altar and those who worship there.” In this passage, the Temple clearly
sounds like it’s still standing. However, the Romans destroyed
Jerusalem’s Temple, along with everything else in the city, in 70 CE.
Therefore, some early-date proponents argue that Revelation must’ve
been written before the Temple was destroyed.
 References to Nero: Proponents of the early dating of Revelation see
possible references to Nero in the text. First, Revelation 17:9–10 may be
a reference to Nero as the sixth Roman emperor: “Also, they are seven
kings, of whom five have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet
come; and when he comes, he must remain only a little while.” And a
myth during the years following Nero’s death stated that he would
return from the dead or be hidden in exile, leading some to believe
Revelation 13:3–4 alludes to Nero himself.
Some believe the reference to 666 in Revelation 13:18 is an allusion to
Nero: “Let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast,
for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six.” The
reason is that Hebrew and Greek letters have a number value associated
with them, enabling you to convert any word to a matching numeric
value. Given this, many commentators hold that the letters of the beast’s
name equal 666. If you tweak the spelling of Nero’s name, Neron Caesar
in Hebrew comes out as 666.
 Rough Greek, indicating Revelation is John’s first writing: Revelation
is written in rough Greek, far less polished than the Apostle John’s Gospel
or epistles. This may very well indicate that it was his first attempt at 
writing a “book” and that his writing skills improved as time went on.

Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived

As Chapter 4 explains, the early-date theory is crucial for the preterist inter-
pretation of Revelation because preterists contend that many of the prophecies
John gives in the book were fulfilled in the first century.
Hip hoppin’ in the 90’s
Many Bible scholars believe Revelation was written sometime during the reign
of Domitian (81–96 CE), likely around 95–96 CE. If so, then Revelation would be
the appropriate end cap to the biblical canon — both in terms of subject
matter and as the last book written by some 5 to 20 years. Arguments supporting
a later date include the following:
 Church tradition: The consensus of early church leadership held that
Revelation was written in the 90s. Irenaeus stated that Revelation was
written during Domitian’s reign. Other early church fathers — including
Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Victorinus (who wrote perhaps the first-
ever commentary on the book), Eusebius, and Jerome — agreed.
 The state of the seven churches: The depressing state of many of the
seven churches in Revelation 3 sounds altogether different from what
was going on during Paul’s ministry to this same region in the 60s.
During Paul’s day, the churches did have their struggles with sin and
other issues, but none were infected with all-out apostasy (defiant disbe-
lief of God) to the extent that John talks of in Revelation 3.
 The timing of John’s ministry to Asia: Scholars know John left Palestine
before the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE. However, they question the likeli-
hood of his immediately assuming the major leadership position in the
churches in Asia Minor. After all, during this timeframe, Paul’s influence
on the churches in the region would still have been strong.
 Earthquake in Laodicea: Historical evidence indicates that an earth-
quake destroyed the city of Laodicea in the early 60s. Therefore, the
physical presence of the city, let alone an established church in
Laodicea during the 60s, seems doubtful.
In addition, the judgment that Jesus has on the Laodicean church is that
of lukewarmness (apathy or indifference): “So, because you are luke-
warm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth”
(Revelation 3:16). Indifference in the shadow of a major event such as an
earthquake goes smack against human nature. After a person or group
survives a catastrophe, they aren’t usually lukewarm about their faith;
rather, they may be angry at God or desperate for comfort.
However, if the earthquake occurred in the early 60s, a new generation
would be of age in Laodicea by the 90s with no firsthand experience of
the earthquake. Lukewarmness in this environment would be more likely.
36
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

 Emperor worship: Some commentators believe that Revelation 13
alludes to the Roman practice of emperor worship. Worship of emperors
while they were still living didn’t gain prominence until the reign of
Domitian (81–96 CE).
 Christian persecution outside of Rome: Although Nero is well-known for
his persecution of Christians, his focus was limited to the city of Rome
itself, not the entire Roman Empire. Some scholars argue that persecution
was more widespread throughout the empire, including western Asia
Minor, during Domitian’s reign.
Later-date proponents also find two notable flaws in the early-date justifications:
 The Temple in Revelation 11 is discussed in a symbolic passage, so it
may not be a reference to a physical Temple.
 The idea that 666 stands for Nero in Hebrew is a stretch. After all, the
target audience for the book wasn’t Jewish but gentile, so John’s intention
to convert a name in Hebrew to a number doesn’t seem realistic. What’s
more, you have to change the common spelling of Caesar in Hebrew to
get the 666, anyway. Finally, early church father Irenaeus denied it
referred to Nero or any other Roman dictator.
37
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived
Churches in start-up mode?
One of the most compelling arguments for the
later date of Revelation is the deteriorating state
of the seven churches in Revelation 3 — too
little love, moral compromise with Rome, luke-
warm faith, and so on. When you read the let-
ters that John addressed to each, the churches
don’t sound like they’re in “start-up mode” as
they would’ve been back in the 60s. Instead,
some time seems to have passed since the start
of the church.
When you compare these churches to the
Israelites in the Old Testament or even the
modern-day church, seeing faith deteriorate
over a generation isn’t unusual — but to have
such problems within a few scant years is odd.
The typical scenario occurs when a generation
fails to pass its faith to the next generation,
causing the up-and-comers to forget the faith of
the earlier generation. If that’s what happened
to the Asian churches, then a later date seems
more likely.

Unraveling Revelation’s 
Textured Style of Writing
The book of Revelation is one of the most unique books in the Bible, not only
because of its subject matter but also because of the textured style in which
it was written. It combines three distinctive types of writing:
 Epistle: In some ways, it’s similar to other epistles, or letters, in the New
Testament.
 Prophecy: It shares characteristics of books such as Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Haggai, and others that focus on prophecy. Prophecy is a message from
God, communicated through a prophet, that can speak the mind of God
or foretell future events that God promises will happen.
 Apocalyptic: In other ways, Revelation is the natural follow-up to the
Old Testament books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Zechariah; they symbolically
address the end of time when good overcomes evil. Apocalyptic books
contain vivid, imaginative symbolism as a method of communication.
In this section, we take a close look at these three types of writing and how
John wove them together to create his unique book. We also look at the role
that Godly inspiration plays in biblical writing.
Revelation as epistle
When most people think of Revelation, the elements of prophecy and apocalyp-
tic symbolism come to mind first. But in terms of overall structure, it shares
the characteristics of an epistle superimposed on an apocalyptic writing (the
next section explains more about that genre).
An epistle is the letter style of writing of all the New Testament books except
the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles. These letters (which became books of the
Bible) circulated among the various churches at the time and were read
aloud. An epistle followed the Greek model of letter-writing, which normally
included the following:
 An introduction that lists the writer and the recipients and provides a
formal greeting and thanksgiving
 The body of the letter
 A conclusion that includes a farewell, which was typically written by the
sender himself to show the credibility and authenticity of the letter
38
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

In some ways, Revelation follows this epistle model. Although the apocalyptic
content that makes up the body of the letter isn’t something you find elsewhere
in the New Testament, the opening and closing of the letter are surprisingly
common. At the start of the book, John writes in Revelation 1:4, “John to the
seven churches that are in Asia,” an opening line that’s similar to other epistle
openings, as is his identification of the recipients in Revelation 1:11. The closing
benediction “The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen” (Rev.
22:21) is similar to that of the Letter to the Hebrews and several epistles by the
Apostle Paul.
John had a specific target audience for the book; therefore, as you read
through Revelation (as well as the Old Testament prophetic works), ask your-
self how the original readers would have understood John’s words and how
they would’ve applied the lessons. After that, you can consider how to best
apply the teachings in your own context.
Revelation as apocalyptic literature
Revelation is popularly known for its apocalyptic style. Apocalyptic literature
is a specific genre of writing that’s characteristic of what Jews wrote between
300 BCE and 200 CE and of the early Christian church. The apocalyptic style
had several unique characteristics, including the following:
 It was written during times of hardship and persecution and longing.
Apocalyptic literature was popular in ancient Israel during some of its
most difficult days. Biblical apocalyptic writing tells readers to prepare
for suffering but to also have hope and confidence that God has ordained
the events that are going to transpire. For example, Zechariah wrote his
book to a defeated people of Israel who had just returned from exile and
felt powerless to change their circumstances.
 It uses vivid imagery and symbolism to represent real-world counter-
parts. The most obvious quality of apocalyptic literature is its use of
seemingly bizarre imagery. Although you tend to see fantastic imagery
today only in sci-fi and horror films, the biblical apocalyptic style isn’t
considered fantasy fare or fiction. Instead, the symbolism adds drama
and deepens the meaning of the message. Apocalyptic writing often rep-
resents people and countries as animals, such as a lamb, dragon, or
strange beast. Take, for example, Daniel 8:21, which refers to a male goat
as the king of Greece and a large horn between its eyes as the first king.
Similarly, real cities and nations receive symbolic names, such as
Babylon, Sodom, Egypt, and Jerusalem; these names are usually the
great powers or cities of the era in which the book was written. What’s
more, political and social problems are often shown as natural disasters
involving the sun, moon, or stars.
39
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage: The Apostle John and the World in Which He Lived

 It often features angels as guides. Angels are often the guides for the
author during the visions. For example, as recorded in Daniel 7–12,
Daniel has visions in the night, which an angel then explains to him.
 It uses numbers to convey meaning. In apocalyptic literature, numbers
(such as seven) usually carry significance beyond their arithmetic 
purposes. Given that, be wary of assuming literal 24-hour, 7-days-a-week
time periods when you come across a measurement of time. The “ten
days” in Revelation 2:10 and “one hour” in Revelation 17:12 may simply
refer to short periods of time. So, too, the 1,000 years in Revelation 20
may not necessarily mean 365,242 days but may instead refer to a more
generic “very long time,” much like Peter writes in 2 Peter 3:8: “But do
not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a
thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day.”
Besides Revelation, the only other apocalyptic book in the Bible is Daniel,
although Ezekiel and Zechariah have similarities to this literary style. However,
many apocalyptic works were written before and during the early church
period but were not considered Scripture (coming directly from God).
Nonetheless, the book of Revelation wasn’t just the lucky one that made it to
the big leagues of canon. It’s altogether distinct from the “pretenders.” Unlike
the extra-biblical writings, in Revelation, John identifies himself as the writer,
declares the book to be inspired by Jesus, and specifically states that the
book is a prophecy.
Revelation as prophecy
The book of Revelation is not merely a book that contains prophecies; rather,
as John states, the book as a whole is a prophecy (Rev. 1:3, 22:7, 22:10, 22:18–19).
In the Bible, a prophecy is a special message from God to his people; it may
concern future events that God promises will happen on earth and in heaven.
Most Old Testament prophecy is preaching designed to bring about repen-
tance and recommitment to the Old Covenant, the promise between Moses
and God on Mount Sinai (see Exodus 31–34 in the Bible). New Testament
prophecy is similar, except believers are called to a renewed commitment to
the New Covenant, the agreement between God and humanity made possible
by the sacrificial death of Jesus.
Prediction, though not the predominant feature, is still an important part of
prophecy in both the Old and New Testaments. Christians believe that in
some cases, the predictions have already been completed in history. Most
Christians, for instance, think that numerous Old Testament prophecies pre-
dicted the coming of Jesus as Messiah, as well as his death and resurrection.
In other cases, the future events have yet to happen (such as passages in
Daniel that deal with End Times).
40
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

In most cases, prophets who wrote down the message focused on the details
of the event but avoided specifics concerning exactly when that event was
going to occur in history. They did so because the point of the prophecy was
to warn people to be faithful and expectant, not simply to provide a play-by-
play guide to how history was going to play out.
Many people find biblical prophecy confusing and sometimes wonder
whether it’s God’s way of teasing or confusing people for some reason. But
that’s not the case. The Bible is clear that prophecy is actually designed to
 Encourage and comfort believers (1 Corinthians 14:3)
 Give hope (Rev. 1:3)
 Refocus believers on God’s character and promises (Rev. 1:3)
At its heart, Revelation is intended to accomplish each of these objectives as
you read through it, even though getting to the meaning may take a little effort.
Revelation as extraordinarily inspired
Many Christians believe that all biblical Scripture originated from God but
was written down by human authors. The terms that people often use to
describe this process are inspired and God-breathed. However, how exactly
the mechanics of this process work is an age-old mystery. We do know what
didn’t happen: God didn’t just temporarily take over the minds of the Bible
writers and turn them into zombie scribes, nor did he just rubberstamp the
ideas of the human authors. Instead, Christians believe that the Holy Spirit
guided and directed the writers without overriding their personality or 
personal expression during the process.
Not all the books of the Bible were written in exactly the same manner, even
though they’re all considered to be inspired. Matthew and John wrote personal
accounts about the life and ministry of Jesus (John 14:26). Mark and Luke,
both right-hand men of Apostles Peter and Paul respectively, relied on the Holy
Spirit to guide them to provide an account through eyewitnesses. The New
Testament epistles were personal letters written “in words not taught by
human wisdom but taught by the Spirit” (1 Corinthians 2:13).
The way in which John received inspiration for the book of Revelation seems
to be extraordinary, involving visions, dreams, and direct communication with
the divine. According to Revelation 1:1, God the Father gave the revelation to
his son Jesus. Jesus then shared the vision with John through an angel. While
John was “in the spirit” (1:10), he received a series of visions, the details of
which he faithfully wrote down (1:2), creating the book of Revelation.

T
oss out the term prophecy, and your friends may start talking about
Nostradamus or any number of other people who claim to have seen the
future. But say biblical prophecy, and anyone familiar with the Bible is likely
to turn the conversation to the book of Revelation and the End Times. However,
prophetic (and apocalyptic) writings in the Bible run throughout both the Old
and New Testaments, not just in Revelation. In fact, approximately one-third of
the Bible is devoted to prophecy. According to Christians, some it has already
been fulfilled, and some is still in the works.
In this chapter, you peek into some of the biblical prophecy outside the book
of Revelation. You explore some of the prophetic works of the Old Testament
that are often associated with End Times prophecies. You also explore the
Olivet Discourse (a sermon delivered on the Mount of Olives), a key New
Testament prophecy spoken by Jesus himself. As you examine these prophe-
cies, you discover their interrelationships and the influence that these
prophetic teachings have on the book of Revelation.
Understanding the Old Testament
Backdrop to Revelation
Like most devout Jews of the time, John was familiar with the writings that
now make up the Old Testament. These writings highly influenced the book
of Revelation, more than they influenced any other New Testament book.

Revelation makes approximately 250 references and allusions to Old Testament
books, including Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, Exodus, Jeremiah, Zechariah,
Amos, and Joel. However, unlike many other books in the New Testament,
Revelation contains no direct quotes from the Old Testament.
All the references Revelation makes to the Old Testament are more than just
interesting factoids. These references add meaning and theological weight to
John’s text by showing that his experience and vision are not isolated from
biblical history but rather are closely interwoven with the whole biblical
story. This points to the essential unity of the Bible and its prophetic teach-
ing. You can also use John’s references as springboards to more meaning as
you dive into the Old Testament Scriptures.
Here are just some of the more-significant allusions to the Old Testament.
This first set is mostly in the first few books of the Bible:
 Revelation mentions the “tree of life” (from Genesis 3:22) four 
times — 2:7, 22:2, 22:14, and 22:19.
 The judgment on the enemies of God in Revelation 19:20 and 20:10 (their
being thrown into the lake of fire burning with sulfur) resembles the
burning of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19:24, where burning sulfur
rains down.
 The symbol of the woman clothed with the sun, having the moon under
her feet and wearing a crown of 12 stars on her head (Rev. 12:1) is similar
to the imagery of Joseph’s dream in Genesis 37:9.
44
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 
Going meta with the story of stories
Scholars sometimes use the term metanarra-
tive for a comprehensive story that explains
many other stories. The Bible, considered as a
whole, is a metanarrative, a story of redemption
(saving from sin, delivering from evil). This
framework is the context for the many stories
within its pages.
In the book of Exodus, the Lord delivers the
Hebrew people from Egypt (Exodus 8–12). A
prominent feature of that deliverance is a series
of devastating plagues, reducing Egypt to sham-
bles. Yet in the midst of these plagues, the
Hebrews are spared and, in the tenth and final
plague, passed over. (The term Passover comes
from this miraculous rescue.)
The historical books of the Old Testament
(Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings) also
recount God’s repeated interventions on behalf of
his oppressed people. In every case, the Lord
comes to their rescue. He wields his “strong right
hand” (Exodus 15:6) — a biblical idiom denoting
God’s power and authority — in their defense.
The New Testament, at numerous points,
employs the imagery of the Hebrew Passover to
describe the salvation that Jesus, the “Passover
Lamb,” provides (John 1:19; 1 Corinthians 5:6–8;
Colossians 1:13–14). Thus, the book of Revelation
is the conclusion of the metanarrative unfolding
in the pages of the Bible.

 Several times in Revelation, John loosely alludes to Exodus 3:14 (“I AM
WHO I AM”) when he refers to God as “he who is and who was and who
is to come” (Rev. 1:4, 1:8, 11:17, 16:5).
 The plagues of hail (Rev. 8:7), locusts (Rev. 9:3), sores (Rev. 16:2), water
changed to blood (Rev. 16:3–4), darkness (Rev. 16:10), and unclean spir-
its that look like frogs (Rev. 16:12–14) relate closely to six of the ten
plague that befall Egypt in Exodus 8–11.
 Revelation 11:8 uses Egypt as a symbol of evil power. Egypt was an
oppressor and enemy of Israel during the days of Moses.
 In Revelation 1:5, John says that believers gain freedom from sin at the
cost of Jesus’s blood, which symbolizes the Passover in Exodus 12.
 John says in Revelation 15:3 that the redeemed people sing the “song of
Moses,” which is similar to what Israel does after crossing the Red Sea
(Exodus 15:1).
 The woman’s protecting her child in the wilderness in Revelation 12:14
is reminiscent of Israel’s being protected in the wilderness as they
wander for 40 years with Moses.
 The symbolism of the Temple and the Ark of the Covenant in heaven in
Revelation 11:19 bring to mind the many references of the Temple and
Ark of the Covenant throughout the Old Testament.
 The use of trumpets in Revelation 8 resembles the way people use trum-
pets in the Old Testament — for worship, for battle, and as a symbol of
the Lord’s presence (for example, Numbers 10:9; Judges 7; 2 Samuel 6:15).
Many of Revelation’s other references to the Old Testament borrow imagery
from books named for the prophets:
 Jesus is described as being the “first and last” in Revelation 1:17 and 2:8
and the “alpha and omega” in Revelation 22:13. Isaiah depicts God in the
same way in Isaiah 44:6 and 48:12.
 The winepress of the wrath of God in Revelation 14:9 echoes the wine-
presses in Joel 3:13 and Isaiah 63:3.
 The scroll that John eats in Revelation 10:8–11 resembles God’s commis-
sioning of Ezekiel as a prophet in Ezekiel 2–3.
 The beast depicted in Revelation 11–20 is similar to the imagery of Daniel 7.
In Revelation, the beast is a single leopard-like being with bear-like feet and
a lion’s mouth. Daniel, however, refers to four different beasts; of the four,
one looks like a lion, one like a bear, and one like a leopard.
 Revelation 12:14 uses the phrase “time, times, and half a time,” which is
the same phrase as in Daniel 7:25 and 12:7.
 The sealed scroll in Revelation 5 is similar to the sealed book in Daniel 12:4.
45
Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible

 The angel standing on the sea and on the land in Revelation 10:5 resembles
the angel over the waters of the river in Daniel 12:7.
 The four horses from Revelation 6 parallel the chariots with horses 
in Zechariah 1:8–11 and 6:1–8.
 The olive trees in Revelation 11:4 are reminiscent of the olive trees in
Zechariah 4.
 The seven lampstands in Revelation 1:12 are similar to the lampstands in
Zechariah 4:2 and 4:10.
Clearly, John was well-versed in the Hebrew Scriptures; much of the symbol-
ism and phrases he uses in Revelation have their roots in the Old Testament.
One Bible scholar even referred to Revelation as a “rebirth of images,” a term
that emphasizes the extent to which the book borrows imagery.
In his classic Commentary on the Apocalypse, H.B. Swete says that 278 of the
404 verses in Revelation refer to the Old Testament.
Peeking into Old Testament Prophecy
In the Old Testament’s opening scene of the history of the nation of Israel,
God delivers his people from slavery in Egypt, using some motivational
plagues and the parting of a sea. After only 40 years (they take the scenic
route through the wilderness), God helps the Israelites establish a home in
Canaan, which they call the Promised Land. However, during their time
strolling in the desert — and as time goes on after they’re settled — they con-
tinually forget about their agreement with God and fling themselves into idol
worship, sinful lifestyles, civil war, and arrogance.
As a result, the Bible says, God raised up several men to be prophets to the
nation of Israel to get them to return to their “first love,” their God in heaven.
These prophets — such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Joel, and Zechariah —
wrote down messages that readers believed were from God himself.
Here are a few reasons for writing down these messages:
 To document the sovereignty and power of God as demonstrated
through events
 To reveal God’s future plans for his people
 To provide advance warning to those rejecting God’s commands
 To give comfort to God’s faithful people
46
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Prophecy in the Old Testament typically centers on the coming of the Messiah
(the Anointed One, whom Christians identify as Jesus) as well as the future of
the nation of Israel and of the earth as a whole. Many scholars hold that the
Old Testament, particularly the book of Daniel, contains a considerable
amount of End Times prophecy. Others maintain that these prophecies refer
to historical events.
One of the great challenges of interpreting Old Testament prophecy is that
the timing for fulfillment is usually absent from the text. For example, two
prophecies may appear alongside each other, but the timetable of the two
may be completely different. One helpful analogy is to think of the prophets
as being able to see the mountaintops along a mountain range but unable to
see into the valleys. In other words, what they recount in their prophecies are
the highlights, or more significant events.
Another challenge scholars face in interpreting prophecy is whether a single
prophecy has dual fulfillment — whether it was or will be fulfilled in two dif-
ferent contexts at two separate times. For example, most scholars hold that
Isaiah 17 was fulfilled in the Assyrian invasion in Hezekiah’s time, which even-
tually led to the destruction of the Assyrians (Isaiah 17:14). But this prophecy
may also represent a force that invades the land at the time of Jesus’s return
and is ultimately destroyed.
We cover some of the more notable prophets who addressed the End Times
in the sections that follow.
Isaiah
The prophet Isaiah, whose ministry took place between 740 and 687 BCE,
wrote the book of Isaiah. He prophesied during the reigns of king Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. The book of Isaiah contains many messianic
prophecies, or prophecies about the future Messiah, deliverer of the Jews.
However, the following passages are often tied to End Times prophecy:
 Isaiah 2:1–5 gives a peaceful vision of the End Times in which people will
“beat their swords into plowshares.”
 Isaiah 11:11 points to a gathering of Israel (all Jews) and to the Jewish
nation’s gaining territory in the region.
 Isaiah 13–14 talks about the destruction of Babylon. Scholars have different
views on whether this is a literal or figurative reference to Babylon,
especially as it relates to the destruction of Babylon in Revelation 18
(see Chapter 12). Some hold that this section of Revelation indicates
that Babylon will actually be rebuilt as a nation in the End Times; others
maintain that it’s a figurative Babylon, headed up by the Antichrist.
47
Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible

 Isaiah 19 discusses Egypt in the End Times. Isaiah prophesies civil war
and judgment in Egypt but says that the country will eventually turn to
God; Israel, Egypt, and Assyria (Syria) will become allies and worship
together.
 People often call Isaiah 24–27 the Little Apocalypse because it seems to
parallel what Revelation depicts in the last days. Isaiah 24 talks about
the devastation that awaits the earth because of the sinfulness of its
inhabitants. Isaiah 25 explains how God will overcome the evil in the
world and protect those who are faithful to him. Isaiah 25:7 may allude
to the end of the Antichrist’s deception (Rev. 13). The salvation of God’s
people is in Isaiah 25:8–9 (Isaiah 25:8 seems to parallel Rev. 21:4). Finally,
many see Isaiah 27’s reference to the Leviathan as parallel to the dragon
in Revelation 20:2.
 Isaiah 65:17 talks about God’s establishing a “new heavens and new
earth.” Some scholars contend that this chapter describes the Millennium
(the period of time depicted in Revelation 20 in which Jesus reigns on
earth for 1,000 years). Others point out that Isaiah’s imagery seems to
nicely parallel Revelation 21:1, which occurs after the Millennium.
 Many scholars who hold to the futurist perspective (see Chapter 4)
point to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 as the fulfillment
of Isaiah 66:8 (“Shall a land be born in one day?”).
Ezekiel
Ezekiel was a prophet to the Jewish exiles from 593–563 BCE, during their
Babylonian captivity. He prophesied about the destruction of Jerusalem and of
its eventual restoration. The book of Ezekiel is nearly all in first-person narrative,
and it uses apocalyptic imagery that’s similar to John’s writing in Revelation.
The first part of the book (Ezekiel 1–24) focuses on the judgment and ruin of
Judah (the Jews) by its enemies. The second part (Ezekiel 25–32) prophesies
God’s judgment and destruction of these same enemies. The final section
(Ezekiel 33–48) looks at the future restoration of the Jewish nation.
The following passages are often tied to End Times prophecy:
 Ezekiel 34, 36, and 37 talk about a restored, reunited Israel. Some argue
that 36:24 indicates that this gathering is not just the ancient return from
Babylon but instead a future return from all over the world.
 In Ezekiel 38–39, Ezekiel prophesies a great battle that will take place.
The nations of Gog, Persia, Ethiopia, Put, Gomer, and Beth-togarmah will
attack Israel from the north. The rich imagery of Ezekiel 39:17–20 sounds
quite like that of Revelation 19:17–21.
A host of interpretations for these two chapters place this battle before,
in the middle, or at the end of the Tribulation (the seven-year period of
48

unprecedented evil that futurists believe will occur prior to the Second
Coming of Jesus). Some commentators consider it to be the final battle
at the end of the Millennium.
 Ezekiel 40–48 describes in a great detail a new Temple, a new sacrificial
system, and a new division of land among the Jewish tribes. Some 
commentators hold that this section prophesies a sacrificial system for
Israel during the Millennium. Note that the description of the river in
Ezekiel 47:1–12 is similar to that of Revelation 22:1–2.
Daniel
Daniel was a Jew who was taken into captivity at Babylon and amazingly ended
up serving as a statesman within the Babylonian court (after spending several
years falsely imprisoned). The first six chapters of the book of Daniel contain
historical narrative, and the remaining chapters contain apocalyptic visions
of future events. People traditionally consider Daniel to be the author of the
book of Daniel, though some contend it was written by an unknown author in
the second century BCE.
The following passages from Daniel are often associated with End Times
prophecy:
 In Daniel 7, Daniel prophesies about four beasts from the sea. The first is
like a lion with eagle’s wings. The second is a bear. The third beast is a
leopard with four heads and wings — it has authority to rule. The final
terrifying beast has two rows of iron teeth and ten horns. Later in the
chapter (Daniel 7:17), Daniel says that these beasts represent four kings
who will come to the earth. Some scholars believe this section parallels
Revelation 17:7–13. Daniel 7 concludes with the removal of the last king
and the establishment of God’s reign.
 Daniel 8 describes the vision of Daniel in Susa, the capital of Persia. He
talks of a two-horned ram (kings of Media and Persia) and a goat
(Greece). Many commentators see Daniel 8:5–8 as referring to Alexander
the Great and Daniel 8:9–12 as a reference to Antiochus Epiphanes, who
desecrated the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Others think the Antichrist
will fill the “little horn” role in Daniel 8 in the last days.
 Daniel 11 vividly describes the actions of historical and future 
kings. Daniel 11:2–20 discusses historical kings, and many commentators 
hold that Daniel 11:21–45 prophesies the events pertaining to the 
future Antichrist (“a despicable person”).
 Many scholars see Daniel 12 as a description of suffering during the
Great Tribulation (Rev. 6–19).
Daniel 9 is one of the most talked about chapters of Old Testament prophecy.
We talk about in detail in the section titled “Examining the 70 Weeks of Daniel 9.”

Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible

Zechariah
Zechariah was a prophet who ministered from 520 to 518 BCE to the many
Jews returning from exile to Jerusalem; he called for rebuilding the city and
Temple. Zechariah’s apocalyptic prophecies clearly point to the coming Messiah
and look far into the future to a time in which the people Israel would be
removed from their homeland and forced into exile. Some of Zechariah’s 
prophecies that are associated with End Times include the following:
 Zechariah 1–2 describes the reestablishment of Jerusalem, and it 
prophesies that the four nations who scattered Judah will be cast out.
 In Zechariah 4, Zechariah describes a lampstand (menorah) and lamps,
which parallels the imagery in Revelation 1. Futurist commentators (see
Chapter 4) often interpret the two olive trees in Zechariah 4:11–13 as
being the two witnesses from Revelation 11:3–4.
 Zechariah 6 describes four chariots and horses that are reminiscent of
the four horses in Revelation 6.
 Zechariah 11 describes the destruction of Israel by evil shepherds, the
last of which may refer to the Antichrist.
 Zechariah 12 talks about a Jerusalem threatened by her enemies but
eventually protected by God. The same theme carries over to
Revelation.
 Zechariah 13 prophesies that two-thirds of Israel will die but that one-
third will be refined and saved, which reflects the effects of judgments
that transpire in Revelation.
 Zechariah 14 talks about God’s coming to the rescue of a Jerusalem under
serious attack. In the end, the Lord will rule over all nations. Once again,
John voices this message in Revelation.
Jeremiah
Jeremiah was a prophet who came about a century after Isaiah. From 628–586
BCE, Jeremiah warned Judah of coming disaster and urged his fellow people
to turn back to God. He prophesied that Babylon would overtake Israel
(Jeremiah 25:8–11), which would be subject to Babylon’s king for 70 years. This
happened during his lifetime, as Babylon began taking Jews as captives.
50
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Joel
The book of Joel is divided into two main sections. The first part focuses on a
plague of locusts, and the second part (more apocalyptic in nature) focuses
on future judgment on the nations of the world. Both images appear in
Revelation.
Examining the 70 Weeks of Daniel 9
As you look at prophecy throughout the Bible, one of the most significant yet
perplexing passages you’re likely to come across is Daniel 9:20–27. Daniel was
an old man at the time he wrote the book and had been in Babylon for nearly
all his life. However, the 70 years of captivity of Israel by Babylon as punish-
ment for disobedience (Jeremiah 25:8–11) were nearly over.
In the story, Daniel prays to God for mercy on behalf of his people. The angel
Gabriel appears and announces that 70 weeks are needed to accomplish 
several things:
 To remove and atone for Israel’s sins once and for all
 To establish everlasting righteousness
 To complete all prophecy
 To anoint a new Temple
The debate over this passage centers on the meaning and significance of
those 70 weeks. Here’s how the angel Gabriel breaks them down:
 Seven weeks: “Know therefore and understand: from the time that the
word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of an
anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks” (Daniel 9:25).
 Sixty-two weeks: “And for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with
streets and moat, but in a troubled time” (Daniel 9:25).
 One week: “After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off
and shall have nothing, and the troops of the prince who is to come shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to
the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. He shall make a strong
covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make
sacrifice and offering cease; and in their place shall be an abomination
that desolates, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator”
(Daniel 9:26–27).
51
Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible

A variety of views on this passage have popped up over the centuries, but
you can boil them down to three main interpretations: dispensationalist, tra-
ditional, and critical. I discuss their understanding of Daniel’s 70 weeks in the
following sections.
Having a long week: The dispensationalist
view
Dispensationalists hold that human history is divided into seven “dispensations”
(eras), which are represented by the seven churches of Revelation 2–3. They
think part of Daniel’s prophecy refers to the Great Tribulation period (Rev. 6–19).
The dispensationalist view holds that the “weeks” that Daniel talks about are
not actual weeks but a symbolic term for years. Therefore, Daniel is talking
about 70 “weeks of years,” or 490 years. Dispensationalists make this claim
based on three factors:
 Daniel lays the groundwork for dealing with years back in Daniel 9:2,
when he talks about 70 years of captivity of Israel.
 In Daniel 10:2–3, when he is actually referring to days, the prophet goes
out of his way to add “days” to his usage of “weeks.” In the original
Hebrew, the phrase is literally “weeks of days.”
 Dispensationalists argue that no other time period other than years
would permit all the prophetic events to take place.
This section explains how those “weeks” play out and just who the prince
and anointed one may be.
Breaking down the timetable
According to dispensationalists, the first 69 weeks took place prior to the cru-
cifixion of Jesus, and the final, 70th week is still coming. Therefore, the entire
church age (which began after the life of Jesus with the disciples’ establishment
of the Christian church) falls in a gap period between the 69th and 70th week.
Many dispensationalists put the starting point of Daniel’s 70-weeks prophecy
at 445 BCE, when King Artaxerxes permitted Nehemiah to rebuild Jerusalem
(Nehemiah 2). The first seven weeks end around the time of the completion
of the rebuilding effort in Jerusalem (approximately 400 BCE — see the “A
year isn’t always a year” sidebar). The next 62 weeks end in approximately 30
CE with Jesus’s triumphant entry into Jerusalem just days before his crucifix-
ion. Some dispensationalists have differing timetables, such as the first seven
weeks lasting from 587–538 BCE and then the 62 weeks starting in 440 BCE
and ending at the birth of Jesus in 6 BCE or at his crucifixion.
52
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Dispensationalists may have different takes on some of the dates of the initial 69
weeks, but they all agree on two things:
 An extended gap comes after the 69th week and before the 70th week.
Jesus’s crucifixion, the destruction of the city and Temple of Jerusalem
in 70 CE, and the entire church age take place in this gap period. The
church age continues today.
 The 70th week is symbolic of the Great Tribulation, the same period
depicted in Revelation 6–19. At the beginning of the 70th week in Daniel
9:27, another “prince” from a great empire will enter a covenant with Israel.
But midway through the week (3.5 years), he’ll break the covenant, stop
the sacrifices in the Temple, and desecrate it.
Naming the cast of characters
According to this view, Daniel 9:25–27 refers to both Jesus and the Antichrist.
The “anointed prince” and “anointed one” in Daniel 9:25–26 are Jesus, but the
“prince” in the last part of verse 26 and then the “he” in verse 27 refer to the
Antichrist.
Reading the End Times
Dispensationalists believe in a collaboration among Daniel 9, Revelation 6–19,
and Jesus’s teaching in Matthew 24, known as his Olivet Discourse (see the
“Exploring the Olivet Discourse” section later in this chapter). They hold that
Jesus explicitly refers to “the abomination of desolation” from Daniel 9:27 in
Matthew 24:15 as a sure sign of the Great Tribulation. Moreover, they also
point to Revelation 13’s dependence on Daniel 9 in terms of describing the
Antichrist. Specifically, both Daniel and Jesus say that the Antichrist will
 Blaspheme in the temple
 Make an idol
 Introduce a reign of terror
53
Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible
A year isn’t always a year
If you look at the length of time between the
events that dispensationalists mention in their
timeline of Daniel’s 70 weeks, you may notice
that the numbers don’t add up. What gives? Can
you discount their theory with a few simple
strokes on a calculator?
Not so, they say. Some scholars contend that a
“prophetic year” is about 360 days, not 365.
Therefore, when you try to calculate the time in
a verse like Daniel 9:25, you have to factor in a
360-day year under the Jewish lunar calendar.
Using this approach, you can add 69 360-day
years to get to Jesus’s lifetime. Other people
counter that idea, pointing out that Daniel uses
“years” in the conventional sense in Daniel 9:1–2.

 Have a 3.5-year reign
 Persecute God’s people
 Be ultimately destroyed by Jesus
Dispensationalists are convinced that Daniel’s 70-weeks prophecy relates to the
last days because the universe-changing nature of the prophecy is something
that only the return of Jesus can fulfill.
Seeing time as relative: 
The traditional view
Traditionalists generally believe that Daniel’s 70 weeks do not prophesy
about the last days but rather point to work of Jesus. In other words, they
hold that God gave Daniel a prophecy so that the Jews would recognize the
events surrounding the arrival of the Messiah.
Unlike dispensationalists, traditionalists do not look for a week to represent
an exact period of time (such as a year). Instead, they see Daniel’s 70 weeks
as symbolizing an unspecified period. In other words, the events that occur
within each “week” are more important than lengths of time — one week may
be 200 years; the next may be 1 year; the next, 3 days; and so on.
Checking out the schedule
Many traditionalists believe the starting point of the 70 weeks is when King
Darius (Cyrus) of Persia decided in 538 BCE to permit the Israelites to return
to Jerusalem after 70 years of captivity and to rebuild the Temple and the city
(2 Chronicles 36:23, Ezra 1). The next 62 weeks begin around 400 BCE and end
with the birth of Jesus (around 4 BCE).
There’s debate among holders of the traditional view, but the final 70th week
is usually broken into two parts. The first half of the week ends in 70 CE with
the destruction of Jerusalem, and the second half ends sometime in the future
with the Second Coming of Jesus. Therefore, the entire church age (from the
30s CE to the present day) is within that second half of the 70th week.
ID-ing the prince and the anointed one
Traditionalists don’t believe that Daniel refers to the Antichrist at all in this pas-
sage. According to this view, the “prince” and “anointed one” in Daniel 9:25–27
always refers to Jesus, not to multiple people. They also view Daniel 9:26 and
9:27 as parallel verses, referring to the same events. What’s more, traditionalists
maintain that the “desolation” in Daniel 9:26 refers to the crucifixion of Jesus.
The Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE serves as Jesus’s judgment on
Israel.
54
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Avoiding the future: The critical view
Criticalists argue that not only does Daniel 9 not prophesy about future End
Times events, but it also never “foretells” any events. Instead, the critical view
claims that the book was written by an unknown author around 164 BCE,
describing the events of his day. From this view, “weeks” and “sevens” refers
to “weeks of years” (490 years).
Laying out the timeline
According to the critical view, the first seven “weeks of years” (49 years) point
to the period 587–538 BCE. However, before the eighth week starts, many pro-
ponents push the timeline back 67 years to 605 BCE, when Jeremiah received
the prophecy that Israel would go into captivity for 70 years. The next 62 weeks
of years last a total of 434 years. The last week of the 70 weeks, according to
this view, refers to 171–164 BCE, a chaotic time period in the history of Israel
that saw the murder of Onias III (the high priest) in 171 BCE, the desecration of
the Jewish Temple in 167 BCE, and the rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE
by Judas Maccabaeus.
However, this timeline presents some problems. Although the events noted
are significant in Jewish history, saying that sin ended and everlasting right-
eousness was introduced as a result seems like a major stretch. What’s more,
Jerusalem and the Temple were not destroyed in 167 BCE but were rather
damaged, even if that damage was significant.
Associating characters with historical figures
The critical view tries to match references to the “anointed one” and “prince”
to real historical figures. “The anointed one” refers to two different people —
high priests Joshua (9:25) and Onias III (9:26). The “prince” in 9:26–27 refers
to Greek king Antiochus Epiphanes, who desecrated the Temple.
Exploring the Olivet Discourse: 
Jesus’s Prophecy
As you examine biblical prophecy and the book of Revelation, perhaps no
other text in the New Testament is more important to look at than Jesus’s dis-
course on the Mount of Olives in Matthew 24:1–25:46 (see also Mark 13:1–37
and Luke 21:5–36). This message that Jesus gave to his disciples is known as
the Olivet Discourse. It covers
 The future destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem
 A future period of great turmoil and tribulation
 Signs of Jesus’s return to earth
55
Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible

Readers of Revelation often hold one of two major opposing views of the
Olivet Discourse:
 Preterist: In simple terms, preterists believe that Revelation refers not to
future events but to events that already took place back in the first century
(see Chapter 4). Therefore, the preterist view holds that all or nearly all
of the prophecy that Jesus describes in Matthew 24–25 was fulfilled when
the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70 CE. Full preterists claim that all
the prophetic events have already taken place; partial preterists hold that
many of the events took place in 70 CE, but the prophecy will be fully
completed with the return of Jesus.
 Futurist: Futurists basically believe that Revelation chronicles literal events
that will take place on earth sometime in the future (see Chapter 4). The
futurist view maintains that although the Temple destruction was fulfilled
in 70 CE, most of the prophetic teaching concerns the End Times and the
Second Coming of Jesus. What’s more, they claim that the particulars of
the historical events surrounding the Roman war with the Jews vary too
much from the Jesus’s prophecies to reflect actual fulfillment.
This section explains the two main interpretations of Jesus’s message and
how they relate to Revelation.
Noting the signs of the times
As Matthew 24 begins, Jesus tells his disciples that the Temple will be destroyed.
The disciples then ask Jesus, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign
of your coming and of the end of the age?”
At the very start, Jesus says that the end of the age won’t take place immedi-
ately. In Matthew 24:4–8, Jesus warns that before the end of the age even begins,
false prophets will claim to be the Messiah, and wars and rumors of wars will
arise. However, he goes on to say that the beginning of the end (“birth pangs”)
will be marked by wars between nations and kingdoms, along with famines and
earthquakes. Futurists believe this passage refers to the first 3.5-year period of
the seven-year Tribulation and that it parallels the seal judgments of Revelation
6 (see Chapter 9).
Next, in Matthew 24:9–14, Jesus describes a time of great spiritual struggle.
On the one hand, Christian followers will be persecuted, martyred, and
despised. False prophets will rise up to mislead people. On the other hand,
God’s people who persevere to the end will help the message (gospel) of
Jesus be proclaimed around the world. When the whole world has heard this
message, the end will come. Futurists claim this section describes the events
of the second half of the Tribulation (Rev. 13:1–18).
56
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Jesus then warns the disciples by specifically referring to the book of Daniel
(likely 9:27 and 11:31) in Matthew 24:15 when he says, “So when you see the
desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place, as was spoken of by the prophet
Daniel [. . .].” Desolating sacrilege refers to when the man of sin places his own
throne in God’s Temple and claim to be God. Preterists think this passage refers
to the events surrounding the Roman destruction of the Temple in 70 CE;
futurists hold that this refers to the Antichrist, who will be in power during the
second half of the Tribulation (Rev. 13).
Continuing on, Jesus tells those who are being persecuted to run for the hills
(okay, mountains) because there will be great suffering during all these events.
He also emphasizes the importance of not being led astray by false prophets.
Witnessing Jesus’s (second) big entrance
In Matthew 24:29–31, Jesus describes his Second Coming by painting a vivid
picture of the events:
 The sun and moon become dark, and the stars fall from the sky. (Jesus
may be alluding to Isaiah 13:10 or Joel 2:30–31. Some preterists see these
references to the Old Testament prophets as Jesus’s way of comparing the
Romans’ future destruction of Jerusalem with the Babylonian captivity of
ancient Israel.)
 The people see “the sign of the Son of Man” and begin to mourn.
 The Son of Man comes “‘on the clouds of heaven’ with power and great
glory.”
 His trumpet blast sends the angels to collect God’s people.
Full preterists claim that these last few points refer to the spreading of
Christianity in the Roman world in the early centuries. Partial preterists and
futurists counter, saying that a plain reading of the text indicates the literal
return of Jesus to the earth.
Futurists also debate the timing of the rapture (when God’s people are taken up
into heaven) in relation to the Second Coming of Jesus. Some commentators
believe Jesus doesn’t discuss the rapture at all in Matthew 24:29–31. Others,
however, argue that the rapture is indicated in 24:30–31 as well as later in the
chapter in 24:40–42 (see Chapter 4 for more discussion of the various views).
57
Chapter 3: The Prequels: Prophecies throughout the Bible

Keeping your guard up
As if answering the question, “So what do we do in the meantime?” Jesus uses
the second half of Matthew 24 and part of Matthew 25 to share several parables
aimed at getting his followers to apply a central lesson of his teaching — and
of Revelation: Be ready! These stories include the following:
 The parable of the fig tree (Matthew 24:32–35)
 The example of Noah (Matthew 24:36–39)
 The lesson of people taken away (Matthew 24:40–41)
 The parable of the faithful house owner (Matthew 24:42–44)
 The lesson of the wise servant (Matthew 24:45–51)
 The parable of the ten virgins (Matthew 25:1–13)
 The parable of the talents (money) (Matthew 25:14–30)
Finally, in Matthew 25:31–46, Jesus tells the story of the judgment of all
nations after his return — a time in which he’ll separate sheep and goats. In
the same way, John warns his readers of the importance of being ready and
watchful at all times.
Considering the “generation” gap
Perhaps the verse that sparks the greatest debate in the Olivet Discourse is
Matthew 24:34: “Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all
these things have taken place.” The problem centers on how to define the
word generation.
Preterists claim that interpreting this passage at face value indicates that Jesus
was clearly referring to the current generation, the generation of his audience.
If so, then the fulfillment of these prophecies has to have transpired in the
short-term — within the lifetime of at least some of Jesu’s listeners.
58
Part I: Revealing the End of the Biblical Story 

Futurists counter by saying that “this generation” doesn’t specifically mean
the generation of the disciples:
 Some commentators argue that you can also translate the original Greek
word as “race” or “a common type of people.” If so, then Jesus was simply
saying that Israel won’t pass away before these prophecies are fulfilled.
 Others hold that “this generation” refers to the generation that sees the
events Jesus is describing. In other words, that future generation won’t
pass away before the Second Coming of Jesus; if you’re alive during the
“birth pangs” (Matthew 24:8), then your generation gets to witness the
end of the world.
 Others point to the fact that biblical prophecy often wasn’t fulfilled
within the lifetimes of the original audience. For example, consider the
prophecy of Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15: “The Lord your God will raise
up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you shall
heed such a prophet.” In this case, “you” spans generations. Christians
believe it refers to not so much to the ancient Israelites living in the days
of Moses but to the Jewish people who lived to see the fulfillment of that
prophecy in the earthly life of Jesus.

I
t’s the weirdest thing: Honest people can observe the same event yet draw
wildly different conclusions about what they saw. Several people can witness
an auto accident and give a handful of contrasting accounts of what really hap-
pened. Or if you had gathered Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks fans to
watch Super Bowl XL, you would’ve heard considerable disagreement over
whether the Steelers won the contest, the Seahawks lost it, or the refs blew the
game.
This same sincere-people-can-disagree principle applies to the book of
Revelation. Since the early church, dominant perspectives on how to inter-
pret John’s book have emerged, but not even well-intentioned, Bible-based
thinkers can reach a consensus. Some argue that John is speaking figura-
tively, merely expressing spiritual themes relevant in any age. Others, how-
ever, believe the symbolic language represents actual events that are going to
take place in a literal time period.
Over the span of church history, four major interpretations of the book of
Revelation have come to the forefront. In this chapter, you explore this quar-
tet. We begin by taking a brief historical look at how the church has viewed
John’s book. Next, you dive into each of the four approaches and examine
their strengths and weaknesses.

Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 
Solving the Revelation Puzzle: Four
Solutions throughout History
The debate over the real meaning of Revelation is nothing new. Throughout
church history, various perspectives on how best to read, understand, and
interpret the apocalyptic letter of John have gained popularity. And although
there are more variations and spinoffs than you can shake a stick at, you can
group them all under four general categories: the futurist, historicist, preterist,
and idealist approaches.
We look at each of these four perspectives in depth in this chapter. This section
gives you an overview of their development. To help you follow along, here
are in-a-nutshell definitions of how each perspective views the events of
Revelation:
 Futurist: Everything is going to happen in the future.
 Historicist: Some has happened, is happening, and is going to happen.
 Preterist: Everything already happened in the past.
 Idealist: Nothing literal happens; everything is symbolic.
Okay, we admit these definitions are a bit simplistic, but they define the
essence of each perspective reasonably well. Each view falls into a different
range along the literal-allegorical continuum (Figure 4-1). What this means is
that futurists read Revelation more literally than everyone else and that ideal-
ists view the book’s message in more spiritual terms than everyone else. The
other two positions fall somewhere in between.

Early church views
The early church in the second and third centuries usually (though not 
exclusively) interpreted Revelation in a literal manner, tying John’s words
into actual events that would take place soon, perhaps within their lifetime.
Some of the best-known church fathers during this period — such as Papius,
Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Victorinus — were outspoken in their
beliefs, which today’s scholars identify with the premillennial and futurist
approaches. (Premillenial simply means the belief that all the events from
Revelation 1–19 will happen before the Millennium begins — see Chapter 13.)
However, the influential Alexandrian church rejected the literal approach.
Instead, Alexandrian leaders, led initially by Origen in the early third century,
developed a more figurative, allegorical method of looking at the Scriptures.
Tyconius (around 390 CE) articulated this idealist approach for Revelation,
and with the backing of Augustine — who was arguably the most influential
Christian between the time of the Apostles and the Protestant Reformers —
this view essentially became the standard doctrine of the church for nearly
1,000 years.
The Middle Ages and Renaissance
The idealist approach had a virtual monopoly on prophetic interpretation
until the historicist method was developed, most concretely by Joachim of
Fiore (theologian and founder of the monastic order of San Giovanni in Fiore,
Italy) in the twelfth century. He claimed a vision from God led him to look at
Revelation in light of actual history. In particular, Joachim argued that many
of the judgments prophesied in Revelation were actually fulfilled in the major
events of history since John’s day.
By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the historicist view gained more
prominence, particularly among the Franciscan religious order, as an alternative
to the still-dominant idealist approach. However, the Protestant Reformation
was what really jump-started the historicist approach. Many reformers, including
Martin Luther, came to believe that Revelation 4–22 was a prophetic snapshot
of church history and identified the first beast in Revelation 14 as a symbol of
the Roman papacy. This historicist approach became the dominant view in
the newly emerging Protestant church over the next 300 years, until the mid-
nineteenth century.
65
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

Into the modern era
During the Reformation era, Spanish Jesuits developed the preterist and
futurist approaches, which helped counter the anti-papal (anti-pope) leanings
of the historicist approach:
 Luis de Alcazar (1614 CE) articulated the preterist method, claiming that
John’s work wasn’t talking about current or future events at all but instead
was oriented to the early church’s battle against Judaism (Rev. 1–12)
and Roman paganism (Rev. 13–19). During the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, the preterist view had periodic surges of interest and has
recently gained more and more prominence.
 Francisco Ribera developed the futurist approach in the late sixteenth cen-
tury. Some in the Roman Catholic Church held his views over the next two
centuries, but Protestants rejected futurism until the nineteenth century.
However, during the 1830s, J. N. Darby, the founder of dispensationalism,
incorporated Ribera’s ideas into his framework. (Dispensationalism holds
that human history is divided into seven “dispensations,” or eras, repre-
sented by the seven churches in Revelation 2–3 — see Chapters 3 and 13
and the upcoming section “Meaning of the letters to the seven churches.”)
This futurist approach would soon spread among other groups as well,
gaining momentum into the twentieth century, particularly in the
Protestant evangelical church.
Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the idealist approach to
Revelation remained popular in other parts of the church, especially among
Roman Catholics and those who embraced a more theologically liberal view
of Christianity in this period.
Today, in the twenty-first century, the historicist method has faded signifi-
cantly in popularity, while futurism, preterism, and idealism all have strong
followings. Of these three, the futurist method has emerged over the past half
century as the most widely known interpretation in today’s culture. It’s often
portrayed in the media and the arts, as you can see in the bestselling Left
Behind book series.
Figure 4-2 shows how these four methods of interpretation have grown and
weakened in popularity within the church over the years.

Futurist: Events Will Take Place 
at a Moment’s Notice
Futurists believe that much of John’s prophecy, starting with Revelation 4:1,
chronicles real events that will take place on this earth sometime in the future.
According to this view, John uses Revelation as a platform on which to give
specific details of the End Times, including
 A seven-year period of judgment called the Tribulation (Rev. 6–18)
 The Second Coming of Jesus, which immediately follows the Tribulation
(Rev. 19)
 A literal 1,000-year of reign of Jesus on the earth (Rev. 20)
 A final judgment of the world (Rev. 20)
 The creation of a new heaven and earth (Rev. 21)
Figure 4-3 shows the futurist’s timeline of Revelation.
This viewpoint has risen significantly in popularity over the past 150 years,
and you can consider it the mainstream position for many Protestant evan-
gelical churches.
Of the four positions, the futurist method is the most literal in interpretation.
While embracing the symbolism in John’s work, futurists believe that symbolic
prophecy always leads to a literal fulfillment, unless the text specifically states
otherwise. Therefore, according to futurists, the numbers used in the book —
such as the 144,000 in Revelation 7 or the 1,000-year reign of Jesus in
Revelation 20 — should be treated literally, even if they also have symbolic
meaning associated with them. So, too, the cosmic disturbances and disasters
foretold in the seals, trumpets, and bowls hint at real cataclysmic events while
symbolizing political and social upheavals.
However, futurists would add the caution that this principle doesn’t mean
every symbol should be interpreted as a literal description. For example, the
“Sodom and Egypt” in Revelation 11:8 is symbolic because the text clearly
says (italics added), “Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city
that is prophetically [allegorically] called Sodom and Egypt, where also their
Lord was crucified.”
Futurists don’t believe that Revelation’s vivid symbolism warrants a fundamen-
tal shift in interpretation. They’re less likely to look for hidden meanings in
the text and instead argue that Revelation tends to be straightforward in its
interpretation.

Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

Various futurist perspectives
Not all futurists agree on the details of interpretation. In fact, several strands
of futurism branch off based on a variety of issues. In this section, we discuss
four noteworthy areas of difference.
Meaning of the letters to the seven churches
Futurists differ on how to interpret the letters to the seven churches in
Revelation 2–3. Most believe these letters are just what they appear to be: let-
ters from John to the seven first-century churches in Asia Minor.
Another camp of futurists — the dispensationalists — argues that each church
represents a period of church history (see Table 4-1 for one interpretation). This
approach to Revelation 2–3 is somewhat related to the historicist approach,
deviating from a plain reading of John’s book for these two chapters (see the
upcoming “Historicist: Covering the Entire History of the Church” section).

Timing of the rapture
The rapture is the point in time when Christians who are still alive on earth
will be taken up to heaven to be with Jesus (see Chapter 10). Futurists differ
on whether the rapture occurs before, during, or after the Tribulation judg-
ments discussed in Revelation:
 Pretribulationists (pre-tribs) and dispensational futurists believe that the
rapture of the church takes place at the start of Revelation 4. They hold
that John’s account of being taken up to heaven parallels the rapture
accounts in 1 Corinthians 15:52–54 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18. In addition,
they also point out that the word church is conspicuously absent from John’s
book after the close of Revelation 3.
 Midtribulationists (mid-tribs) hold that the rapture will take place midway
through the Tribulation period.
 Posttribulationalists (post-tribs) say it’ll happen at the end of the judgment
period, just prior to the Second Coming of Jesus.
Chronology of Revelation
The majority of futurists believe that, starting at Revelation 4:1, the book
largely provides a continuous chronology of events that’ll take place during
the End Times. Others argue that Revelation actually contains parallel sec-
tions (Rev. 4–11 and Rev. 12–19) that provide two descriptions of the
Tribulation before the Second Coming.
Timing of judgments
Most people who subscribe to the futurist approach hold that the seal, trum-
pet, and bowl judgments described in Revelation 6–19 have yet to take place.
They represent judgments that are far more severe than the world has ever
experienced. In other words, according to classic futurism, you can think of
Revelation’s prophecy as being in pause-mode, just like on your DVD player.
Some of the events (Rev. 2–3) have taken place, but Jesus has yet to unclick
the pause button to continue the fulfillment of most of the prophecy in the
book of Revelation.
A minority futurist perspective sees the seal judgments as already taking place
progressively within the church age, while the others remain in the future.
71
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

Examining the futurist approach
Futurists hold up several arguments to support their position. They say that
futurism is consistent with the following:
 The history of fulfilled prophecy: Futurists contend that a literal per-
spective closely parallels the way in which God fulfilled Old Testament
prophecy (see the “Fulfilled Prophesy: Literal or Symbolic?” section in
this chapter). Therefore, they argue it’s reasonable to assume the same
principles apply to Revelation as well.
 A plain reading of the judgments of Revelation: The futurist approach
argues that, even if you don’t understand the specifics of the End Times
judgments, a plain reading of Revelation tells you that they’re going to
be really, really bad. Therefore, according to futurists, because events of
the scope and magnitude of those foretold in Revelation have never
occurred in human history, preterism and historicism can’t be true.
 Traditional scriptural interpretation: The futurist approach maintains
that an accurate reading of Revelation 4–22 shouldn’t be much different
from the way you approach Revelation 1–3 and the rest of the Bible.
Therefore, futurists argue that by following the grammatical-historical
method of interpretation, you arrive at a futurist understanding of the
prophecy. (See Chapter 17 for some practical guidelines that are part of
the grammatical-historical method of interpretation.)
72
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 
Newspaper exegesis: The end is near!
One of the criticisms that non-futurists have
concerning the futurist approach is its tendency
to promote sensationalism and what’s called
newspaper exegesis — interpreting Scripture
based on current events. For example, suppose
an article on fingerprint and eye-scanning tech-
nologies hits the stands, and some futurists
become convinced that this technology is a pre-
cursor to the mark of the beast (a way in which
people are identified by something on their
bodies). Or perhaps the European Union is
labeled as the modern-day Babylon, and the euro
foreshadows a worldwide economy led by the
Antichrist. And of course, the Antichrist is who-
ever is the most notorious villain of the moment.
The important point isn’t speculating on whether
these theories are true or false but rather recog-
nizing that they are, in fact, theories. If the futur-
ist view is correct, then by definition, John’s
prophecy must truly be fulfilled in actual events.
But because Christians believe only God knows
the details, people can only play guessing games
regarding world events. People in every genera-
tion have declared particular world events and
leaders or specific dates as definite fulfillments
of specific prophecy in Revelation, only to be
proven wrong over and over.

 Early church leanings: The futurist approach was developed in the
Middle Ages as a response to the Protestants’ historicist approach.
However, the core belief of this approach — a literal interpretation of
Revelation — has its roots at least as far back as the early second-century
church.
However, critics note some challenges to futurism:
 Futurism requires more effort than the other viewpoints in interpreting
John’s stated timing of events. In Revelation 1 and 22, John clearly says
that the events he is writing about will “soon” transpire. Critics charge
that futurists have to force their translation of that text in order to 
support their claims. (See the “Are we there yet? or, How soon is ‘soon’?”
section in this chapter for more on this issue.)
 Much of Revelation becomes less relevant to the seven churches. If
everything after Revelation 4:1 happens in the future, then much of
John’s book had little relevance for the original readers. (For details on
this issue and the futurist response to it, see the later “Who is John
really writing to?” section in this chapter.)
Historicist: Covering the 
Entire History of the Church
The historicist interpretation of Revelation sees John’s book as revealing the
entire course of history during the church age. In other words, the book’s
prophecy started in the early church and, because there are no clearly
defined starting and stopping points, the prophecy is being continuously ful-
filled in “real time.” The historicist, therefore, sees Revelation as history in
the making.
The basic approach
Because prophecy in Revelation is an ongoing process, historicists look at
major historical events since the first century and then attempt to map them
back to specific prophecies in Revelation (see Figure 4-4). For example, some
believe that the opening of the seals in Revelation 6–7 symbolizes the barbar-
ian invasions against the Western Roman Empire, while the locusts of
Revelation 9:1 represent the Arabs who attacked the Eastern Roman Empire.
Other prophetic events in history range from the Protestant Reformation, to
the French Revolution, to such modern issues as the United Nations or U.S.
race riots. Although the view is less common today, classic historicists
embraced the idea that the papacy (the office of the Roman Catholic pope)
was the Antichrist (beast) discussed in Revelation 13:1.
73
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

Under the historicist approach, prophecy is fulfilled through real events, but
Revelation is also dripping with symbolic significance. In particular, histori-
cists look at the dating discussed in Revelation as key. Specifically, they hold
to a year-day principle, meaning that one day in Revelation symbolizes one
year in actual history (paralleling the year-day relationship in Ezekiel 4:4–6).
The historicist interpretation has an impressive list of proponents from the
past, including Martin Luther, John Wycliffe, John Knox, William Tyndale, Sir
Isaac Newton, John Wesley, and C.H. Spurgeon. However, like disco music and
tapered jeans, the historicist approach is out of style today. Few people in the
twenty-first century subscribe to this perspective.
Examining the historicist approach
As evidence for the validity of their interpretation, historicists hold up some
rather compelling mappings of real historical events to the prophetic judg-
ments in Revelation.
Critics, however, insist that the matchmaking attempts of the historicist are
much like an Internet dating service: Odds are that you’ll get an occasional
hit, but you’ll have many more misses or forced fits along the way. Critics
also note these challenges: 
 No consensus among historicists: Although historicists may agree on a
general interpretative model, this group shows little agreement on the
specifics of fulfilled prophecy. This situation raises a practical issue of
how useful Revelation would be as prophecy if no one is ever sure about
any of the events that happened in either the past or present.
 Most historicist models reach too much for a solution: Non-historicists
argue that trying to map history over the past 2,000 years into Revelation’s
judgments is like trying to fit a round peg into a square hole.

Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

 Fulfillments are too Euro-centric: Most historicist accounts base much
of the fulfilled prophecy on events that impact the European church and
overlook the worldwide church.
 Not all timing easily fits into the year-day principle: Non-historicists point
to various parts of Revelation in which the stated timeframes don’t seem
consistent with the year-day model — in particular, Revelation 11:2, 12:6,
12:14, and 13:5.
One potential danger that historicists (and futurists, too) should recognize is
a tendency to become preoccupied with the nitty gritty details of prophetic
fulfillment. When this happens, readers risk turning Revelation into little more
than a puzzle or math problem rather than the Word of God. Therefore, it’s
important that Christians not lose sight of the bigger messages that John was
delivering — to be faithful and obedient to Jesus regardless of circumstances.
Preterist: Explaining Historical Events
from the First Century
Preterists believe that the prophecies discussed in Revelation correspond not to
future events but to events that already took place back in the early centuries
CE. In other words, Revelation is fulfilled prophecy (or at least largely so).
According to the preterist approach, John wrote the entire book of Revelation
as a promise of deliverance for the seven churches in the Roman province of
Asia that were suffering intense persecution from Jewish authorities and the
Roman Empire. The seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments were thus directed at
the Jews and the Romans (see Figure 4-5).

Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

Classic preterists hold that John’s prophecies were fulfilled by the destruc-
tion of Jerusalem in 70 CE, though a smaller group of preterists extends this
window to include the fall of the Roman Empire in 393 CE. Not surprising, the
classic preterist position largely depends on an early dating of John’s writing
(in the 60s, prior to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE). See Chapter 2 for more on
the dating of Revelation.
Preterism was formally developed in the Middle Ages and served as a minor-
ity opinion for centuries. However, it’s recently become a popular model
within some scholarly circles. What’s more, the preterist approach has a defi-
nite appeal to readers who find the futurist’s End Times talk too sensational-
istic or downright wacky. Preterists see their view as a far more
down-to-earth solution, while still holding true to the reliability and divine
inspiration of the Bible.
Although preterists would argue that the prophecies were fulfilled as actual
historic events, they interpret many of the judgments more symbolically than
futurists do. Therefore, the classic preterist holds that the return of Jesus
(Rev. 19) is a carrying out of his judgments, not a physical return of Jesus to
the earth (because that obviously didn’t occur in 70 CE).
Preterists often consider Matthew 24 (also Mark 13 and Luke 17, 21) as a
mini-version of Revelation because Jesus discusses many of the same themes
of his judgment and return (see Chapter 3). Because this teaching, the Olivet
Discourse, is in the first three Gospels but not the Gospel of John, preterists
suggest that Revelation may be John’s elaboration on what Jesus talked
about on the Mount of Olives. They point out that, in context, Jesus’s discus-
sion about judgment in the Gospels seems to be related to the destruction of
the Temple in Jerusalem. If so, John is following suit in his book of Revelation.
(For more on the Olivet Discourse, see Chapter 3.)
Various preterist perspectives
Not all preterists are alike. Here are two notable points of difference:
 Timing and nature of Jesus’s Second Coming
• Full (classic) preterists claim that the prophecies of the entire book —
including Jesus’s symbolic Second Coming — were already fulfilled
back in the first century.
• Partial preterists believe that the judgments already took place
back in the first century but agree with the idea of a literal Second
Coming of Jesus in the future, along with a final judgment.
76
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

 View of Revelation as prediction versus description
• Many classic preterists affirm the predictive nature of John’s writ-
ing, believing that these prophecies were fulfilled within years of
John’s writing.
• Some who call themselves preterists believe John was simply
describing current events rather than predicting events that would
take place in the future. From this perspective, Revelation was the
persecuted Christian church’s response to the powers that were
attacking the church.
Examining the preterist approach
Preterists see several strengths to their interpretative view, including the 
following:
 Relevance to the original readers: If John is prophesying about events
that will transpire within a handful of years after his writing, then he
functions very much like an Old Testament prophet preparing his con-
temporaries for what to expect shortly. Practically, Revelation also is
very similar to other epistles. (See the “Who is John really writing to?”
section later in this chapter.)
 Consistency with a plain reading of the timing: John repeatedly says
that the events in the prophecy will happen “soon” (1:1, 22:7, 22:12, 22:20).
A preterist can take that word at face value. (See the “Are we there yet? or,
How soon is ‘soon’?” section.)
 Consistency with the Olivet Discourse: Preterists hold that the Olivet
Discourse (Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 17, 21 — see Chapter 3) tells
of the coming destruction of Jerusalem. Given the parallels between
Jesus’s teaching on the Mount of Olives and Revelation, they believe the
two prophecies point to the same events.
Critics of preterism identify several challenges to this viewpoint:
 Dependency on early dating of Revelation: The classic preterist relies
on the early dating of Revelation (before 70 CE). However, as Chapter 2
discusses, the certainty of an early date is no slam dunk.
 Difficulty in seeing all the prophecies fulfilled: When you compare the
fall of Jerusalem (and/or the later destruction of Rome) with the details
provided in Revelation, preterists identify remarkable parallels.
Specifically, they hold up nonbiblical historical accounts (such as those
of the well-known Jewish historian Josephus) that depict stories of suf-
fering and disaster. However, critics argue that even taking those
accounts at face value, it remains a stretch to see John’s prophecy ful-
filled to the extent that Revelation requires.
77
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

 Mixture of figurative and literal interpretations: Critics charge that
preterists are selective about what is literal, symbolic, or both. Preterists
insist on a plain reading of some of the text, such as the “I am coming
soon” wording in Revelation 22, literal references to the Temple in
Jerusalem (Rev. 11), and allusions to Nero (Rev. 17). Yet non-preterists
argue that preterists run away from a plain reading of the text in other
passages. In particular, although futurists and historicists view the white
rider in Revelation 19 as Jesus, preterists believe that the image merely
symbolizes the carrying out of the Word of God. 
 Differences between ancient history and John’s prophecy: Critics
insist that if the preterist approach is valid, then church history
would’ve been much different. Instead of suffering continued and pro-
longed persecution, early Christians would’ve received total victory
over the Jews and Romans. What’s more, they argue that because the
final judgment and destruction of evil has yet to occur, then at least
some of Revelation is incomplete.
 Origins in a reactionary period of history: The original proponent of
the preterist approach did so in part as a response to the antipapacy
claims of Protestant reformers’ historicism (see the earlier section “Solving
the Revelation Puzzle: Four Solutions throughout History”). By itself, the
environment in which preterism developed doesn’t nullify the view, but crit-
ics believe people should factor potential biases into the whole equation.
Idealist: Identifying Themes, 
Not Literal Events
The idealist position (also known as the spiritual, allegorical, or symbolic
approach) looks at Revelation as a figurative description of the constant,
cyclical battle between good and evil that exists throughout human history
(see Figure 4-6). The idealist, therefore, doesn’t look for prophecy to be ful-
filled in actual, literal events. You may think of idealists as viewing Revelation
as a fictional tale elaborating great spiritual truths.

78
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

Idealists see Revelation as a book that John wrote to encourage believers in
his day of God’s eventual victory over evil and to call them to persevere during
tough times. The battles discussed refer to struggles that are occurring in a
spiritual realm and that the Apostle Paul alludes to in Ephesians 6:12: “For our
struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against
the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the
spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.” The judgments that are prophe-
sied signify the recurrent, natural disasters and political-social problems that
humans have always faced. As you’d expect, the idealist approach emphasizes
the vivid symbolism of Revelation and downplays its predictive qualities.
Various idealist perspectives 
Within the idealist camp, you find a variety of perspectives. Here’s the 
basic tour:
 Conservative versus liberal idealists: Most theologically conservative
idealists affirm the idea of Jesus’s eventually returning to earth, defeating
Satan once and for all, and establishing his permanent kingdom. More-
liberal idealists maintain that all the talk of a Second Coming in the
Scriptures is pure allegory — that Jesus has no intention of an actual,
personal return to the earth for a second time.
 Hybrid idealists: Some commentators tend to combine the idealist
approach with the preterist, forming a hybrid idealist-preterist position
(see the earlier section titled “Preterist: Explaining Historical Events
from the First Century”). From this perspective, prophecy was fulfilled
figuratively within the first century but without any ties to historical
events. Other commentators blend the idealist approach with the
historicist and even the futurist interpretations.
Examining the idealist approach
Proponents of the idealist approach point to the following strengths of their
interpretation:
 Consistency with the apocalyptic nature of Revelation: Idealists put all
their interpretative eggs in the apocalyptic basket, so to speak. They
hold that apocalyptic literature wasn’t meant to be taken as a codebook
to actual events. Instead, just as artistic expressions like poetry and
opera deal with broad moral themes, so, too, does John’s Revelation. 
 Relevance in any age: Because this approach deals with the prophetic
messages on a higher, more abstract level, you don’t need to try to
match up each passage of Scripture with a historical event, as the other
79
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

approaches do. Therefore, from the perspective of the idealist, all the
Scriptures are relevant to every generation of the church, not just a
minority of believers facing those events in a specific space and time.
Critics of the idealist approach note several shortcomings, including the 
following:
 Idealism stops short. Futurists, historicists, and preterists are quick to
point out that they can agree with many of the broad symbolic themes
that the idealist approach espouses (good will triumph, justice will be
served, and so on). However, they argue that idealists make their mis-
take by not seeing the literal undertones of the text.
 An allegorical interpretation waters down Scripture. A literalist argues
that when you interpret the Scriptures allegorically, you reduce their
authority because the meaning comes from the interpreter, not the text.
 It’s less consistent with Old Testament prophecy. Critics hold that the
nonliteral nature of this approach is far less consistent with the normal
patterns of Old Testament prophecy. (See the “Prophecy fulfillment:
Literal or symbolic?” section in this chapter.)
 Symbolism has to turn literal — at some point, anyway. Christians affirm
that God will eventually defeat evil once and for all and usher in a new
kingdom that Jesus will reign over forever. If so, then the battle of good
versus evil must have actual events play out at some point in history. Non-
idealists argue that the concluding chapters of Revelation must have at
least some literalness to them, no matter how figurative John’s writing
may appear to be.
What’s Your Angle? Evaluating 
the Four Approaches
As you examine each of the basic interpretations of Revelation, you can identify
several key questions:
 How consistent are these approaches with the way in which Old
Testament prophecy was fulfilled?
 How relevant was Revelation to the original readers? 
 How consistent are these approaches with John’s statements about the
timing of fulfillment?
 Was the persecution of the early Christians serious enough to justify the
position that the judgments have already been fulfilled?
We discuss these questions in this section. But first, Table 4-2 summarizes
the views that each approach has on the major sections of Revelation.

Prophecy fulfillment: Literal or symbolic?
One of the key debates about Revelation is the degree to which its prophe-
cies are meant literally. In other words, do the prophecies translate into
actual historical events? Or do they symbolize key themes that are taking
place throughout history?
The way in which the Bible addresses fulfillment of past prophecy can be a
valuable guide in determining how best to interpret Revelation. Scholars gen-
erally use four ways to describe how any particular prophecy was carried out
within documented biblical history:
 Real event, as told through a literal description: The prophecy
describes a real event that took place, and the biblical wording closely
matches the historical context. For example, several Old Testament pas-
sages offer precise descriptions of real events during Jesus’s life, such as
his birth in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2) and his ride on a donkey in front of
crowds of adoring people (Zechariah 9:9). So too, Zechariah 11:12–13
includes very specific details about the Judas’s betrayal of Jesus, 
prophesying that the price of betrayal will be 30 silver coins and that the
money will be used to buy a potter’s field. Matthew 27:6–9 says that’s
exactly what happened.
81
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

 Real event, as told through a plainly obvious figure of speech: The
prophecy describes a real event that took place in history but uses a
figure of speech; however, as you look back on history, the symbolism in
the passage is obvious. For example, Isaiah 53:5 prophesies Jesus’s cruci-
fixion: “But he was wounded [pierced] for our transgressions, crushed for
our iniquities.” Although Isaiah doesn’t specifically talk about crucifixion,
the symbolism indicates the manner of death that Jesus would suffer.
 Real event, as told through a symbolic description: A prophecy may
foretell a real event but use symbolic language that’s less obvious, par-
ticularly to the original hearers. For example, consider Jesus’s statement
in John 2:19: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
Jesus was referring not to the literal Temple in Jerusalem but to himself.
Looking back, the symbolism is obvious, though people at the time didn’t
think so. Or take Psalms 118:22: “The stone that the builders rejected has
become the chief cornerstone.” This passage is a clear reference to Jesus,
but it’s more allegorical in nature. Finally, the prophet Ezekiel wrote of angels
scattering coals over Jerusalem (Ezekiel 10:1–22), prophesying the
destruction of Jerusalem that took place shortly after that 
(2 Chronicles 36:11–15).
 Real spiritual theme, as told through a symbolic description: A final
category of prophecy is one that provides general themes but has no
direct ties to real events, places, or people in history. Some defending
the allegorical method would point to God’s promises of blessing to
Abraham and his descendents (as in Genesis 12:3) as illustrative of the
broad, cyclical nature of prophecy.
In general, prophecy that was fulfilled completely within the timeframe of the
Old and New Testaments forecasted real historical events that took place in
the world. However, the description of the prophecy varies — sometimes
very literal (Micah 5:2), sometimes highly figurative (Ezekiel 10:1–22), and
quite often, somewhere in between. This literal approach is, by the way, fully
consistent with the way in which Old Testament Scripture is used and quoted
within the New Testament.
Some prophecies span these categories, such as Isaiah 40:3, which combines
the first and second categories in describing John the Baptist: “A voice cries
out: ‘In the wilderness [literal description] prepare the way of the Lord, make
straight in the desert a highway for our God [figurative description].’”
Therefore, as you consider each of the major interpretations of Revelation,
keep these general trends from past prophecy in mind. For more information
on whether an interpretation is more literal or figurative, please see Figure 4-1
and the earlier sections on the individual theories.
82
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

Are we there yet? or, How soon is “soon”?
In Revelation, John seems to highlight the immediacy of the events that he’s
prophesying. John kicks off his book telling readers that these events “must
soon take place” (Rev. 1:1) and that “the time is near” (Rev. 1:3). John then
closes out the book in chapter 22 with not one, not two, but three statements
from Jesus saying, “I am coming soon” (Rev. 22:7, 22:12, 22:20).
These statements are like sweet music to the preterist ear. After all, a plain
reading of these verses is consistent with this interpretative approach, which
insists Revelation has already been fulfilled. The preterist is also eager to
jump on Revelation 22:10–11, where Jesus specifically instructs John that he
must not “seal up” the words of the prophecy, because “the time is near.”
Preterists contrast this passage to Daniel 12:9, in which God tells Daniel that
he must “seal up” his prophetic message because it wasn’t a message for his
lifetime. The preterist then reasons that if John’s message were for the
church thousands of years later, then Jesus would’ve told John to seal up his
prophetic words as well.
Although a preterist (and a historicist and idealist) can take those words of
imminence at face value, the futurist has to work harder:
 Futurists argue that soon is best translated in context as suddenly. In
other words, whenever Jesus does return, the event will happen
suddenly and immediately.
 They point out that in apocalyptic literature and biblical prophecy, time
is sometimes non-linear: The future is talked about in the present tense
and sometimes even in the past.
 They suggest that God’s concept of “soonness” is quite different from
people’s. The Apostle Peter makes this point in 2 Peter 3:8–9: “With the
Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one
day. The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some think of slowness.”
 Futurists hold up a logical argument that goes something like this: Jesus
says repeatedly that he is coming soon. However, Jesus has not yet
returned to earth. Therefore, soon has not yet occurred.
Who is John really writing to?
John identifies the audience of his letter as the seven churches in Asia.
However, depending on the approach you take, the actual relevance of the
prophecy to this group of people varies greatly.
83
Chapter 4: Choosing a Perspective for Understanding Revelation

If you subscribe to the preterist approach, then Revelation reads much like a
standard epistle — immediate, practical relevance to the target audience of
John’s day. As with other epistles — Romans or Hebrews, for example — 
relevance for later generations, including your own, begins with understand-
ing Revelation’s meaning to its original recipients.
However, if you take a futurist or historicist approach, then the bulk of
Revelation (4–22) becomes, in a practical sense, irrelevant to the original
audience. Consequently, Revelation is written, either partially or completely,
as a vehicle intended for a broader audience. As a comparison, consider John
F. Kennedy’s famous speech at Rice University in 1962. In this address,
Kennedy uttered the famous words, “We choose to go to the moon in this
decade,” in front of a crowd of thousands in Texas. But the speech was for
more than the people attending; it was meant for the entire nation. Kennedy
was simply using Rice as a venue for a broader purpose.
In addition, critics of the early rapture theory (believers’ being taken up to
heaven in Rev. 4:1) say such a timeline calls into question the very purpose of
the book in the first place. They reason that if the church is indeed raptured
at the start of Revelation 4, then the prophetic details of the entire
Tribulation period would be meaningful only to the unbelieving people “left
behind.” Pretribulationists (who believe that the rapture will occur before the
seven-year Tribulation) counter by saying that God will use the Tribulation
period to bring nonbelievers to faith. They add that the events of Revelation
19–22 (Second Coming of Jesus, Millennium, Last Judgment, and new heaven
and earth) are relevant to all Christians of any era, regardless of whether
they’re on the earth at the time that these events transpire.
Was first-century persecution 
really that bad?
One of the linchpin issues for the preterist position is the extent of persecu-
tion that the Christians in the Roman province of Asia were experiencing
from the Jews and pagans in the 60s CE. If there was considerable persecu-
tion, then this fact helps preterists in the claim that John, in his prophetic
judgments, is speaking of the fall of Jerusalem as a judgment on the Jewish
people. However, if the persecution of believers was nominal or limited, then
the preterist has a harder case to prove.
Overall, evidence of the extent of Jewish persecution of Christians seems to
be mixed and inconclusive. Although there’s ample proof that frequent perse-
cution of Christians by the Jewish leadership did occur in Jerusalem and
Judea, the extent to which that persecution spread beyond the home base of
Judaism, particularly into western Asia Minor, is unclear. The Acts of the
84
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

Apostles does chronicle Jewish leadership following Paul around and making
life difficult for him. It also talks about Jewish attempts to incite persecution
among the broader Gentile community. Preterists, in fact, are also quick to
point out that the word used in Revelation to refer to the Tribulation (thlipsis)
is the same word used in Acts (11:19, 14:22) and in 2 Thessalonians 1:4, 1:6.
On the flip side, critics note that the suffering that occurs in Revelation is far
beyond anything that occurred in the Acts timeframe. They also point out
that the New Testament records the fact that Paul regularly worshipped in
synagogues, implying that he was not persecuted as he did so. Further, they
argue that in spite of the Jewish dominance in Jerusalem, the Jews simply
didn’t have a strong influence across the empire.
Finding common ground
When history eventually plays out, one of the four main approaches to inter-
preting Revelation will, in fact, prove itself to have been the best. But until
that time, Christians believe they’re simply called to faithfully seek the truth
under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
Fortunately, the inspiration, authority, and trustworthy nature of the Bible
can remain intact while people identify with any of these four views. In other
words, Christians can agree to disagree. Justin Martyr offers a great example
of the right attitude regarding how one views Revelation. Though this second-
century church father held a premillennialist (futurist) view, he acknowl-
edged that genuine Christians thought differently.
These four approaches differ wildly on the specifics and details of the book
of Revelation and the events that it prophesies. However, futurists, preterists,
historicists, and idealists can all affirm that Revelation was written, first and
foremost, to encourage Christians to persevere during difficult times and to
remind them that, even through tough times, the church will persist until
Jesus returns.

In This Chapter
 Understanding why Revelation uses symbolism in the first place
 Surveying the major symbols that John uses in Revelation
T
he modern mindset is practical. After all, most people lead extremely
busy lives — so much so that when they want information on something,
they don’t want to have to jump through hoops. When it comes to the most
popular films of the year, for example, the box-office winners are usually ones
with a straightforward plotline. Films rich in symbolism, abstract concepts,
and vague imagery usually play only to a few diehards in the art houses.
Not surprisingly, then, people living in the twenty-first century often have 
difficulty in getting a handle on the symbolic nature of Revelation. The first
five books of the New Testament are in a clear narrative style as they depict
the ministry of Jesus and the early church. The next set of books — letters by
Paul, Peter, and other Apostles — are practical in nature, and you may very
easily see them as applicable to your life. But when you get to Revelation, its
symbolism can be a shock to the system.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the symbolism and imagery of the 
book of Revelation. We start off by telling you why John used apocalyptic
symbolism (and it really wasn’t because he was just being mean or coy!).
After that, we survey some of the major symbols you encounter in the book.
Giving John’s Readers a Heads-up
People today live in a world of disclaimers. Before you drink a hot cup of
coffee, your cup displays The beverage you are about to enjoy is extremely hot.
Or if you watch a full-screen DVD or video at home, you see the following
before the movie begins: This movie has been modified from its original 
version. It has been formatted to fit your screen.

In Revelation 1:1, John gives readers his own disclaimer — that the letter 
that they are about to read will contain symbolism. In the New King James
Version of the Bible, Revelation 1:1 begins, “The Revelation of Jesus Christ,
which God gave Him to show His servants — things which must shortly take
place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John [. . .]”
(emphasis ours).
People often used the Greek word semainein, translated as “signified” (or
“made it known” in the NRSV), when talking about Delphic oracles in ancient
Greece. Oracles were prophetic decrees revealed by a priest or priestess,
communicated through symbols. The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the
Old Testament) uses the same word in Daniel 2:45 when talking about the
interpretation of a symbolic dream.
In reading the word semainein, the original readers would’ve known right off
that John’s writing was going to define and convey truth through figurative or
imaginative pictures rather than through plain text. In other words, because
God “signified” the message, readers should expect God to communicate his
message through symbolism. This symbolism was not meant to obscure truth
but was simply the mode of communication chosen to convey it.
Given that principle, some commentators go even further in terms of 
how to interpret Revelation. They suggest that in spotting semainein, the
original readers would have known, as a general rule, to interpret Revelation
figuratively until it’s plainly obvious that they should do so literally.
Why Use Symbols?
The simple truth is that almost everyone today would’ve preferred for John
to be Captain Obvious, laying out the Revelation of Jesus in as clear a manner
as possible. Understanding the point of the book would be so much easier 
if specifics such as these were used:
 Jesus will be coming back on March 3, 2019. Be there or be square.
 Beware, the Antichrist will be named Gilligan. His cohort will be known
as the Skipper.
 The Millennium is a figurative term meant to represent the Super Bowl
halftime show.
In other words, instead of Scripture, almost everyone would prefer a glorified
legal document that lists out the complete facts of the last days. After all,
with such a document in hand, people wouldn’t need to wrestle with the
interpretations. If lawyers didn’t get involved interpreting the obvious, you’d
simply need to decide what to do with the information John presented in his
book. But we have what we have.
88
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

So why exactly did John write Revelation with a heavy dose of symbolism?
We examine several possible reasons in this section.
Following biblical tradition
Although Revelation may be best known for its use of symbolism, the reality
is that symbolism is present in many parts of the Old and New Testaments. 
In the Old Testament, God often speaks though the prophets in symbols. 
The books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Zechariah make heavy use of apocalyptic
imagery, a literary device that employs wild and rich symbolism to represent
historical events, nations, and persons.
Jesus may not have used common apocalyptic symbolism in the Gospels, 
but he did speak through parables, which are, in effect, symbolic stories
meant to define and illustrate truth. In Luke 8:10, he says, “To you it has been
given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others I speak in
parables, so that ‘looking they may not perceive, and listening they may not
understand.’” In other words, people who genuinely want to discover his
truth will do so, but those who do not will somehow miss out on what exactly
he’s trying to say.
Those words from Jesus become even more significant when you see the
message that Jesus gives to the seven churches in Revelation 2–3 at the end
of his personalized messages: “Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the
Spirit is saying to the churches.”
Adding greater meaning than plain text
You know the old saying a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, in the 
same way, symbolism and imagery can provide greater meaning to define
truth than plain words alone. Consider, for example, John’s use of the name
“Babylon” to describe a great evil power in Revelation. To any Jew, the mere
mention of Babylon would have dramatic and emotional significance given
the history of what the real-life ancient Babylon did to the Israelites in their
history. Therefore, the symbol of Babylon in Revelation had a much greater
impact on John’s original readers — Jew and gentile alike — than if John
would’ve left it as an unnamed demonic force.
With a twenty-first century Western mindset, symbolism is often considered 
a form of illustration. In other words, people have a truth or fact and then use
a symbol to illustrate or help to explain the concept. For example, consider
the truth that, according to the Bible, God sacrificed his son Jesus because
God loved the world. A Westerner may explain this by coming up with a story
about a father who makes the agonizing decision to let his son die while
stuck on the train tracks instead of killing everyone aboard the train by
derailing it.
89
Chapter 5: Deciphering Symbols with Your Secret Decoder Ring

However, from John’s mindset, this thinking is reversed. Instead, from a
Middle Eastern perspective, parables and symbolism actually define meaning
and truth; they don’t just illustrate truth. In other words, you can glean real
insight from discovering the details and essence of the story instead of just
trying to summarize the main point of it.
Getting people’s attention
The Old Testament prophets and Jesus himself often used symbolism and
parables to get the attention of their listeners. Even today, the use of symbol-
ism and imagery gets people’s attention more than straight text does. After
all, in a church sermon on Sunday morning, the congregation always seems
to pay more attention when the pastor or priest provides an illustration or
tells a story instead of delivering a straight sermon of bullet points.
Symbolism engages a reader’s head and heart. It forces readers to take an
image and interpret it by actively considering it in light of their knowledge
base and personal experiences. In the process, they make more mental 
connections and are more likely to remember the image and the message
behind it.
John’s imagery certainly adds shock value to get the churches out of 
complacency. For example, describing Babylon as the harlot or prostitute 
in Revelation 17 can provide a deeper impact than merely writing, “Babylon
represents something really bad you need to watch out for.”
Reinforcing unity
Symbolism works only if readers have the tools and experience to interpret
it. Thus, symbols can help bond the reader and writer and provide continuity
among stories.
Connecting the original readers
To the modern-day reader, John’s symbolism seems strange and foreign. After
all, the reader today is removed in several ways from people of the early
church — culture, language, knowledge of the popular literary genres of the
day, and so on. In fact, some scholars have compared the symbolism of the
modern political cartoon to that of Revelation. A political cartoon, after all,
makes little sense unless you understand the symbolism and issues being
poked fun of.
90
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

In contrast, believers in the churches of Asia Minor would’ve understood 
the symbolism because of their knowledge of both the Old Testament and 
the popular pagan myths of the day in the Roman Empire. To the original
readers, the symbolism was not a special “Bible code” for which you needed
special expert knowledge.
Tying the Old and New Testaments together
As Chapter 3 describes, the vast majority of symbols that John uses in
Revelation originally appeared in the Old Testament from prophets such as
Daniel and Ezekiel. Therefore, when you look at the symbols in the context 
of the entire Bible, then all of God’s prophecy and plans begin to make more
sense as one cohesive message across the pages of the Bible.
Keeping some secrets
The book may be called Revelation, but symbols provide enough ambiguity
to keep it from being a tell-all. Some level of mystery protected the original
readers and encouraged believers to continue to look to God for guidance.
Protecting the underlying message
When you look at the political and social context of most apocalyptic litera-
ture, you see that most of its authors wrote in times of turmoil and distress.
Regardless of whether John scribed Revelation during the 60s or 90s CE 
(see Chapter 2), he certainly wrote during a time of intense trouble and per-
secution. Therefore, he may have used symbolism to mask his message of
hope from potential persecutors. If that’s true, then those who really want 
to discover the truth will do so, but skeptics will never understand.
Encouraging continued reliance on God
Though commentators often fall into the trap of trying to circumvent this
fact, the ambiguity of symbolism prevents people from pinning God down 
on the exact details concerning the last days. After all, consider the major
interpretations of the book (see Chapter 4). Preterists read Revelation and
see its fulfillment as having already taken place in first century. Futurists 
look at the way the world is heading and see its fulfillment as happening in
the future. Idealists point to cycles of evil throughout history as proof of 
fulfillment. At the very least, this diversity of opinion should humble people
as they seek answers.
91
Chapter 5: Deciphering Symbols with Your Secret Decoder Ring

Understanding Common Interpretations
A newcomer to Revelation’s imagery may conclude that interpreting
Revelation is as easy to do as trying to learn to speak Kanji while you’re
gagged and blindfolded in a Turkish prison. In other words, pretty difficult
stuff! However, although some aspects are challenging and prone to different
interpretations (see Chapter 4), there are some common perspectives on
many of the symbols you encounter as you read through John’s book. Use 
the rest of this chapter to get a bird’s eye view, and then dive deeper into 
the symbolism in Part III.
Discovering the meaning 
of the major symbols
The Book of Revelation For Dummies is largely devoted to exploring the 
symbolism of Revelation. In fact, you can’t go a page or two in reading
Chapters 6–15 without coming across some discussion of John’s imagery.
However, to get you started, we provide a brief overview of many of the
major symbols in Revelation. Use Table 5-1 as your reference to where you
can find complete details on a particular symbol.
92
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 
Looking for answers
The language of Revelation is filled with sym-
bolism. John uses animals, countries, numbers,
lamps, stars, and much more to represent
people, places, spiritual events, and the like. In
general, you can place symbols into three
groups:
 Fully explained symbols: John explains
some of the symbols himself and uses a
consistent meaning throughout his text. For
example, the red dragon in Revelation 12:3
is clearly defined elsewhere in Revelation
12:9 and 20:2.
 Indirectly explained symbols: Others sym-
bols aren’t explicitly defined in Revelation,
but John relies on a reader’s Old Testament
knowledge to provide an understanding of
their meaning.
 Unexplained symbolism: A final group
doesn’t have any parallels in Scripture, and
John never explains the meaning.

The scroll
The opening verse of Revelation 5 begins by talking about a scroll: “Then 
I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the
inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.” The scroll proves to be 
anything but an ordinary document. It’s something like a last will and testa-
ment because the information revealed on the contents describes the 
eternal inheritance of those who believe in Jesus. But at the same time, it’s 
a message for God’s people right now.
93
Chapter 5: Deciphering Symbols with Your Secret Decoder Ring

The seals
In Revelation 6, the seven seals on the scroll are opened one at a time.
Therefore, the breaking of each seal is an event — a judgment — that takes
place before the reading of the scroll’s “last will and testament.”
Four horsemen of the Apocalypse
The breaking of the first four seals in Revelation 6 reveals four horses, known
collectively as the four horsemen of the Apocalypse; they’re differentiated in
part by their colors — white, red, black, and pale green:
 White horse: The rider on the white horse, equipped with a bow and
adorned with a crown, comes out to kick some booty. Some take this
rider to be Jesus himself, symbolizing the spread of the Christian gospel
across the world. Others contend the rider is the exact opposite — the
Antichrist, wearing the disguise of white but bent on destruction.
 Red horse: The rider on a red horse is clearly a bad dude, spreading 
violence and war wherever he goes.
 Black horse: The rider on the black horse symbolizes the famine and
starvation that occurs because of the economic inequality that exists
between the haves and the have-nots.
 Pale horse: The rider of the pale horse is none other than Clint
Eastwood. Okay, seriously, the pale rider symbolizes the death that 
follows in wake of the red and black horses.
The Day of the Lord
The Day of the Lord is a key term to understand when you look at Revelation
as well as the Old Testament prophets. It refers to judgment, the future 
time in which God “holds court” and passes judgment on the world. It’s also
94
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 
Super sevens and sadistic sixes
Within the Bible, the number seven shows up
nearly 400 times to symbolize completeness and
perfection. This number is important even in the
first two chapters of Genesis, where God cre-
ates the world in six days and then rests on the
seventh. Genesis 2:3 says, “So God blessed the
seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God
rested from all the work that he had done in cre-
ation.” The number seven appears over 50 times
in Revelation alone, referring to seven spirits,
churches, trumpets, bowls, seals, persons,
horns, eyes, thunders, plagues, and signs.
If the number seven is God’s number, then 
the number six symbolizes both humanity 
and human fallenness. The number six repre-
sents humankind’s incompleteness and imper-
fection — falling short of God’s perfect number
seven.

associated with the time in history in which God’s will for the world will be
fulfilled and complete. The term itself appears 19 times in the Old Testament
and 4 times in the other New Testament books. In Revelation, the Day of the
Lord is associated with Revelation 6:17 and 6:14. (See Chapter 9 for more on
the Day of the Lord.)
Silence in heaven
When the seventh seal is opened in Revelation 8, there’s silence in heaven 
for about half an hour. The silence is noteworthy because it signifies a point
of no return for the existing world — the old is passing away and the new is
beginning. John reveals the full details of that new world in Revelation 21.
So why 30 minutes? The jury’s still out on that one. Some believe that the
vagueness of the time “about half an hour” implies that the exact time can’t
be discerned from the text.
The trumpets
In Revelation 8, John tells of seven trumpets that are played by seven angels.
The trumpet was an important symbol in the history of God’s people. It was
used to direct and lead the Israelites during their desert wanderings as well
as during wartime battles. Not only was it a rallying call, but it was also a
reminder of God’s directing them and fighting on their behalf.
The trumpets in Revelation 8 signify the “amplification” of judgments in the
last days leading up to the Second Coming of Jesus; they serve as a reminder
that God is leading the fight.
Babylon
Babylon is a dominant military and political power in Old Testament history,
but it also appears in Revelation 14. Some believe that readers should take
this reference literally, holding that ancient Babylon will rise again in the
Middle East as a powerful force in the world and the seat of the Antichrist’s
power. Others see Babylon as symbolic of first-century Rome. Another 
view is that Babylon represents the capital of the Antichrist’s empire.
The bowls
Like the seals and trumpets that come before them, the seven bowls in
Revelation 16 symbolize a set of judgments on humankind during the last
days. The seven bowls represent the final, terrible, unprecedented stretch 
of activity just before the Second Coming of Jesus.
The Millennium
In Revelation, John speaks of a 1,000-year reign of Jesus, a timeframe 
that’s commonly referred to as the Millennium. Here are the traditional 
interpretations:
95
Chapter 5: Deciphering Symbols with Your Secret Decoder Ring

 Premillennialists believe that this is a literal 1,000-year period that will
take place following the Second Coming of Jesus. Many premillennialists
are also dispensationalists, who believe that human history is divided
into seven “dispensations” (eras), which are represented by the seven
churches of Revelation 2–3.
 Amillennialists believe the Millennium is purely figurative, referring to
the current church age or the reign of deceased saints with Jesus in
heaven (or perhaps both).
 Postmillennialists believe the Millennium occurs prior to the Second
Coming of Jesus; it’s an age in which the world will be transformed by
the gospel.
For details on these views, please see Chapter 13.
Assembling the cast of characters
Within Revelation, John provides a memorable cast of characters whose
imagery often overpowers the text and brings it to life. Here’s a brief look 
at some of the most significant figures.
The mystery man (“One like the Son of Man”)
Early on in Revelation 1, John talks of a vision he had in which a mysterious
person stands in the midst of seven lampstands. John describes him in 
vivid detail:
“[He was] clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his
chest. His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; 
his eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze,
refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.
In his right hand he held seven stars, and from his mouth came a sharp,
two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining with full force.”
(Rev. 1:13–16)
In this passage, John is speaking of Jesus. The description seems like a rather
scary picture of Jesus until you understand the symbolism:
 The robe and sash refer to the attire worn by Jewish high priests.
 The whiteness of his head and hair symbolizes either Jesus’s purity and
holiness or his wisdom and dignity.
 His fiery eyes depict divine omniscience (complete knowledge) and
judgment.
 His bronze-like feet contrast with the soiled feet of fallen humankind and
the pagan gods’ feet of clay.
96
Part II: Interpreting the Book of Revelation 

 His mighty voice symbolizes his sovereignty and power.
 The seven stars represent the angels of the seven churches (Rev. 1:11),
which are the chief focus of Revelation 2–3.
 The two-edged sword from his mouth symbolizes the lethal power and
penetration of the words of Jesus.
 The radiance of his face conveys his divine nature.

Scholars have several theories about the 24 elders in Revelation 5. Some 
see them as glorified people who represent the either the entire people of
God (Jews and gentiles) or else just the New Testament church (Christians).
Others believe they’re angelic choirs singing praises to God in heaven. A few
contend that John is referring to a 24-point star god of ancient Babylonian
mythology.
The mighty angel
The mighty angel in Revelation 10 is a source of debate. Some contend that
the mighty angel is Jesus because he’s described in terms usually associated
with God. Others counter, saying that nowhere else is Jesus depicted as an
angel. Instead, they suggest that this reference is talking about an archangel,
maybe even Gabriel. Archangels play an important role throughout 
biblical history.
The two witnesses
Revelation 11 introduces readers to “two witnesses” who will prophesy for
1,260 days while wearing sackcloth. John then refers to these two individuals
as “two olive trees” and “two lampstands.”
Some interpret the two witnesses as the ongoing witness of the church.
Others interpret the passage more literally and see them as two preachers
preaching to Jews in Jerusalem. Of course, exactly who that dynamic duo 
is leads to further debate. Some options include Zerubbabel and Joshua the
high priest, the Law and the Prophets, Peter and Paul, Israel and the church,
Enoch and Elijah, and Moses and Elijah.
The 144,000
The 144,000 in Revelation 7 has long been a subject of debate and resentment.
Some people believe that this group of people symbolizes all Christians.
Others think that this refers to Jewish Christians because the passage 
mentions the tribes of Israel. A final interpretation is that the 144,000 is an
elite group of Christians (perhaps martyrs) who have special status because
of their devotion.

Chapter 5: Deciphering Symbols with Your Secret Decoder Ring

Pregnant woman
John describes the pregnant woman in Revelation 12 as being “clothed 
with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of
twelve stars.” Once again, people have various perspectives on who exactly
this woman symbolizes. Some see her as the people of God since the very
beginning (ancient Israel and the church). A second view is that the imagery
is a Christianized version of ancient myths. A third view is that the pregnant
woman is Domitia, the mother of the Roman emperor Domitian’s son; he
declared her to be the “mother of God.” Some Catholics hold that the 
pregnant woman is the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus.
Red dragon
The symbolism of the pregnant woman in Revelation 12 is subject of much
discussion, but there’s little debate over the red dragon that’s menacing 
the woman. The red dragon, adorned with seven heads and ten horns, is
Satan himself.
The wings of a great eagle
When reading about the wings of a great eagle in Revelation 12, you may
wonder whether J.R.R. Tolkien picked up on this imagery when writing The
Lord of the Rings. Some see the creature as the same eagle referred to in
Revelation 8:13. If so, then John is talking about an angel providing protection
for faithful believers during the last days. Another take is that John is actually
speaking of a powerful kingdom that uses an eagle as a symbol.
The beast and his mark
In Revelation 13, John writes about two of the most intriguing symbols in all
the book: the beast and the mark of the beast. According to Revelation, the
beast, who is a false prophet, will require his followers to receive a number
stamped on their right hands or foreheads; the mark is required for surviving
in the world economy. That mark, says John in Revelation 13:18, is 666.
Many have long speculated on whether 666 is a literal number or a symbol
for something else. Some futurists have speculated that Social Security num-
bers, bar codes, microchip implants, or some other identification technology
is the mark of the beast. Others see 666 as pointing to an address, area code,
or the numeric value of a person’s name.
Since the early days, many have speculated on the identity of the beast, 
identifying him as Nero Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Hitler, as well as
modern leaders ranging from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton.
Most scholars do believe that the beast symbolizes an actual person.
However, they maintain that 666 is symbolic, especially because the number
six appears elsewhere in Scripture as a sign of imperfection and fallenness.

f you suffer a plane crash in the ocean and somehow survive to find your-
self stranded on a deserted island, the first thing you have to do is get your
bearings — that is, determine your situation. In a similar way, if you’re a first-
time reader of the book of Revelation (or even an infrequent visitor), the task
at hand is essentially the same: How do you make sense of this strange book?
In this chapter, we give you the lay of the land: what apocalyptic literature is,
who wrote the book of Revelation, to whom it was written, why it was written,
and basically what it says. These are all important questions that require an
adequate answer; otherwise, most of the book may fly right over your head.
Declassified! Releasing God’s Secrets 
in the Apocalyptic Press
John wrote the book of Revelation during the heyday of apocalypticism. This
rather obscure term speaks more of a mindset than of a specific literary
genre, though certain works in the period 200 BCE to 200 CE do share some
common literary traits.

Apocalypticism is primarily a view of reality. The Greek word apocalypsis
(from which we get the word apocalypse) denotes action: uncovering, unveil-
ing, disclosing, or revealing something previously hidden or secret. In short,
an apocalypse is a public disclosure of previously classified information. 
This section covers its essential features.
Touring God’s headquarters and 
giving away the ending
Apocalypses often include esoteric (secret) information about the workings
of the heavenly realms and how this influences the earthly realm. In biblical
literature, this information is conveyed to a well-known figure of Jewish 
tradition — or in the book of Revelation, a Christian — who is transported 
to heaven and given a heavenly tour. This person then writes down what’s
revealed and makes it accessible to a larger audience. An angelic guide often
explains the meaning of these visions. The Old Testament books of Ezekiel,
Daniel, and Zechariah also include apocalyptic sections involving angelic
informants (Ezekiel 40:3–4, 43:6–27; Daniel 7:15–28, 8:15–27, 10:10–21;
Zechariah 1:9–2:13, 4:1–6:15); in fact, the book of Revelation is indebted to
these Old Testament passages.
So what’s God’s big news? Apocalyptic works claim to inform the reader
about certain aspects of an eschatological drama. Eschatology is just a big
word for the study of the End Times or last days. The grand climax of this
drama is imminent — that is, it can happen at any moment. As the prologue
of Revelation explains, “The time is near” (1:3).
Choosing sides: Dualism
Apocalypticism takes seriously the notion that two absolute powers or 
principles operate in the universe. Such a view is called dualism, and it can
exist on several levels:
 Ethical (or moral): In this case, a fundamental split exists between good
and evil. In the book of Revelation, God himself is the ultimate source of
all that’s good; Satan and free moral agents who refuse to submit to God
are the ultimate source of evil. This kind of personal, ethical dualism
underlies the basic conflict in the book of Revelation.
 Visible and invisible: This kind of dualism acknowledges that there 
are two realities. The first is the realm that you can see, touch, and
handle — that is, the material world of creation, which is good. But
behind the visible is the realm of the invisible, where spiritual beings
like God, Satan, and angels of various ranks and orders, both good 
and bad, exist. Obviously, the book of Revelation assumes this kind of
dualism as true, as does historical Christianity.
102
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 Matter and spirit: In this kind of dualism, matter is associated with evil,
and spirit is connected with the good. A religious-philosophical move-
ment called Gnosticism advocated such a divide. This system, emerging
during the second half of the first century and appearing full blown in
the second, offered salvation and escape from the realm of the material,
which included the human body, and return to the realm of pure spirit
through secret knowledge (hence the name Gnosticism, deriving from
the Greek word gnosis, meaning “knowledge”). The book of Revelation
clearly doesn’t share this view.
Christian Gnostics even denied that Jesus, as the Son of God, truly
assumed human flesh. In his first epistle, John the Apostle vehemently
denounces this idea (see 1 John 2:18–29, 4:1–6). And in Revelation, 
John may be attacking an early form of Gnosticism in the messages to
Pergamum (2:14–15) and Thyatira (2:20–23), where false teachers are
encouraging compromise with Christian moral values. The connection
with Gnosticism is this: Many Gnostics held that what one did in the
body didn’t affect the spirit; consequently, they reveled in licentiousness
while believing themselves to be the elect people of God.
In short, the book of Revelation embraces two kinds of dualism: the ethical
and the visible/invisible.
Christian apocalyptic works assume a struggle for supremacy between 
Jesus and Satan. Human beings are caught right in the middle of this struggle
involving both visible and invisible powers. In other words, behind the 
imperial power of Rome lurk demonic forces opposed to the kingdom of 
God. Followers of Jesus (later identified as the Lamb) must make a choice;
divided loyalties and sitting on the fence aren’t options.
Note that the conflict is truly cosmic in scope. According to the Bible, no 
one and nothing is exempt or excluded. This struggle is cast in the form of a
drama consisting of several acts. Second Esdras and 2 Baruch, Jewish apoca-
lyptic works contemporary with the book of Revelation, have a similar drama
that unfolds in stages or acts (2 Esdras 5:21–6:34; 2 Baruch 53:1–74:4).
Being encouraged to stick with it
Apocalyptic writing generally has an exhortatory purpose. Exhortatory
derives from exhort, which essentially means “to encourage.” Biblical apoca-
lyptic literature is directed first and foremost to those who make a profession
of faith in God.
Christian apocalypses are distinguished from their Jewish counterparts by
their insistence that Jesus is the Messiah (the Anointed One) and that only 
he can redeem and restore a fallen world. Thus, the primary purpose of
Revelation is practical: to encourage the faithful to hold fast their commitment
to Jesus.
103
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)

In spite of its gloomy assessment and deep pessimism about the present
world, viewed as lying under the deadly influence of Satan, Revelation does
offer hope: Jesus will ultimately triumph. Therefore, Christian believers are
encouraged to cling tenaciously to their faith in Jesus and not defect to Satan.
Probing the Prologue (1:1–3)
The prologue (the opening section of a literary work) provides essential
information for understanding the meaning and structure of the book of
Revelation. The prologue wastes no time informing you what the book is 
all about:
“The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants
what must soon take place; he made it known by sending his angel to 
his servant John, who testified to the word of God and to the testimony 
of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.” (Rev. 1:1–2)
In this section, we briefly examine the essential information the Apostle John
conveys to his first-century readers.
Unveiling the good guy
Revelation is more than mere information: It’s a revelation of a person, Jesus.
It’s somewhat like the unveiling of an official portrait of the President of the

Getting the essential message
Every profession has its own lingo. If you’ve ever
hung out with computer geeks, you know that
when they get focused on some narrow techni-
cal subject, they almost sound like they’re speak-
ing a foreign language. They understand each
other because they’re insiders who know the
technical terminology. If you want to understand
what they’re talking about, you have to have one
of them translate the technical terms into
layman’s terms — more familiar concepts that
you can understand.
Much of the book of Revelation is “insider stuff”
directed specifically to those who are Christians
and who understand the language of faith that’s
unique to Christian experience. But given the
complexity of the metaphors and images, even
insiders have trouble fully understanding John’s
visionary book.
Still, anyone can grasp the basic message:
Jesus is going to return to earth, overthrow
Satan’s evil empire, reward his faithful followers,
punish those who reject his lordship, and create
a new heaven and new earth. Or as many put it,
Jesus wins.

United States or a comparable world figure. Typically, there’s a ceremony 
in which a select audience is invited to view the finished portrait for the 
first time.
The book of Revelation is a literary portrait of how Jesus appears in heaven
and during the End Times. The portrait consists of narrative and descriptive
brush strokes depicting a real person. In a sense, you, the reader, are invited
to view a newly commissioned portrait of Jesus. You watch as the drape
shrouding the canvas falls to the floor, and suddenly an imposing figure,
larger than life, directs his gaze right at you.
Checking out John’s sources
Deep Throat was the source of key information that brought down the Nixon
administration in the Watergate fiasco. For years, no one but the reporters
knew who Deep Throat was. But no such mystery surrounds Revelation;
according to Revelation’s writer, John, God himself is the source of the story.
That’s a pretty bold claim!
In Revelation, John doesn’t get a face-to-face interview with God the Father,
but the message comes through some pretty reliable channels. John makes
the following assertions:
 This unveiling is authorized by God and comes from Jesus himself.
 An unnamed angel serves as the mediating or revealing agent who 
oversees the delivery of the message (vision).
 John is the recipient and the recorder (writer) of the message
(prophecy).
 John receives this revelation (message) through a series of visions.
 John testifies that what is in the book is what he has seen. This implies
that John is charged with making its contents known to a wider audi-
ence. It’s not about a private religious experience having only individual
significance.
The prologue explicitly claims that what follows in the book is a trustworthy,
divine communication. Unless you have prior grounds for accepting this
book at face value (that is, you’re already a committed Christian), you’ll have
to suspend judgment on the question of the trustworthiness of the message
until you’ve examined the book in more detail and reflected on its implica-
tions. Our task, as your guides, is to help you assess what it says; you can
then decide whether you believe it’s true.
105
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)

Receiving blessings
Revelation promises a special blessing to those who read the prophecy aloud
(likely during Christian worship services) and to those who listen and put 
the lessons of its warnings and encouragements into practice (1:3). Reading
sacred texts aloud was the prevailing custom in the Ancient Near East as 
well as during the Greco-Roman period.
Those who read texts silently were sometimes thought to be under the 
influence of an evil spirit — their lips moved but there was no sound!
The blessing or benediction in Revelation 1:3 is the first of seven scattered
throughout the book (14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 22:14). Each offers encour-
agement and consolation for Christians who find themselves locked in the
struggle with evil. Of course, the number of benedictions is significant: Seven
in the Bible represents completeness and perfection. By the time you come 
to the seventh benediction, the End Times drama has run its course.
Saluting the Saints in Asia (1:4–6)
From 1:4–6, the book of Revelation conforms to conventional letter format of
the first century with but slight modification. Salutations typically consisted
of four pieces of information:
 The name(s) of the writer or writers
 The name(s) of the recipients
 The greeting
 A prayer of thanksgiving
We run through all four elements in this section.
From John with love: Revelation’s writer
Conservative critics make a good case that John, author of Revelation, 
is the Apostle John, one of the original 12 Apostles of Jesus (see Chapter 2).
According to church tradition, this John was a highly respected leader among
these churches; the Roman provincial government exiled him to the rocky
island of Patmos “because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus”
(Rev. 1:9).
106
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

John was a victim of government-sponsored religious persecution. This 
circumstance is important for understanding the message of the book of
Revelation. The Roman Empire was just beginning to manifest overt hostility
toward this rapidly growing phenomenon called Christianity. Prior to this, 
the Romans had maintained a fairly tolerant attitude.
To whom it may concern: The recipients
Revelation 1:4 reveals that the initial readers were members of Christian
house churches in the Roman province of Asia (in southwestern Turkey
today — see Chapter 2 for a map). A messenger whom they knew and
trusted, a fellow believer named John, wrote the scroll containing what’s 
now called the book of Revelation (Rev. 1:9). Both John and the readers
shared commitments to the person of Jesus and his teachings and also 
a common worldview.
Heaven says hello: Passing on the greeting
The greeting “grace to you and peace” reflects a standard Christian greeting.
What’s unusual about this greeting is that it comes not from the author 
initially designated — namely, John — but from three heavenly beings or 
entities. Here they are now.
107
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)
The changing tide of persecution
The Romans viewed the early Jesus movement
as one of the sects of Judaism (Pharisees,
Sadducees, Essenes). Because imperial Rome
recognized Judaism as a sanctioned religion,
Jews and Christians were free to practice their
religion so long as they were loyal to the empire.
Some eastern religious sects were not so rec-
ognized and were repressed. What changed for
early Christians were two seismic events:
 The fire in Rome in 64 CE: In order to escape
the (probably true) accusations that Nero
himself had ordered the burning, the
emperor accused Christians of setting the
fire. Needing a scapegoat, Nero unleashed
a brief but violent campaign against
Christians in Rome, killing hundreds.
 The Jewish revolt against Rome in 66–74
CE: Because Christianity had Jewish roots,
was considered a sect of Judaism, and fea-
tured leading figures who were Jewish
(Jesus himself), the Jewish revolt against
Rome necessarily brought Christians again
under suspicion. After the revolt, Rome
viewed Christianity as a religion distinct
from Judaism.
However, not until Domitian’s reign (81–96 CE),
when loyal citizens were expected to participate
in emperor worship (especially in the province
of Asia), did a more hostile attitude toward
Christians begin to appear.

God
Revelation’s greeting first comes from “him who is and who was and who is
to come.” This is a title for God, stressing his eternal and self-existent nature.
The title is similar to how God describes himself to Moses in the book of
Exodus. There, as Moses encounters God through a burning bush in the Sinai
desert, God reveals his special name: “I AM WHO I AM” (Exodus 3:14).
Seven spirits
Revelation’s greeting also comes from “the seven spirits who are before the
throne of God.” Later in chapters 4 and 5, the throne room scene, these seven
spirits function as worshipers around the throne and as messengers sent out
into the world to do God’s bidding. We tentatively identify these seven spirits
as the seven archangels of Jewish tradition (1 Enoch 20:1–8; Tobit 12:15; 2
Esdras 4:1; and Daniel 10:13; for a further discussion of these beings, see
Chapter 8).
However, the seven spirits may be an expression denoting the one Holy 
Spirit because the number seven in apocalyptic literature often conveys the
idea of perfection. However, this view is problematic because the next person
mentioned is Jesus. Generally, the members of the Trinity are always listed 
as God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In no other instance 
in the New Testament are the members of the Trinity listed in this order (for
instance, see Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14). We think this point tips
the scales against the seven spirits representing the Holy Spirit.
Jesus
Finally, the greeting comes from “Jesus, the faithful witness, the firstborn 
of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.” Each title for Jesus is 
a window into the message of this book and resonates with hope for the
Christians of Asia Minor:
 Faithful witness: The Greek word rendered “witness” is martys, from
which we get the English word martyr. John’s Gospel emphasizes the
role of Jesus as a witness to God’s saving intentions. Through Jesus, 
God intends that all should have an opportunity to become children of
God (John 1:12–13).
John is noting that in Jesus’s earthly ministry, he demonstrated his
unflinching commitment at the cross, and he now serves as a role 
model for the Asian Christians. They, too, must render their witness to
Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross, even if it means dying on one themselves.
Christians must be clear about this: They can’t compromise with 
Rome’s religious system, featuring the divine Caesar.
 Firstborn of the dead: This title follows hard on the heels of the former.
According to the Bible, here lies the hope of all who commit to the 
cross: Beyond death awaits a resurrection of the body, just like Jesus’s
108
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

rising from the dead. Throughout Revelation, John repeatedly reminds
his readers about this hope. It’ll provide backbone for the perilous 
days ahead.
 Ruler of the kings of the earth: Talk about being countercultural! This
title flies directly in the face of the Roman imperial cult with its claims
about the divine Caesar and Roma (the Latin name for Rome). John’s
work portrays the truth as presented in the Bible: All glory and domin-
ion belong to the rightful king (Jesus) — all the more reason for the
faithful to remain steadfast.
Singing Jesus’s praises: Doxology
In place of a prayer of thanksgiving or a prayer for the welfare of his readers,
John substitutes a doxology (a hymn or prayer of praise) offering up praise 
to the central character in the book of Revelation: “To him who loves us and
freed us from our sins by his blood, and made us to be a kingdom, priests
serving his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever.
Amen” (Rev. 1:5–6).
This doxology focuses on the biblical claim of Jesus’s unique, saving work 
in the divine plan of salvation: He is the redeemer. As the redeemer, he
accomplishes two essential actions:
 Jesus overcomes sin. This idea presupposes that apart from Jesus’s
intervention, no one can overcome the deadly effects of sin. The New
Testament views sin as a master having complete control over the life 
of a person outside of Jesus (John 8:34; Romans 6:5–14).
 Jesus ordains believers as priests. As priests, Christians serve God in
worship. A priest in biblical thought is one who mediates the blessings 
of God to others and who intercedes for the needs of the believing com-
munity. According to the New Testament, all believers are considered 
priests and have the privilege of exercising priestly ministry — consisting
of prayers of praise, thanksgiving, and intercession (Ephesians 1:3–14;
Hebrews 13:15; 1 Peter 2:5–9). Christian liturgy, then, is an indispensable
part of what it means to be in the kingdom of God.
The word liturgy derives from two Greek words, le_s/laos, (“people”) and
ergon (“work”). Thus, liturgy is the work that the people of God perform
in his presence. Central to Christian liturgy is Communion, also known 
as the Eucharist or Lord’s Supper, in which Jesus’s death on behalf of his
people is tangibly remembered and made present. The sacrifice of Jesus
on the cross is the very heart of Christian worship.
Don’t miss the two things attributed to Jesus in this doxology: glory and
dominion. This is an implied rebuttal of the claims that imperial Rome made
through its elaborate symbolism, rituals, and outward pomp.
109
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)

Sounding the Theme (1:7–8)
In Revelation 1:7, John suddenly departs from the typical first-century 
letter-writing style (see “Saluting the Saints in Asia [1:4–6]”) and blurts out 
a startling pronouncement: “Look! He is coming with the clouds; every eye
will see him, even those who pierced him; and on his account all the tribes 
of the earth will wail. So it is to be. Amen.”
John’s exuberant utterance is both the theme and the conclusion of
Revelation, and it combines two Old Testament passages, Daniel 7:13 and
Zechariah 12:10–12. Both texts, in their respective contexts, describe the 
dramatic appearance of a figure whose sudden arrival on earth not only
alters history but completes history. John apparently views the “one like a
human being coming with the clouds of heaven” in Daniel 7:13 and the “one
whom they have pierced” of Zechariah 12:10 as references to Jesus.
John’s announcement affirms or implies the following:
 Jesus’s return to earth is a highly visible, public event that will be seen
worldwide. Revelation 19 adds more details to this unprecedented event.
 Jesus’s return to earth has relevance and importance for all people
living at that time.
 Jesus’s return to earth is, according to the Bible, certain. John adds 
his Amen — “may it be so” — to this confident pronouncement. This
announcement that Jesus is coming back frames the entire book: 
Three times in chapter 22, Jesus himself proclaims, “I am coming soon!”
(Rev. 22:7, 22:12, 22:20).
As if to further underscore the certainty of Jesus’s return, God now adds his
imprimatur (approval): “‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’ says the Lord God,
who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty” (Rev. 1:8).
Only two times in the book of Revelation does God speak: in Revelation 1:8
and in 21:5–6. In both instances, the point is that he is sovereign over all that
is; all of history unfolds under his all-wise and holy counsel. This idea recurs
throughout the entire book.
Initiating the Visions (1:9–11)
In typical letters of the first century, after the salutation, greeting, and thanks-
giving, the author transitions to the body of the letter. In a way, that’s how
Revelation 1:9–11 functions: It introduces the main subjects of the rest of the
110
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

letter; however, the letter format falls away and the document assumes the
shape of a typical apocalyptic writing, in which John recounts a series of
visions, unpacking the central theme of Jesus’s return to earth. (For more 
on apocalyptic writing, see the earlier section titled “Declassified! Releasing
God’s Secrets in the Apocalyptic Press.”)
John briefly recounts the circumstances and occasion on which he received
the first of several (perhaps a total of seven) visions. We call the vision in
chapter 1 the initiating vision. Here are the salient features of John’s first
visionary experience.
John’s location
John receives his vision on Patmos, an isolated, rocky island about 35 
miles offshore from Miletus, on the mainland of Asia Minor (southwestern
Turkey — see Chapter 2 for a map). The island itself is approximately 6 miles
wide and 10 miles long. More importantly, it was not, in the first century, a
luxurious resort or vacation paradise! It served as a place of banishment for 
political prisoners and other persons deemed to be agitators.
The significance of John’s self-ID
John’s self-identification carries special meaning for his readers. He’s a
Christian brother who shares with them three realities:
 He shares the persecution that goes with being a follower of Jesus.
 He shares what it means to be in the kingdom. The kingdom refers to 
the present, invisible, spiritual reign of Jesus over his church. Christians
believe it’ll be succeeded by Jesus’s future, visible reign in glory over all
creation at his Second Coming.
 John shares the patient endurance of Jesus. Disciples of Jesus must be
prepared to endure suffering for the sake of the gospel. John serves as 
a positive role model in this regard.
Persecution comes with the territory for those who decide to follow Jesus.
Jesus was well aware of this and repeatedly warned listeners to count the cost
carefully. In John’s Gospel, Jesus issues this warning: “If they persecuted me,
they will persecute you” (John 15:20; see also Matthew 5:10–12). The Apostle
Paul likewise warns the new converts at Thessalonica: “In fact, when we were
with you, we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution; so it
turned out, as you know” (1 Thessalonians 3:4).
111
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)

Occasion
John simply states, “I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day [. . .]” (Rev. 1:10).
The expression in the spirit refers to a state of religious exaltation and
ecstasy, somewhat like being in a trance. The individual experiences what
psychologists would label as a heightened or altered state of consciousness.
This condition has a long history, with notable examples occurring among
the Old Testament prophets. Exceptional in this regard was the sixth-century
prophet Ezekiel. Several times in his book, he narrates extraordinary, spiri-
tual experiences that involve clairvoyance and levitation (see Ezekiel 1–11).
The Apocalypse of John shows many instances of indebtedness to Ezekiel for
imagery, symbols, and concepts.
John says the vision occurred on “the Lord’s day.” This is the earliest docu-
mented instance of this expression being used for Sunday, the day set aside
by Christians for worship and rest. We know from the Gospels that Jesus 
rose from the dead on a Sunday following the Jewish Passover (Mark 16:2;
Matthew 28:1; Luke 24:1). Not surprisingly, this day of the week held special
significance for Christians and was the occasion for their coming together 
to celebrate the Lord’s Supper and the resurrection (Acts 20:7, 20:11; 1
Corinthians 16:2).
Angelic orders
After announcing he was “in the spirit,” John explains what really got his
attention that day: “[. . .] and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
saying, ‘Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches, to
Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, 
and to Laodicea’” (Rev. 1:10b–11).
John gets a jolt! Like a trumpet, a heavenly voice blares out a commission: 
He needs to write down what he’s about to see. The book must go to seven
churches, all located in the Roman province of Asia.
Such a scenario seems surreal to most people in the modern world, but it
wouldn’t have seemed so to John. He would’ve viewed himself as being in a
succession of prophets for whom divine revelation was a real possibility. 
The Bible shows that the God of Israel has a long track record of bursting into
people’s lives — whether they’re ready or not — and commissioning them to
serve as his ambassadors. Several such commissioning scenes occur in the
Old Testament.
Just when John the Apostle’s ministry seems to be over, owing to circum-
stances beyond his control, the Lord intervenes and commissions him for
another assignment. And although John probably didn’t realize it at the time,
112
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

the book of Revelation turns out to be the culmination of God’s self-revelation
in Scripture; it concludes the canon (the inspired and authoritative collection
of books making up the Bible). Not bad for a 90+-year-old man!
Seeing the First and the Last (1:12–18)
The second half of Revelation 1 falls into two sections: In verses 12–16, you
discover what John saw when he turned around to look in the direction from
which the voice came; in verses 17–20, you read about John’s reaction to
what he saw and his consequent commission by the risen Jesus.
These two moments contain the main outline of the book, and they structure
the visions that follow in chapters 2–22. This first vision is like a table of con-
tents. It also provides some essential information enabling readers to decode
the symbols that occur in the visions of chapters 2–3. In short, John hands
you a master key that unlocks the coded apocalyptic language.
Standing among seven menorahs
When John turns around in Revelation 1:12, the first things catching his eye
are seven golden lampstands. These are not candlesticks, as the King James
Version of the Bible has it, but seven-branched lampstands, called menorahs
in later Jewish tradition, like those used in the Tabernacle and Temple
(Exodus 37:17–24; 1 Kings 7:49). Each menorah consists of seven branches
capped with a small bowl that contains olive oil for fuel. The center bowl 
is the reservoir for the other six, and a wick rests in each bowl, providing 
illumination when lit.
However, John’s attention is quickly riveted to a much more imposing 
presence — a person.
The human-like figure — Son of God, Son of Man
Standing among the seven lampstands is “one like the Son of Man” (Rev.1:13).
The description echoes Daniel’s vision of a human-like figure arriving on 
the clouds of heaven and assuming dominion over an everlasting kingdom
(Daniel 7:13–14); this “one like a human being” accepts worship and directly
approaches the throne of God. But although he possesses the attributes and
rights of God, he also appears very human.
Mystery surrounds this person because he remains unnamed in the book of
Daniel. Some Jews in the first century identified this figure as the promised
Messiah; you can see this, for example, in a work called the Similitudes of
Enoch, which probably predates the writing of Revelation.
113
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)

In Revelation, using descriptive language clearly evocative of Daniel, John
identifies this mysterious person as Jesus. Similarly, in John’s Gospel, Jesus
calls himself the Son of Man: He tells an audience in Jerusalem, “For just as
the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in
himself; and he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he 
is the Son of Man” (John 5:26–27). The title Son of Man becomes almost 
synonymous with Son of God in this context.
Understanding the Son’s appearance
The Old Testament prophets Ezekiel, Daniel, Isaiah, and Zechariah provide
important background material for Revelation. John frequently borrows and
reworks ideas and themes from these books. Each feature of the wardrobe
and appearance of the “one like the Son of Man” (see Rev. 1:13–16) calls for
comment:
 “Clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest”:
High priests in the Jewish Tabernacle and Temple wear this item
(Exodus 28:4; 29:5). As John has already stated (Rev. l:5) and makes
abundantly clear throughout the book, Jesus offers up his own blood 
as a sacrifice for sins. He is both priest and sacrifice.
 “His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow”:
The color white is often symbolic of purity and holiness. White hair and
a white beard often represent wisdom and dignity. In Daniel 7:9, these
characteristics describe the “Ancient of Days,” or God. By applying this
description to Jesus, John affirms that Jesus is part of the Godhead
(which also includes God the Father and the Holy Spirit).
 “His eyes were like a flame of fire”: This is a symbol of divine omni-
science and judgment. Jesus knows the hearts and minds of all; his gaze
penetrates into the deepest darkness. Human beings are an open book
before this judge.
 “His feet were like burnished bronze”: The high priests of ancient
Israel served barefoot in the Tabernacle and Temple. Jesus’s feet shine
like highly polished bronze, contrasting with the soiled feet of mere
human priests; this probably points to the divine and sinless character
of Jesus (see Hebrews 7:26–28). The imagery may also imply strength.
 “His voice was like the sound of many waters”: This feature emphasizes
the sovereignty and power of Jesus. Like the waves crashing against the
rocky cliffs of Patmos, Jesus’s voice booms out across the universe.
 “In his right hand he held seven stars”: John unpacks this symbol in
1:20, so we postpone comment until the section “Decoding the mystery.”
 “From his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword”: This image makes 
a statement about the power and penetration of Jesus’s words. The
double-edged sword was well-known to John’s audience as the gladius, 
114
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

a short sword only a couple feet in length and standard issue for Roman
legionnaires. It was especially lethal in close, hand-to-hand fighting.
Jesus’s words, then, effectively accomplish his purposes (Isaiah 49:2,
55:11; Hebrews 4:12).
 “His face was like the sun shining with full force”: John couldn’t fail 
to recognize who this Son of Man was. He had seen him before. The 
synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) all narrate an extraordinary
moment called the Transfiguration, when three disciples, including 
John, see the earthly Jesus begin to radiate with glory. It happens on an
unnamed “high mountain” in Galilee (Matthew 17:1). For a brief moment,
Peter, James, and John see the divine nature of Jesus of Nazareth
unveiled:
“And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like 
the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly there
appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. [. . .] Suddenly
a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice
said, ‘This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen
to him!’” (Matthew 9:2–4, 7)
The similarities between the Transfiguration and what John now sees
are stunning.
Meeting Jesus face to face
Have you ever met someone really famous whom you admired a great deal?
Did you stutter a bit when trying to talk? Did your palms sweat? Did you 
feel mildly faint? Did your brain shut down, just a bit overwhelmed by the
emotion of the event? Well, just imagine meeting the Man Upstairs face to
face! The Bible records several instances of human encounters with God:
 Abraham, on the night the Lord makes a covenant with him (Genesis
15:12)
 Moses, when the glory of the Lord passes before him on Mount Sinai
(Exodus 34:8)
 Joshua, before the captain of the Lord’s army at Jericho (Joshua 5:14–15)
 Isaiah, when he sees “the King, the Lord of hosts” on his throne 
(Isaiah 6:5)
 Ezekiel, when he sees the mobile throne chariot of God (Ezekiel 1:28)
 The three Apostles Peter, James, and John on the mount of
Transfiguration (Mark 9:6)
115
Chapter 6: Setting Up the Scope of the Book (1:1–20)

John’s reaction to the presence of Jesus is typical of all who experience a 
personal theophany, or appearance of God: John falls before the feet of Jesus
“as though dead” (Rev. 1:17).
Reassuring Jesus’s servant
Jesus’s reaction to John’s collapse is reassuring. He places his right hand 
on him, probably his shoulder. The right hand in biblical thought is a symbol
and sign of power. By placing his right hand on John, Jesus assures him of
acceptance and favor.
The gesture is followed by verbal assurance: “Do not be afraid” (Rev. 1:17).
Several times, when John the Apostle was a young man, he heard Jesus say
these words. The last time was shortly before the crucifixion. Jesus had 
just informed his disciples that he was leaving them and returning to God 
the Father. In response to their anxiety, Jesus twice reassured and consoled
them: “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me.
[. . .] Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid” (John
14:1, 14:27). And now in Revelation, John the Apostle, in his old age, once
again hears these soothing words spoken by a familiar voice.
Seeing who holds the keys
After telling John not to be afraid, Jesus identifies himself as “the first and
last, and the living one. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever; and 
I have the keys of Death and Hades” (Rev. 1:17–18). The titles Jesus uses 
for himself are divine titles, the very things that define who God is: the 
self-existent one, the one who is the source of life itself.
The risen Jesus of the book of Revelation is Lord of life and death, his author-
ity represented by holding the keys. This is really good news for believers
because Jesus promises to raise up (resurrect) all who believe in him at the
last day (John 5:24–29).
The message of Jesus’s triumph over death is a theme that recurs again and
again throughout the book of Revelation. Watch for it.
Charting the Course (1:19–20)
The brief section in Revelation 1:19–20 is valuable because it lays out the main
sections of the book of Revelation. This occurs within a commissioning scene
reminiscent of the Old Testament prophets (Isaiah 8:1; Jeremiah 30:2; 36:2;
Ezekiel 43:11; Habakkuk 2:2). Jesus also gives John an interpretive key for
understanding the next major section of the book (chapters 2–3). Read on.
116
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Getting a commission to write
The one like the Son of Man tells John, “Now write what you have seen, what
is, and what is to take place after this” (1:19). This sentence serves as a table
of contents for the rest of the book of Revelation. Notice how it falls into the
following three sections:
 What you have seen: This sums up the initiating vision of Jesus granted
to John on the island of Patmos, now viewed as a past event (1:9–18).
 What is: The next two chapters consist of seven prophetic messages
directed to seven house churches located in the Roman province of 
Asia (2:1–22).
 What is to take place after this: The this refers to what was actually hap-
pening in the seven house churches. Beginning at chapter 4, however,
John describes his visions of what happens “after this.” He is caught up
to the heavenly throne room, where he sees Jesus enthroned at the right
hand of God the Father. From the throne, Jesus directs the course of 
history to its grand finale. Everything unfolds in accordance with God’s
will, symbolized by a scroll of destiny. Revelation 4–19, therefore, by
means of a series of visionary experiences, carries the action forward
from John’s day at the end of the first century until the triumphant
return of Jesus at some unspecified time in the future (19:11–16).
Decoding the mystery of the stars
In Revelation 1:20, Jesus explains to John the mystery of the seven stars in
his hand: They are “the angels of the seven churches.” As for the seven lamp-
stands, they represent the seven churches of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, already mentioned in 1:11. The
equation of the lampstands as churches seems fairly straightforward. The
seven angels are most likely literal angelic beings in God’s service on behalf
of the churches (see more in Chapter 8).

In This Chapter

G
etting mail has always been popular — even in the first century. In 
fact, one of the notable achievements of the Roman Empire was the
establishment of safe roads over which imperial couriers delivered official
letters. Because FedEx and UPS didn’t exist yet, travelers and messengers
hand-carried personal mail.
After John finished writing the book of Revelation, he sent it to seven
churches in the Roman province of Asia, located in what’s now western
Turkey. As soon as they began reading, these churches would’ve immediately
understood the unusual nature of their mail: It contained seven heavenly
messages from Jesus himself, delivered through John.
Jesus addresses these congregations in a stern but compassionate manner.
Much is expected of them, but much is promised for those who persevere.
They’re under enormous pressure to abandon their exclusive commitment to
Jesus as Lord and to compromise his high moral standards. In many respects,
these seven messages embody the primary purpose of the entire book: to
exhort believers to be faithful till the end, even at the cost of their lives.
In this chapter, you explore the content of the seven letters in Revelation 2–3
and gain an increased awareness of the difficulties facing early Christians
living in the Greco-Roman world. You also appreciate how each letter is
specifically composed for the congregation it addresses, while at the same
time addressing all the churches. Readers also get occasional glimpses into
the historical background of the cities in which these house churches were
located. Finally, you discover some of the foundational beliefs and behaviors
of early Christians.

The Symmetry of the Messages
Peeking into Revelation 2–3, one question that immediately comes up is
whether these individual messages are really letters. After all, they don’t
actually follow the typical letter format as seen in the Apostle Paul’s New
Testament letters and other letters of that era. The closest parallel seems 
to be prophetic letters and oracles (divine messages typically delivered 
to human beings through prophets), such as those in the Old Testament 
(2 Chronicles 21:12–15 and Jeremiah 29). In fact, Amos 1–2, with its seven
stereotyped judgment oracles, provides the most striking comparison —
underscoring the prophetic nature of the book of Revelation. As a result, 
the best label for these seven letters may be messages.
Before diving into the content of the messages, you need to be aware of their
structure and pattern. Here’s why the organization is significant:
 Most members of these house churches couldn’t read — some authori-
ties estimate that only about 15 percent of the members of a given con-
gregation were capable of doing so. The arrangement of each message
falls into a stereotyped pattern consisting of the same basic components,
serving as a memory aid to listeners.
 Carefully structured messages reflect a characteristic of prophetic
speech. This confirms John’s claim that his work is “prophecy” (1:3).
 Structuring and patterning also occur regularly in the teaching of Jesus
in the Gospels. A quick reading of the Sermon on the Mount displays 
this feature as well (Matthew 5–7).
In the following sections, we draw attention to this structure.
Surveying the structure of each letter
The basic structure of each message is as follows:
 Charge to write: “To the angel of the church in [. . .] write:”
 Identification of sender: “These are the words of [. . .]”
 Commendation or condemnation: “I know [. . .]”
 Pastoral admonition: “Remember [. . .], Do not fear [. . .], Repent [. . .
and so on]”
 Pastoral exhortation: “Let everyone who has an ear listen [. . .]”
 Promise: “To everyone who conquers [. . .]”
120
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The only deviation from this outline occurs with the last two items; in the last
four messages, the positions of the exhortation and promise are reversed.
However, the deviations probably aren’t significant; they simply reflect the
universal desire of authors for some artistic variation!
Yet despite the similar structure, each message is tailor-made for a given
church. Here are three features of the messages that call for special comment:
 All the messages identify and describe Jesus as the sender, but their
descriptions, though based on the initiating vision of Jesus (1:12–16 —
see Chapter 6), vary for each individual church. For example, the mes-
sage to the church at Smyrna identifies Jesus as “the first and the last,
who was dead and came to life” (2:8). Given that the believers at Smyrna
were about to undergo severe persecution (2:10), they especially needed
a reminder of Jesus’s power over death.
 The pastoral admonitions in the messages are directed at unique situa-
tions that exist in each church. Jesus offers encouragement and rebuke
as needed.
 The promise to each individual church varies, but all the promises 
point to the same reality: everlasting life. In Smyrna, for example, Jesus
promises that the “second death” will not harm them, which is highly
appropriate for their circumstances (2:11).
Although each message is tailor-made for a specific church, its audience isn’t
limited to that church. On the contrary, the messages are clearly intended 
for all seven churches because each letter concludes with a summons to 
hear what Jesus is saying to the churches in plural (2:7, 2:11, 2:17, 2:29, 3:6,
3:13, 3:22).
121
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)
Bridging the chapters
John didn’t write the book of Revelation in chap-
ter and verse — that organization came later.
However, chapters 2 and 3 do have a unique
structure, which sets them apart from chapter 1
and kind of provides a natural break. In
Revelation 1:20, Jesus decodes the meaning of
two primary symbols in chapters 2–3 and pre-
pares the audience for the ideas that lie ahead:
“As for the mystery of the seven stars that you
saw in my right hand, and the seven golden
lampstands:
 “[T]he seven stars are the angels of the
seven churches,
 “[A]nd the seven lampstands are the seven
churches.”
Jesus, in the midst of the lampstands, sends a
message loud and clear: He’s present in the lives
of believers, both individually and combined, and
he’s completely aware of what’s happening on
the ground.

Considering the order of the messages
On top of each message’s basic structure, readers can find an additional 
pattern that’s based on the relative spiritual condition of each church:
 Churches 1 and 7 (Ephesus and Laodicea) are in grave peril.
 Churches 2 and 6 (Smyrna and Philadelphia) are the only ones not 
censured for some shortcoming.
 Churches 3, 4, and 5 (Pergamum, Thyatira, and Sardis) are okay but 
not great.
This pattern forms a chiasm, a literary device in which parallel ideas or lines
of text conform to an half of an X-like pattern: A-B-C-B'-A':
A Ephesus (2:1–7)
B Smyrna (2:8–11)
C Pergamum (2:12–17)
C Thyatira (2:18–29)
C Sardis (3:1–6)
B' Philadelphia (3:7–13)
A' Laodicea (3:14–22)
Ephesus and Laodicea are the A and A' elements, Smyrna and Philadelphia
are the B and B', and Pergamum, Thyatira, and Sardis correspond to C. 
This pattern draws attention to the dire need for repentance at Ephesus 
and Laodicea.
Of course, a glance at a map (see Chapter 2) can clarify an important relation-
ship among the cities: They’re all linked by road to Ephesus, the leading city
of the province. Perhaps, then, the order of the seven churches in Revelation
follows the order of mail delivery in the first century!
Asking about the Audience
Audience is important. After all, when you have something to say, the details
you reveal, the support you provide, and the language you use is likely to
vary, depending on whether you’re chatting with your boss, your great aunt,
or the buddies you’ve known since the sandbox. So for Revelation, the 
question remains: Who is the audience, and are they real or symbolic? Here’s
what scholars say.
122
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Angels: Postmen or guardians?
Here’s one question you may ask yourself when you read these passages to
the seven churches: Just who in the world are these angels that Jesus is 
referring to when he addresses each letter “to the angel of the church in x”?
You may not have seen any of those sorts of creatures hanging around your
church. The question is complicated by the fact that the Greek word angelos
(translated “angel”) conveys the idea of a messenger or one sent, but it also
has several nuances. Scholars have offered four main explanations. An angel
may be
 The deliverer of the message: If this is John’s meaning, perhaps he’s
referring to the person who actually delivered the letter — the postman,
so to speak. However, the problem with this explanation is that the angel
is the recipient of the message, not the deliverer. Furthermore, the word
angel occurs 67 times in the book and, in every other instance outside
chapters 2–3, it refers to an angelic being of some kind.
 A pastor of the church: A second explanation is that the angelos is the
pastor of the church. The basic problem with this suggestion is that
nowhere in the New Testament, or Christian literature outside the New
Testament, does the word angel refer to a pastor, bishop, or any other
human office-holder in the church.
 The spiritual attitude of the church: Some scholars tweak the transla-
tion by saying the angel typifies the “spirit” or “attitude” of the church 
in question.
 A guardian angel: The best explanation may be to take John at face
value. But is this credible? Do churches have guardian angels? As strange
as it may sound, that may just be what John intends. After all, in a few
passages, the Bible does speak about angels who assume the role of
guardians (Matthew 4:6, 4:11, 18:10, 26:53; Luke 15:10; Acts 5:19, 12:7–15,
27:23), and Paul alludes to angels concerned about proper decorum at
Christian worship services (1 Corinthians 11:10).
In John’s mind, like that of other New Testament writers, angels appear to be
personal agents who watch over and protect the communities of the faithful.
Because they’re assigned to individual congregations, Jesus addresses them
directly, even though they’re spiritual representatives rather than visible 
participants in the life of the churches. This form of address strengthens
Christian conviction that divine resources are indeed at their disposal.
123
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

The seven churches: Real or symbolic?
Many people look at the structure and pattern of these messages and wonder
whether they’re messages to seven real churches or whether this is simply a
literary device that John uses to address Christians in general. What’s more,
given the symbolic nature of the number seven (it represents perfection 
or completeness), many speculate that its usage is a clear tip-off that these
letters aren’t really addressed to seven actual churches.
Because each church is to read the messages sent to the other churches, the
intended audience is at least greater than any one congregation. What’s
more, the province of Asia contained other churches besides the seven John
selected (see, for example, Colossians 4:13). In a very real sense, then, these
seven churches represent a much larger constituency.
Still, each message includes too many historical details specific to that particu-
lar church for a totally symbolic view to be persuasive. Our look at each
church in the sections that follow underscores this point.
Good reasons exist for viewing the seven churches as actual churches of the
first century, which are typical of churches throughout Christian church his-
tory. In short, they’re both actual and representative. You can probably find 
a Smyrna, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, for example, just about any time or era
you choose. In fact, you may even catch a glimpse of your own church in one
of these snapshots!
124
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
The churches as eras of church history
Dispensationalists believe that the churches rep-
resent seven different eras of church history. For
example, here’s one possible scheme:
 Ephesus represents the first Christian 
century.
 Smyrna represents the era of persecution in
the second and third centuries.
 Pergamum represents the age of Constantine,
when Christianity became the religion of 
the Roman Empire.
 Thyatira is the Middle Ages.
 Sardis is the Protestant Reformation.
 Philadelphia is the period of the modern 
missionary movement.
 Laodicea represents the church of the End
Times, which has abandoned its former
beliefs and principles.
As intriguing as this may be, we think it oversim-
plifies church history, which is actually very rich
and complex.

Getting to Know the Seven Churches 
Up Close and Personal
A quick read of Revelation 2–3 reveals that all is not well among the house
churches of Asia. Although you see a few indications of random violence
directed at members of these churches, for the most part, the pressure is
more subtle. More than a few Christians are succumbing and lapsing into
their pre-Christian lifestyles and vices. It’s worth noting what you don’t 
read: nothing about state-sponsored persecution appears in these seven 
messages — yet. As you move into the central section of the book, however, 
a quite different scenario emerges. In other words, Jesus addresses these
seven churches and challenges them to be faithful for a very good reason:
The evil empire — Rome — is about to strike back!
125
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)
Virtues and vices of life in the cities
The following table summarizes the moral and
spiritual condition of the seven churches. This
chart is selective and representative. It doesn’t
simply document the various strengths and
weaknesses of each church. Rather, it highlights
a particular vice and its corresponding virtue.
The point is to draw attention to the virtues that,
according to Revelation, should characterize
Christian congregations at all times.
At Ephesus, for example, the vice is a spirit of
contentiousness; what’s needed is an infusion
of love. The church at Smyrna needs to hear the
admonition to exercise courage. It’s not as
though they had none; they’d been quite coura-
geous to this point. But they did need a reminder
not to let fear grip their hearts and thereby
undermine their courage.

The second and third centuries are historical periods that saw considerable
persecution and martyrdom of Christians who refused to participate in 
the state religion. This involved venerating the gods of Rome and even some
of the deceased Roman emperors, such as Augustus. Christian refusal 
was considered treason against the empire — a crime deserving capital

Acts, Artemis, and the silver industry
The book of Acts indicates that Ephesus sup-
ported a thriving industry that specialized in
making silver figurines of Artemis (the photo
shows an image of this fertility goddess).
Archeological work at Ephesus confirms the
New Testament account. Undoubtedly, women
who wanted to get pregnant wore some of these
figurines around the neck as a lucky charm.
The Apostle Paul narrowly escaped disaster
when disgruntled silversmiths, led by a man
named Demetrius, sought to discredit and expel
him from the city following his very successful
evangelistic campaign. Apparently, because of
Paul’s preaching, many converts abandoned
their devotion to Artemis, so much so that busi-
ness fell off and the silversmiths found their liveli-
hood threatened (Acts 19:23–27). This led to a
huge riot staged in the great theater. Today,
tourists can sit in this magnificent 24,000-capac-
ity theater and look out across the remains of the
Arcadian way, a colonnaded street leading, in
Paul’s day, from the theater to the commercial
harbor on the shoreline.

punishment in the view of most Roman citizens. The book of Revelation, 
written at the end of the first century, is almost a dress rehearsal for what’s
coming. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the story in the later 
chapters of Revelation.
So what was it like to live as a Christian at the end of the first Christian cen-
tury in the Roman province of Asia? To help you enter imaginatively into their
world, we first provide a brief snapshot of each city in which these believers
lived and then reconstruct, as best we can, what the spiritual condition was 
in the house churches located within them. Bear in mind that early Christians
met for worship in private homes.
Probably several houses hosted worship services in each city. Romans 16, for
example, mentions “the church in their house” (Romans 16:5) and “the saints
who are with them” (Romans 16:15).
Ephesus: Down on love (2:1–7)
Though not the capital, Ephesus was nonetheless the largest and most impor-
tant city in the province. It even boasted the title supreme metropolis of Asia.
In fact, the Asian proconsul (Roman official who served as the governor of 
a province) resided in Ephesus and maintained government offices there.
Ephesus, the city
Ephesus was a splendid Greco-Roman city boasting a population of at least a
quarter million. Its geographic location was ideal, beautifully nestled between
two mountains close to the Aegean Sea’s shoreline. The city was adorned
with public and commercial buildings, fountains, gymnasiums, bath houses,
stadiums, theaters, and especially, temples. Ephesus was also a commercial
powerhouse and transportation hub. If all roads led to Rome, Ephesus was 
a major intersection on the way.
Besides its location where the Cayster River empties into the Aegean Sea,
Ephesus is positioned at the western end of a great road linking western 
Asia to the Anatolian interior and the Near East (Anatolia is the Asian part 
of modern-day Turkey). Roman milestones on this ancient road calculate 
the distance using Ephesus as the point of origin. The city is also on a north-
south road following the coastline of Asia Minor by way of Smyrna and
Pergamum, all the way to Troas (the area around the city of Troy) and the
Dardenelles (a strategically important strait). The products of the rich
Anatolian lands flowed to the harbor and roads of Ephesus and from there 
to the larger Mediterranean world.
The crown jewel of Ephesus was the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven
wonders of the ancient world. This magnificent structure measured 420 feet
long by 240 feet wide, supporting a roof 60 feet high that was upheld by 117
127
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

imposing columns. Within the temple, open to the sky, stood a huge statue 
of Artemis (Diana is the Roman equivalent). Originally the Greek goddess 
of wild nature, she morphed into a fertility goddess at Ephesus.
The church at Ephesus
Based on what Jesus says to the church of Ephesus (Rev. 2:1–7), their spiritual
fervor doesn’t match the grandeur of their city.
Revelation notes that believers are doing some things right. Jesus commends
them for their hard work and especially their vigilance against false Apostles.
Ephesus was a hotbed of false teaching even in the early days following
Paul’s founding of the church. Paul, in fact, worried and warned about this
problem while on his way to Jerusalem during his third missionary journey.
He requested the Ephesian elders to come down to the beach and meet with
him before he sailed on to the east. In a memorable scene, he predicts future
trouble: “I know that after I have gone, savage wolves will come in among
you, not sparing the flock. Some even from your own group will come distort-
ing the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them. Therefore be
alert [. . .]” (Acts 20:29–31). Paul was right in his warning. Five years or so
later, when Paul writes to his young assistant Timothy who is ministering in
Ephesus, a major concern is dealing with false teachers who are upsetting the
faith of many (1 Timothy 1:3–11, 4:1–9, 6:3–10).
In Revelation, although Jesus commends the church for examining and reject-
ing the false teachers, he points to a cancer in their midst: Perhaps as an 
outgrowth of their zeal to defend the truth, an unloving attitude permeates
the Ephesian church. Jesus says, “You have abandoned the love you had at
first” (Rev. 2:4). The people have failed to remember the exhortation of their
founding father, the Apostle Paul: “But speaking the truth in love, we must
grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ” (Ephesians 4:15).
According to the Bible, their lack of love is inconsistent with the truth of
Christianity and is deadly. After all, John says, “Whoever does not love abides
in death” (1 John 3:14). Jesus, however, knows what the solution is: Love
must first be directed to him because he’s the source of all love. Genuine love
for God always overflows as love for others (Philippians 1:9; 1 Thessalonians
3:12). The remedy is immediate repentance. For those who choose to repent,
Jesus offers glorious promise — permission to enter paradise.
Smyrna: Faithful under fire (2:8–11)
Smyrna lies 40 miles to the north of Ephesus, just south of where the Hermus
River empties into the Aegean Sea. Possessing a well-protected harbor, the
city of Smyrna also sits at the western end of a trade route joining the major
inland route across Anatolia to the east. Apollonius of Tyana, writing at about
the same time as John, describes Smyrna as “the most beautiful of all cities
under the sun.”
128
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Smyrna, the city
A disaster defined the city of Smyrna. In 600 BCE, Alyattes, king of Lydia 
(a powerful state in Western Asia), destroyed Smyrna. After the city lay in
ruins for centuries, Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great’s generals and
successors, resurrected the city in 290 BCE. Once again, Smyrna, with its
choice location, became a thriving Greek city with all the trappings. Today,
the modern city of Izmir, one of the largest cities in Turkey (3.5 million),
stands on the same site. The description of Jesus in Revelation 2:8 as the 
one “who was dead and came to life” may subtly allude to Smyrna’s 
remarkable return to life.
Of more consequence for early Christians, Smyrna loyally supported Rome in
her struggles to gain control of the Mediterranean Sea. In fact, the Smyrneans
supplied significant naval support for the emerging Roman Empire. As a con-
sequence, when Smyrna petitioned Rome for the honor of building a temple
to the emperor Augustus and his mother in 23 CE, the city received the privi-
lege over 11 other candidates. And even though the Roman Senate never 
officially deified Tiberius Caesar, the Smyrneans built a temple in his honor.
The construction and official support of these temples reveal a city with a
culture that took great pride in the imperial cult and zealously insisted on its
support from the citizenry. This allegiance to the state presented a major
problem for Christians.
The church at Smyrna
Jesus commends but doesn’t censor the church in Smyrna. The people are
bravely hanging on despite severe affliction and persecution around them. 
He says sympathetically to the Smyrnean Christians, “I know your affliction
129
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)
Nixing the Nicolaitans
Jesus commends the Ephesians for hating the
works of the Nicolaitans. But who in the world
are they? Here’s the short answer: We don’t
know for sure. Mentioned again by name in the
message to the church of Pergamum (2:15),
they’re likely the evildoers and false Apostles
referred to in Revelation 2:2. But even this 
doesn’t explain much.
Irenaeus, an early church father of the second
century, claims they go back to Nicolaus, a
former proselyte (gentile convert to Judaism)
and deacon in the Jerusalem church (Acts 6:5).
Actually, Irenaeus says Nicolaus himself had
taught that one must rigorously hit and strike the
body in order to suppress evil desires. Some of
his followers, however, radically altered this and
held that what one did in the body made no dif-
ference whatsoever because the body had no
influence on the spirit. This generally led to what
believers viewed as an immoral and even lewd
lifestyle. Irenaeus’s theory may be correct, but
there’s not enough evidence to come to any cer-
tain conclusions. What we can say with some
confidence is that the Nicolaitans urged certain
compromises with the prevailing culture, a
stance that John roundly condemns.

and your poverty [. . .]” (Rev. 2:9). But in spite of this, ironically, Jesus calls
them rich! Perhaps this echoes Jesus’s beatitude: “Blessed are you who are
poor, for yours is the kingdom of God” (Luke 6:20). Belonging to the kingdom
of God rather than the kingdom of Caesar carries with it riches the world
knows nothing about (1 Corinthians 3:21–23; Ephesians 1:7–22).
Imagine how difficult it must have been for the believers in Smyrna to with-
stand the constant pressure to participate in the imperial cult (veneration of
the gods of Rome and the deified Roman emperors). Charges of treason and
lack of patriotism would be constant issues for them.
Given that religious, civic, and political life were so intertwined in the Greco-
Roman world, we wonder how many Christians were expelled from their guild
and treated as outcasts and untouchables. If, for example, your guild adopted
the emperor as its patron deity, you’d be expected to participate in the sacri-
fices and suppers held in honor of the divine Caesar. Not to participate would
be interpreted as lack of loyalty and friendship. And the same would be true
if your guild invoked some of the other Greek/Roman gods and goddesses 
(of which there were many!) as patron deities. Already in the 50’s, the issue 
of eating meat sacrificed to idols was a major concern of Christian house
churches (1 Corinthians 8–10). Ironically, one of the early slanders widely 
circulated about Christians accused them of being “haters of all mankind.”
The Latin phrase for a religion that Rome recognized was religio licita. To 
be unsanctioned was religio illicita. During Paul’s missionary journeys, he 
got out of several scrapes because Roman officials viewed early Christianity
as one of the sects or parties of Judaism, a religio licita (see Acts 18:12–17).
However, because of increasing tensions between Jews and the early
Christian church, Christianity was downgraded to religio illicita.
Jesus forewarns the Smyrneans: Hunker down because you’re about to
undergo imprisonment. The duration he mentions, “ten days” (Rev. 2:10),
probably means a relatively short period of time. No biblical or extra-biblical
sources mention this imprisonment, but there’s no reason to doubt its reality.
As you read this passage, remember the time frame is at the end of the first
century (likely 90–95 CE). It won’t be long before large numbers of believers
experience imprisonment, enslavement, torture, and death because of their
refusal to participate in the imperial cult.
Pergamum: Compromising 
convictions (2:12–17)
Pergamum, 70 miles north of Smyrna, is an impressive city perched high 
atop a hill overlooking the Caicus River plain and the Bay of Lesbos in the
distance. Pergamum, like Smyrna, sided with Rome against the surrounding
130
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Greek city-states in the struggle to dominate the region. For this, the empire
amply rewarded Pergamum. In 133 BCE, when Attalus III bequeathed his 
kingdom to Rome, the city functioned as the official capital of the province 
of Asia. Today, the city of Bergama in Turkey preserves the ancient name.
Pergamum, the city
Pergamum, a bustling city of some 180,000 inhabitants in John’s day, reached
its zenith under Eumenes II (197–159 BCE). He transformed the city into an
architectural and cultural center. Among its many showpieces was a library
of 200,000 scrolls rivaling that of Alexandria, Egypt.
The English word parchment comes from a blend of two Latin words: Parthica
(pellis) (“Parthian [leather]”) and pergam_na (“parchment”). The latter
comes from the Greek word  pergam_n_, from Pergam_nos — that is, “of
Pergamum.” People used this skin or leather as a substitute for papyrus.
One of the significant architectural monuments of Pergamum was the great
altar to Zeus (see Figure 7-1), standing some 40 feet high and crowning 
the rocky summit of the acropolis (a high, fortified part of the city). This 
altar celebrated the victorious defense of Pergamum against the invading
Gauls. Perhaps the comment “where Satan’s throne is” (Rev. 2:13) refers 
to this temple.

131
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

Many other temples punctuated the city, the most notable dedicated to
Dionysius, Athena, Demeter, and Orpheus. However, because of Pergamum’s
loyalty to Rome, pride of place went to the imperial cult. As early as 29 
BCE, citizens of Pergamum venerated the genius of Rome and its emperor 
by burning incense before a statue of the divine Caesar. This, too, is a good
candidate for “Satan’s throne.”
A thousand feet below, at the bottom of the acropolis, lay a complex dedicated
to Asclepius, the god of healing. The Asclepium, or health spa, achieved a 
far flung reputation as early as 350 BCE. Thousands of people, suffering from 
a spectrum of disorders, descended on the Asclepium in hopes of a cure.
Remarkably, the complex featured individual rooms with the soothing sound
of gently flowing water piped into each. Although superstition abounded, the
concern and care of the attendants was a point of pride that the patients
greatly appreciated.
Today, visitors can view the plaster casts of various body parts that pilgrims
left in the sanctuary of Asclepius as testimonials to their healing. Physicians
there administered a rather surprising array of medicinal treatments with
apparent success. Worth noting in this regard is the fact that Galen, one 
of the founders of modern medicine, received his medical training at the
Asclepium of Pergamum.
The church at Pergamum
In Revelation, Jesus begins by commending the church at Pergamum for their
faithful endurance: “Yet you are holding fast to my name, and you did not
deny your faith in me [. . .]” (2:13). Clearly, these believers are under intense
pressure to participate in the various temple rituals, especially emperor wor-
ship, because this was such a point of pride for the city. According to Jesus’s
message, a believer named Antipas, about whom little is known, lost his life
for refusing to participate. He may have even been executed at the temple 
of Zeus or the temple dedicated to imperial Rome (“where Satan lives”).
However, not everything is peachy in Pergamum. Some professing Christians
aren’t prepared to make the supreme sacrifice that Antipas did. They ask
questions like, “Can’t we all just get along? If we don’t believe it, why not just
go through the motions and burn the incense?” Jesus calls this response 
“the teaching of Balaam” (Rev. 2:14).
So who’s Balaam? In Numbers 22–25, Balaam, a greedy false prophet, coun-
sels Balak, the king of Moab, to derail Israel on her march to the Promised
Land — by sexually enticing the Israelites to participate in idolatrous rituals,
anticipating that God will punish Israel as a result! Balaam nearly succeeds 
in his diabolical scheme. Some 24,000 Israelites perish in a divine visitation
(Numbers 25:9; 1 Corinthians 10:8). Jesus warns the Christians at Pergamum
of a similar fate: “Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and make war
against them with the sword of my mouth” (Rev. 2:16).
132
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

From Jesus’s perspective, participation in idol sacrifices and the imperial cult
amount to spiritual prostitution. Either Jesus is Lord or Caesar is Lord — 
it’s a zero-sum game. Furthermore, orgies often accompanied pagan sacrifice,
so physical prostitution was never far removed from spiritual prostitution.
The Balaamites probably believed that what’s done in the body doesn’t affect
the spirit (the view of the Nicolaitans — see the “Nixing the Nicolaitans” side-
bar). So in their view, illicit sex was a non-issue, a personal decision of no
consequence. Some believers in Pergamum were tempted to agree. To those
wavering, Jesus issues a stern warning.
However, Jesus promises those in Pergamum who hold fast to their Christian
faith many things in Revelation 2:17:
 Hidden manna: This mysterious substance sustained the Israelites
throughout their wilderness wanderings after Moses led them out of
slavery in Egypt (Exodus 16). It’s a symbol of eternal life in Judaism 
and probably functions in the same way here.
 White stone: In the Greco-Roman world, stones of various kinds served
as tickets and admission passes. Here, the white stone admits the holder
to paradise — far better than even the Olympics!
 A new name: In the Old Testament, the giving of a name or the changing
of one’s name carries great significance (Genesis 17:5, 17:15, 32:27–30;
Isaiah 56:2, 62:2). In this passage, the new name indicates a completely
transformed nature. The fact that no one else knows it suggests that
each believer has a unique destiny in eternity.
One final note about this message: The description of Jesus holding “the
sharp two-edged sword” (2:12) may allude to the famous Roman short sword
that often functioned as a symbol of capital punishment. The fact that Jesus,
not Caesar, holds the sword speaks volumes about who really holds the
power of life and death.
Thyatira: Dirty dancing with 
Jezebel (2:18–29)
Thyatira lay on the south bank of the Lycus River in a broad and fertile valley
running north and south and connecting the Caicus and Hermus valleys.
Today, the Turkish city Akhisar occupies the ancient site.
Thyatira, the city
Thyatira was founded by Seleucus I, one of Alexander the Great’s successors.
Because of its location guarding the eastern approaches to the great coastal
cities like Smyrna and Pergamum, Thyatira was a frontier outpost. Lacking 
133
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

a great acropolis (high, fortified part of the city) like Pergamum, Thyatira
depended on the determination of its citizens to defend itself against all
aggressors. Appropriately, early coins from Thyatira depict the patron deity
astride a horse wielding a great battle-axe. Perhaps Jesus’s commendation 
of the church for its “patient endurance” (Rev. 2:19) is an instance where
church and city are mirror images of each other.
Perhaps the most significant feature of Thyatira was its large number of trade
guilds (akin to modern day trade unions) including woolworkers, linen work-
ers, garment makers, leather workers, tanners, potters, bakers, slave-dealers,
and bronze-smiths. Each guild often adopted one of the popular idols as its
patron deity to bring luck and bless the business.
Christians in Thyatira would’ve encountered grave difficulties because of 
the integral connection between the various guilds and their patron deities.
Inscriptional evidence (that is, formal inscriptions on statues, public build-
ings, tombs, and so forth) indicates that the guardian deity of Thyatira was
the god Tyrimnos, identified with the sun-god Apollo. No doubt the trade
guilds invoked this deity.
The church at Thyatira
Interestingly, the letter to Thyatira is the longest of the seven, and yet in many
ways, the city itself was the least well-known and important of the seven.
The start of the letter designates Jesus as “the Son of God” (Rev. 2:18), which
is significant because it’s the only time the book of Revelation uses that 
title. It’s probably not a coincidence that Tyrimnos (Apollo) and the emperor
were both acclaimed as “sons of Zeus.” By the reference to Jesus as the Son
of God, the Thyatiran believers are reminded that there’s only one Son of
God, and he’s Jesus, not Caesar. What’s more, it may be more than mere coin-
cidence that Jesus is also described as having feet “like burnished bronze,”
especially in a town known for its bronze-working guild. Clearly, the Jesus of
Revelation trumps all wannabe gods and goddesses.
According to the message of Jesus, the believers at Thyatira are doing some
things right, and they receive high praise for four works:
 Love: This crowning virtue heads the list.
 Faith: Faith, another one of the three Christian virtues (the third is 
hope — see 1 Corinthians 13:13), is also alive and well at Thyatira.
 Service: If the first two items are virtues, the next two are the practical
outworking of these virtues. The term service can also be rendered as
ministry.
 Patient endurance: Surviving in the midst of suffering and hard times 
is a prerequisite for belonging to a house church in Asia Minor. For the
most part, this small congregation is withstanding the pressure and
receives a passing grade.
134
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

On the other hand, Jesus has a beef with their compromises. A formidable
female prophetess advocates accommodation with idolatrous rituals, a prob-
lem that also bedevils Ephesus and Pergamum. Their challenge is to survive
as Christians in a hostile environment in which false religion and economics
seem to be intimately intertwined.
Jesus refers to the false prophetess as “Jezebel,” likely a reference to the 
notorious queen of King Ahab in the Old Testament. The original Jezebel 
promoted the sexually immoral cult of Baal and Asherah and persecuted the 
true prophets of God (1 Kings 18–19; 2 Kings 9). Thyatira’s Jezebel is more
subtle — claiming to have received direct insight from God that allows her 
to encourage Christians to compromise by participating in sexually immoral
idol worship. In Revelation, Jesus knows better and describes her insights as
“the deep things of Satan” (2:24). In short, she seems to claim that Christians
can dance with the devil, so to speak, and not get hurt.
Jesus’s warning to the churches of Thyatira is direct and unambiguous:
Repent or else! Jezebel and her cohorts will get what they deserve. In place 
of a bed of sensual pleasure, they’ll get a bed of affliction and death.
At the end of the message, Jesus promises the churches two things:
 Authority to rule: Victorious believers will share in Jesus’s rule over the
world to come. However, believers may not coast into the kingdom; they
have to be steadfast to the very end.
 The morning star: Jesus promises to give his faithful the “morning star.”
We aren’t going to blow smoke here — we don’t know for sure what this
means! The morning star, the planet Venus, probably refers figuratively
to Jesus (see Revelation 22:16 and 2 Peter 1:19). But the precise back-
ground is unknown. Perhaps Revelation is reapplying Numbers 24:17 
(“a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel”), 
a passage rabbis interpret as a reference to the Messiah.
Because of widespread fascination over this “star’s” appearance just before
sunrise, Venus serves as a fitting metaphor — the messianic herald of a new
world that’s coming. Taken together, the two images of authority and morn-
ing star may be making the same point: Conquerors — meaning believers
who endure to the end — have a vital share and role in the new world.
Sardis: Sleepwalkers in the city (3:1–6)
Located at the junction of routes into the interior of Turkey (30 miles to the
south of Thyatira and about 50 miles east of Smyrna), Sardis was an impor-
tant transportation and commercial hub. Though Sardis was once one of the
most prosperous cities in the region, today the ancient site lies abandoned,
about 5 miles west of the modern city of Salihi, Turkey.
135
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

Sardis, the city
Sardis had a near legendary past. Once the capital of the kingdom of Lydia, 
it became a center of fabulous wealth. Its last great king, Croesus (560–546
BCE), was so rich he became a byword: “as rich as Croesus!” Gold and silver
coinage was first minted at Sardis, a fitting achievement in a truly golden age.
Sardis was geographically blessed with a grand acropolis: The stronghold of
Sardis stood perched atop a steep ridge 1,500 feet above the plain, seemingly
impregnable to all assaults. The key word is seemingly. The great citadel of
Sardis fell to the Persians in 546 BCE.
After Alexander the Great’s conquests, Sardis fell under the control of various
Hellenistic regimes (Hellenism refers to the Greek culture that dominated 
the Mediterranean basin from the time of Alexander the Great [334 BCE] until
well into the late Roman age). Believe it or not, during this era, the citadel 
of Sardis was seized again and under similar circumstances. In 218 BCE,
Antiochus III captured the fortress because no guard was posted above the
steep slopes!
The Hellenistic era ended when Attalus III bequeathed Pergamum to Rome 
in 133 CE. Sardis became an administrative center in the Roman province of
Asia. But never again did the city regain the prominence it once held. In fact,
136
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Hold onto your helmet! Seizing Sardis
Under King Croesus, Sardis ruled over all other
Asian cities. But then Cyrus the Great, the king of
Persia, began his series of conquests and turned
his eyes to the west and wealthy Sardis. Cyrus’s
army made valiant attempts to storm the citadel
but with no success. Just when it seemed Cyrus
had to accept defeat and withdraw, one of his
soldiers, Hyroeades, spotted a Lydian soldier
who had dropped his helmet down the slopes of
the precipice and clambered down to retrieve it.
Hyroeades watched carefully and marked the
place where the Lydian soldier climbed back to
the citadel. It was unguarded because it was
thought to be so steep no guard was necessary.
That proved to be the undoing of Sardis. Cyrus’s
soldiers were able to force entry and seize 
the citadel.
The Greek historian Herodotus recounts the
siege and capture of Sardis and its aftermath in
his book The Histories (1.78–93). Surrounding this
account, however, Herodotus spins tales about
Croesus’s rise to power and the splendor of 
his kingdom (1.25–78). Like a mirror image,
Herodotus then narrates Cyrus’s rise to power
and glory (1.94–141). These two Titans were 
destined to collide.
Why didn’t Croesus prevail? Herodotus attributes
his defeat to misplaced confidence in the
impregnability of the citadel of Sardis. Perhaps
some of this well-known history of Sardis lies
behind the message to the church at Sardis: the
failure to be vigilant.

in a competition to build a second temple to Rome’s imperial cult in 26 CE,
Sardis vainly vied for the honor based on its storied past. At this point, the
city seems to have had a reputation but no real clout.
The remains of Sardis are impressive. At the foot of the acropolis of Sardis
stands a great temple dedicated to Artemis, in imitation of the one at Ephesus.
Archaeologists have also uncovered a gymnasium complex featuring a marble
court area.
A strong Jewish community inhabited Sardis. Modern visitors to the site
marvel at the remains of a beautiful synagogue — about the length of a foot-
ball field — dating to the third or fourth century. Because Sardis was host 
to a thriving Jewish community from Hellenistic times, the city doubtless had
a fine synagogue in John’s day as well.
The church at Sardis
In a sense, the church at Sardis is spiritually sleepwalking — dead on their feet
while appearing to be awake — and they’re headed for disaster! In his mes-
sage, Jesus summons these believers from their spiritual slumber: “Wake up!”
(3:2). There’s still hope! The citadel hasn’t fallen yet, and they can still stave
off the enemy: “Strengthen what remains and is on the point of death.” How?
Three commands, barked out like military orders, point the way: Remember,
obey, and repent. The book of Revelation leaves no doubt about what they’re
supposed to remember and obey: the word of God and the testimony of 
Jesus (1:2, 1:9, 6:9, 12:17, 19:10, 20:4).
The consequences of failure to respond immediately mirror the history 
of the city. Like previous successful assaults on the citadel of Sardis, Jesus
will come “like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you”
(3:3). In short, the local church at Sardis will cease to exist.
But all is not lost. A vigilant minority of people “have not soiled their clothes”
(3:4). This vivid metaphor probably refers to compromise with the non-
Christian environment. To them, Jesus holds out two glowing promises: 
 White robes: Worshipers in temples, whether gentile or Jewish, were
required to appear in clean clothes, typically in white linen. Christians
are promised that they, too, will worship in the “new Jerusalem” and 
be dressed in white, a symbol of righteousness and moral purity.
 A place in the book of life: The notion of a registry of the redeemed
also occurs in the Old Testament (Exodus 32:32; Psalm 69:28; Daniel
12:1). Jesus promises the conquerors of Sardis — the believers who 
stick it out — that their names will not be removed from the registry of
the new Jerusalem. On the contrary, Jesus himself will announce their
names in the presence of God and his angels.

Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

Philadelphia: Holding on 
’til the end (3:7–13)
Philadelphia is best known today for the Liberty Bell, Rocky Balboa, and a
great cheesesteak sandwich. But another Philadelphia, in the ancient world,
resided on the Hermus River Valley at about 30 miles to the southeast of
Sardis. Because it was situated at the junction of five roads leading to Mysia,
Lydia, and Phrygia, it gained the title “gateway to the East.” Besides being a
frontier city, linking the interior of Anatolia (Asian Turkey) with the coastal
cities (Smyrna was about 100 miles due west), Philadelphia was near an
important vine-growing district, and it hosted textile and leather industries.
The modern city of Alasehir lies near the same site.
Philadelphia, the city
Philadelphia, the “city of brotherly love,” was so-named because of the 
affection Attalus II Philadelphus (159–138 BCE), the city’s founder, felt for 
his elder brother Eumenes II, the noted king of Pergamum. Before becoming
king himself, Attalus II served as a loyal general for Eumenes. In about 
140 BCE, Attalus founded Philadelphia in honor of his brother, making it the
youngest of the seven cities.
Attalus placed great hopes on this city. He viewed it as a launching point from
which Hellenism (Greek culture) might be spread into the barbarian interior
of Anatolia. This was partially successful: The Lydian language finally ceased
to be spoken by 19 CE, but Phrygian culture itself quite outlived Hellenism.
Greeks and Romans typically viewed other peoples and tribes as substandard
and primitive. They used the Latin word barbarus and the Greek word bar-
baros for such non-Latin and non-Greek speaking peoples. The Apostle Paul
uses the Greek term for non-Greek speakers in Romans 1:14 and Colossians
3:11 but without snobbish, elitist overtones.
The hopes for the city received a jolting setback in 17 CE, when a devastating
earthquake leveled the city. Philadelphia, lying close to a major geological
fault line, seems to have suffered the brunt of the quake, and successive
tremors furthered the damage. According to ancient historians, the danger 
of collapsing buildings and walls so terrified the populace that most citizens
lived outside the city in temporary shelters during these harrowing times.
But owing to generous imperial funding made possible by Tiberius Caesar
(Luke 3:1), the city made a comeback. Unfortunately, tremors rocked the area
for years afterward, making life somewhat chaotic. In spite of this, the city
persevered, and in John’s day it was relatively prosperous, a testament to
their steadfastness.
A major temple in Philadelphia was dedicated to Dionysius, god of merry-
making and wine — not surprising in light of the reputation of the surround-
ing area for high-quality grapes. No archaeological evidence indicates the
138
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

presence of the imperial cult in Philadelphia during the first century, though
such evidence from the beginning of the third century exists. On the other
hand, we’d be quite surprised if there were no presence whatsoever of the
imperial cult and the widespread trade guilds in John’s day.
The church at Philadelphia
Philadelphia, like Smyrna, receives no condemnation or stern warning. What’s
striking is Jesus’s frank acknowledgment of their tough circumstances and 
his exhortation to hold on at all costs. Like the city in which they lived, the
Philadelphian Christians were remaining steadfast in the midst of suffering
and hard times. The threat to the church lay not inside its walls but outside 
of them. In particular, the Jewish community apparently made life difficult.
Jesus identifies himself as the one “who has the key of David, who opens and
no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens” (Rev. 3:7). The description
probably refers to a passage in Isaiah 22:15–22, in which Shebna, head stew-
ard during the reign of king Hezekiah of Judah (716–686 BCE), is replaced by
Eliakim. A head steward controls the keys giving access to the palace and its
rooms. (Palace reliefs from Assyria depict officials having a large wooden key
attached to a shoulder.) The point is this: Jesus, like Eliakim, now has the
authority to admit or disbar individuals from his kingdom.
The relevance for the church at Philadelphia probably lies in a painful 
dispute between church and synagogue. Which community is the true Israel,
and is Jesus of Nazareth the true Messiah? The Jewish leaders of John’s day
denied Christian claims and may have even excommunicated (officially
excluded) Jewish Christians from the synagogue (see John 7:13, 9:22). For
Jewish Christians, this was a bitter blow, cutting them off from their cultural
heritage. But Jesus reassures them: “I [like Eliakim] have set before you an
open door, which no one is able to shut” (3:7). They’re indeed members of
the true Israel, and the Jewish community at Philadelphia, like Shebna, will
one day acknowledge this transfer of status and authority (3:9).
The message of Jesus in Revelation 3:9 is harsh, so handle with care. It refers
to the Jewish synagogue as “a synagogue of Satan” and even denies their
claim to be Jews (see also 2:9). Read this passage in the context of a debate
among members of the same group. After all, Christianity is a daughter of
Judaism. During Jesus’s earthly ministry, especially in John’s Gospel, Jesus
and the religious leadership frequently clash. They challenge his authority;
he condemns their unbelief. Because they reject his message and are abusive
toward him, he says, “You are from your father the devil” (John 8:43). The
Jewish leadership in Philadelphia reacts in a similar way and thus receives
his censure. But it’s quite another thing for modern Christians to take up this
harsh rhetoric and apply it the Jewish people, as was done in the Middle
Ages and continues to be done by anti-Semites (those who are hostile toward
Jews). Christians are taught to leave the matter of people’s spiritual status
and destiny to Jesus as they bear witness to the gospel. Jesus was not 
rebuking Jews because of their Jewishness but because of their refusal to
accept him and his message.

Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

Jesus offers another promise to this beleaguered congregation: “I will keep
you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world to test the 
inhabitants of the earth” (Rev. 3:10). This probably refers to the so-called
Great Tribulation of the End Times. (See Chapter 8 for a discussion of the
relationship of the rapture to the Tribulation.)
Conquerors may claim two promises from Jesus:
 Pillars in the Temple of God: How fitting for believers who live in an
earthquake-prone city whose pillars may collapse at any moment! This
metaphor speaks of stability and strength. It also speaks poignantly 
to those cut off from the heritage of the Jewish Temple that once stood
in Jerusalem. (It had been destroyed in 70 CE.) They’re now members 
in good standing of the grander and greater Temple of the Lord
(Ephesians 2:19–22).
 New names: As in Pergamum and Sardis (see the earlier sections on
these cities), the notion of receiving a new name plays a prominent 
role at Philadelphia. But in Revelation 3:12, it’s not just one new name;
it’s three:
• Name of God: Is this the sacred name Yahweh? Perhaps. At any
rate, the new name emphasizes that believers are part of the 
family of God. They bear his name as sons and daughters.
• Name of the new Jerusalem: Twice in its checkered history,
Philadelphia adopted a new name. More relevant for the church,
however, is possession of the name of the new Jerusalem, 
certifying citizenship in the celestial city.
• New name of the Lamb: Whatever this name is, believers share 
a new status with the Lamb. He is, after all, “the firstborn within 
a large family” (Romans 8:29).
Each of the promises point to a new reality: Believers are all in the family, so
to speak.
Laodicea: Don’t drink the 
water! (3:14–22)
Laodicea is located in the eastern end of the Lycus Valley, a tributary of 
the Maeander River. It lies about 40 miles to the southeast of Philadelphia
and 100 miles due east of Ephesus on the coast. Antiochus II (261–246 BCE)
founded the Hellenistic city in honor of his wife Laodik. The ancient site 
is near the village of Eskihisar and the large, modern city of Denizli, Turkey
(population 800,000).

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Laodicea, the city
Located on a plateau 100 feet above the river, Laodicea reached a pinnacle 
of prosperity during the Roman age. Like Thyatira, Sardis, and Philadelphia,
Laodicea lay along the trade routes into the interior of Anatolia and onwards
to Syria. It was, accordingly, a military outpost and commercial center. Among
the city’s assets was a high-quality black wool raised and carded in the region.
The city was proud of its medical school and of a locally produced ointment
(“Phrygian powder”) reputed to cure eye ailments.
Laodicea was also a well-known banking center, with a number of wealthy citi-
zens. The famous Cicero even cashed large bank drafts at Laodicea. Reflecting
this wealth, the city minted its own coins and, following an earthquake in 60
CE, rebuilt itself, largely through private donations.
There were, of course, temples dedicated to various gods and goddesses, as
witnessed by inscriptions on their coins. The most important deity in the
region was Men Karou, a god connected with healing and whose temple lay
13 miles to the west of the city. Within the city itself were temples to Zeus
and Augustus, and nearby was a large marketplace where commodities were
bought and sold.
Large-scale excavations began in the year 2000, so much of the ancient city of
Laodicea remains to be discovered. Nevertheless, the ruins of two theaters, a
nymphaeum (a Roman building featuring running water, fountains, flower gar-
dens, and statues), an odeum (a small public building for music and poetry
performances), a gymnasium, a stadium (380 yards long!), and other public
buildings are clearly visible to visitors. Of special interest is a triple arch
gateway dedicated to none other than the emperor Domitian.
Laodicea did have a downside: The water was lousy. Unlike Colossae, 10
miles to the east, where copious amounts of cool, refreshing water were 
readily available, Laodicea had to pipe water in from several miles away. By
the time the water coursed its way through stone pipes to Laodicea, it was
tepid. To make matters worse, it was full of foul-tasting mineral deposits.
The church at Laodiciea
No other church is rebuked as severely — and no other church reflects more
clearly the city in which they live — than the Christians of Laodicea.
The spiritual condition of this church is as unpalatable as the water its 
citizens have to drink. More than a few sermons and commentaries miss the
point here. Jesus is not saying that being spiritually lukewarm is worse than
being spiritually cold. He’s saying the Laodicean Christians are of no spiritual
benefit whatsoever. Unlike the cool, refreshing water of Colossae or the hot,
therapeutic, mineral waters of Hierapolis, 6 miles to the north, the “spiritual
water” of Laodicea is worthless and nauseous. The NRSV translation, “I am
about to spit you out of my mouth,” is too tame (3:16). In reality, the idea
Jesus conveys here is, “You’re gonna make me puke!”
141
Chapter 7: Reading the Seven Letters to Conflicted Churches (1:19–3:22)

In addition, Jesus calls them “wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.”
What irony! Here’s a city proud of its self-reliance, hard-earned wealth, 
world-famous medical school and ointment, and luxurious clothing. The
church reflects a similar complacency. In short, they’re oblivious to their
spiritual need and completely lacking in zeal.
The remedy for Laodicea is heartfelt and immediate repentance. This is 
symbolically portrayed in terms of going to the marketplace and making
three purchases. All three items speak of salvation through Jesus:
 Gold refined by fire: What an appropriate metaphor for a city priding
itself on its gold reserves! Pure gold speaks of genuine faith (1 Peter 1:7).
 White robes: In place of the chic, black, wool garments, they need 
white robes, a symbol of the righteousness of Jesus freely granted to
repentant sinners.
 Eye salve: Once again, you can’t miss the irony. These believers are 
spiritually blind, so Phrygian powder won’t help a bit. Turning to Jesus
in faith, however, restores spiritual sight to the blind (Luke 4:18).
In one of the most memorable metaphors in the entire book, Jesus stands
outside the door of the Laodicean house church and knocks (Rev. 3:20). In
other words, he puts the ball in their court: They can either open the door
and allow him in or refuse him entrance. The problem at Laodicea is serious:
Spiritual indifference threatens their spiritual life. Fling open the door, Jesus
urges! Admit him and celebrate his supper (a reference to the Lord’s Supper
or Communion [Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22] and the End Times marriage
supper of the Lamb [Rev. 19:6–9]). In short, they desperately need genuine
conversion.
The promise to the conquerors — there were some genuine believers at
Laodicea (“I reprove and discipline those whom I love” [Rev. 3:19]) — is 
similar to that of Thyatira (see the earlier section on Thyatira). Conquerors
sit on Jesus’s throne and share in his reign (3:21). You may be glad to hear
that Laodicea did continue to be a center for Christian witness for some 
time afterward, hosting a famous church council in 363 CE.

Peeking into the Throne 
Room (4:1–5:14)
In This Chapter
 Surrounding the throne of God
 Scanning a sealed scroll: The mysterious book of destiny
 Revealing a supreme paradox: The Lion (of Judah) is a Lamb!
O
ne of the coolest things about the starship Enterprise in Star Trek — and
there were a lot of cool things — was the capability of “beaming up” or
“beaming down.” So if Captain Kirk was on the surface of some exotic planet
or asteroid and the Enterprise was hovering in the vicinity, he simply issued
the famous order, “Beam me up, Scotty,” and presto! He dematerialized and
vanished. The next thing you knew, he materialized back on the flight deck of
the Enterprise. Now that’s cool.
“Beaming up” isn’t a new idea. In the first two centuries BCE and the first 
two centuries CE, a number of Jewish writings, designated as apocalyptic
(because they claim to reveal hidden secrets about the universe and the
future), appeared in the Middle East. These writings typically feature an
ascent into the heavenly realms by a noteworthy figure from Jewish history
and tradition. These visionary ascents end in a visit to the throne room of
God himself.
In this chapter, you discover that Revelation 4–5 has striking similarities to
these apocalyptic accounts of visionary ascents. But more importantly, as
you peek into God’s throne room, you dive into the meaning of John’s vision
and discern how it answers a nagging question for Christians: Who’s in
charge of all that happens on planet earth? Chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation
have an emphatic answer: a book of destiny contains God’s unchangeable 
will for all creation.

Focusing on the “Someone” 
on the Throne (4:1–11)
As Revelation 4 begins, John tells of his ascent into heaven through a heav-
enly portal: “After this I looked, and there in heaven a door stood open! And
the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, ‘Come
up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.’”
144
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Trying to describe God: It ain’t easy!
The Bible consistently shies away from describ-
ing God in visual terms. Judaism prohibits any
images to represent the deity. This edict goes all
the way back to the days of Moses, when God
tells the Israelites, “You shall not make for your-
self an idol, whether in the form of anything that
is in heaven above or that is on the earth
beneath or that is in the waters under the earth”
(Exodus 20:4).
In the Old Testament, whenever God appears to
human beings, a brilliant light or fire indicates his
presence, but his person is never actually
described (Genesis 15:17; Exodus 3:2, 14:24, 19:18;
1 Kings 18:38). Sometimes an angel of God
appears in bodily form and speaks on behalf of
God (Joshua 5:13–15). Other times, God seems to
make himself known to people; Moses and a
group of leaders, for example, are said to “see”
God in Exodus 24: 9–10. But once again, the text
doesn’t actually describe him; rather, it tells
what’s visible “under his feet” — namely, a
translucent sapphire-colored pavement. The
book of Numbers describes Moses’s frequent
face-to-face conversations with the Lord
(Numbers 12:8). But yet again, Numbers never
describes exactly what that form entails. When
Isaiah is commissioned to be a prophet, he
“sees” the Lord seated on a throne (Isaiah 6:1–3).
However, the prophet chooses to focus on the
flowing robe and the seraphim who surround the
throne, not the actual appearance of God.
Okay, so the Old Testament does dare to
describe God using visual imagery a few times.
But the language in these cases is always
metaphorical. In the book of Daniel, God is
called “the Ancient of Days,” and his clothing is
“white as snow; the hair of his head [. . .] white
like wool” (Daniel 7:9). In a vision of the mobile
throne chariot, Ezekiel describes the glory of
God as a “figure like that of a man.” He also
depicts this figure from the waist up as being
“glowing metal,” and from the waist down, “he
looked like fire” (Ezekiel 1:26–27). Significantly,
these Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel passages pro-
vide the background imagery for John’s vision
of the exalted Jesus in the throne room in
Revelation 4:2–6 (as well as Rev. 1:2–16, 20:11).
The New Testament is consistent with the Old
Testament prohibition against representing God
the Father in bodily form (John 1:18; 1 Timothy
6:16). However, because Jesus is the Son of God
in the flesh (John 1:14; Romans 1:3; Colossians
1:19, 2:9; 1 John 1:1–2, 4:2), the New Testament
writings break with their Jewish heritage by
affirming that the glory of God is actually seen
“in the face of Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6; John
14:9). It’s worth noting, however, that nowhere
do the Gospels or other New Testament writings
actually give a physical description of Jesus.
Perhaps this striking absence underscores an
important New Testament concept, which is
highlighted in the book of Revelation: Jesus,
though born an ethnic Jew (Galatians 4:4), is the
redeemer of people “from every nation, from all
tribes and peoples and languages” (Rev. 7:9;
see also John 3:16).

This scene marks a turning point in Revelation. From chapter 4 through 
chapter 21— which chronicles the grand finale of history — John’s perspec-
tive alternates between heaven and earth. He experiences a series of visions
in which he witnesses various scenes, some taking place in heaven, others
happening on earth. All these visions relate in some way to the final triumph
of the kingdom of God.
In this section, we follow John on a guided tour of the throne room. He first
describes, in highly symbolic language, the one seated on the throne. Then,
starting from the outside and working inward, he depicts three different
classes of beings who circle the throne.
Seeing who takes the seat
Just after John is transported through the door to heaven, his focus fixes 
on a throne: “At once I was in the spirit, and there in heaven stood a throne,
with one seated on the throne! And the one seated there looks like jasper and
carnelian, and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald”
(Rev. 4:2). By the time John completes his tour of the throne room (Rev. 5:13),
it’s clear that everything in the universe revolves around this magnificent
throne.
A throne signifies rule, authority, and power. In theological terms, John’s
vision of the throne is all about the sovereignty of God. This is the central
theme that he emphasizes over and over again in the book of Revelation.
Reflecting his Jewish background, John resorts to traditional images and
metaphors to describe the presence of God on his throne. Precious gem-
stones, a rainbow, thunder and lightning, and a crystal sea all serve to depict
God’s presence but not his person. The invisible God “shows himself” by
means of a dazzling light show while his heavenly entourage surrounds him
in worship.
Debating when believers 
go up, up, and away
Okay, this may seem like an odd place to bring this up, but some commenta-
tors do attempt to link John’s visionary ascent into heaven with what’s
referred to as the rapture. The rapture is the event when all believers (as
defined by the Bible) who are living on the earth are taken up into heaven. 
If you’re familiar with the popular Left Behind series of books, then you’re
familiar with the idea.
145
Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)

Linking John’s ascent to heaven with the rapture sparks fierce debate. The
question is this: Does John’s ascent correspond to the “rapture of the
church”? That is, does John here represent the view that all true believers
will be caught up to be with Jesus just before the End Time judgments begin?
The Tribulation is usually identified as Daniel’s 70th week (Daniel 9:20–27 —
see Chapter 3), and it consists of the judgments depicted in Revelation 6–18
under the symbols of seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls (see
Chapters 9, 10, and 12 for details). Some people believe the rapture will
happen before or after the Tribulation period is complete. Others believe 
that the rapture will take place during the period of Tribulation. Here, we
offer brief summaries of the key arguments for each view.
Making the great escape: The pre-trib rapture
The pre-tribulation (pre-trib) teaching, widespread in evangelical circles,
holds that before the Great Tribulation, Jesus will remove his people from 
the earth, sparing them from the judgments that fall on an unbelieving world.
It’s labeled the pre-tribulation view because Jesus returns for the church prior
to the last seven-year period of earth history. Arguments in favor of this view
include the following:
 Pre-trib adherents believe that God wouldn’t inflict such suffering and
misery on his chosen people. Proponents appeal to texts such as 1
Thessalonians 5:9 for support: “For God did not appoint us to suffer
wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.” This 
argument generally carries the most weight in pre-trib circles.
 The account of John’s rapture (Rev. 4:1–2) immediately follows the mes-
sages to the seven churches (Rev. 2–3). Each message was addressed to
the angel (or messenger) of that particular church. The angels seem to
function as representatives of each church. This may suggest that John
himself functions as a representative figure for the entire church in 4:1.
 The word for church (ekkl_sia in Greek) drops out of the text after
Revelation 3:22 and doesn’t reappear until the very end of the book at
22:16. Thus, the church isn’t explicitly mentioned during the Tribulation
(chapters 6–18). Pre-tribulationists believe this silence suggests that 
the church is raptured before the Tribulation.
 Because Jesus told his disciples his coming would be “like a thief” (Luke
12:39) and “no one knows the day nor the hour,” (Matthew 24:36), the
rapture supposedly can’t follow any known or prophesied event. This
leads to what is sometimes called the any moment rapture view. The
imminence of the rapture rules out any preliminary signs. Therefore, the
rapture must take place before the predicted seals, trumpets, and bowls
occur. Consequently, John’s being caught up to heaven in Revelation 4:1
most likely represents the rapture of the church because it can’t be
dated and it precedes the judgments that follow. This interpretation 
preserves the pre-trib insistence on the imminence of the rapture.
146
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Several bestselling authors have promoted the pre-tribulation position over
the years. In 1970, Hal Lindsey published a blockbuster book, The Late Great
Planet Earth, incorporating the pre-trib rapture scheme. More recently (1995),
Tim LaHaye (with Jerry Jenkins) burst on the scene with his immensely 
popular Left Behind series.
Staying till the end: The post-trib rapture
Those who hold to the post-tribulation (post-trib) view argue that Jesus won’t
return and the church won’t be raptured until after the Tribulation. They
offer the following arguments in support:
 Post-tribulationists agree that God won’t inflict his wrath on members 
of the church. But that’s different from saying he’ll protect believers
from the wrath of the Antichrist. The bowl judgments are all directed at
the Antichrist and his followers. Just like the Hebrews in Egypt were pro-
tected from some of the plagues (Exodus 8:20–12:30), so God protects
his people from the bowl judgments of the End Times. The exhortation
to be faithful unto death in the face of the persecution by the Antichrist
is directed to the first Christian readers (Rev. 13:9–13). This sounds
hollow if in fact no Christians actually experience such a persecution.
 John’s ascent closely resembles Jewish and Christian accounts of other
ascents to heaven. In all these other cases, the individual doesn’t repre-
sent a collective entity, so adherents say the same is true with John’s
ascent.
 Although the word for church doesn’t appear in Revelation 4:1–22:15,
post-tribulationists declare that this doesn’t mean the church is gone
during this period. Clearly, some individuals put their trust in Jesus
throughout the period of the Tribulation (Rev. 7:14–17). To call them
“Tribulation saints” without acknowledging that they, too, are part of 
the church seems arbitrary.
 The imminence of Jesus’s coming hardly rules out precursors. Although
Jesus specified that one can’t know the day or hour, that’s not the same
thing as month or year. Paul seems to indicate that at least two things
must first occur before the rapture; namely, a great apostasy (a falling
away from faith and trust in Jesus) and the appearance of Antichrist (2
Thessalonians 2:1–12). An event that’s imminent or impending may quite
properly have precursors and yet not be precisely datable.
Clearing out at halftime: The mid-trib rapture
Those who hold to a mid-tribulation (mid-trib) view believe the rapture
occurs approximately 3.5 years into the seven-year Tribulation, usually 
identified with Daniel’s 70th week (Daniel 9:20–27). As a compromise posi-
tion, this view incorporates arguments from both the pre-tribulation and
post-tribulation views. Distinctive arguments are as follows:
147
Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)

 The last trumpet of 1 Corinthians 15:52 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is 
identified with the seventh trumpet of Revelation 11:15–18. The seventh
trumpet in Revelation occurs just after the halfway point of the final
seven years. This is based on Revelation 11:3, in which 42 months and
1,260 days equal 3.5 years.
 The two witnesses of Revelation 11, who are martyred in the middle of
the Tribulation, may symbolize the church and thus mark the moment 
of the rapture of the church.
 According to mid-tribulationists, the seven seals and trumpets of
Revelation 6–8 are not judgments; rather, they’re the “beginning 
of the birth pangs” that Jesus refers to in the Olivet Discourse 
(Matthew 24:8 — see Chapter 3 for more on the Olivet Discourse).
 God’s wrath doesn’t begin until Revelation 11:18, when mid-
tribulationists believe the church will be in heaven.
Minority positions on the rapture question
Some tweak the mid-tribulationist view and espouse a pre-wrath rapture,
occurring just before the bowl judgments of Revelation 15–16 are poured 
out on the Antichrist and unbelievers.
Others maintain a partial-tribulationist view, which agrees with the pre-
tribulationist position in regard to timing but differs in one important qualifi-
cation: Only believers who are walking in fellowship with Jesus are raptured
before the Tribulation. Disobedient believers will be “left behind” with 
unbelievers and not resurrected or transformed until Jesus’s Second Coming
proper, the so-called “revelation of Christ” at the end of the Tribulation.
These last two options are definitely minority positions.
Concluding with a word of advice
Attempting a definitive position on the timing of the rapture is probably
much ado about nothing. The book of Revelation begins and ends with a
prophecy and a promise that Jesus will return (Rev. 1:7, 22:20), and the
148

Heaven according to Enoch
An example of a visionary ascent features the
patriarch Enoch who, according to the Bible,
lived prior to the great flood of Noah. “Enoch
walked with God; then he was no more, because
God took him away” (Genesis 5:24). Enoch was
the perfect candidate for a supposed ascent to
the throne room — after all, the Bible implies he
was “translated” to heaven.
An anonymous Jewish writer, some two cen-
turies before Jesus, composed The Book of the
Watchers, which narrates the celestial travels of
Enoch. This book, now part of a larger compos-
ite work called 1 Enoch, goes into considerable
detail describing the throne room and its sur-
roundings (1 Enoch 14:8–19:3). There are striking
parallels to Revelation 4–5.

church’s creeds (statements of belief) proclaim the fact that Jesus will 
return but don’t attempt to set the time of his coming. Debating the precise
time shouldn’t be an occasion for contention or suspicion. Perhaps a 
pan-tribulation view is best — everything will pan out in the end!
Circling the throne
As Revelation 4 unfolds, John describes the heavenly court that circles the
throne (the three distinct groups are in italics):
“Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones
are twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on 
their heads. Coming from the thrones are flashes of lightning, and rum-
blings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne burn seven flaming
torches, which are the seven spirits of God: and in front of the throne
there is something like a sea of glass, like crystal. Around the throne, and
on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front
and behind.” (Rev. 4:4–6)
Thus, John’s description of the heavenly court consists of three circles:
 Twenty-four elders sit in the outer perimeter, each sitting on his own
throne.
 A second circle, inside the elders, consists of seven blazing lamps,
which John identifies as the “seven spirits of God.”
 Within this circle lay one last quartet surrounding the throne.
In this section, we explore the occupants of these circles.
The 24 elders
John describes the 24 elders as wearing an interesting combination of
priestly and kingly threads — white garments and golden crowns. But who
exactly are these 24 elders? On this point, there’s considerable disagreement.
The most popular theories say that the 24 elders are
 Glorified humans who represent the entire people of God, composed 
of both Jews and gentiles
 Glorified humans who represent only the New Testament church
 The 24 star-gods of the ancient Babylonian pantheon (a temple of 
the gods)
 Angels patterned after the 24 priestly orders of the Old Testament 
(1 Chronicles 24:6–19)
 Angels who symbolize the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 Apostles
149
Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)

The glorified-humans perspective is popular in many evangelical circles. But
many scholars argue that the immediate context rules out the idea that the
elders are glorified humans because the elders later speak of human beings
in the third person (emphasis ours): “You have made them to be a kingdom
and priests serving our God, and they will reign on earth” (Rev. 5:10). This
seems to show a clear distinction between the elders and human beings.
The theory that John is referring to Babylonian mythology is even more
unlikely. Biblical writers occasionally adapt ancient mythological ideas —
indeed, several instances occur in the book of Revelation itself. But the writ-
ers use these references only when they’re fully consistent with the basic 
theological foundation of Scripture. What’s more, it’s quite unlikely that John
would feel a need to describe the heavenly throne room in terms of a pagan
myth, given his extensive knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures.
The idea that the 24 elders represent angels receives strong support from a
large number of scholars. In Jewish tradition, the Tabernacle was patterned
after a heavenly sanctuary in which angelic beings worshiped God. There 
are many examples of this in the Old Testament, including Exodus 25:9, 25:40,
26:30; Isaiah 6:1–5; and Ezekiel 40–48. This perspective is thus consistent with
Scripture by holding that the 24 elders represent heavenly choirs singing
praises to God in his heavenly sanctuary.
The seven spirits
John describes the seven spirits as “seven flaming torches” (Rev. 4:5). Exactly
who or what they are is highly debated. The Bible often associates fire and
dazzling light with God’s presence. As a result, these beings almost certainly
represent God himself or creatures that serve in the immediate presence of
God. Many scholars aren’t satisfied with this vague conclusion and thus aim
for a more precise definition of the seven spirits. Here are three opinions:

Reflections of heaven
The notion that an earthly sanctuary is a replica
of a heavenly one goes back into ancient Near
Eastern thought. For example, in a creation epic
called Enumah Elish dating to the second mil-
lennium BCE, the sanctuary of the chief
Babylonian god Marduk is patterned after a
heavenly prototype.
Closer in time to the book of Revelation are the
Dead Sea Scrolls. Among these more than 900
separate manuscripts are the Songs of the
Sabbath Sacrifice. They refer to a heavenly
Temple with elaborate rituals and liturgies car-
ried out by angelic priests. The Qumran commu-
nity (who maintained the Dead Sea Scrolls)
apparently believed their liturgical services mir-
rored that of the angelic worship above — hence
the necessity of doing everything “decently and
in order.” The Apostle Paul may reflect a similar
view in his letter to the Corinthians concerning
orderly worship (1 Corinthians 11:10).

 Some scholars detect a symbolic significance in the number seven — the
number of completeness and perfection — and prefer to identify them
as the sevenfold activity of the Holy Spirit as enumerated in Isaiah 11:2.
 Others are content simply to identify them as an angelic order like the
seraphim and cherubim.
 A final group considers the seven spirits to be the seven archangels
mentioned in Jewish apocalyptic traditions.
Viewing the seven spirits as archangels parallels the Jewish apocalyptic book
1 Enoch 20:1–7 (see the “Heaven according to Enoch” sidebar), which lists the
archangels’ names as follows: Michael, Gabriel, Suru’el (or Uriel or Phanuel),
Raphael, Raguel, Saraqa’el, and Remiel (in some manuscripts). These seven
angelic beings are explicitly said to stand in the presence of God (1 Enoch 9:1,
40:9), which is the same function the seven spirits perform in Revelation 8:2.
You can find some other interesting parallels as well. For instance, the
Apostle Paul refers to an archangel without giving a name in connection with
the rapture of the church in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. Even more significantly,
two of the archangels in Enoch are also mentioned in the Bible: Gabriel
(Daniel 8:16, 9:21; Luke 1:19, 1:26) and Michael (Daniel 10:13, 10:21, 12:1; Jude
9; and Rev. 12:7).
151
Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)
Flights of fancy and the four living creatures
The description of the four living creatures has
spawned several far-fetched interpretations
over the years. For example, Irenaeus, bishop of
Lyons (130–200 CE), thought each creature was
one of the four Gospels in the New Testament.
Some modern interpreters still see this as a 
possible interpretation. For example, one widely
used commentary suggests the following identi-
fication:
 The lion is the Gospel of John. A lion is a
kingly figure, and Matthew presents Jesus
as the King of the Jews.
 The ox is the Gospel of Luke. An ox is a
humble, servant figure, and Mark portrays
Jesus as the servant of the Lord.
 The man is the Gospel of Matthew. The
man matches Luke’s depiction of the
humanity of Jesus, the Son of Man.
 The flying eagle is the Gospel of Mark. The
eagle describes John’s soaring portrait of
the divine Son of God.
From our perspective, John would’ve been quite
surprised by these highly creative interpreta-
tions! The four living creatures are part of a
standard, Jewish, apocalyptic worldview that
John shares and which derives from Daniel and
Ezekiel. In neither of these biblical books is
there the slightest suggestion that the creatures
represent anything other than angelic beings.

The four living creatures
The group of four living creatures is closest to the throne. Here is John’s
description of them:
“Around the throne, and on each side of the throne, are four living crea-
tures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion,
the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with a face
like a human face, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. And
the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes 
all around and inside. Day and night without ceasing they sing, ‘Holy,
holy, holy, the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and is and is to come.’”
(Rev. 4:6–8)
This description seems drawn from two Old Testament prophets: Ezekiel’s
vision of the mobile throne chariot (Ezekiel 1 and 10) and the seraphim 
in the book of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:2–3) who constantly worship “the Lord God
Almighty.” Because Ezekiel 10 explicitly calls the living creatures cherubim,
this name seems the most likely identification in Revelation 4 as well.
An ode to the one on the throne
As Revelation 4 concludes, the elders sing a hymn to the “someone” on the
throne:
“The twenty-four elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne
and worship the one who lives forever and ever; they cast their crowns
before the throne, singing: ‘You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive
glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will
they existed and were created.’” (Rev. 4:10–11)
The praise song in Revelation 4 underscores the central theme of the vision
of the throne room vision — namely, the sovereignty of God. In this passage,
John says that all creation owes its existence to God and all created beings
are obliged to praise him for his glory, honor, and power.
John’s original audience — the Christians of Asia Minor — may actually 
have sung this hymn of Revelation 4:11 in their worship services. A number
of modern scholars have drawn attention to liturgical elements (prescribed
forms of public worship) incorporated into the book of Revelation.
In the end, the message of Revelation 4 is clear: Believers need not fear what
Caesar or any worldly empire may do to them. God is on his throne, and all
will be right with the world when all is said and done.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Singing Praise to the Lamb with 
Scroll-Opening Skills (5:1–14)
As chapter 5 opens, John’s attention turns to a sealed scroll in God’s right
hand, a scroll of immense importance: “Then I saw in the right hand of the
one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back,
sealed with seven seals” (Rev. 5:1). In this section, we describe John’s vision
of the heavenly scroll and a heavenly person who is qualified to open the
scroll. The angelic choirs sing his virtues and achievements.
Examining a mysterious scroll
What kind of document is the mysterious scroll in Revelation 5:1? In the first
century, books were in scroll format, not codex (a manuscript in book form).
Codex, a Christian innovation, did not become dominant until the second
century. In this section, we examine this scroll.
Where there’s a will, there’s a way to open it
Because a scroll, made of papyrus, parchment, or vellum (calfskin), is rolled
up when not in use, you have to unroll it to read its contents. This scroll in
Revelation is not an ordinary document because it has seven seals along the
outside edge (Figure 8-1 shows a sealed scroll). This suggests a very impor-
tant, probably legal, document (see Jeremiah 32:9–15). A last will and testa-
ment fits this description. Such a document would be sealed by the testator
(the one who makes the will) and verified by witnesses. Only after the death
of the testator would the seals be broken and the scroll unrolled.
If the scroll is a last will and testament, this throws light on a major purpose
of the book of Revelation. A will is a legal document declaring how an individ-
ual wishes his or her estate to be distributed after death. To be valid, it must
possess two kinds of information:
 A list of the heirs
 A description of the estate
Figure 8-1:
A papyrus

three seals.
153
Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)

According to Revelation, exactly that kind of information is eventually
revealed. In Revelation 3:5, those who overcome at Sardis (one of the seven
churches — see Chapter 7) are promised their names will not be blotted out
of “the book of life.” John mentions a book of life in Revelation 20:12, at the
Last Judgment of the great white throne. This seems to be the scroll listing 
all the heirs, those who believe in Jesus. Then, immediately afterward, comes
an extensive section describing the new earth and the new Jerusalem (Rev.
21:1–22:6) — the real estate and possessions bequeathed to the heirs. All 
this fits quite nicely the notion that the sealed scroll is a will.
There is, of course, a distinctive twist. In this case, the one who made the 
will — Jesus, the Son of God — did in fact die; but he also came back to life
and now bequeaths his vast estate to those who believe in him. They become
joint heirs (Romans 8:17; 1 Corinthians 3:22–23).
Reading the book of destiny
Some things aren’t neatly accounted for, suggesting that the scroll is more
than a will. After the scroll is opened (Rev. 8:1), you discover that the scroll
also includes divine judgments that are poured out on unbelievers before the
heirs enter into their inheritance (Rev 8:2–18:24).
In addition to being a will, the scroll is a book of destiny. According to the
Bible, what’s recorded there must come to pass. This idea of a predetermined
course of history is completely in character with apocalyptic thought. The
sovereign God is not sitting on his throne, nervously wringing his hands and
wondering what on earth is going to happen next. Rather, he’s calmly survey-
ing an unfolding story whose every twist and turn is within his knowledge and
control. The scroll serves to remind first-century readers of a fundamental
Christian conviction: God is the controller of everything that happens.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Lord of all he surveys: God’s cosmic surveillance
At one point in Return of the Jedi, episode six
of the Star Wars trilogy, the Galactic Emperor,
in his Death Star battle station, sits in the con-
trol room, surrounded by a battery of video
monitors. He views what’s going on in various
locations of the galaxy. On one monitor, he sees
Han Solo and Princess Leia trying to gain
access to the shield generator protecting the
Death Star. Everything, it seems, is under his
surveillance.
The Bible teaches that on an infinitely greater
scale, the one on the throne in Revelation is
immediately and continuously aware of all that
happens in his universe. Psalm 139 celebrates
this all-knowing, all-present, all-powerful God
who cares deeply for his children. Unlike the evil
emperor, God has good intentions and purposes
to save his people from sin. The believers in Asia
Minor may rest assured: Their heavenly Father is
aware of everything happening in their lives.

Double-siding the scroll
The scroll has writing on both sides of the parchment. Ordinarily, one would
write only on the side with the fibers running horizontally — the recto side —
because the ink goes on more smoothly. This would be the inside of the
scroll. The outside or opposite side — the verso — has the fibers running
vertically. This means that as you write across the page, the pen must cross
minute ridges of the vertically aligned fibers. The writing may not always be
as legible on the verso side, with occasional smudges or blots in the ink.
Still, if you needed more space, you could use the verso because parchment
was a rare commodity. The significance of this little detail is considerable:
The scroll contains so much information that both sides of the parchment
must be used (a similar idea occurs in Ezekiel 2:10). The list of the heirs is a
long one — many names are “written down in heaven.” Revelation 7 confirms
this idea as the multitude of the redeemed is so large that “no one could
count” its number (Rev. 7:9).
Handling a crisis in the throne room
At this moment, a crisis occurs in John’s vision (Rev. 5:2–4). An angel issues a
challenge: “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” To John’s
dismay and grief, no one steps forward, nor does he volunteer.
In a visionary trance, the seer’s senses are heightened; he or she sees, hears,
touches, and tastes more sharply. Emotions are intense. John weeps and sobs
openly. Clearly, the scroll must be opened if its contents are to become real.
This is the book of destiny containing the course of redemptive history and
its completion. If no one opens and reads the scroll, the kingdom of God
won’t come in all its fullness. No wonder John weeps.
But not to fear! A worthy candidate is waiting in the wings. With a curt com-
mand to cease crying, the angel announces the lineage of the worthy one (Rev.
5:5). He is none other than the great Lion of Judah (Genesis 49:9; Numbers
24:17) and the Root of David (Isaiah 4:2, 11:1). These dynastic titles, which
refer to the royal house of David, are deeply rooted in Old Testament history.
After the collapse of David’s dynasty in 586 BCE, they were reinterpreted as
references to the promised Messiah — who would overthrow Israel’s enemies
and regather the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland (Jeremiah 23:5,
33:15; Zechariah 3:8, 6:12). By the first century CE, many Jews maintained a
hope for one of David’s descendants who would rescue and redeem them from
oppression. Jesus, as one of those descendents, is sometimes referred to as
the Son of David.
Varying messianic expectations coexisted within first-century Judaism. Among
them was the hope of a Messiah from the house of David. A Jewish writing
dating to the mid-first century BCE already gives expression to this hope
(Psalms of Solomon 17:21–46). Similar sentiments appear in Jewish apocalyptic
155
Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)

texts (4 Ezra 11–12; Testament of Judah 24:1–5; Testament of Dan 5:10–13; and
Florilegium 1:10–13, 18–19). The New Testament Gospels also witness to this
belief among the Jewish people of Palestine in the first century CE (Matthew
2:1–6, 17:10–12, 22:41–45).
Not your ordinary lamb
What John sees next is stunning, and we have to admit, a little weird: “Then 
I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders 
a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth” (Rev. 5:6).
Because apocalyptic literature uses metaphors and imagery as symbols,
you’re correct to assume there’s a lot more to this lamb than meets the eye —
or eyes.
This lamb has been “slain,” graphically indicated by its slit throat, the man-
dated way to slaughter an animal according to Jewish tradition. But this lamb
is still very much alive! Miraculously, the lamb survived death and now reigns
alongside the One on the throne.
Slain for sins
The background of the slain-lamb image lies in the Old Testament sacrificial
system. In ancient Israel, Jews ate meat only after first offering it up in sacri-
fice to the God of Israel. In other words, the eating of meat (from the herd 
or flock — that is, a bull, male sheep, or goat) always took place in a ritual/
worship context. The worshiper brought a sacrificial animal that was blemish
free, the best he possessed. After laying hands on the head of the animal,
symbolizing a transfer of guilt, he slaughtered it.
The long-established method of killing the animal was by slitting the carotid
artery of the neck, the most painless and humane way to do it. The blood was
poured out at the base of the altar (blood wasn’t eaten because it served as
the cleansing agent whereby the guilt and stain of sin was removed and thus
rendered anyone who touched or ingested it “unclean”).
The book of Leviticus contains a handbook for priests on how to sacrifice 
animals and which animals were appropriate for the various occasions and
offenses (Leviticus 1–16). If one sinned, the sacrificial ritual, accompanied 
by genuine repentance, restored the sinner to fellowship with God.
The New Testament is saturated with sacrificial imagery in its depiction of
what Jesus did on the cross. By his death, says the Bible, he atones for the
sins of the world (1 John 2:2) and reconciles sinners to God (2 Corinthians
5:16–21). Like the Old Testament sacrificial animals and the Passover Lamb,
Jesus is without moral blemish. By shedding his blood, he effectively removes
the contagion of sin and averts God’s righteous wrath against sinners.
156
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Protecting the Israelites
Central to Israel’s life and worship was the feast of Passover, celebrating
Israel’s liberation from slavery in Egypt. The tenth plague, the death of the
firstborn, came upon all Egyptians who didn’t recognize the God of Israel.
The Israelites gained protection from the destroying angel by slaughtering a
lamb and daubing its blood on the doorframes of their homes (Exodus
11–13). The plague “passed over” the Israelite homes. By means of the blood
of a lamb, without blemish and a year-old male, the people of Israel were
saved. The family members then roasted and ate the lamb.
This ancient festival, the longest, continually observed religious festival
known to history, provides part of the New Testament imagery that explains
what Jesus did for humanity by dying on a cross (John 1:29).
The Lord’s Supper (Communion or the Eucharist) reenacts Jesus’s death on
the cross and powerfully reinforces what Jesus did to save his people. As
Christians eat the bread and drink the wine, as in the ancient Passover meal,
they celebrate their deliverance from the power of sin and death (Romans
3:21–26). And how can Christians be sure Jesus’s death really accomplishes
what the New Testament says it does? Because they’re convinced that Jesus
is alive and well at the right hand of the Father! Jan van Eck’s painting (Figure
8-2) from the altarpiece at the Cathedral of Saint Bavon visually depicts the
living, slain Lamb in glory.

Chapter 8: Peeking into the Throne Room (4:1–5:14)

Master of the universe
In Revelation, the Lamb stands in the center of the throne. Silence hangs 
over the throne room. The moment of truth has arrived. The Lamb takes the
seven-sealed scroll from the right hand of the one seated on the throne (Rev.
5:7). How does a lamb pick up a scroll? Honestly, we don’t know, but perhaps
he takes it in his mouth. However he does it, the angelic singers immediately
prostrate themselves and erupt in a hymn of praise to the Lamb (5:8–10).
Why is there so much rejoicing by the heavenly hosts (the angelic beings who
surround the throne)? The description of the Lamb having “seven horns and
seven eyes” offers a clue:
 Horns: John doesn’t decode the horns, but they’re standard apocalyptic
terminology for power. The seven horns speak of fullness and perfect-
ion of power. In other words, the Lamb possesses the kind of power
associated with God himself — he’s omnipotent, all-powerful.
 Eyes: The seven eyes are explicitly identified as the seven spirits of God,
possibly indicating that the Lamb has authority over the highest angelic
beings. Angels function as his “eyes” and convey to him exhaustive
knowledge. If, however, the seven spirits represent the Holy Spirit, then
the Lamb possesses the Holy Spirit to the nth degree. With either inter-
pretation, the Lamb is aware of everything that transpires on earth; he’s
omniscient, all-knowing.
Here’s the bottom line: The Lamb is a divine being in his own right alongside
the one on the throne. Already, in symbolic imagery, you see the outlines of 
a teaching that’s later enshrined in the great creeds (statements of belief) 
of Christianity — namely, the doctrine of the Trinity: three persons (Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit) in one God. John’s vision of the throne room depicts 
a profound paradox: The Lamb is a God-man.
John’s Gospel and Paul’s letters chime in with complementary portraits of 
a preexistent, divine being through whom all things were made and through
whom all things are reconciled (John 1:1–14; 1 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians
5:19; Philippians 2:6–11; Colossians 1:15–20, 2:9; 1 Timothy 2:16).
The Lamb holds the seven-sealed scroll; he is master of the universe. He
determines the course of history and its ultimate outcome. He has a set 
purpose and goal, namely to create a new people and a new heaven and
earth. In short, he intends to make “all things new” (Rev. 21:5).
The chapter concludes with a visual and auditory celebration of the sover-
eignty of the Lamb (Rev. 5:11–14). John now enlarges the circles around the
throne (see “Circling the throne,” earlier in this chapter). Beyond the elders,
an enormous multitude of angelic beings form an even larger circle. John
uses the highest number he can conceive of to convey the magnitude — 
“ten thousand times ten thousand.” They join in the chorus of praise and
adore the Lamb who is worthy of a sevenfold tribute — the number of 
perfection and completion.

his chapter has nothing to do with those adorable whiskered aquatic
mammals that bark, smack their flippers together, and balance beach
balls on their noses. Although these seven seals do sort of bark, they also
bite and are not at all cute. Like adhesive flaps on envelopes, these seals
serve as locks securing the very serious contents of a special scroll.
Taken together, the seven seals of Revelation 6:1–8:1 are much like a master
key to a building. If you have the right master key, then unlocking doors is a
straightforward task. But with the wrong key, getting inside may be impossi-
ble. That’s why we believe unlocking this section of the book of Revelation,
discussing the seven seals, is crucial to understanding the entire book.
Getting a good grip on the themes and imagery related to the seals helps the
rest of the imagery and timelines fall into place.
In this chapter, you discover how the seven seals in Revelation 6:1–8:1 pre-
view the events that lead up to and climax with Jesus’s return to earth. You
also see how Old Testament references to the End Times and the return of
Jesus explain much of the imagery in this section of Revelation. The chapter
concludes with suggestions about the meaning of the mysterious 144,000
whom God has sealed on their foreheads.

Unsealing the Beginning of the End
In Revelation 5 (see Chapter 8), the Lamb emerges as the only being worthy
to take the scroll, break its seals, and thereby reveal its contents (Rev. 5:5). 
In Revelation 6, the Lamb now breaks the seals — an act that triggers a series
of events leading to his triumph. John watches as one of the four living crea-
tures around the throne calls upon other creatures, each of which plays a
part in the unfolding of this cosmic drama.
Exploring the relationship of 
the three series of sevens
The Old Testament prophets warned that before the kingdom of God tri-
umphs, fearful judgments will impact the earth. They refer to this time of
intense suffering as the Day of the Lord (Isaiah 13, 34; Jeremiah 4–7; Ezekiel 7,
25; Amos 5:18–29; Zephaniah 1–3). Although John doesn’t use that term, his
prophecy picks up this concept and organizes it into three series of seven
judgments. This section explains how these judgments compare.
The number of judgments in each series may derive from the ancient doom
prophecy in Leviticus 26. There, the Lord forewarns his people Israel, “And if
in spite of this you will not obey me, I will continue to punish you sevenfold
for your sins” (Leviticus 26:18); this warning repeats three more times in the
same chapter (26:21, 26:24, 26:28). At any rate, in apocalyptic writing, the
number seven typically signifies that which is complete, finished, or perfect.
For example, when the last series of seven bowls are about to be poured out,
John comments, “For with them the wrath of God is ended” (Rev. 15:1).
Timing
In Revelation, the seven seals are the first of three sevens; the others are the
seven trumpets (Rev. 8:6–11:19) and the seven bowls (Rev. 15, 16). A key for
interpreting the central section of the book of Revelation is understanding
how the three series of sevens relate to each other. Several options are 
possible:
 Concurrent: The seals, trumpets, and bowls run parallel to each other
and end at the same point in time.
 Successive: The seals, trumpets, and bowls follow each other in chrono-
logical sequence. On this view, the three series are like an expandable
telescope.
 Both: The arrangement of the seals, trumpets, and bowls combines both
successive and concurrent elements, ending at the same point.
160
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The third option appears to make the most sense (but you’re welcome to dis-
agree!). John designates the sixth seal as the day of the wrath of God and the
Lamb (6:16–17). The succeeding series of trumpet and bowl judgments elabo-
rate on the sixth seal, with this exception: All three series end at the same
point — the triumph of the kingdom of God. This interpretation means that
trumpets 1 through 6 expand on the sixth seal, and bowls 1 through 6 cover
much the same ground, though most likely they occur near the end of the
sixth seal or Day of the Lord, just before Jesus returns. The upshot is that
much of Revelation 8–19 involves the unfolding of the sixth seal. Perhaps the
best way to get a handle on this is scheme through the diagram in Figure 9-1.
Because of the obvious parallels between the judgments in the seven trum-
pets and the seven bowls, some scholars contend that these are actually 
parallel passages describing the same events. Although the seven trumpets
and bowls are virtually identical in terms of the focus of their judgments, 
you shouldn’t necessarily conclude that these are meant to describe the
same events. Rather, these passages appear to best describe a sequence of
events — an escalation of severity from a series of partial judgments to a 
final set of really, really nasty ones. John even refers to the bowls as “the
seven last plagues” (italics ours) in 15:1, clearly indicating sequence.
Scope
The content of the seals appears less intensive and extensive than that of 
the trumpets and bowls. The seals affect only a quarter of the earth: “They
[Death and Hades] were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with
sword, famine, and pestilence, and by the wild animals of the earth” (6:8). By
contrast, the trumpet judgments affect a third of the earth (8:7–12), and the
bowl judgments are completely global. By then, poor ol’ planet earth is
maxed out!

Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)

Breaking the seals to gain 
access to the scroll
Visualize how you’d open a sealed scroll. Instead of a book containing a set 
of bound pages, think of a roll of papyrus (an early form of paper) several feet
long. String tied around the scroll prevented it from unraveling. To this was
added a clay seal impressed with the owner’s signature. An intact seal guar-
anteed the authenticity of the document and provided evidence that no one
had tampered with the contents. See Figure 9-2.
The scroll in Revelation 5–8 has seven such seals. To open the scroll, some-
one first has to break all seven seals. More than a few interpreters go awry
here by failing to realize this rather fundamental point: The seals are not 
the contents of the scroll! They’re preliminary events that have to happen
before the contents can be read. The sealed scroll is a last will and testament
(see Chapter 8). In it are the names of the heirs and a description of their
inheritance. Before the heirs receive their inheritance, certain events must
first unfold.
Scoping out the seven seals
The seven seals in Revelation 6:1–8:1 fall into four categories:
 The first four seals: Identified as horsemen on four differently colored
horses, these seals depict terrestrial events.
 The fifth seal: Though not depicted as a horse and rider, this seal is
closely associated with the first four. It provides a heavenly perspective:
a brief snapshot of Christian martyrs (killed because of their beliefs)
beneath an altar, crying out for justice.
 The sixth seal: This seal brings the reader to a display of terrifying dis-
turbances on the earth and in the heavens, including the sun’s turning
black, stars’ falling to earth, and the moon’s becoming red as blood.
 The seventh seal: After a parenthetical section consisting of two
explanatory visions, the last seal issues in silence in heaven, a quite
unexpected result.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The arrangement of the seals significantly affects the overall interpretation 
of the section. The evils occurring during the first five seals generally result
from human depravity (even famines have a human component in that
they’re often a byproduct of war). Injustice, inequality, prejudice, hate, greed,
lust for power, and lack of self-control contribute to much of the human 
suffering characterizing the present age. The fourth and sixth seals add so-
called natural disasters to the mix. But when the Lamb breaks the seventh
seal in Revelation 8:1 and the scroll can at last be opened and read, John
delays explaining what happens. We describe the individual seals in detail
later in this chapter.
Comparing notes with Jesus
The synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke — every Gospel except
John’s) provide a key to unlocking the meaning of the seals. In Revelation,
everything under the first seven seals parallels a message Jesus gave to his
disciples. This teaching — in which Jesus explains what will happen before
the end of the world — is commonly known as the Olivet Discourse (named
after the Mount of Olives, where he gave this teaching); it appears in Matthew
24:3–44, Mark 13:3–37, and Luke 21:7–36. In his teaching, Jesus emphasizes
that catastrophic events such as war, famine, earthquakes, pestilence, and
persecution will recur throughout the present age.
Table 9-1 shows how the seven seals parallel the teaching in which Jesus 
outlines the events leading up to and including his return to earth.

Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)

When Jesus lists the events in the Olivet Discourse, he doesn’t say they’re
specific signs of the end (Matthew 24:6); rather, he simply says, “All this 
is but the beginning of the birth pangs” (Matthew 24:8). The difference is 
significant. Jewish apocalyptic literature also commonly expected an intense
period of suffering, sometimes called the woes of Messiah, to precede the
Messiah’s appearance (1 Enoch 62:4; 2 Esdras 4:42; and Babylonian Talmud:
Tractate Sanhedrin 96b–97a). Note: The Jewish community by and large
rejected early Christians’ claim that Jesus was the expected Messiah. Most
Orthodox Jews (observing the rites and traditions of Judaism) today are still
awaiting the coming of their Messiah; meanwhile, non-observant Jews have,
for the most part, abandoned belief in a personal Messiah and think instead
in terms of a messianic age — that is, a future time of universal peace and
prosperity.
In short, the events Jesus foretells in both Revelation and the Gospels aren’t
simply items on a heavenly to-do list, dates in a calendar of events, or precise
indicators of the nearness of the end of time. Life between Jesus’s life on
earth (that ended with his death and resurrection) and his return to earth is
punctuated by disasters and devastating events, none of which is a sure sign
of Jesus’s immediate return. In fact, he cites only one specific accomplish-
ment that foreshadows his return: “And this good news of the kingdom will
be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and
then the end will come” (Matthew 24:14).
The First Four Seals: The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse (6:1–8)
Galloping forth like figures from a Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry dinner (think Harry Potter) come four horses and their riders. Each
one signifies disaster for the planet. The first four seals in Revelation 6 serve
as preliminaries leading up to the earth-shaking events connected with the
sixth seal.
Revelation portrays each of the first four seals as a differently colored horse
with a rider. John appears to be borrowing the imagery from the Old
Testament:
 In Zechariah 1:7–17, four angelic horsemen patrol the earth and are
mounted on red, sorrel (reddish brown), and white horses.
 In Zechariah 6:1–8, the prophet has a vision of four chariots pulled by
red, black, white, and dappled gray horses, respectively. The chariots
(driven by angelic charioteers) are identified with the four winds of the
earth, which patrol their respective regions.
164
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 Additionally, John may be drawing from Jeremiah’s prophecy of four
judgments (pestilence, sword, famine, and captivity) and four destroyers
(sword, dogs, birds, and wild animals) of the sinful people of Jerusalem
(Jeremiah 15:2–3).
 Ezekiel likewise prophesied “four deadly acts of judgment, sword,
famine, wild animals, and pestilence” against Jerusalem (Ezekiel 14:21).
In this section, we take a close look at John’s four horsemen of the 
apocalypse.
White horse and rider with a bow
This first seal is arguably the most difficult of the seven seals to interpret. 
In Revelation 6:2, John says, “I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider
had a bow; a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering and to
conquer.” Commentators are divided between two main interpretations of
who this rider on a white horse is:
 Jesus: This view is linked to Revelation 19:11–16, in which Jesus is
depicted riding a white horse in his triumphant return to earth.
 The Antichrist: This view argues that because the other three horses
represent negative, destructive forces, it’s more consistent that all four
share a common negative character.
So which is it? Well, keep in mind that white horses don’t always equate to the
good guys in white hats. Generals of armies in the ancient world frequently
rode white horses as a sign of prestige, not moral character. Furthermore, it
seems inappropriate for an angelic being to summon Jesus to go forth; being
summoned is more fitting for someone of lesser status and dignity. Also, the
bow in the hand of the rider on the white horse doesn’t seem appropriate for
Jesus and deviates from the references in Revelation where Jesus has a sword
issuing from his mouth (Rev. 1:16, 2:12, 2:16, 19:15). Bows in scriptural imagery
frequently convey a negative image of war and destruction (Jeremiah 6:23,
46:9, 49:35; Lamentations 2:4; Hosea 1:5, 1:7; Zechariah 9:10).
As we discuss in the earlier “Comparing notes with Jesus” section, the seven
seals seem to parallel Jesus’s teaching on the End Times in the Olivet
Discourse. There, the first thing Jesus warns his disciples about is false mes-
siahs (Matthew 24:4–5). Many commentators, therefore, suggest that the first
rider on the white horse is in fact the Antichrist, the great imitator (see
Chapter 11 for more on this bad boy).
In our view, the four horsemen represent conditions and circumstances 
characterizing human history from the first century until the present.
Consequently, the rider is not the Antichrist but false messiahs (supposed 
liberators of the Jews) who precede him. These pretenders were already
active in the first century; for example, they appear in connection with 
165
Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)

the Jewish war against Rome in 66–74 CE. The Jewish historian Josephus
described several false messiahs leading up to and during this conflict. John,
in his first epistle, says, “As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so 
now many antichrists have come” (1 John 2:18). The false messiahs triggered
revolutionary movements erupting in violence. Jewish Christians often 
suffered persecution from their fellow Jews because they didn’t join or 
identify with these revolutionary movements.
Red horse and rider who removes peace
Opening the second seal reveals another rider and horse. The rider depicted
in Revelation 6:3–4 is definitely a negative image: “When he opened the second
seal, I heard the second living creature call out, ‘Come!’ And out came another
horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that
people would slaughter one another; and he was given a great sword.”
The bright red color of the second horse graphically represents blood.
Bloodshed characterizes human history from the first century to the twenty-
first. The Roman Empire went through a particularly violent era during the
Jewish war of 66–73 CE and the power struggle following Nero’s suicide in 
68 CE. As many as a million casualties resulted from these conflicts. Though
bloodshed was not so widespread during the reign of Domitian, numerous
conflicts lay on the horizon. From then until now, the historical record docu-
ments a depressing recurrence of death and destruction owing to war. Fast
forward to today, where TV and computer screens bombard you with images
of violence, acts of terrorism, and oppression around the globe. Clearly,
despite the best human efforts, there has never been a golden age in which
murder and violence were absent from the world.
Black horse and rider with a pair of scales
As the Lamb opens the third seal, a fearful specter rides forth. In Revelation
6:5–6, John writes, “When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living
creature call out, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider 
held a pair of scales in his hand, and I heard what seemed to be a voice in 
the midst of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a day’s 
pay, and three quarts of barley for a day’s pay, but do not damage the olive
oil and the wine!’”
In this passage, a famine strikes, but not everyone suffers. The wealthy enjoy
luxuries while the poor can’t even afford necessities. An entire day’s wage 
(a denarius) is required just to feed one’s family — that’s an inflation rate 
166
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

12 times normal! As a result, many enter survival mode and settle for the less-
nutritious barley. The disparity in prices and commodities illustrates a 
distressing feature of human history: inequity and injustice.
Throughout the history of the Roman Empire, famines frequently ravaged the
population (Acts 11:27–30). Even today, graphic images of starving children
from sub-Saharan Africa regularly haunt our consciences. Never have greater
numbers lived on the brink of starvation than the twenty-first century. This
illustrates our overriding point that the first five seals characterize human
history from John’s day to our own. As we see it, they’ve already been broken
and are being actualized in human history. Never have we had an era when
famine was not a major concern for multitudes somewhere on the planet. The
same goes for each of the five seals.
Pale green horse and Death and Hades
As the Lamb opens the fourth seal, the Grim Reaper rides out on his pale
green mount: “When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
fourth living creature call out, ‘Come!’ I looked and there was a pale green
horse! Its rider’s name was Death, and Hades followed with him; they were
given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, and
pestilence, and by the wild animals of the earth” (Rev 6:7–8).
Death and Hades are closely linked: Death is the moment at which physical
life ceases; Hades is the continuing post-death existence of disembodied 
spirits. More specifically, Hades is the Greek term for the place of departed
spirits, typically regarded as the underworld. The New Testament views
Hades as a temporary place that’s ultimately destroyed at the end of the
world (Rev. 20:13–14).
This ghastly apparition speaks for itself. Pale green is chosen as the color of
this horse to depict the appearance of a rotting corpse. As a consequence 
of the red and black horses, Death stalks the land.
Epidemics regularly decimated the Roman Empire. In fact, in Ephesus,
plagues felled one-third of the population during the years 165–251 CE. And
recall the devastating plagues of the Middle Ages, such as the Black Death 
of 1347–1351 that swept away one-third of all Europeans. Even in modern
times, the great flu pandemic of 1918–1919 accounted for over 675,000
American deaths, far more than in WWI. Today, the AIDS virus infects millions
of victims, and the death toll is unthinkable (according to the United Nations,
about 33.2 million infected in 2007 with about 2.1 million deaths). Other
potential plagues lurk in the dark world of viruses and microbes.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
The four horsemen of Notre Dame
On October 18, 1924, Notre Dame football
achieved a moment of immortality thanks to a
New York Herald-Tribune sportswriter named
Grantland Rice. Borrowing from the imagery of
the Apocalypse, he filed a story following Notre
Dame’s 13–7 victory over an Army team at the
Polo Grounds. Here is perhaps the most famous
football story ever penned in sports journalism:
“Outlined against a blue-gray October sky
the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic
lore they are known as famine, pestilence,
destruction and death. These are only
aliases. Their real names are: Stuhldreher,
Miller, Crowley and Layden. They formed the
crest of the South Bend cyclone before
which another fighting Army team was swept
over the precipice at the Polo Grounds this
afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down
upon the bewildering panorama spread out
upon the green plain below.”
George Stricker, a student sports publicist at
Notre Dame, capitalized on this characteriza-
tion. When the team arrived back at South
Bend, he arranged with a local livery stable to
have four horses available. The four players,
quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, left halfback Jim
Crowley, right halfback Don Miller, and fullback
Elmer Layden mounted up and posed in their
uniforms. That picture appeared in the national
press and a legend was born.

The Fifth seal: The blood 
of martyrs (6:9–11)
Most people believe that the fifth seal, though standing apart from the four
horsemen, is closely associated with them. John writes,
“When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those
who had been slaughtered for the word of God and for the testimony they
had given; they cried out with a loud voice, ‘Sovereign Lord, holy and
true, how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the
inhabitants of the earth?’ They were each given a white robe and told to
rest a little longer, until the number would be complete both of their
fellow servants and of their brothers and sisters, who were soon to be
killed as they themselves had been killed.” (Rev. 6:9–11)
The connection between this seal and the previous four is simply this:
Martyrdom for one’s faith, like war, famine, plague, and death on a massive
scale, is a recurring historical phenomenon. Religious persecution has never
totally disappeared. Based on John’s vision, it’s unlikely to end until the
return of Jesus.
These martyrs, who’ve died because of their faith in Jesus, rest safely
beneath the heavenly altar. In popular Jewish belief, the righteous dwell
under God’s throne until the day of resurrection. The “rest” promised to 
the martyrs (Rev. 6:11) speaks of more than mere physical refreshment; it
conveys enjoyment of Jesus’s presence and anticipation of his complete 
victory over evil.
169
Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)
Putting together the welcoming party
The return of Jesus is called the Parousia, a
Greek term basically meaning an arrival,
coming, or presence. The term also means a
royal visit to a Greco-Roman city. The visit of the
emperor or a member of the royal family was a
Parousia. The city elected a delegation to meet
the emperor and his entourage well outside the
city limits and escort him back to the forum in the
city center. Much to-do went into preparations,
involving general sprucing up, minting of cele-
bratory coins, civic speeches, public festivities,
games, and so forth, in order to make a good
impression.
The Apostle Paul skillfully adapts the Greco-
Roman concept of a Parousia to the return of
Jesus. He sees Jesus as the coming King of
kings, and the welcoming delegation are believ-
ers who are taken up (raptured) to “meet the
Lord in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17). Jesus’s
entourage includes believers who die before the
Parousia. They won’t miss out on the festivities;
in fact, they have a front-row seat!

As you explore the fifth seal, keep in mind that John wrote the book of
Revelation at the end of the first century. But already in 64 CE, during a brief
but bloody episode, Nero Caesar had put a great host of Christians to death.
Multitudes died in the arena, torn to shreds by lions. Others were crucified,
and some were burned alive at night to serve as torches for Nero’s nightly
dinner parties.
The Sixth Seal: The Day of the 
Lord Has Come! (6:12–17)
The events associated with the first five seals are challenges and suffering that
humans have encountered over the centuries. However, the description of the
sixth seal in Revelation 6:12–17 places it in an entirely different category from
the others. A great earthquake accompanied by unparalleled cosmic distur-
bances (such as literal falling stars!) indicate something off the charts.
170
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Persecution then and now
Ancient historians Tacitus, Seutonius, and
Sulpicius Severus captured the gory details of
the persecution of early Christians. These histo-
rians imply that Nero’s actions were designed to
deflect the outrage of the citizenry of Rome. In 64
CE, a devastating fire destroyed large portions of
the city with huge loss of life. A rumor circulated
that Nero himself had set the fire, wanting to
rebuild the city in a manner more suited to his
taste. Needing a scapegoat, Nero fastened the
blame on the Christians.
During the reign of Domitian (81–96 CE), there
were periodic outbreaks of persecution, espe-
cially in cities of Asia, because Christians
refused to burn incense to the divine Caesar.
During the second and third centuries, 
extensive state-supported persecution swept
over the empire, and thousands of believers
perished.
Throughout the Middle Ages and into the
Reformation and Counter-Reformation, violent
episodes of persecution erupted, some of it
mutually destructive. Christians in Asia Minor,
where the seven churches were located, expe-
rienced several waves of conquest and perse-
cution in the seventh and eighth centuries,
eventually almost dying out entirely.
However, what many people don’t realize is that
never before in history have there been as many
martyrs as there are currently. In many areas of
the world, various religious, political, psycholog-
ical, and economic factors have created a hos-
tile environment for those who follow the
teachings of Jesus.

Never in recorded history have such phenomena occurred. People in all
walks of life cower in caves and cringe as terrible events unfold all around
them. What’s going on here? It’s like Creation returns to its original state 
of chaos (Genesis 1:2).
Like Old (Testament) times: Going 
back to the Day of the Lord
Crucial to understanding the sixth seal is the Old Testament notion of the
Day of the Lord. In this regard, the prophetic books of the Old Testament are
essential reading (see Chapter 3). The prophets paint a mural of the last 
days of earth’s history, when the Lord God of Israel holds court and settles
all accounts — Judgment Day. Metaphors depicting both its severity and its
salvation collide, so get ready for some fire and brimstone.
Amos
The book of Amos is a good example of stark doomsday imagery. In his 
writings, the prophet Amos tries to correct some common misconceptions.
Israelites in Amos’s day generally assumed the Day of the Lord would be a
time of blessing and light. They believed this solely on the basis that they
were Israelites, as if membership in their group brought automatic blessing
as a privilege. They disregarded that willfully choosing to disobey God’s
directives would bring judgment — something they should’ve known based
on the history of their people’s interactions with God.
Amos, directed by God, lets them know their wrong behavior has landed
them in serious hot water. Just because they’re the “children of Israel”
doesn’t mean they receive a free pass to God’s kingdom. Amos graphically
attacks their misconceptions. For example, he says that the Israelites are like
a man who encounters a lion and bear and escapes both by fleeing to the
safety of his home, only to be bitten by a deadly snake hiding in the wall
(Amos 5:19). Thinking he’s escaped disaster, he is suddenly stricken and dies.
What a picture of bitter disappointment! As always, though, God offers an
alternative: If the Israelites acknowledge their disobedience and bring their
behavior to be in line with God’s commands, then the Day of the Lord can be
a day of light rather than a day of darkness (Amos 5:18–24).
Isaiah
Other prophets build on Amos’s initial sketch of the Day of the Lord, none
more graphically than Isaiah. Isaiah sketches a time of terror and trembling:
“Enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from the terror of
the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth”
(Isaiah 2:19).
171
Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)

John, in describing the cosmic disasters of the sixth seal, clearly borrows
Isaiah’s imagery. Isaiah writes:
“See, the day of the Lord comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to
make the earth a desolation, and to destroy its sinners from it. For the
stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the
sun will be dark at its rising, and the moon will not shed its light. [. . .]
Therefore I will make the heaven tremble, and the earth will be shaken
out of its place. [. . .]” (Isaiah 13:9–10, 13:13)
In the same vein, Isaiah continues, “All the host of heaven shall rot away, and
the skies roll up like a scroll. All their host shall wither like a leaf withering 
on a vine, or fruit withering on a fig tree” (Isaiah 34:4).
Compare Isaiah’s description to the following events of Revelation 6:12–17:
 The sun turns black, and the moon turns red.
 The stars fall from the sky.
 The sky disappears “like a scroll rolling itself up.”
 Islands and mountains are no longer in place.
In with the New (Testament): Looking 
to the Day of the Lamb
The expectation of divine intervention and vindication, as related in the Old
Testament’s Day of the Lord, became a standard feature of Second-Temple
Judaism, a term referring to Judaism during 517 BCE–70 CE. Here’s how the
New Testament relates Jesus to this day of judgment:
 In the Gospels, Jesus accepts this depiction and further elaborates on
some of its features. The distinctive contribution of Jesus lies in his 
conviction that he, as the Son of Man, plays the pivotal role in the Day 
of the Lord.
 In John’s Gospel, Jesus is quoted as saying, “The Father judges no one
but has given all judgment to the Son” (John 5:22).
 The Apostle Paul simply expands the Old Testament expression and
speaks of “the day of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 1:8;
Philippians 1:6, 1:10, 2:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:2).
For John, this day clearly belongs to both the Lord and the Lamb. In
Revelation 6:16–17, as the people flee to the mountains, they call to the rocks,
“Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and
from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of their wrath has come, and
who is able to stand?” Christians often call this time the Great Tribulation, a
term that comes from Matthew 24:21 and Revelation 7:14 in the King James
Version of the Bible.
172
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Pausing for Effect (7:1–17)
As Revelation 7 begins, John hits the pause button. He feels he needs to 
elaborate on an important point. As you read through the book of Revelation,
several such pauses or interludes occur. These include the following:
 Revelation 7:1–17
 Revelation 10:1–11
 Revelation 11:1–14
 Revelation 12
 Revelation 13
 Revelation 14
These pauses in the action highlight key issues that John considers impor-
tant. He wants to use the delay to answer the question raised by terrified
173
Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)
Sorting out Second-Temple Judaism
First-Temple Judaism means the form of Judaism
that existed from the dedication of the first
Temple in about 970 BCE until the Babylonians
destroyed it in 586 BCE. It was characterized by
the great covenant made between the Lord and
Israel at Mount Sinai (as recorded in Exodus
19–24). This form of Judaism is basically the one
reflected in the Old Testament books.
Second-Temple Judaism means the form of
Judaism that existed from about 517 BCE, when
the second Temple was dedicated, up to its
destruction by the Romans in 70 CE. It was char-
acterized by the traditions of the first Temple,
supplemented by the new traditions that arose
as Jews interacted with their new Hellenistic
(Greek-cultured) environment and their ongoing
attempt to adapt the old laws to new settings.
During the Second-Temple period, great contro-
versy arose among the Jews. The various
groups — known as Pharisees, Sadducees (as
documented in the New Testament), Essenes
(as depicted in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls),
and others that scholars know about only by
inference — arose during this era and had quite
different understandings about what constituted
genuine Judaism. Of course, the Jewish move-
ment that eventually became known as
Christianity also arose during Second-Temple
times and added another perspective.
Of the various Jewish groups, only the Pharisees
and Christians survived the great war against
Rome (66–74 CE). Pharisaism evolved into
Rabbinic Judaism. This form of Judaism, shaped
by the Mishnah and Talmud (authoritative inter-
pretations of the biblical laws of the Old
Testament), ended the age of diversity and ush-
ered in a long period of uniformity until the period
of the Enlightenment (eighteenth century).
Judaism today is once again characterized by
great diversity of belief or even unbelief.

earthlings who wonder whether anyone can escape destruction in the great
day of the wrath of God and the Lamb (Rev. 6:17). The reassuring answer
unfolds in Revelation 7.
Surveying the survivors
John identifies two groups of people who stand before the throne of God —
“the 144,000” (Rev. 7:4) and a “great multitude” (Rev. 7:9). These individuals
survive the Day of the Lord for one reason: because God seals and saves
them. This salvation is a “God thing,” not something they’ve achieved. As the
Apostle Paul says, “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this
is not your own doing: it is the gift of God” (Ephesians 2:8). Seen in this light,
the whole Bible is a sweeping, overarching story of mercy showing how God
rescues sinful people from otherwise inevitable judgment.
The imagery John uses to depict this salvation is striking. Four angels hold
back the four winds of the earth, which represent destructive forces about 
to be unleashed on the world. But God intends to protect his chosen people
just as he did long ago in Egypt (Exodus 8–12).
Another angel places God’s seal on the foreheads of 144,000 people, identified
as “the people of Israel” (Rev. 7:4). This feature of John’s vision recalls a
vision of the prophet Ezekiel in 592 BCE. Ezekiel saw six destroying angels
about to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Jerusalem because of their 
apostasy (abandoning belief in God) and rebellion. Before they’re allowed to
execute vengeance, however, another angelic being records the names of
those who are truly repentant. These he seals with a mark on their foreheads.
Only those with the mark escape the impending disaster (Ezekiel 9:1–11).
Suddenly, John sees another group he refers to as “a great multitude that no
one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and lan-
guages, standing before the throne” (Rev. 7:9). An innumerable host experi-
ences God’s grace and joins the happy throng before the throne. Nothing
states that they’re sealed by God, but there they are nonetheless.
So what’s their story? One of the 24 elders interrogates John: “Who are these,
robed in white, and where have they come from?” (Rev. 7:13). John doesn’t
know, but he knows the elder knows, so John asks the elder. He responds,
“These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (Rev. 7:14). In
short, they’re Christians who refused to deny their faith even at the cost of
their lives.
Note the paradox of making one’s garment white by washing it in blood in
this section. For Christian believers, this paradox stands at the heart of the
gospel message. In fact, paradox characterizes Christian teaching at many
points — predestination (God decreed everything that happens) versus
174
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

human freedom, God’s transcendence (God is independent of and beyond the
universe) versus his immanence (God is everywhere present in his creation),
and salvation by faith and judgment by works, among others.
A regular feature of apocalyptic literature involves dialogue with a heavenly
guide. The seer is either asked a question or asks a question. In this instance,
John is asked a question he doesn’t know and throws it back to the angel,
who supplies the answer (Rev. 7:13–14, 17:6b–7; Ezekiel 37:3; Daniel 7:15–16;
Zechariah 1:9, 1:19, 4:1–6).
Identifying the 144,000
John gives a roll call of the tribes of Israel, which results in a tally of 12,000
from each of the 12 tribes listed, for a grand total of 144,000. In short, the
total is 122 multiplied by 1,000. Considerable speculation and controversy
surround the identification of the 144,000. Three major options present 
themselves.
All Christians
The 144,000 may symbolize all Christians. On this understanding, they’re 
virtually the same group as the great multitude mentioned next in Revelation
7:9–17. The difference is merely one of perspective. The listing of the tribes of
Israel here is different from the Old Testament record (the tribes of Ephraim
and Dan are omitted), which may support the idea of a purely symbolic
nature of the group.
In the New Testament, several passages view the church as a New Israel
(Romans 2:28–29; Galatians 6:16). In other words, gentiles and Jews who
believe in Jesus make up a new people of God. Take a look:
 This may be reflected in the churches of Smyrna and Philadelphia,
where you hear of “those who say that they are Jews but are not” 
(Rev. 2:9, 3:9). In other words, Christians believe they, not ethnic Jews,
are the true Israel.
 The group of 144,000 reappears in chapter 14, and Revelation 14:4 says,
“They have been redeemed from humankind as first fruits for God and
the Lamb.” Proponents contend that this description suggests that the
144,000 — previously described as the tribes of Israel — symbolize the
church because “from humankind” refers to gentiles.
 The Apostle Peter refers to gentile believers as “exiles of the Dispersion”
(1 Peter 1:1), an application of a Jewish expression to Christians. The
same adaptation appears in the Letter of James, where Christians are
stylized as “the twelve tribes in the Dispersion” (James 1:1).
175
Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)

Jewish Christians
The 144,000 may symbolize Jewish Christians, not Jewish and gentile
Christians together. The fact that the tribes of Israel are enumerated accords
more naturally with the group being actual Jews who believe in Jesus. Paul
speaks of a present remnant of Israel (including himself) who do believe, and
he seems to predict that at the end of the age, a wholesale conversion of Jews
will occur (Romans 11:26).
Proponents of this view point out that
 People on earth give “glory to the God of heaven” in only one place in
the book of Revelation (11:13), and these people appear to be Jews 
in Jerusalem.
 Jesus promised his disciples that when he comes in his glory, they’ll “sit
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel” (Matthew 19:28;
Luke 22:30).
 The Apostle Paul seems to envision a future conversion of Jews just
prior to the Parousia, or Second Coming of Jesus (Romans 11:26–27).
Perhaps, say proponents, the last chapter of earth’s history will include a
remarkably dedicated group of Jewish Christians who bear witness to their
faith in Jesus as the Messiah. Some interpreters also hold that the two 
witnesses of Revelation 11 represent Jewish Christians who minister in
Jerusalem in connection with the End Times.

Tribe talkin’
The tribes of Israel were groups of people claim-
ing common kinship. Israel traced its ancestry
back to the 12 sons of Jacob. These sons in turn
became the forefathers of the individual tribes
that eventually made up the tribal federation
known as Israel (Genesis 12–50). This pattern of
organization, widespread in the ancient Near
East, is similar to that of Native Americans. They,
too, were organized into tribal federations such
as the Sioux (or Dakota) and Miami nations.
There are several curiosities in the listing of the
tribes of Israel in Revelation 7:5–8. Why is Judah
listed first? Why is Dan omitted? Why is Joseph
listed along with his eldest son, Manasseh, but
not his youngest son, Ephraim? Judah is proba-
bly first because Jesus came from that tribe. But
as to why Dan is omitted and Manasseh rather
than Ephraim is listed, we can only speculate. A
few early Christian interpreters (such as
Irenaeus in the second century and Commodius
during the third) inferred from the omission of
Dan that the Antichrist would be a Jew from that
tribe. This is mere speculation sometimes laced
with anti-Jewish prejudice. (For more on the
Antichrist, stay tuned for Chapter 11.)

An elite group of Christians
The 144,000 may be an elite group of Christians who are especially devoted
to Jesus and receive special status as a reward for their commitment. Most
often, this group is equated with Christian martyrs. The number is symbolic
because there have been many times this number of martyrs in virtually 
any period of church history you choose. But some religious groups view the
number literally and teach that the 144,000 are a spiritually elite group of
believers who enjoy exalted status in the final kingdom.
The biggest problem with this perspective is that the elitism such a view
implies seems contrary to the clear teaching on equality throughout the 
New Testament (Galatians 3:28–29; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Colossians 3:11).
Moreover, attempts to take the number literally — exactly 144,000 people,
not one more or less — ignores the non-literal conventions of apocalyptic
writings.
Observing the multitude standing 
before the throne
Another throne room scene unfolds in Revelation 7:9–17. First, the multitude
who have maintained faith in Jesus and who have come out of the great 
ordeal — commonly known as the Tribulation and linked to the Day of the
Lord (see “The Sixth Seal: The Day of the Lord Has Come! [6:12–17]”) — 
offer up a confession of faith: “Salvation belongs to our God who is seated 
on the throne, and to the Lamb!” (Rev. 7:10). This confession underscores 
that the Bible consistently holds that God saves his people; they don’t save
themselves.
The angelic choir fills the heavens with a mighty sevenfold song of worship
to God: praise, blessing, glory, wisdom, honor, power, and might. Consider
that during the time John wrote the book of Revelation, people directed such
attributes to Caesar. John is making a clear statement that these attributes
befit only a true supreme being, namely God.
Then, combining several Old Testament texts (Isaiah 49:10; Psalms 121:6,
23:1–2; Ezekiel 34:23–24; Isaiah 25:8), the section concludes by describing 
the blessings that await the multitude of the redeemed, those who have been
faithful to Jesus. Like the angelic guardians of the throne, the redeemed 
surround and serenade the sovereign God. He, in turn, shelters them from 
the scorching sun. The imagery derives from the figure of an ancient Near
Eastern monarch sitting on his throne under a canopy or awning. His sub-
jects are likewise protected from the sun’s rays by awnings or something 
similar, providing shade for the entire court area (see Figure 9-3).

Chapter 9: Breaking Seven Seals (6:1–8:1)

Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY
John is a master of irony and paradox throughout his writings. As Revelation
7 ends, it offers another striking example of paradox when the Lamb is also
designated as the shepherd of the redeemed (Rev. 7:17). This picks up on
John’s Gospel, where Jesus is both “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin
of the world” (John 1:29) and the “good shepherd [who] lays down his life for
the sheep” (John 10:11). You can see similar examples of John’s use of irony
in Revelation 5:5–6, where the lion is a lamb.
The Seventh Seal: Silence 
in Heaven (8:1–5)
Revelation 8 begins with the opening of the seventh seal. When the Lamb
opens it, there’s silence in heaven for half an hour. But the drama and sus-
pense quickly rebuild when “the seven angels who stand before God” (Rev.
8:2) receive seven trumpets. Something big is about to go down. Before you
hit the fast forward button and hurry to find out what it is, pause and reflect
on this delay. What does it signify? Angelic adoration ceases, and silence
envelops the command center of the universe.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The significance of the pause is that with the opening of the seventh seal, the
old order passes away. God’s wrath against sin is spent, and judgment gives
way to blessing, just like the prophets said it would (see Amos 9:11–15 and
Isaiah 65:17–25). In other words, the future is now, and it’s nothing short of a
brand new heaven and brand new earth (Rev. 21). John, at this point in his
text, deliberately delays a description of the grand finale. He has much more
to say about the events leading up to the conclusion.
One of the hallmarks of John’s literary technique, in addition to irony, is to
postpone the climactic moment of his narrative. He carries the reader along
and sustains suspense for as long as possible. John skillfully does this in his
Gospel of John, where he narrates the ministry of Jesus by means of a literary
device, namely “the hour of his glory,” when referring to events related to
Jesus and his impending crucifixion. Throughout the Gospel of John, the
writer repeatedly informs you that it isn’t yet Jesus’s hour (John 2:4, 7:6, 7:8,
7:30, and 8:20). Finally, in Jerusalem, during the week of the feast of Passover,
John quotes Jesus as saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glo-
rified” (John 12:23). Ironically, the “hour of his glory” culminates in the death
of Jesus on the cross, followed by his resurrection. Perhaps artist Salvador
Dali comes closest to visually capturing this glory in John’s literary tour de
force (Figure 9-4).

Chapter 10
Sounding Seven Trumpets
(8:2–11:19)
In This Chapter
 Connecting the dots between the plagues of Egypt and the seven trumpets
 Observing the opening volley against the Evil Empire
 Reflecting on God’s wrath against evil
 Appreciating another interlude before the main event
“D
on’t make me angry. You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry.” David
Banner uttered that classic line in the 1970s The Incredible Hulk tele-
vision series just before he turned into the Hulk. When we look at Revelation
8–11, we wonder whether God may be saying the same thing. In this section 
of Revelation, Satan’s evil empire is about to experience the opening bursts of
the angelic artillery. And this skirmish just softens up Satan’s forces for the
final bombardment of the bowl judgments (see Chapter 12), reducing Satan’s
empire to ashes.
The trumpet judgments, cosmic blows that affect a third of the planet, are
more extensive and devastating than the seals (see Chapter 9). The trumpet
judgments, however, don’t impact the people of God; they aim at those still
defying the rule of the warrior Lamb.
In this chapter, you explore God’s judgment on evil in the world. As you do 
so, you see how the Old Testament helps you understand what’s going on. The
account of the plagues on Egypt (Exodus 7:14–10:23) provides a pattern for
the trumpet judgments. Here, you also begin to understand why this is a fight
to the finish between the two main characters of redemptive history, Jesus
and Satan. Both lay exclusive claim to the earth and its inhabitants. Only one
will eventually triumph. And the triumph of the one means the demise of the
other. (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows got this right, too — it’s either
Harry or Voldemort!)

Previewing the Seven Trumpets
Revelation 8 begins with an introduction to the seven trumpets: “When the
Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an
hour. And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets
were given to them” (Rev. 8: 1–2).
The trumpets herald the Day of the Lord, the Great Tribulation, the final era
of earth history in which the Lamb reasserts uncontested rule of the planet
and decisively defeats the forces of evil. The seventh trumpet, like the sev-
enth seal and seventh bowl, transitions to the grand finale, the triumph of the
Lamb and his kingdom.
These seven trumpets, like the seven seals (see Chapter 9), fall into four 
categories:
 Trumpets 1–4 (Rev. 8:7–12), like the four horsemen (Rev. 6:2–8), form
one distinct unit. For the most part, these judgments are directed at
nature.
 An eagle announces trumpets 5–7 and identifies them as the three
“woes” (Rev. 8:13–11:19). Trumpets 5 and 6 are demonic in nature and
are directed at rebellious human beings.
 Trumpet 6 is followed by a delay and interlude highlighting specific
aspects of the Day of the Lord (Rev. 10:1–11:14).
 Trumpet 7, like the seventh seal, anticipates the triumph of the Lamb,
only to be postponed by another delay and interlude (12:1–14:20).
182
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
And in this corner . . .
The fight began back in Genesis 3, when Satan
(under the guise of a serpent) deceived Adam
and Eve. Their disobedience resulted in expul-
sion from the Garden of Eden, and Satan
usurped control over planet earth. The Apostle
John, in his first epistle, doesn’t mince words
when he observes, “the whole world lies under
the power of the evil one” (1 John 5:19). Even
Jesus, during his earthly ministry, acknowledges
Satan’s present power and influence: “Now the
ruler of this world will be driven out” (John
12:31). The Lord God, however, promises Eve that
one of her descendants will crush the serpent’s
head — that is, deliver a mortal blow (Genesis
3:15).
According to the New Testament, that descen-
dant is none other than Jesus of Nazareth. The
Apostle Paul expresses this conviction when he
writes to the believers at Rome, “The God of
peace will shortly crush Satan under your feet”
(Romans 16:20). The fight has turned out to be
long and drawn-out, but the book of Revelation
narrates the final blow in chapter 20. The trum-
pet judgments are the beginning of the end for
the Dark Lord and his followers. The victor in this
cosmic slugfest is not in doubt.

Preceding the trumpets: 
Silence and prayer
Before the trumpets begin, Revelation 8:1 notes that heaven is silent for
about half an hour (see Chapter 9). After that period of time, activity sud-
denly fills the heavenly sanctuary. The seven angels who stand before the
throne of God prepare to sound their trumpets. This signifies that something
big is about to happen. But before the trumpet blasts, a ritual unfolds as
related in Revelation 8:3–4: “Another angel with a golden censer came and
stood at the altar; he was given a great quantity of incense to offer with the
prayers of all the saints on that golden altar that is before the throne.”
Incense was a regular feature of non-Christian, Jewish, and Christian worship.
The fragrant odor evoked in the worshiper a sense of the presence of the deity
and was offered up as an expression of thanksgiving or intercession (requests
on others’ behalf). Jewish usage goes back to the Mosaic rituals of the
Tabernacle and the subsequent first and second Temples. Christianity later
incorporated and adapted the Jewish practice for its liturgy. In this passage,
John describes the incense drifting over the heavenly sanctuary as a sweet
accompaniment to the prayers of the saints — that is, believers in Jesus.
The Bible indicates that believers’ prayers facilitate God’s will. Does prayer
change things? The Bible repeatedly suggests that it does (see Psalm 37:4–5;
Isaiah 65:24; Matthew 7:7–8; Mark 11:22–24; Philippians 4:6; Hebrews 4:16;
James 5:16). These prayers at the golden altar aren’t categorized as to their
specific content, but they probably include the prayers of the martyrs, 
mentioned in the fifth seal (see Chapter 9). In other words, the saints are
crying out for vindication, a request about to be answered in a big way.
Making a stormy appearance
The incense burner is hurled down to the earth, signaling the beginning of
the heavenly assault: “Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire
from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder,
rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake” (Rev. 8:5). The storms
that follow are considered theophanic signs, a fancy theological word that
refers to an appearance of God.
To make sense of this episode, take a little trip back in time to review some
Old Testament passages that illuminate the text. The Old Testament narrates
several theophanies, such as the appearance of God on Mount Sinai. In
Exodus 19, Yahweh (the personal name of the God of Israel, rendered as Lord
in most English translations) descends on the mountain accompanied by 
various earthly and celestial phenomena. Here’s how Exodus 19:16, 19:18
describes it: “On the morning of the third day there was thunder and light-
ning, as well as a thick cloud on the mountain, and a blast of a trumpet so
183
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

loud that all the people who were in the camp trembled. [. . .] Now Mount
Sinai was wrapped in smoke [. . .] the whole mountain shook violently.” The
similarities of this passage to Revelation 8:5–6 is apparent. John’s point is
simply this: God is about to reveal himself as he did in the past in order to
accomplish the salvation of his people. This is no trivial matter!
Whenever God displays his power on earth, there’s a whole lot of fireworks,
rocking, and rolling going on (1 Kings 18:38)! Fire from the altar functions
almost like a cosmic blowtorch. The Lamb is on the move!
Paralleling the plagues of Egypt
The sequence of trumpets shows some similarities to the plagues that rained
down on rebellious Pharaoh and his Egyptian empire, which had been built
on the backs of Hebrew slaves (Exodus 7–12). Table 10-1 shows some of the
common features between the trumpets of Revelation and the plagues in the
Old Testament.
Table 10-1

(Exodus 9:22–35)

Fifth Trumpet: Locusts (Rev 9:1–11)
Ninth Plague: Dense darkness 
Fourth Trumpet: A third of all celestial 
(Exodus 10:21–29)
light darkens (Rev. 8:12)
You may notice that the plagues and trumpets aren’t sequentially parallel, nor
do all the plagues have a trumpet counterpart. But the events are too close 
to be accidental, and it seems likely that John borrows the plague imagery to
describe what unfolds in his vision. Comparing the trumpets to the plagues 
is helpful because it enables readers to make theological sense of both sets 
of judgments. In the case of the Egyptian plagues, the Lord is trying to break
Pharaoh’s will as well as punish him for crimes against humanity — well
before anything like an International Court of Justice at the Hague existed.
184
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Pharaoh isn’t a pawn in a predetermined power play; he has an opportunity
to repent. According to the Bible, God allows people to make their own
choices. Pharaoh refuses, but at least some Egyptians choose to believe in
God. In fact, according to Exodus 12:38, a few believing Egyptians even leave
Egypt with the Hebrews and cast their lot with them.
The same applies to the trumpet judgments. According to the Scriptures, God
takes no delight in judging defiant sinners. But he does allow evil to overtake
those who embrace it. He also allows repentance up until the last possible
moment. In that light, the trumpet judgments aren’t merely a punishment but
also a warning to those who don’t believe in God. They serve the same reme-
dial function as the plagues on the ancient Egyptians.
Admitting problems of interpretation
As you look at the trumpet judgments, you have to consider two nagging
problems: How should this passage be viewed, and how does what happens
fit into the portrayed character of God?
The literalness of events
Is all this trumpet imagery purely symbolic, or is it intended to be taken 
at face value? Or is there a middle position? A literal interpretation of the 
trumpets doesn’t make much sense in hard scientific terms. We can argue
that God can do whatever he wants, but it’s difficult to understand how 
only a third of the light from heavenly bodies can be darkened.
185
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)
Worshiping the god of light: One-god Egyptians
Philo the Jew, a writer in the first century, inter-
prets Exodus 12:38 as proof that some Egyptians
embraced monotheism, the belief in one god:
“These were [. . .] those who, reverencing the
divine favour shewn to the people, had come
over to them, and such as were converted and
brought to a wiser mind by the magnitude and
the number of the successive punishments” (On
the Life of Moses 1.147).
The reign of Akhenaton may show further evi-
dence. Akhenaton ruled Egypt after the time of
Thutmose III and Rameses II — the two most
likely candidates for the Pharaoh of the Exodus.
Inexplicably, Akhenaton departed from a millen-
nia-long, polytheistic (many-god) tradition and
affirmed a form of monotheism. Akhenaton spoke
of Aton, the sun-god, as a unique, transcendent,
and everlasting deity, remarkably similar to the
biblical depiction of Yahweh. What prompted
such a radical move? It may have been memory
of the plagues on Egypt and the contest between
Pharaoh and Yahweh, in which the gods of Egypt
were shown to be inadequate.

Some argue that although God occasionally breaks natural laws, he generally
operates in accordance with the laws and forces that he put in place. These
people suggest that these judgments are unprecedented but still within the
parameters of known laws of astrophysics and earth sciences.
Those who interpret these trumpets symbolically point out that the trumpet
judgments are at home in the standard apocalyptic imagery that prophets
used to depict God’s judgment on evildoers in the End Times.
The character of God
How can a loving God inflict wide-scale suffering, even on his rebellious
human creation? Is God sadistic? Does God get off the hook simply by saying
these people deserve what they get? This is, of course, a long-standing theo-
logical problem that extends beyond the pages of Revelation. The technical
name for this issue is theodicy — that is, justifying God’s actions and attitudes.
We don’t pretend to have a definitive answer. We will, however, point out 
that the underlying theme of the Bible is that God is holy, just, righteous, 
gracious, loving, and merciful (Exodus 34:6–7). The consistent testimony of
God’s people through the ages is that all God does is good and right.
When trying to understand any single chunk of the Bible, view it in the con-
text of the entire Bible. Try to set your own biases aside instead of imposing
them on what you’re reading. Does the resulting interpretation accord with
reality, and does it cohere with the biblical perspective? See Chapter 17 for
tips on sorting out Scripture properly.
Honing in on the horns of old
Trumpets played an important role in biblical history as well as in the Roman
world of the first century:
 Direction: In the Old Testament, the Lord instructs Moses to make two
silver trumpets (Numbers 10). These trumpets serve as directional and
inspirational devices. For example, during the wilderness wanderings,
the children of Israel assemble, pack up, and move out when they hear 
a distinctive blast from the trumpets. They stop and set up camp when
they hear a different call (Numbers 10:3–8).
 Military commands and morale: During war, the trumpets indicate
attack, retreat, and so forth. The sound of the trumpets also constantly
reminds Israel that the Lord fights on their behalf (Numbers 10:9).
 Dates: The blowing of trumpets heralds various appointed festivals, 
the beginning of months, and the new year (Numbers 10:10, 29:1;
Leviticus 23:24).
 Royal crownings: Trumpets sound at the coronation of Israelite kings 
(1 Kings 1:34, 1:39; 2 Kings 9:13).
186
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Perhaps the most famous episode involving trumpets is at the battle of
Jericho during the invasion of Canaan, the Promised Land (Joshua 6). Seven
priests with seven trumpets blowing continuously lead the army of Israel
around the city for seven days. On the seventh day, after circling the city
seven times, blowing the trumpets continuously, the priests blow one final
blast as the people shout to the Lord — and the walls of Jericho collapse.
The parallel to the trumpet judgments of Revelation seems unmistakable.
Like Jericho, the evil empire is going to tumble down.
Like the Israelites, the Roman army used trumpets as a tactical device during
battle. Legionnaires performed certain maneuvers at the sound of trumpets.
One of the keys to Roman success was the well-coordinated movements of
the various military units. Perhaps this feature of mighty Rome also lies
behind John’s vision. The angelic legions are being unleashed against the
inhabitants of earth.
The single, most important fact for understanding the trumpet judgments is
this: They’re eschatological trumpets. That’s a fancy way of saying that they
herald the day of God’s wrath against sin. This theme is reflected in the Old
Testament and in several apocalyptic works of roughly the same period as
the book of Revelation, as well as in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 15:52;
1 Thessalonians 4:16).
The First Four Trumpets: 
Fire, Blood, and Hail
Revelation 8:7–12 describes the sounding of the first four trumpets:
“The first angel blew his trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mixed
with blood, and they were hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth
was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green
grass was burned up. The second angel blew his trumpet, and something
like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea. A third
of the sea became blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died,
and a third of the ships were destroyed. The third angel blew his trumpet,
and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third
of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is
Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died
from the water, because it was made bitter. The fourth angel blew his
trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a
third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened; a third of the
day was kept from shining, and likewise the night.”
187
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

These first four trumpets focus directly on the planet earth. The Old
Testament prophets speak of the dire consequences of sin on the environ-
ment and predict environmental repercussions for failure to keep covenant
with God (Isaiah 24:4–13; Hosea 4:3). Because of massive noncompliance on
the part of humanity, it’s now zero-hour, and earth reels under a heavenly
bombardment.
Trumpet 1: Plague on the land
“Hail and fire, mixed with blood” descend upon earth when the first angel
blows his trumpet (Rev. 8:7). This seemingly incongruous mixture may
describe, in graphic imagery, violent thunderstorms in which lightning and
hail result in huge loss of life. Whatever its nature, the results are devastating.
Don’t insist on a literal understanding of the fraction one-third. Fractions like
one-third are a regular feature of apocalyptic imagery (see Zechariah 13:8–9;
Ezekiel 5:1–2).
The takeaway point is this: Vegetation of all kinds is completely wiped out in
large portions of the earth. If the third and fourth seals depict the ravages of
famine in the course of world history (Rev. 6: 5–8 — see Chapter 9), this first
trumpet results in famine on an unprecedented scale at the end of world 
history. Wealth is of little help now. Obviously, both domesticated and wild
animals perish in vast numbers. The consequences are unimaginable. Human
beings realize, too late, how dependent they are on the plant and animal 
kingdoms.
Trumpet 2: Plague on the high seas
When the second angel blows his trumpet, “Something like a great mountain,
burning with fire, was thrown into the sea” (Rev. 8:8). One perspective is 
that this refers to an asteroid or comet slamming into the earth. After all,
such things have occurred in earth history with devastating consequences.
Alternatively, is it a reference to volcanic activity in the Mediterranean? In 79
CE, Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried the inhabitants of Pompeii and
Herculaneum alive. As many as 10,000 people died in that disaster.
This imagery is typical of that found in other Jewish apocalyptic writings.
John’s vision, then, in keeping with apocalyptic imagery, seems to depict 
a planetary disaster involving a large portion of the oceans. The “sea” as 
the location for the impact of this asteroid-like object probably reflects the
fact that the Roman Empire was essentially the land areas surrounding the
Mediterranean Basin. This was, for all practical purposes, the extent of the
known world at that time. The implication, then, is that this is a truly world-
wide disaster. The impact is staggering, and the fallout, in terms of ecology,
economics, and human life, is enormous.
188
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Trumpet 3: Plague on fresh water
Compounding an already desperate situation, much of the freshwater
sources of the planet are suddenly rendered toxic when the third angels
blows his trumpet. As Revelation 8:10–11 says, “A great star fell from heaven,
blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs 
of water. The name of the star is Wormwood.”
A literal reading suggests something like an asteroid or comet. The problem
here is the name given to the star. Wormwood — a type of bitter, poisonous
herb (Jeremiah 9:15, 23:15) — almost makes it sound like a person whose
name personifies what happens. Furthermore, in Jewish apocalyptic litera-
ture, stars are frequently associated with angelic or demonic beings. Following
this tack suggests an angelic being who in some way degrades vast tracts of
freshwater sources. The result is sobering: “Many died from the water” (8:11).
Some modern commentators, endorsing a literal interpretation of Revelation,
draw attention to the increasing danger posed to world peace by inadequate
drinking water. They entertain various scenarios involving international 
conflicts over the availability of drinkable water and cite this section of
Revelation as support. Without denying the increasingly dangerous situation
of adequate drinking water, we think this really misses the intent of John’s
vision. These are divine judgments without parallel in human history.
Trumpet 4: Plague on sources of light
The fourth trumpet involves something inexplicable in terms of known laws
of physics. The light output from heavenly bodies diminishes one-third. 
Even worse, during a third of normal daylight hours and nighttime, total dark-
ness reigns. This recalls the ninth plague of darkness upon Egypt (Exodus
10:21–22). The impact of such a reduction in light would be catastrophic.
Besides the psychological effects (paralyzing fear and biological clocks com-
pletely out of synch), the consequences for earth’s living creatures (death of
plant life and animals that feed on it) are mind boggling. The bottom line is
this: Panic paralyzes the planet.
In the Old Testament, judgment is depicted in terms of darkness. The Old
Testament prophet Amos likens the Day of the Lord to a day of darkness
(Amos 5:18). The prophet Joel chimes in with a similar conviction: “a day of
darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness!” (Joel 2:2). Jesus
also predicts that “the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its
light” (Mark 13:24).
But the darkness has an even darker side. In Scripture, darkness sometimes
symbolizes the demonic. The fourth trumpet may foreshadow worse things
to come. In this case, it points toward the fifth trumpet, which depicts a
demonic invasion. The Dark Lord and his demons are about to prowl the
189
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

planet, and before they do, it gets dark — really dark. In his Gospel, the
Apostle John has a keen eye for this sort of symbolism. It’s no coincidence in
his Gospel when, after Satan possesses Judas during the Last Supper, John
ominously informs his readers, “And it was night” (John 13:30).
Wailing the Woes of the 
Last Three Trumpets
At the end of Revelation 8, John hits the pause button, saying, “Then I looked,
and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew in mid-heaven, ‘Woe,
woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets
that the three angels are about to blow!’” (Rev. 8:13). These “woes” are named
appropriately: They’re aimed directly at humanity itself.
The dark side now enters the arena: demonic invasion. No, the Martians
aren’t coming, nor are UFOs with strange-looking creatures — the situation’s
actually a lot worse than that. Demons from the bottomless pit are about to
be unleashed on the Earth. Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters won’t be any
help this time!
Trumpet 5: Demonic locust plague
In Revelation 9:1–3, an angel blows the fifth trumpet. John sees a star fall
from heaven to earth, and it receives a key to the bottomless pit (in some
English translations, rendered “Abyss”). The fallen star then opens a shaft,
allowing smoke and locusts to escape and envelop the earth (Rev. 9:1–3).
No, the star is most likely not a little twinkling star gone bad. Instead, in 
keeping with standard apocalyptic imagery, the star is probably an angel, just
as Revelation 1:20 and 2–3 identify seven stars as the angels of the seven
churches of Asia. The bottomless pit or abyss is another standard apocalyp-
tic expression for the underworld, the place of the dead and demonic spirits.
Meeting the swarm
As for the locusts, these are really nasty creatures (Rev. 9:4–11). The imagery
is related to the prophecy of Joel in the Old Testament. Joel envisions locusts
descending upon the land of Judah in massive numbers. At first he seems to
be describing the well-known and dreaded locusts that periodically infest 
the Middle East (Joel 1:1–7). But then his prophecy takes a bizarre turn, and
he describes locust-like creatures that do the Lord’s bidding. In this case,
they wreak total destruction on the land. The prophet describes this plague
as occurring during the Day of the Lord. Apparently, these are no ordinary
locusts but an end-times mutant, even more terrifying than the normal ones
(Joel 2:1–11).

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The ancient Near East was subject to periodic locust infestations. Locusts
occasionally experience a tremendous population explosion and form 
massive swarms. They then go in search of vegetation. The ancients were
helpless in the face of such a plague. Today, aerial and satellite surveillance
pinpoint such swarms, and pesticides head off potential disasters. The last
major locust invasion in Israel occurred in 1916.
John echoes Joel’s ancient prophecy by describing a demonic invasion under
the figure of a locust invasion. These locusts are certainly not your typical,
garden-variety locusts — they prefer humans to vegetation! The demons are
permitted to torture those who lack the seal of God but are forbidden to kill
them. The suffering is so intense that those stung attempt to commit suicide
but are unable to.
John’s depiction of these demonic locusts almost defies description. 
They’re likened to powerful war horses having human faces (reminiscent 
of Ringwraiths from the J. R. R. Tolkien’s book series The Lord of the Rings).
The locust-demons wear crowns like kings and princes, and they have long,
flowing hair like women and teeth like lions. Covered in scale armor, these
creatures possess a scorpion-like tail with a stinger that inflicts intense agony
(Rev. 9:7–10). The imagery combines to create a truly terrifying specter.
If there’s a bright spot in this ghastly portrayal, it’s this: The assault is limited
to five months, the lifespan of ordinary locusts. The fact that God determines
a limit points to the remedial aspect of the judgment: Rebellious sinners still
have an opportunity to repent and switch allegiance to the Lord of light (Rev.
1:16). It also shows that God permits evil to carry out his own purposes. This
is reminiscent of Isaiah 10:5–11, in which the Lord allows the cruel empire of
Assyria to punish rebellious Israel and Judah. Later, the Lord punishes
Assyria for its arrogance and excessive cruelty.
Debating demonic invasions
Is such a thing really conceivable? Theological assumptions play an impor-
tant role in this question. If you believe that demons are real and that
demonic possession is possible, then this scenario isn’t off-the-wall. Jesus,
the Apostles, and the church fathers, after all, believed in the reality of
demons and demonic influence and possession (see Mark 1:32, 3:15, 7:26–30;
1 Corinthians 10:20–21).
Joel 2:1–11, along with Exodus 10:1–20 (the eighth plague against Egypt) and
possibly Genesis 6:1–4, serve as the backdrop for the text in Revelation
9:1–11. A destroying angel leads the assault: “They have as king over them
the angel of the bottomless pit” (Rev 9:11). John gives him a descriptive
name: the double name of Abaddon (Hebrew for Destruction) and Apollyon
(Greek meaning Destroyer). The Destroyer orders his horde of demons from
the bottomless pit to assault the earth.
191
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

Trumpet 6: Demonic cavalry
A divine command kicks off the sixth trumpet and second woe: “Release the
four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates” (Rev. 9:14). In Jewish
and Christian apocalyptic tradition, angels perform various regulatory func-
tions in connection with the cosmos. Evil angels are also depicted as bound
or restricted to certain locations, sometimes in subterranean caverns, some-
times in a watery abyss. The four angels of Revelation 9:14 appear to fall 
into this latter category, only in this case, they’re bound somewhere at the
Euphrates River. This great river, because of its fame and importance, is often
simply referred to as “the river” or “the great river” in the Old Testament.
The Tigris-Euphrates River Valley is significant because it was one of the two
great “cradles of civilization” in the ancient Near East (the other being the
Nile River Valley). It was also the eastern border of the Roman Empire. To the
east lay the threatening kingdom of the Parthians, today the area of eastern
Iraq and western Iran.
Perhaps the action of released angels, which isn’t explicitly described here, 
is related to the sixth bowl, in which the Euphrates River dries up, allowing
the kings of the east to invade the Holy Land (Rev. 16:12–16) (see Chapter 12
for details on the bowls). But for now, the four angels unleash an even more
devastating demonic invasion, resulting in the torture and death of one-third
the world’s population (Rev. 9:15).
In keeping with apocalyptic traditions, the exact hour, day, month, and 
year of this conflict is predetermined, but only God knows when that is (see
Daniel 12:7, 11–12). Jesus tells his disciples that the exact day and hour of 
his coming is also known only by the Father; not even he nor the angels know
the exact date (Mark 13:32).
192
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
The great flood and the first wave of invasions
One school of thought is that Revelation 9:1–11
refers to a second great demonic invasion of
earth. Supporters of this theory believe the first
invasion occurred before the flood of Noah and
was the reason for the destruction of all living
things. In this perspective, the “sons of God” of
Genesis 6:1–4 refer to fallen angels or demons
who take possession of human beings and coex-
ist with them. The result is a monstrous hybrid,
the Nephilim (Genesis 6:4). In this scenario, the
Lord intervenes with a cosmic judgment and ini-
tiates a new beginning (Genesis 7–8). Both
demonic invasions occur prior to cosmic
destructions: The world that was (the pre-flood
world) perished by water; the post-flood world
perishes by fire (2 Peter 2:4–10; 3:1–13). It bears
repeating: The sealed saints aren’t subject to this
demonic assault (Rev. 9:4). The Dark Lord can’t
take any of the Lamb’s followers (John 10:28–29).

The fact that Jesus seems not to know the exact date of his return has
prompted more than a little theological controversy. How can he truly be
divine if he’s limited in knowledge? The traditional response has been to say
that during his earthly ministry, Jesus voluntarily laid aside certain divine
attributes such as omniscience. Now, in his exalted state at the right hand 
of God the Father, he fully exercises all his divine attributes and knows
exactly the day and hour of his return.
Commentators differ considerably on the occasion and combatants in the
slaughter following the sixth trumpet (see Chapter 4 to discover the four
basic approaches to the book of Revelation):
 Idealists: Idealists simply speak in generalities, namely that world 
conflict will result.
 Historicists: Historicists have championed a number of warmonger 
candidates, running the gamut from Genghis Khan to T. E. Lawrence 
(of Arabia).
 Preterists: Preterists most often suggest a Parthian invasion. Parthia, 
a kingdom lying east of the Euphrates River and stretching across Iran,
was the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire. The Parthians were a
feared opponent, having more than once bloodied the eastern legions.
John pictures this vast army as cavalry, and the Parthians were famous
for their swift horses.
 Futurists: Futurists of an earlier generation expected a literal cavalry,
200 million strong, to descend on Israel during the Tribulation. More
recently, many have identified China as the invader. This invasion will
supposedly force the Antichrist to intervene in the Middle East.
Modern futurists take the references to sulfur, fire, and smoke — and 
the enormous casualty rate — as evidence of thermonuclear weapons.
In fact, some authors find allusions to a whole host of modern weapon
systems in the book of Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelation, including attack
helicopters armed with a tail mount that sprays chemical and biological
weapons!
Overall, many commentators argue in favor of a literal demonic army
because the description exceeds anything known to human experience.
Horses with lion-like heads and death-dealing mouths and tails, the latter
having heads like serpents, probably indicate you’re dealing with something
supernatural. This connects the army with the fifth trumpet, the locusts,
which most interpreters identify as demons.
Greek mythology includes a bizarre monster called Chimera (the name means
she-goat). Chimera is a three-part creature, being like a lion in front, a snake
behind, and a fire breathing she-goat in the middle. Perhaps John’s vision
adapts this mythological imagery.
193
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

Whether these creatures are literal or figurative, the havoc they wreak is real.
Yet in spite of these demonic judgments, the survivors “did not repent of their
murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts” (Rev. 9:21).
Trumpet 7: Not just yet
The seventh — and last — trumpet, like the seventh seal (see Chapter 9), is
delayed. Before moving on to the seventh and final trumpet, John describes
two more intervening visions. Why the delay? In part because there’s still
more to relate concerning certain aspects of the End Times, and in part
because when the last trumpet sounds, just like when the fat lady sings, it’s
over. Well, almost . . .
The First Interlude: The Angel 
and the Little Scroll
Like a commercial that comes right before you hear whether a contestant is
going to win on a TV game show, an interlude appears at the beginning of
Revelation 10 — it’s time for a word from our sponsor. Destruction, judgment,
and chaos are momentarily set aside to, among other things, announce no
more delays!
But the more significant role of this vision of the angel and the little scroll is
that of a re-commissioning. John is divinely directed to continue his role as
prophet to the nations. He must warn them, like a watchman on a castle wall,
of impending disaster.
Looking at a mighty angel
Emerging from the heavens in brilliant sunlight, an angel takes center stage:
“And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a
cloud, with a rainbow over his head; his face was like the sun, and his
legs like pillars of fire. He held a little scroll open in his hand. Setting his
right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land, he gave a great shout,
like a lion roaring. And when he shouted, the seven thunders sounded.
And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I
heard a voice from heaven saying, ‘Seal up what the seven thunders have
said, and do not write it down.’ Then the angel whom I saw standing on
the sea and the land raised his right hand to heaven and swore by him
who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the
earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it: ‘There will be no
194
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

more delay, but in the days when the seventh angel is to blow his trum-
pet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he announced to his servants
the prophets.’” (Rev. 10:1–7)
Notice that John now appears to be viewing the action from the earth. Prior 
to this — after he was taken into the heavenly throne room (Rev. 4:1) — his
vantage point was from heaven looking down on the earth. This alternation
between heavenly and earthly perspectives is typical of apocalyptic literature,
in which the seer moves easily between these two vantage points. This pro-
vides the reader with behind-the-scenes information and thus a more compre-
hensive picture of what’s really going on than is accessible to outsiders.
At this point, John describes the descent of a powerful angelic figure to the
earth as though he’s looking upward. Perhaps it’s fitting that he’s on earth for
this portion of the vision, because he’s now re-commissioned to proclaim the
End Time judgments. Like the prophets who preceded him, he ministers to
his fellow humans.
ID-ing the angel
But who is this mighty angel referred to in Revelation 10:1? Is it Jesus? An
archangel? Or neither? Well, it’s most likely either Jesus or an archangel. Here
are the arguments for each:
 Jesus: Because the description of the mighty angel in Revelation 10
includes items sometimes associated with deity, some commentators
conclude that the angel is Jesus. For example,
• “Wrapped in a cloud” describes God in Psalm 104:3.
• “With a rainbow over his head” reminds readers of the rainbow
above the throne in Revelation 4:3.
• “His face was like the sun” recalls Revelation 1:16, where the risen
Jesus is so described.
• “His legs like pillars of fire” is similar to Revelation 1:15, where
Jesus’s feet are “like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace.”
This, at first glance, is rather convincing. The problem, however, is that
nowhere else in the book of Revelation is Jesus referred to as an angel.
Furthermore, it seems inappropriate that the Lord of all creation should
take an oath to God as the mighty angel does in Revelation 10:6. Also,
there’s no biblical support for the notion that humans actually become
angels in heaven; they’re only said to be like them in a few specific ways
(see Matthew 22:30).
 An archangel: Most likely, the mighty angel belongs to one of the
classes of angels mentioned in the Bible and in Jewish literature.
Archangels, in particular, are very powerful and perform critically impor-
tant roles in redemptive history. In Jewish tradition, the archangel Uriel
is associated with light and the luminaries, and he carries out a number
195
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

of important divine missions. You can also make a good case for Gabriel,
who comes to Daniel’s assistance and explains the meaning of a vision
(Daniel 8:15–16). Gabriel is also the messenger who informs Zechariah
and Mary of their key roles in the births of John the Baptist and Jesus
(Luke 1:11–20, 1:26–38).
Keeping secret things
When the mighty angel straddles the planet and shouts, seven thunders
resound, apparently with an intelligible message. As John is about to record
the message, a divine voice restrains him: “Seal up what the seven thunders
have said, and do not write it down” (10:4). Such a command is another 
standard feature of apocalyptic literature:
 Daniel is instructed not to let the contents of his prophecy be known to
his generation (Daniel 7:28; 8:26; 12:4, 9).
 The Apostle Paul is forbidden to disclose the details of his visit to the
throne room (2 Corinthians 12:4–7).
 In John’s Gospel, Jesus cries out, “Father, glorify your name” (John
12:28). In response, “A voice came from heaven.” Some who are present
that day think “it was thunder.” Others claim “an angel has spoken to
him” (John 12:29). But none of them really understands what was said
and what it means. In this instance, only for believers is the veil of
secrecy removed. But even in the case of believers, some things remain
hidden and secret, beyond comprehension. Such is the case here in
Revelation 10:4. As Deuteronomy 29:29 says, “The secret things belong
to the Lord our God.”
One thing is quite clear: The end is imminent. When the seventh trumpet
sounds, “the mystery of God will be fulfilled” (Rev. 10:7).
Tasting a bittersweet book
John is summoned to take a small scroll from the hand of the mighty angel
and then eat it:
“Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying,
‘Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing
on the sea and on the land.’ So I went to the angel and told him to give me
the little scroll; and he said to me, ‘Take it, and eat; it will be bitter to your
stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.’ So I took the little scroll
from the hand of the angel and ate it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth,
but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. Then they said to
me, ‘You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and 
languages and kings.’” (Rev. 10:8–11)
196
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Visualizing this scene isn’t easy. Imagine a gigantic angel straddling the conti-
nents and seas and John apparently zooming upward and asking for the scroll.
Similar to what happens with the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel
2:10–3:3), John is told to eat the scroll. He’s warned that at first it will taste
sweet, but then it’ll turn bitter in the stomach. The text itself gives no expla-
nation for this turn of events. Perhaps it refers to how God’s word is sweet if
it’s believed, but if ignored, it becomes a bitter word of judgment. The fact
that the prophet ingests the scroll implies that the message itself becomes a
part of the prophet’s life. Being a true messenger of God involves living out
its message, and sometimes that message is harsh and bitter. Judgment is
hard to digest.
The Second Interlude: Two Star 
Witnesses in Jerusalem
In Revelation 11, a second interlude (which is also the second of the three
woes) further delays the blowing of the seventh trumpet. John is transported
to the streets of Jerusalem to witness a remarkable example of street preach-
ing. Two Jews-for-Jesus make a big splash in the Holy City! In fact, they get
the attention of the ultimate bad boy himself, the Antichrist. Here are a few of
the highlights of this second interlude (see Rev. 11:1–11):
 John is told to measure the Temple.
 John is told about two witnesses who appear and prophesy for 1,260
days.
• Fire comes from their mouths to kill any attackers.
• They can stop rain and turn rivers into blood.
• They can release any manner of plague anywhere on the earth.
 John is told about a beast from a bottomless pit that comes and kills the
two witnesses.
• The people of world celebrate the deaths of the witnesses.
• After 3.5 days, the two witnesses return to life and go up into
heaven.
 John is told about an earthquake that destroys one-tenth of the city.
• 7,000 people die.
• The survivors give praise to God.
In a mere 11 verses, you see an incredible story with multiple plot twists,
populated by fantastic creatures and people with superpowers! Revelation
may be complex, but it’s definitely not a boring book of the Bible!
197
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

Measuring the Temple
Remember how the three ghosts of Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol trans-
ported Ebenezer Scrooge through past, present, and future scenes? Scrooge
could see and hear all the people around him, but they couldn’t see him.
That’s sort of what happens to John in Revelation 1:1–11.
He has been transported to Jerusalem some time in the future, where he visits
the Temple and sees all that takes place. But before the two witnesses show
up, John is told to take a special measuring stick and measure the Temple of
God and the great altar in front of it, as well as count the worshipers. This, 
of course, prompts a number of questions.
What is this Temple?
Bear in mind that at the time John wrote this vision, the second Jerusalem
Temple had already lain in ruins for over 20 years (unless you opt for an early
dating, in the 60s CE, for the book of Revelation — see Chapter 2 for details).
Readers must either imagine a third Temple or use a symbolic interpretation.
If you opt for a literal understanding, this lands you right in the middle of a
highly controversial, politically charged issue! Will there be a third Temple?
And if so, what happens to the Mosque of Omar, the famous Dome of the
Rock that was built over the site of the original Temple? Christians affirm 
that God alone knows.
The New Testament includes one other place that some people interpret 
as a reference to a third Jewish Temple: Paul’s passage describing the coming
of the Antichrist, whom he calls “the lawless one” (2 Thessalonians 2:3–12).
There, Paul says, “He [the Antichrist] takes his seat in the temple of God,
declaring himself to be God” (2 Thessalonians 2:4). But there’s considerable
disagreement about what Paul means, and in other places, he says that
believers themselves are the Temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16, 6:19).
Ultimately, it’s an open question.
Why do measurements even have to be taken?
The background of John’s action in measuring the Temple recalls a similar
task undertaken by two Old Testament prophets, Zechariah and Ezekiel.
In Zechariah 2:1–5, the prophet observes an angelic surveyor taking a mea-
suring line to determine the dimensions of a restored and rebuilt Jerusalem.
Jerusalem had been burned to the ground by Nebuchadnezzar’s army in 586
BCE. Living in the era of return and restoration, before the rebuilding of the
walls by Nehemiah (444 BCE), Zechariah is informed by his angelic guide 
that the city will swell and sprawl beyond its historic boundaries.
198
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Ezekiel assumes a rebuilt Jerusalem, but more importantly, given his priestly
perspective, focuses on a blueprint for a greatly enlarged Temple replacing
Solomon’s structure (Ezekiel 40–48). His detailed measurements make up the
bulk of this section of his book. An angelic being does the actual measuring
with a 6-cubit-long reed (just over 10 feet long); Ezekiel writes down the 
measurements.
John echoes these prophetic accounts for his own purpose. The point seems
to be a divine promise of protection for the people of God. That which God
measures for restoration is safe from all alarms. This protective measure
chimes in with Revelation 7, where John describes the sealing of God’s
people prior to the trumpet judgments (see Chapter 9).
Deciphering who or what the witness are
Who are these two witnesses of Revelation 11? This is the question everyone
wants an answer to! From our experience, this section is one of the most 
difficult chapters to interpret in a book already notorious for its complexity.
A survey of commentaries reveals a dizzying array of candidates for the two
witnesses. At least commentators agree that the number two is significant:
This was the minimum number of required witnesses to sustain a charge in a
court case (Deuteronomy 19:15). Beyond that, unanimity disappears. Here
are some of the leading options:
 Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest: Revelation 11:4 identifies 
the two witnesses as “the two olive trees and the two lampstands that
stand before the Lord of the earth.” This phrasing comes from Zechariah
4:3–14, where it refers to the two leaders of the post-exile Jewish restora-
tion movement at the end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries
BCE. (This was a movement among dispersed Jews to return to their
ancient homeland and rebuild a Jewish colony). However, it’s more likely
that John simply borrows the imagery and applies it to some other 
individuals or group.
 The Law and the Prophets (Scripture): In the first century, the Old
Testament Scriptures were often referred to as “the Law and the
Prophets” (see Matthew 5:17; John 10:34; Romans 3:31). Although the
Scriptures serve as a witness to the truth, this hardly seems appropriate
to the context of Revelation 11. The two witnesses, after all, are mar-
tyred and raised to life again!
 Peter and Paul: Advocates of an early dating for the book of Revelation
(preterists) are more likely to suggest this option because both Apostles
were martyred at about the same time during the latter part of the reign
of Nero Caesar (64–68 CE). Highly problematic for this view, however, is
the obvious fact that neither Apostle was brought back to life.
199
Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

 Israel and the Church: This option capitalizes on the fact that both
Israel and the Church (Christians) have a mission as witnesses to the
nations (Isaiah 42:6–7, 49:6; Acts 1:8). Although martyrdom has often
befallen Israel and the Church in their respective histories, and you can
speak metaphorically of a “resurrection” for both in their ongoing mis-
sion, you have to ignore the details of Revelation 11 rather wholesale on
such a view.
 Enoch and Elijah: These two are selected because both were raptured
(taken up) to heaven and did not experience death (Genesis 5:24; 2
Kings 2:11). Because Hebrews 9:27 says, “It is appointed for mortals to
die once,” some expositors hold that these two prophets are required 
to return and experience death like all mortals before being resurrected
and raptured again.
 Moses and Elijah: The context of Revelation 11 fits these two better 
than any previously mentioned. For example, take Revelation 11:5: 
“And if anyone wants to harm them, fire pours from their mouth and
consumes their foes” corresponds to an episode in the life of Elijah (2
Kings 1:9–12), as does Revelation 11:6: “They have authority to shut the
sky, so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying” (1
Kings 18). The last half of Revelation 11:6 says, “They have authority
over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with
every kind of plague, as often as they desire,” recalling Moses and the
plagues on Egypt (Exodus 7–12).
But is it credible to hold that these two individuals actually return to
earth and carry out a witnessing ministry in Jerusalem? We can’t rule
this out. After all, according to the Gospels, Moses and Elijah appeared
with Jesus to Peter, James, and John on the mount of Transfiguration
(Matthew 17:1–8; Mark 9:2–8; Luke 9:28–36). Still, that appearance is
hardly the same thing as the ministry described in Revelation 11. It’s
also true that the prophet Malachi spoke of Elijah’s coming before “the
great and terrible day of the Lord,” in a context mentioning Moses
(Malachi 4:4–5). In fact, there was an expectation among the Jewish
people that Elijah would return and announce the coming of Messiah
(see Matthew 17:10). To this day, observant Jews leave a special chair
empty during the Passover ritual, giving tangible expression to the hope
that Elijah will return and announce the coming of Messiah.
On the other hand, Jesus seems to identify John the Baptist as coming in
the spirit and power of Elijah and, in that sense, he was Elijah (Matthew
11:14, 17:11). This seems to tip the scales against the notion that Moses
and Elijah actually return for one more mission.
The answer to this question is tough. We think you can marshal a credible
case for a more or less literal interpretation, involving two actual individuals
who powerfully witness to the gospel during the first 3.5 years of the Great
Tribulation in Jerusalem. Whereas many take a symbolic view of the “great
city,” we cautiously suggest that Jerusalem will indeed be the scene of this
remarkable ministry. Our reasoning is that John’s prophecy accords with Old
200
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Testament prophecy placing Jerusalem right in the thick of things during the
tumultuous Day of the Lord (see Zechariah 12–14). But, as is true with other
parts of Revelation, no one knows the specific answer until it happens. You
could say that John has written the ultimate cliffhanger!
A rising beast, raptured witnesses, 
and a deadly earthquake
The ministry of the two witnesses of Revelation 11 is cut short by “the beast
that comes up from the bottomless pit” (Rev. 11:7). Interpreters agree that the
beast is the Antichrist. The abrupt introduction of a key figure in apocalyptic
literature is not unprecedented. Fortunately, John lingers later with another
interlude (Rev. 12–13), adding more details to the portrait of this bad boy.
At this point, John is content to inform the readers briefly about a power
encounter in Jerusalem. The two witnesses seem invincible. A divine aura 
protects them from enemies (11:5), and they possess unprecedented power
over nature (11:6). Who can stand up to them? The answer is a bit frightening.
Satan, the Dark Lord, conjures up a person who can not only take them on but
defeat them. Arising from the bottomless pit, this satanically energized person
kills the two witnesses and leaves their bodies exposed as an act of humilia-
tion and intimidation. None dare oppose the beast from the bottomless pit
without mortal consequences! But apparently, most earth-dwellers are quite
happy with the outcome: Global celebrations over the demise of the two
prophets take place.
Does the Dark Lord get the last word? No. After 3.5 days, the bodies of the
two witnesses are raised and raptured (taken up) to heaven in plain view of
eyewitnesses. In fact, their rapture is a command performance in response to
God’s command: “Come up here!” (11:12). This is followed by a most unset-
tling phenomenon for the inhabitants of Jerusalem: A devastating earthquake
occurs, leveling a tenth of the city and resulting in 7,000 deaths.
The response of the survivors is instructive. This is the only time in the
sequence of seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments that indicates a positive reac-
tion. Though filled with terror at what had happened, John says they “gave
glory to the God of heaven” (11:13). This is in stark contrast to the reactions
to prior judgments, where the people cursed God. This is also the conclusion

Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

Beginning of the End: 
The Seventh Trumpet
In Revelation 11:15, the seventh trumpet blast sounds, the last of the three
woes mentioned in 8:13. The angelic choir again raises an anthem of praise.
The keynote of fulfillment resounds in the heavens: “The kingdom of the
world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah” (Rev. 11:15).
Seemingly, everything’s ready for the grand celebration! The 24 elders intone
the significance of this moment: “You have taken your great power and begun
to reign” (Rev. 11:17).
As the great doors of the heavenly sanctuary open, John catches a glimpse 
of the Ark of the Covenant resting inside the Temple (Rev. 11:19). In both the
Mosaic Tabernacle and the first and second Temples, the Ark resided in a
special room called the holy of holies, whose dimensions formed a perfect

Calculating with prophetic years
John’s vision in Revelation 11 draws heavily upon
the book of Daniel. Two time periods signal this:
“forty-two months” and “one thousand two hun-
dred sixty days” (Rev. 11:2–3; see Daniel 7:25, 9:27,
12:7, 12:11–12).The book of Daniel equates these
time periods with “three and one half years.”
John takes over a chronological scheme in the
book of Daniel and incorporates it into his frame-
work for the Great Tribulation or Day of the Lord.
Daniel contains a prophecy of a succession of
world powers (symbolized by various predatory
beasts) leading to the eventual arrival and tri-
umph of God’s kingdom (Daniel 7). In this
sequence, the seer discovers that a particularly
evil king reigns during the fourth kingdom “for a
time, two times, and half a time” (Daniel 7:25). In
the context of the book (see Daniel 4:16, 36), a
“time” equals one year.
Furthermore, Daniel reinterprets Jeremiah’s
prophecy that after 70 years elapsed, Jews
would return back to their ancestral homeland
(Jeremiah 25:11–12). Daniel transposes the 70
years into 70 weeks of years, in which a “week”
equals seven years. This, then, amounts to 490
years (70 × 7). Daniel sees that when the 490
years finally elapse, transgression, sin, and iniq-
uity are put to an end and everlasting righteous-
ness arrives (9:24). His primary focus, however,
is on the seventh week of seven years.
Apparently this “week” is divided equally into
two segments of 3.5 years. During the second
segment, an evil person commits outrage and
abomination in Jerusalem. John apparently
accepts this framework for his description of the
last “week” of the prophetic calendar. Like
Daniel, John paints a portrait of an evil person
who commits blasphemy and persecutes God’s
people for 3.5 years.
In other words, the Tribulation is calculated to
last one prophetic week — that is, seven years,
in keeping with Daniel’s chronology. Putting this
all together, John pictures a scenario in
Jerusalem in which two witnesses proclaim the
gospel for 3.5 years before being martyred — the
midpoint of the final seven years of earth.

cube. Accompanying this disclosure are features regularly associated with 
a theophany, or appearance of God: lightning, thunder, earthquake, and hail
(see Exodus 19:16–19; Psalm 18:7–15).
Not to be confused with Noah’s gigantic animal-filled boat, the Ark of the
Covenant was the central piece of furniture in the Tabernacle, cloistered in 
a cubical room (15 × 15 × 15 feet; see Exodus 25:10–22). The Tabernacle,
where the priests offered worship to God, was actually a very elaborate tent
(Exodus 26). The Tabernacle was disassembled and reassembled over and
over during the 40 years that the Children of Israel wandered in the desert
after leaving Egypt.
The Ark (see Figure 10-1) was made according to the pattern God showed
Moses on the mountain. In construction, it’s essentially an acacia wood chest
with a lid, covered in pure gold (see Figure 10-2). On the lid of the chest are
two golden cherubim, angelic figures, facing each other with outstretched
wings that touch above the Ark. Inside are the book of the covenant, contain-
ing the Ten Commandments (Exodus 24:12), a golden bowl of manna (Exodus
16:32–34), and later, Aaron’s staff (Numbers 17:2–10). The Ark functions as
Yahweh’s footstool (1 Chronicles 28:2; Psalm 99:5), and a bright luminescence
hovers over it.

Chapter 10: Sounding Seven Trumpets (8:2–11:19)

So, where is the Ark? What happened to it is a mystery. Most scholars think
the army of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar destroyed or melted it
down in 586 BCE. Persistent Jewish traditions, however, claim that the priests
or Jeremiah hid the Ark and that it remains hidden to this day. Several “arke-
ologists” in modern times claim to have seen it or photographed it, but these
claims are all fraudulent. The mystery surrounding the disappearance of the
Ark, however, makes for a great movie, even though you can be sure it’s not
really stowed somewhere in a warehouse in Washington, D.C., as depicted in
Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark!
The reappearance of the Ark in this moment functions as a symbol of God’s
faithfulness to his covenant promises. The people of God need a strong
reminder of this because in the short run, they’re about to experience the
wrath of Antichrist.

A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts,
and More! (12:1–14:20) 
In This Chapter
 Examining redemptive history in the story of the woman and the dragon
 Seeing the emergence of two beasts
 Reassuring the saints in the face of satanic opposition
T
he climactic moment in the long struggle between good and evil begins,
and the church is put on full alert. Revelation 12–14 can be viewed as
describing a period of despair bracketed by a beginning and ending of hope.
Revelation 12 reverberates with hope and victory for the believers, those
who trust in the Lamb (Jesus) for their salvation. 
Revelation 13, the middle section, is the rock bottom for the people of God.
The forces of darkness and evil close in for the kill. Satan’s Antichrist appears
to crush all resistance. But suddenly, just when all seems lost, in chapter 14,
the Lamb counterattacks with devastating effect. The forces of evil com-
pletely crumble and collapse. All this is crammed into three chapters in order
to help the church cram for its last test. 
In this chapter, you explore the topic of the Antichrist and why the Bible
maintains that believers have no need to fear in face of satanic opposition. 
Heavenly Drama: The Dragon Falls, 
the Woman Is Saved (12:1–17)
A skilled writer, John borrows imagery from the Old Testament and various
pre-Christian traditions and weaves them into a new tapestry displaying 
distinctly Christian threads. In Revelation 12, he draws upon ancient, mytho-
logical traditions from Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, and of course, 
the Hebrew Bible. Out of these, he creates a mini drama about cosmic
redemption.

The drama that unfolds is essentially the age old conflict between Jesus and
Satan. The plot features a child of destiny, Jesus, who comes to planet earth
to rule over all the nations. For his part, Satan resists this liberation move-
ment by attempting to kill the infant Jesus. Failing this, he unleashes his
venom against the historic people from whom Jesus descended (the Jewish
people) and those who profess allegiance to him (the church). The warfare
that rages in this conflict is truly cosmic in scope involving the celestial
(heavenly) as well as the terrestrial (earthly) realms. After the last battle, 
a new heavens and a new earth emerge from the smoke of this protracted
struggle (Rev. 21–22).
In composing this mini-drama, John incorporates imagery and concepts
drawn from pre-Christian mythology and legend as window dressing. These
borrowings are part of the shared traditions common to the Greco-Roman
world to which John’s audience belonged. By employing them, John adds
vividness and luster to the basic storyline. C. S. Lewis does much the same in
his Narnia books. The essential Christian message is dressed up in the lan-
guage of myth and fable. In neither John’s nor Lewis’ case are they affirming
belief in the window dressing; they are simply creatively retelling the familiar
gospel story.
John sets up his dramatic vignette by depicting the leading characters under
the guise of “portents.” These “portents” signify something of great impor-
tance for understanding redemptive (biblical) history. In the following discus-
sion, we offer our take on the identity and meaning of these portents.
Meeting the cast of characters 
John’s mini-drama involves three leading characters; two others appear in
minor roles. Each of these figures appearing on stage convey important reali-
ties about redemptive history and thus are described as “portents” (omen).
Because John and his first century audience share a common cultural her-
itage, which is not our own, the imagery and symbolism requires decoding. 
Pregnant woman clothed with the sun
The first character to appear on the stage is “a woman clothed with the 
sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars”
(Rev. 12:1). She speaks no intelligible lines but cries out in pain as she gives
birth (Rev. 12:2).
As is common in apocalyptic literature, John depicts characters who function
as symbols. A good example is an apocalyptic portion within a Jewish book
called 1 Enoch, dating to a period before the beginning of Christianity. It
retells the story of Israel using animals like cows, sheep, bulls, and rams as
symbols for the leading characters (1 Enoch 83–90). For this reason, modern
scholars designate this section as the “Animal Apocalypse.” If one knows the
story of Israel in the Bible, the various symbols are rather easily identified.
206
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Matters are not so cut and dried in Revelation 12—considerable disagree-
ment arises among scholars about the symbolic meaning of the woman. Here
are four differing perspectives: 
 The people of God: A majority of scholars identify the woman as the
people of God — Israel of the old covenant and the church of the new
covenant. One reason for this connection lies in Genesis 37:9–11, which
shares some common features. In a dream, the 17-year-old Joseph sees
the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him. His father Jacob,
whose name was changed to Israel (Genesis 32:28), interprets this to
mean that he and Rachel, Joseph’s mother, will bow down and submit to
Joseph’s authority.
In John’s adaptation of this vision, the twelve stars represent the twelve
tribes of Israel (Jacob’s 12 sons became the 12 tribes of Israel, as nar-
rated in Genesis 29 through Exodus 1). Furthermore, in several poetic
passages, prophets refer to Israel in the figure of a woman (Jeremiah
2–3; Ezekiel 23; Hosea 1–3) and, especially significant for this passage, as
a woman in childbirth (Isaiah 26:17–18, 66:7; Micah 4:10, 5:3).
 A Christianized version of ancient mythology: Another possible source
for John’s imagery comes from the world of Babylonian, Egyptian, and
Greco-Roman mythology. For example,
• From ancient Babylon comes a creation myth in which Marduk, the
national god of Babylon, defeats the seven-headed, primeval
dragon Tiamat.
• From Egypt comes a myth in which Set-Typhon, a red dragon, pur-
sues Isis, a mother-goddess, only to be killed later with fire by her
son Horus.
• Greek mythology provides perhaps even a closer parallel in the
story of the pregnant goddess Leto. She is pursued by the dragon
Python but escapes to the island of Ortygia.
Because his original readers were aware of these mythological tradi-
tions, John may have been borrowing some of the trappings. His finished
product, however, is thoroughly Christianized, as seen in this line: “But
they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb” (12:11).
 Domitia, the mother of God: An intriguing possibility relates to the
emperor Domitian. In the year 83 CE, Domitian’s 10-year-old son died. In
his grief, Domitian proclaimed his deceased son a god and his mother,
Domitia, the mother of god. Coins from this period give expression to
Domitian’s fantasy. One coin, for example, displays Domitia enthroned,
holding a scepter and wearing a diadem (a crown). The inscription reads
“Mother of the Divine Caesar.” Another coin depicts the child playing
with the seven stars and sitting above the heavens. Still another coin
shows Domitia on one side and the moon and six planets on the other
(see Figure 11-1). On this view, John counters imperial ideology by 
indicating who the true Lord of heaven and ruler of all the kings of the
earth really is.
207
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

 Virgin Mary: A very popular view during the medieval era and today in
conservative Roman Catholic circles interprets the woman as the Virgin
Mary. The correspondence in some of the imagery and storyline is obvi-
ous. Whether this is what John intended, however, is debatable. For the
reasons stated in support of the first option, most Catholic scholars
today agree that the woman symbolizes God’s people of both the Old
and New Testaments. One could, however, combine both views, in which
case the Virgin Mary typifies or embodies the true people of God.

Red dragon with seven heads and bad attitude
Among scholars there’s very little disagreement on who the red dragon from
Revelation 12:3 represents. In fact, you can hardly miss the symbolism. The
“great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on 
his heads” is generally believed to be none other than Satan. In fact, John
decodes this big, bad dragon in Revelation 12:9 — “The great dragon was
thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the
deceiver of the whole world” — and later in Revelation 20:2.
Male child with iron scepter
The identity of the male child in Rev 12:5 seems an obvious reference to
Jesus. Jesus is the one who will “rule all the nations with a rod of iron.” In
many translations, rod is translated as scepter, a symbol of power and royalty.
John’s opening salutation describes Jesus as “the ruler of the kings of the
earth” (1:5), and to the conquerors at Thyatira Jesus promises, “I will give
authority over the nations; to rule them with an iron rod” (2:26–27). And, says
John, when Jesus finally returns, “he will rule them [the nations] with a rod 
of iron” (19:15). All this is based on Psalm 2:8–9, a Psalm given a messianic
interpretation by some Jews well before the time of Jesus (see the sidebar,
“Document 4Q174”) and taken over and applied to Jesus by early Christians
(Hebrews 1:2).

Michael the mighty archangel
Revelation 12 speaks of Michael the archangel (Rev. 12:7), a regular character
in Jewish and Christian apocalyptic writing. He is typically the defender of
Israel (Daniel 12:1) and the leader of the angelic army loyal to God (Daniel
10:13, 10:21; Jude 9). In the Dead Sea Scrolls he appears ten times and func-
tions as the great protector of God’s people and as one who administers judg-
ment upon the wicked forces allied against Israel. He also conveys heavenly
mysteries and explains their meaning to a visionary like Enoch (See 1Enoch
9:1; 10:11; 20:5; 24:6). He may be the unnamed archangel the Apostle Paul 
had in mind when he described what would happen at Jesus’ second coming
(1 Thessalonians 4:16).
209
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)
Document 4Q174
In 1947, a shepherd was herding his flock near
Qumran, which is located near the Dead Sea. As
the story goes, the shepherd thought some
sheep had wandered into one of several caves
in the area. He tossed a rock into one, hoping to
scare the sheep out. Instead of bleating sheep,
he heard the sound of breaking pottery. Going
into the cave, he discovered several clay con-
tainers that held seven ancient scrolls. The year
was 1947, and it marked the beginning of the fur-
ther discovery of hundreds of documents in
nearly a dozen caves; these documents are
known as the Dead Sea Scrolls.
One of those documents provides evidence that
some Jews interpreted Psalm 2 in terms of the
Messiah. The reference appears in a sectarian,
probably Essene, document, called Midrash on
the Last Days and given the designation 4Q174.
The Essenes are designated as a sectarian
group because they broke away from the more
influential and dominant group in first century
Judaism, the Pharisees. A midrash is an inter-
pretation or paraphrase of a biblical text. The text
quotes Psalm 2:1 and then offers this comment:
“The meaning is that the nations shall set them-
selves and conspire vainly against the chosen of
Israel [a title for the Jewish Messiah] in the Last
Days. That will be the time of persecution that is
to come upon the House of Judah, to the end of
sealing up the wicked in the consuming fire and
destroying all the children of Belial [another
name for Satan]. Then shall be left behind a rem-
nant of chosen ones, the predestined.” 
So what does 4Q174 mean? This code is easy to
break! The number 4 means this document was
found in cave four (there were 11 in all) and the
Q means it was found at Qumran, a site along the
northwestern shore of the Dead Sea. The
number 174 is an inventory number given by the
researchers who studied the various documents.
The total number of manuscripts found in these
caves is thought to be between 800 and 900. The
settlement was inhabited by an ascetic group of
Jews called the Essenes. They rejected both the
Sadducees and Pharisees as incorrect inter-
preters of the law of Moses. They consequently
withdrew into the Judean desert to await the
coming of two Messiahs — one from the line of
David and the other from the priestly line of
Zadok. They expected a decisive battle against
evildoers (which included the Sadducees and
Pharisees!) in the End Times.

With the wings of an eagle
Does Revelation 12:14 refer to an eagle or just its wings? If it’s an eagle, could
be this the same eagle that announces the three woes back in Revelation
8:13? If so, the eagle may represent an angelic being.
Or perhaps John depicts some powerful king or kingdom under the figure of
an eagle. A passage in Ezekiel may shed some light. In Ezekiel 17, the prophet
gives an allegory involving two powerful eagles. The first represents the
Babylonian monarch, Nebuchadnezzar. The second is Psammetichus II of
Egypt. Judah sought, unsuccessfully, to resist Nebuchadnezzar by forming an
alliance with Psammetichus (Jeremiah 37:5).
In this regard, it’s perhaps worth noting that the Roman legions had an eagle
on top of their standards. John’s first readers may have immediately thought
of Rome. A number of prophecy buffs today see a reference to the United
States of America symbolized in the American bald eagle. 
Most likely, the passage means only the wings, not the whole eagle, related to
the imagery of Exodus 19:4 and Deuteronomy 32:11. This would mean you
can view the eagle as representing God’s protection for the faithful remnant
of the End Times. This may, of course, involve angelic agency, here depicted
as a great eagle.
Unpacking the plot and viewing the action
Now that the leading characters appearing onstage have been identified,
we’re ready to let the drama unfold. The drama consists of three acts
arranged in a logical, if not chronological sequence. The first act is necessary
to understand what happens in the second and the second is essential for
grasping what happens in the climactic third act. The bottom line is this: We
learn why the dragon is so filled with rage. Despite his best efforts, he can’t
thwart the kingdom of the child destined to rule the nations. He can cause
carnage, but he can’t keep control of planet earth. 
Act one: The great escape
Act one opens with an immediate, life-threatening danger: a woman in the
throes of child birth confronted by a red dragon intent on devouring her new-
born! The dragon is backed up by fallen angels (or demons). One thinks here
of the Death Eaters in Harry Potter: “His tail swept down a third of the stars
of heaven and threw them to earth” (Rev 12:4). 
Amazingly, the child escapes. All you’re told is that he is “snatched away and
taken to God and to his throne” (Rev. 12:5). So, who is this child? As men-
tioned above, most commentators understand this as a reference to Jesus.
However, a few express doubts that a Christian writer like John would tell the
story of Jesus in such a compressed way, without even mentioning the cross
210
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

and resurrection. Moving from birth to ascension leaves out incredibly
important parts! But that shouldn’t be seem as a great problem. John is selec-
tive and creative. He doesn’t feel compelled to “give the whole ball of wax”
because his audience is already aware of the details.
For example, the original recipients of Revelation would be aware of the
Gospel of Matthew, which provides a fuller account of the birth of Jesus.
According to Matthew, eastern astrologers (magi or wise men) arrive in
Jerusalem (Matthew 2:1–12). They’re convinced from observations of a cer-
tain “star” that the promised Messiah has been born in Judea. Unfortunately,
they go straight to the man in charge, the paranoid and cruel Herod the
Great, and ask where the child is. Herod pretends to sincerely desire to show
homage to this heir to the kingdom. Having asked the religious experts 
where the Messiah was prophesied to be born and learning it was Bethlehem
(Micah 5:2), Herod dispatches the magi with instructions to let him know
when they find the child. Herod’s intention is to murder the infant in order to
eliminate any potential threat to his power.
Providentially, God steps in to save Jesus’ life. That is, God oversees the
course of history down to the smallest details. In this instance, by means of a
dream, the wise men are warned not to return to Herod. Then an angel alerts
Jesus’ father Joseph to the mortal danger and Joseph flees to Egypt with 
his family just in the nick of time. When Herod realizes he’s been outsmarted,
he orders a massacre of all males two years old or younger in the village of
Bethlehem, adding to his already long list of atrocities.
John’s vision summarizes the same event but from “behind the scenes.” 
In other words, behind all the plotting of the paranoid Herod, the devil is at
work. John’s vision unmasks the ultimate culprit. Satan works through people
who fully embrace evil to achieve their own ends (similar to the tragic story
of Faust, who sold his soul to the devil). 
Act two: A cosmic slugfest 
Act two quickly ensues in Revelation 12:7–12. Satan (appearing as a dragon
and later as a serpent) has been outwitted. An all-out heavenly war erupts
between the good angels under the command of Michael and the evil angels
led by the dragon. This cosmic slugfest results in the ousting of Satan and his
evil cronies. They’re consigned to the earth. This seems to be a case of good
news/bad news. The good news is that Satan has no more influence in
heaven; the bad news is that planet earth becomes his base of operations. 
In this mini-drama, the final chapter of earth history is characterized by a
cosmic power struggle. In John’s vision, a loud voice from heaven spells out
what this all means: “Rejoice then, you heavens and those who dwell in them!
But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with
great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!” (Rev. 12:12). A deter-
mined and desperate devil digs in for “the last battle.” He wants to take as
many with him as he can. 
211
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

However, in spite of all the threatening talk about Satan, Satan suffers two
stunning setbacks in this section. Michael and the angels oust him from the
heavenly court and the saints on earth also defeat him. How do they, so
much weaker in virtually every way, manage to overcome the powerful red
dragon? The answer is once again expressed in Johannine paradox: “they
have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their 
testimony” (Rev. 12:11). They trust in the death of the Lamb on their behalf
and remain faithful to him even to the point of death (12:11b). 
Act three: Satan on a leash
Act three returns the woman to center stage. The dragon directs his rage at
the woman who gave birth. But Satan is on a leash; he doesn’t have unlimited
power. God providentially protects the woman — the people of God (see 
the earlier “Meeting the cast of characters” section) — from Satan’s assaults.
This is the message John wants the church of his day to hear — a message
relevant for the church throughout the last days.
From the New Testament perspective, “the last days” began at Pentecost
(Acts 2:17–21; Hebrews 1:2) and continue until the Parousia (the second
coming of Jesus).
Remarkably, Revelation 12:12–16 describes an extraordinary rescue opera-
tion. It’s as if the woman drank an energy drink that literally gave her wings!
How cool is that? So, what can you make of these mysterious eagle wings that
carry the woman away to a wilderness retreat, “where she is nourished for a
time, and times, and half a time” (three and one half years or 42 months or
1,260 days)? Then the dragon tries to drown the woman with a flood of water
issuing from his mouth. But the earth comes to the woman’s rescue and swal-
lows up river. Once again the dragon is prevented from destroying the
woman, the people of God. Admittedly, this is another difficult passage, and
interpreters diverge in keeping with the degree of literalness they employ.
Here a couple of interpretations: 
 Literal view: On a more-or-less literal reading, the woman represents the
Jewish people of the End Times. They come under satanic attack led by
the Antichrist (the beast of Rev. 11:7 and Rev. 13). God providentially
rescues them (perhaps by aircraft?) and transports them to a sanctuary
in the Negev (a wilderness area of southern Israel). 
One expositor of an earlier generation, Dr. Louis Talbot, believed the
rose-red city of Petra (in modern-day Jordan) would serve as a safe
haven during the great tribulation. Following up on this conviction, he
arranged to have Gospel pamphlets printed and stashed in Petra in
anticipation of that time! Needless to say, this goes well beyond what the
biblical text actually says.
212
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Tim LaHaye, in his novel Desecration: Antichrist Takes the Throne (the
ninth book in his Left Behind series) takes the woman to represent
“tribulation saints” — that is, individuals, both Jewish and Gentile, who
are not believers when the rapture occurs but come to faith in Jesus
during the great Tribulation. They’re part of a resistance movement
dubbed “the Tribulation Force.” LaHaye sketches a scenario in which a
million believers, including many Israelis, escape the Antichrist’s wrath
by also fleeing to Petra. This planned escape is called “Operation Eagle,”
based on Revelation 12:14.
 Symbolic view: Those holding a symbolic view explore the imagery
drawn from the whole of Scripture. They believe this passage resonates
with echoes of the story of the Exodus from Egypt. For example, notice
the following items:
• Just like the red dragon who pursues the woman, so Pharaoh 
pursued the Israelites when they left Egypt (Exodus 14:8).
• The reference to the two wings of an eagle recalls the words of the
Lord in Exodus 19:4: “. . . I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought
you to myself.”
• Perhaps readers hear an echo of Pharaoh’s charge to drown
Hebrew babies (Exodus 1:22) when the serpent pours forth water
like a river in order to drown the woman.
• The opening of the earth to swallow up the water may allude to the
episode in the wilderness when the rebellious house of Korah was
swallowed up by the earth (Numbers 16:31–33). 
The bottom line is this: The imagery emphasizes God’s providential protec-
tion for his people during the great Tribulation. This doesn’t mean they’re
spared the wrath of the Antichrist. Rather, it means the Antichrist can huff
and puff as much as he wants, but he won’t be able to blow the house down.
Those who believe in Jesus will emerge victorious whether by life or death.
After all, Jesus himself promised that “the gates of Hades will not prevail
against it [the church]” (Matthew 16:18).
Two Beasty Boys Join the Dragon 
to Make Their Mark (13:1–18)
As Revelation 13 begins, John describes how the dragon (Satan) spawns and
empowers two henchmen who set out to deceive the world and destroy the
Fellowship of the Lamb. In this chapter, you are introduced to the members of
the unholy trinity and how they manage to take control of planet earth. You
see how through a counterfeit miracle, a mock resurrection, the beast from
the sea (antichrist) secures economic and political control of the world. The
beast from the earth, the antichrist’s minister of propaganda and high priest,
213
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

installs a false religious system requiring worship of the beast. A worldwide
identification scheme, the infamous number of the beast, 666, is imple-
mented. Only those bearing the number and thus cooperating and participat-
ing in this godless cult can buy or sell. The fellowship of the Lamb is on the
brink of extermination. 
Monster mash: The Antichrist, 
beast of the sea
In ancient mythology and in the Hebrew Bible, the sea often represents an
unruly force echoing the chaos that existed prior to the creation of the earth
(Genesis 1:2). One version of a creation story from Babylon, called Enuma
Elish, speaks of the primeval sea waters as a great dragon called Tiamat. In
this epic myth, Tiamat and Marduk (see Figure 11-2), the young, powerful god
of Babylon, engage in hand-to-hand combat. Psalm 74:13–14 borrows the
imagery of this primeval duel but changes the names: It’s not Marduk but
Yahweh who overcomes the chaos monster Leviathan. Just before this trial
by arms, Tiamat spawns a massive army of dragons. (If you’re a Lord of the
Rings fan, think Sauron and his Orcs.) In keeping with that imagery, the
dragon of Revelation now conjures up the ultimate chaos monster; “a beast
rising up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads; and on its horns
were ten diadems, and on its heads were blasphemous names” (Rev. 13:1).
This monster shows up again in Revelation 17–18.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

John’s description of the beast also incorporates important information from
the book of Daniel. The beast from the sea is a composite beast displaying
features of a leopard, bear, and lion. Daniel uses these three animals to 
depict a sequence of four world empires that precede the final kingdom of
God (Daniel 7). Many conservative scholars understand this sequence
accordingly:
1. The lion represents Babylon under the authority of Nebuchadnezzar.
2. The bear represents the large and powerful kingdom of Persia launched
by Cyrus the Great.
3. The leopard represents the lightning-fast conquests of the Macedonian
Greeks under Alexander the Great.
4. The nondescript beast who supplants all previous kingdoms is either
Rome or the final kingdom of the Antichrist.
5. The little horn with human-like eyes and arrogant mouth is either
Antiochus IV Epiphanes (215–163 B.CE) or the Antichrist. Some inter-
preters see this as a case of typology. Typology is a way of linking 
persons, events or institutions from one biblical era to a later one, espe-
cially the Old and New Testaments. This is usually stated in terms of a
foreshadowing. It assumes that there is a correspondence or pattern
that unfolds within salvation history. In this particular case, Antiochus
IV of the second century B.CE (the era of the Maccabean Revolt) fore-
shadows the final Antichrist of the end times.
In John’s vision, the beast from the sea is so terrifying and hideous he incor-
porates all the evils of the wicked world empires preceding him. The most
alarming fact about this beast is his source of power and authority: The
dragon energizes the beast and authorizes him to act on his behalf. This is
Satan’s most cunning creature ever — it’s not a physical beast, like Godzilla
walking around and terrorizing the earth. He’s a human being, no doubt 
possessing charm and charisma, who cobbles together an immense, interna-
tional, economic and political coalition, all under the direct control of Satan.
John, however, describes him under the guise of ferocious beasts in order to
expose his real character and intentions.
The dragon cons the world into believing the beast is invincible. Receiving 
an apparently mortal blow to one of his heads, the beast recovers. It seems
to be a miracle. In fact, it’s a parody of the resurrection of Jesus. The world 
is amazed and responds with worship and adulation directed to both the
dragon and his protégé: “They worshiped the dragon . . . saying, ‘Who is like
the beast, and who can fight against it?’” (Rev. 13:4). The answer seems to 
be no one.
A reign of terror ensues. The beast seizes power and authority over the entire
planet. For the first time since the Tower of Babel (Gen. 11:1–9), a one-world
government arises. God is ridiculed and debunked in the new regime. The
beast claims he is God. This seems to be the same event the Apostle Paul
215
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

describes in 2 Thessalonians 2:4: “He opposes and exalts himself above every
so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of
God, declaring himself to be God.” For 42 months (three and a half years) the
beast holds the reins of power. The church and all others are unable to stop
him. But believers aren’t powerless. They refuse to worship the beast or
receive his mysterious mark. John inserts a word of admonition and exhorta-
tion, noting the pointlessness of mounting a violent resistance (Rev. 13:9–10).
The exhortation has special relevance for believers in the first century con-
fronting the blasphemous claims of the imperial cult. But it also has relevance
for succeeding generations who must likewise resist false ideologies that 
supplant God. One thinks of Christians like Dietrich Bonhoeffer who resisted,
at the cost of his life, the Nazi ideology during WWII. The primary reference,
however, is for that last generation of Christians who are called upon to resist
the onslaught of the antichrist. Believers, however, should not lose their cool.
This is all foreseen by God. He knows precisely what’s happening. The saints
must do the one thing in their power left to do: They must continue to be
faithful to the Lamb even if it costs them their lives. As John says in Revelation
13:10, “Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.”
Head of PR: The false prophet, 
beast from inner earth
In Revelation 13, the dragon (a.k.a. Satan) conjures up a second beast, this
time from the depths of the earth, that has two horns like a lamb and speaks
like a dragon (Rev. 13:11). Like many of the beasties and other odd critters
found in Revelation, this beast is not a literal monster but rather is a symbol.
In this case, the beast is an individual who heads up a world government.
Ancient and apocalyptic mythologies speak of two primeval monsters: a sea
monster called Tiamat or Leviathan and a land monster, sometimes called
Behemoth (1 Enoch 60:7–10; Isaiah 27:1; Job 20:15). John may draw upon
these two primeval monsters in his portrayal of the Antichrist and his 
false prophet.
Although we don’t know exactly what form this beast will take, we do have
some good clues as to its character:
 It has two horns like a lamb might have. This could imply an attempt to
appear like the Lamb of God. In apocalyptic literature, animals with
horns, like sheep and goats, are regularly used as symbols of strength
and power (See Daniel 8).
 The beast speaks like a dragon. This doesn’t mean he speaks in some
kind of mythic language only other dragons can understand. It refers
rather to the nature or substance of what he has to say. Because Satan
has already been characterized by John as a dragon, it’s a safe bet that
this beast’s words will be deceptive and dangerous. 
216
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Combining the two character traits symbolized by the lamb-like horns and
dragon tongue, what you get is a real beastly wolf in sheep’s clothing! He’s
the consummate false prophet, and, in fact, is so designated later (Rev. 16:13;
19:20; 20:10). A charismatic figure, the beast from the earth serves as the min-
ister of propaganda for the beast from the sea. He performs miraculous signs
like a modern Moses or Elijah and thoroughly hoodwinks a credulous world.
In short, the beast from the sea functions as an unholy spirit. Together, beast
one (from the sea) and beast two (from the earth) represent the Antichrist
and the false prophet.
The false prophet seeks to glorify the Antichrist in the eyes of the unbelieving
world by setting up a blasphemous cult featuring a speaking image of the
beast. The beast must be worshiped as a god, and the penalty for disobedi-
ence is death. There’s no escape for members of the Fellowship of the Lamb.
A worldwide registration system comes online, the notorious “mark of 
the beast.”
As early as the days of Caligula (41 B.CE), a near-crisis occurred when
Caligula insisted that his statue be worshiped in the Jerusalem Temple. The
Jewish people were prepared to resist his decree to the death. Fortunately, 
he was assassinated before the command was carried out. In John’s day, 
worship of the divine Caesar was mandatory in some Asian cities, and at
least one Christian, Antipas, suffered martyrdom for disobeying (Rev. 2:13).
The imperial cult is doubtless the lens through which John portrays the 
false prophet’s ministry (for more on emperor worship in Ancient Rome, 
see Chapter 2).
Beastly markings: 666
Perhaps no single feature of the book of Revelation has intrigued readers as
deeply as the mark of the beast and its mysterious number, 666. The false
prophet (beast from the earth) institutes a registration system whereby fol-
lowers of the sea beast all receive a number stamped on either their right
hand or forehead. Without this number, no one can buy or sell. Survival 
literally depends on having this number, which is “the name of the beast or
the number of its name.”
So, what is this mysterious number and whom does it represent? Given that
John states, “This calls for wisdom: let anyone with understanding calculate
the number of the beast” (Rev. 13:18), you’d almost think all you need to do is
pull out a calculator and go at it! Some people have tried that approach,
which has yielded some pretty offbeat conclusions. Like a Gordian Knot, the
problem of perpetual motion, and Colonel Sander’s secret blend of 11 herbs
and spices, the number of the beast has kept scholars scratching their heads
for ages. Here’s a sampling of proposed explanations for the identity and
mark of the beast.
217
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

Nero Caesar
The early church Father Irenaeus, in the second century CE, mentions that
people were already suggesting many candidates for the role of Antichrist.
One in particular was at the top of the list — and with good reason. Nero
Caesar’s brief but bloody persecution of Christians in the aftermath of the fire
in Rome (64 CE) qualified him because Revelation 17:6 describes a woman
(closely identified with the beast) as “drunk with the blood of the saints and
the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.”
A rumor that became a legend circulated to the effect that Nero either had
not died (the official report said he committed suicide), or that he died but
would come back from the dead. Supposedly he was alive and well in Parthia
(Rome’s bitter rival in the east) and would soon return and wreak vengeance
on Rome. This became known as the Nero redivivus legend. Perhaps a major-
ity of modern scholars think John had this in mind when he penned this sec-
tion, even if he only borrowed the legend in order to depict an eschatological
(end times) figure.
Here’s where the story gets interesting and somewhat involved: If one takes
the name of Nero Caesar, converts it into Hebrew letters, and then takes the
numeral value of the letters according to their order in the alphabet, the sum
is 666. This kind of calculation is part of a system of interpretation called
gematria and was popular not only in Jewish circles but in Roman culture as
well. Examples of gematria can be seen on the walls of the Roman city
Pompeii.
Irenaeus, however, warns his readers not to engage in idle speculation. The
number can be known only when the antichrist actually arrives on the scene.
For now, he notes, only God knows what the number means and who the
antichrist is. Yet, in spite of Irenaeus’s warning, scholars have tried their
hand at breaking the code, with astonishingly different results!
The pope
The Reformers, locked in an often-violent struggle over control for the hearts
and minds of European Christians, readily found ammunition for their apolo-
getic cannons by pillorying the pope as the antichrist. The primary source
for this identification comes later in Revelation 17–18. The mention of the
seven mountains (Rev. 17:9) seemed to point to Rome, the center of papal
power. Mention of being clothed in purple and scarlet, gold and jewels, along
with a golden cup of abominations (thought to be an allusion to the doctrine
of transubstantiation, the Roman Catholic teaching that the bread and wine of
the Eucharist actually become the body and blood of Christ when conse-
crated by the priest) seemed quite sufficient for the Reformers to erase all
doubt: The pope was indeed the antichrist.
218
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The number 666 was accordingly viewed as symbolic of the evil papal
system. Because six falls short of perfection (seven), it is suitable as the
number for fallen humanity. Thrice six simply intensifies the evil of this
wicked person and institution. The first edition of the Church of England’s
Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) says, “There is no other Head of the
Church, but the Lord Jesus Christ; Nor can the Pope of Rome, in any sense 
be head thereof: but is that Antichrist, that Man of sin and Son of Perdition,
that exalteth himself, in the Church, against Christ, and all that is called 
God” (Chapter XXV, VI). This section of the book has long since been deleted.
Today, only a tiny minority of commentators hold this view. 
Napoleon Bonaparte
During the upheavals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
more than a few commentators and preachers identified Napoleon Bonaparte,
the Corsican corporal himself, as the antichrist. His return from exile in Elba
(the wound that seemed mortal, Rev. 13:3) and mobilization of another army
(Rev. 16:14–16) seemed to unfold according to the script. Then there was
Waterloo, exile in St. Helena, and death — but no return to life. Another 
candidate faded from memory.
Assorted modern dictators and tyrants
In more recent times, a number of Bible teachers and preachers went into
print claiming that Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were the antichrist, or
perhaps together, were the beast and false prophet. In fact, if one added
Japan’s emperor Hirohito to the equation, you had the three, self-designated
Axis powers, a kind of unholy trinity from the perspective of the Allies!
Needless to say, the Axis perpetrated enough heinous crimes to merit the
dubious distinction. But that terrible time fell far short of fulfilling John’s
prophecy. Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and Osama
Bin Laden, among others, merit mention in this infamous “Hall of Shame” for
ordering or otherwise causing the deaths of so many. Each of them displayed
a measure of cunning and cruelty that Revelation’s antichrist no doubt 
possesses in unprecedented measure.
World-renowned leaders
We mention the following people because they illustrate only too well the
need for Irenaeus’s warning about speculation. A few Bible prophecy buffs,
following the old theory that the antichrist is a Jew, latched onto one of the
most charismatic and enigmatic political figures of the twentieth century,
Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon. More than
a little whiff of anti-Semitism can be detected in this supposed identification.
Still others pointed to Mikhail Gorbachev, whose only real “credential” —
besides that fact that he was the General Secretary of the Communist Party
and President of the Soviet Union (some believe that Communism is a tool of
Satan and will eventually be controlled by the Antichrist) — was a rather
prominent birthmark on his forehead!
219
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

Buildings, phone numbers, and computer codes
Speculation still runs rampant about the number 666. Bar codes and micro-
chips provide a field day for 666 sleuths! The Internet abounds with theories,
and new sightings regularly surface. A prominent building in New York City
bears the address 666; rumors persist that it serves as the future office for
the antichrist. When a new computer system came online in Europe with the
code name 666, the prophecy experts were all over it! And when a telephone
company assigned the area code 666 to a part of the Bible Belt in Kentucky,
the uproar was sufficient to have it changed! One “expert” observed that
Ronald Wilson Reagan’s full name has six letters in each name; to top it off,
when he left Washington, the number of his new address was originally 666.
He had it changed to 668. So what’s in a number? Apparently a lot!
The PIN of the antichrist 
Most scholars in the premillennial tradition (Jesus returns to the earth and
reigns a thousand years before the final judgment and the new heavens and
earth) believe the beast from the sea represents an actual person who heads
up an evil empire. They further contend that 666 symbolizes who this person
is, a kind of personal identification number (PIN). They claim that the notion
of six as the number of imperfection and fallen humanity makes sense. In the
Bible, seven is often referred to as representing perfection, so six would be
imperfect, and thus 666 emphasizes three times over the evil and depravity of
the person and his kingdom. But as to his specific identity, most believe that
only when he is actually revealed may his identity be known with certainty.
Many historical figures and regimes have embodied some of the features of
the antichrist (despotic cruelty and oppression for example) but none have
come close to matching the scale of deception and devastation depicted in
Revelation 13. Does he, she, or it exist somewhere on the earth right now?
Only time will tell! How’s that for a definitive non-answer to the mystery 
of 666?
The Lamb and the 144,000 (14:1–5)
Revelation 14 opens with an image that gives comfort to all people of God:
The Lamb is standing on Mount Zion with the redeemed. By sharing a short
celebration that includes thunder, harps, and a new song, John assures
believers that ultimate victory belongs to the Lamb.
The 144,000 (the number is symbolic) first mentioned in Revelation 7 (see
Chapter 9) reappear in John’s vision — this time on Mount Zion, with the
Lamb, around the throne of God. Etched on their foreheads, as opposed to
666, is the name of the Lamb and the Father speaking to the character and
status of those who bear it. These are sons and daughters of God. None of
220
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

them have the dreaded mark of the beast. They’ve resisted the most intense
pressure and persecution imaginable. Their unswerving loyalty and 
commitment is expressed in the following biblical imagery:
 Virgins, or those who kept themselves pure: This description draws
attention to spiritual fidelity and chastity. In the Old Testament, Israelites
frequently turned away from God and worshipped other gods, commit-
ting a kind of spiritual adultery. In the New Testament, believers are
warned about mixed loyalties (Matthew 6:14; 1 John 2:15, 5:21). In this
context, the redeemed are called virgins (some translations are more
descriptive, indicating they avoided sexual relations) because they
acknowledge and confess that only Jesus is Lord: “These follow the Lamb
wherever he goes” (Rev. 14:4). True believers in Jesus are, figuratively,
the pure bride of Jesus.
In the first century CE, Christians had to make a choice: Is Caesar Lord
or is Jesus Lord? Those who chose Jesus ended up as macabre enter-
tainment and food for lions. According to Revelation, the End Time gen-
eration will have to make a similar choice: Is the beast of the sea Lord or
is the Lamb Lord? The redeemed choose the Lamb and celebrate their
choice by singing a song of redemption that only they can sing. 
 First fruits: In the Old Testament, Israelites were commanded to bring 
a portion of the early harvest of the land to the Temple of God as an act
of thanksgiving and gratitude for the full harvest to follow (Leviticus
19:23–25, 23:9–21; Deuteronomy 26:1–11). These first-fruit offerings also
supplied the priestly and Levitical families (those belonging to the tribe
of Levi and assigned to assist the priests at the tabernacle as specified in
Numbers 3–4) who ministered before the Lord at the sanctuary and were
not able to spend the time in the fields themselves. Metaphorically, the
expression refers to that which is first (Jeremiah 2:3) and that which
belongs solely to the Lord. In the New Testament, believers are referred
to as first fruits (James 1:18; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; Romans 8:23). 
 Blameless: The 144,000 reflect their status as followers devoted com-
pletely to the Lamb by virtue of their virtue. Transparent integrity char-
acterizes these redeemed. John probably alludes to a prophetic text in
Zephaniah 3:13: “. . . the remnant of Israel; they shall do no wrong and
utter no lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths.” The
stark contrast to the deceit and deception of the dragon and the beasts
is unmistakable.
This vision of the Lamb on Mount Zion surrounded by 144,000 bearing his
name stands in splendid contrast to the previous section. By the time chap-
ter 13 concludes, one wonders how the fellowship of the Lamb can possibly
survive such an onslaught .Yet here there are singing a new song in the 
presence of the Lamb! The bottom line is this: faith in the Lamb triumphs
over demonic deception, economic deprivation, and brute force. John says 
in prose in his first epistle what he here depicts in imagery: “And this is the
victory that conquers the world, our faith. Who is it that conquers the world
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?” (1 John 5:4). 
221
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

Three Angels with Three 
Messages (14:6–13)
Have you ever seen a school production of Peter Pan or some other play
requiring actors to “fly” by means of “invisible” wires? What John witnesses
is way better! Three wireless angels appear in mid-air, each with a special
message. These announcements anticipate and summarize the last series of
seven judgments, the seven bowls of God’s wrath. These bowls, when finally
poured out, finish off the antichrist’s kingdom headquartered in Babylon the
great (14:8). All those who follow the beast suffer the same fate: They must
drink the wine of God’s wrath. This entails a fiery punishment whose smoke
“goes up forever and ever” (Rev. 14:11).
Proclaiming an eternal gospel
The first announcement is in Revelation 14:6–7: “Then I saw another angel
flying in mid-heaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on
the earth — to every nation and tribe and language and people. He said in 
a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has
come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs
of water.’”
The eternal gospel is more broadly based than the good news of Jesus’ aton-
ing death. This message spoken by the angel addresses the fundamental
offense human beings commit: failure to acknowledge God as Creator. This
primal offense (Genesis 3) replicates itself in every human heart and leads to
our alienation from him and all others. The Apostle Paul is making the same
point in Romans when he says: “. . . for though they knew God, they did not
honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their think-
ing, and their senseless minds were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they
became fools; and they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images
resembling a mortal human being or birds or four footed animals or reptiles”
(Romans 1:21–23).
Proclaiming the fall of Babylon
A second angel announces the soon-to-happen collapse of Babylon the great:
“Then another angel, a second, followed, saying, ‘Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
great! She has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornica-
tion’” (Rev. 14:8). That doesn’t sound like a very appealing vintage! In Chapter
12, we go into more detail as to the identity of Babylon. But for now, all you
need to know is that Babylon is not necessarily a literal city but could be a
political power. Here’s a sampling of the leading views on what this angelic
message means (for more on general ways to read Revelation, see Chapter 4):
222
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 Literal approach: People adhering to a strictly literal approach insist
that ancient Babylon (which is located in Iraq) will rise from the desert
sands and become the global capital of the Antichrist’s evil empire. 
Back in the 1990s, when Saddam Hussein began restoration work on the
ancient site of Babylon, prophecy buffs were buzzing. Needless to say,
the initial enthusiasm has cooled in light of more recent events. Still,
some of the faithful continue to teach that ancient Babylon will literally
be rebuilt.
 Symbolic approach: Those holding a symbolic approach argue that
Babylon is more likely to be a code name for Rome. An apocalyptic work
contemporaneous with the book of Revelation uses Babylon as a sym-
bolic name for Rome. On this view, John is encouraging the faithful of his
day by predicting the demise of imperial Rome.
 Futurist approach: A moderately futuristic approach understands John
to be using first-century imperial Rome as the lens through which to
focus on the ultimate power center of the Antichrist. John borrows
prophetic language from the Old Testament prophet Isaiah that predicts
the fall of historic Babylon for destroying Jerusalem and the First Temple
in 586 B.CE (Isaiah 21:9). John reapplies this prophecy to Rome of the
first century CE God will judge Rome, the new Babylon, for destroying
Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE It’s possible, however, 
that Rome represents that ultimate Babylon the great, the capital of
Antichrist’s empire. Where this will be located is, like the identity of the
Antichrist himself, to be known only at the end.
Proclaiming a warning with assurance
All who accept the mark of the beast are destined to experience God’s wrath.
There’s simply no way to soften this. The third angel delivers a somber warn-
ing that makes this pretty darn clear: “‘Those who worship the beast and its
image, and receive a mark on their foreheads or on their hands, they will also
drink the wine of God’s wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger, and
they will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels
and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up 
for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the
beast and its image and for anyone who receives the mark of its name’” 
(Rev. 14:9–11).
The imagery employed for this punishment derives from the Old Testament
and is related to undiluted wine, fire, and sulfur — not a tasty blend of 
flavors. The first metaphor stresses the potency of God’s judgment (Jeremiah
25:15–16, 51:7), and the second recalls the devastation of Sodom and
Gomorrah (Genesis 19:24). What is especially difficult is the seemingly unend-
ing nature of the judgment: “And the smoke of their torment goes up forever
and ever” (Rev 14:11). We look more closely at this judgment in Chapter 13.
223
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)

That’s the bad news; now the good news: On a brighter note, the angel ends
with a word of exhortation to the faithful, encouraging them to “hold fast to
the faith of Jesus” (Rev. 13:9–10). A voice from heaven affirms this encourage-
ment with a benediction or beatitude (a blessing): “Blessed are the dead who
from now on die in the Lord” (14:13). Who does this voice belong to? Most
likely it’s the voice of Jesus. This is strengthened by the fact that the Spirit
responds. This is one of those biblical passages that suggest the threefold
nature of God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).
Revelation 14:13 is the second of seven beatitudes or benedictions (“Blessed
are”) interspersed throughout the book of Revelation. The others are in
Revelation 1:3, 16:15, 19:9, 20:6, and 22:7, 14.
Harvesting and the Grapes 
of Wrath (14:14–20)
A two-part, multi-layered, harvest-themed vision caps off Revelation 14:
 In the first harvesting, an angel tells someone sitting on a cloud and
holding a sickle to reap the harvest of the earth. 
 In the second harvesting, another angel tells a different angel holding a
sickle to harvest grapes, which are then thrown into a winepress and
trampled.
Are these two scenes positive or negative images? Or is one positive and the
other negative? A majority of commentators agree that the second harvesting
is a picture of divine judgment. Considerable disagreement, however, sur-
faces over the nature of the first harvesting. Following the harvestings is an
image of warfare.
Reaping the earth
In most agrarian settings, and throughout the Bible, harvest time typically
denotes a joyous time of thanksgiving. In this passage of Revelation, however,
what is reaped (that is, to gather a crop in by cutting) is not corn, wheat, or
any kind of grain. Human beings are reaped. Consequently, some interpreters
understand the reaping imagery as the ingathering (or rapture) of the
church. This view is strengthened by the fact that the one sitting on the white
cloud who does the reaping is said to look like “the Son of Man,” which is
another title for Jesus.
224
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Jesus’ parable of the sower (Mark 4) may offer further support for this view.
In the parable, some “hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty and
sixty and a hundredfold” (Mark 4:20). Even closer in thought is the parable in
which a farmer sows a field with seeds. Afterward, it sprouts and yields ripe
grain. The farmer “goes in with his sickle, because the harvest has come”
(Mark 4:29). But even closer yet is John’s narrative of the Samaritan woman
in his Gospel. Jesus says to his disciples, “‘But I tell you, look around you and
see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. The reaper is already receiving
wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may
rejoice together’” (John 4:35–36). Not surprisingly, then, some expositors take
a positive view of the first harvesting of the earth.
Treading the grapes (of wrath)
The second harvesting involves gathering and then stomping on symbolic
grapes. The grape vintage is typically another joyous occasion in biblical
times. The entire family would participate with singing and games while
crushing the grapes barefoot in the wine press.
But in some passages, treading grapes serves as a terrifying metaphor of
God’s judgment. In fact, John seems to borrow the imagery from Isaiah 63:1–6.
There, in a startling word picture, the prophet describes the Lord’s coming
upon the land of Judah bedecked in garments stained crimson. When asked
why his royal robes are red, he replies, “I have trodden the wine press alone . . .
I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their juice spattered
on my garments, and stained all my robes. For the day of vengeance was in 
my heart, and the year for my redeeming work had come. . . . I trampled down
peoples in my anger, I crushed them in my wrath, and I poured out their
lifeblood on the earth.” Most likely, then, the image of squeezing out the juice,
like blood, vividly conveys another picture of God’s wrath poured out on
unbelievers during the great Tribulation.
225
Chapter 11: A Woman, a Dragon, Two Beasts, and More! (12:1–14:20)
Two takes on one judgment
John apparently borrows the imagery for both
the wheat and the grape harvestings from the
Old Testament prophet Joel. In Joel 3:13, in a
context of impending divine judgment on the
nations, the prophet says, “Put in the sickle, for
the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the wine
press is full. The vats overflow, for their wicked-
ness is great.” The last line, many scholars
observe, casts a quite different perspective on
both the first and second harvestings. From this
perspective, both would seem to represent
divine judgment. John’s vintage scene is intro-
duced by describing an angel who performs the
action: “And he too had a sharp sickle” (Rev.
14:17). This seems to link closely the two 
sickles, and clearly, the second conveys a 
negative image. Therefore, many commen-
tators conclude that both harvestings, in this
context, depict God’s End Time judgment on an
unbelieving world.

“The Battle Hymn of the Republic” — the source of the title of John Steinbeck’s
The Grapes of Wrath — also refers to Isaiah 63:1–6.
Battle-spilled blood as high as a bridle
Chapter 14 ends with a grisly one-sentence depiction of death: “Blood flowed
from the wine press, as high as a horse’s bridle, for a distance of about two
hundred miles” (Rev. 14:20). This is another dramatic image that most com-
mentators don’t take literally. Several accounts of ancient battles employ
hyperbole in order to impress upon the reader the enormity of the loss of life.
Josephus in his epic The Jewish War is a prime example. Similar exaggeration
appears in Jewish accounts of the fall of Bar Kokhba’s fortress to the Romans
in 135 CE (Bar Kokhba was the leader of the second revolt against Rome
[132–135 CE]and declared to be the Messiah by Rabbi Akiva). It seems likely
that John is using hyperbole to describe his vision as well. Having said that,
don’t minimize the main point — namely, the immense loss of life.
Notice that the wine press is trodden “outside the city” (Rev. 14:20). What
city? Does John mean Babylon the great, whose collapse he more fully
describes in Revelation 18? Or does he mean Jerusalem, where the two wit-
nesses ministered? Probably he means Babylon the great, a code name for
Rome and the lens through which John projects the ultimate imperial city of
the beast.

In This Chapter
 Pouring out God’s wrath
 Arming for Armageddon
 Getting up close and personal with the great whore
 Watching Babylon burn and sink
T
he book of Revelation can seem like endless rounds of a heavyweight,
world championship boxing match, with a dash of extreme fighting and
tag-team wrestling thrown in and a lot more characters in the ring. And some
of the characters are way weirder than any that show up on WWE Friday Night
SmackDown. But in this match-up, the fix is in, and the favorite is none other
than Jesus. Based on the claims of Scripture, the outcome of the match has
never been in doubt. Babylon and the beasties are going down for the count.
This chapter explores the final outpouring of God’s wrath on rebellious
humanity, spurred on by the unholy trinity: the dragon, the beast, and the
false prophet (see Chapter 11). The imagery and metaphors draw heavily
from the Old Testament story of the plagues on Egypt and judgment oracles
found in the Hebrew prophets. The driving metaphor is that of bowls filled
with God’s wrath. Like a highly toxic liquid, these bowl judgments affect the
entire planet. The upshot is a planet rendered almost uninhabitable.
In this section of Revelation, John also tantalizes the reader with more clues
to the identity of both the beast and Babylon. Then, in the longest chapter in
the book of Revelation, he composes a dirge (song of mourning) over the col-
lapse of Babylon the great. Ironically, the saints are encouraged to join in and
rejoice over Babylon’s demise. Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats — the
bell is about to sound on the final round.

228
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
A Preamble to God’s Final 
Wrath (15:1–8)
Revelation 15:1–8 prepares readers for the final onslaught of God’s wrath. The
action unfolds in the form of a heavenly liturgy, or worship service. John first
glimpses the faithful martyrs worshiping God around a sea of glass (15:2–4).
Seven angels then solemnly emerge from the heavenly Temple, probably also
the throne room, the very presence of God (15:5–6). One of the four living
creatures invests the seven angels with seven golden bowls containing the
wrath of God (15:7). They prepare to pour out the contents, just like priests in
the Jerusalem Temple regularly poured out drink offerings on the great bronze
altar standing in front of the Temple (1 Kings 7:50; 2 Kings 12:13). In the book
of Revelation, however, the bowls are poured out on the earth, not an altar.
The significance seems to be that these bowls function as a purification ritual.
Fittingly, the scene concludes with the heavenly Temple filled with God’s
glory. None may enter its precincts until the purification is complete. The the-
ological point, conveyed by means of priestly and liturgy imagery, seems to be
this: God’s ultimate intention is to render his creation holy — that is, com-
pletely set apart for his worship and service.
Preparing for the end
As Revelation 15 opens, John views proceedings from heaven. The first time
John’s perspective shifts to heaven occurs in Revelation 4, when he is raptured
(caught up) to the heavenly throne room. This remains his vantage point until
Revelation 10–11, in which John is apparently back on earth. But Revelation 12
once again describes the action from a heavenly perspective, followed immedi-
ately by Revelation 13, in which John is back on the ground to witness the rise
of the beast and false prophet. Revelation 14 presents another visit to heaven,
where he remains in Revelation 15.
Alternation between heavenly and earthly perspectives is characteristic of
apocalyptic writings. Note that the book of Exodus, chapters 19–40, reveals
Moses making several ascents and descents of Mount Sinai in the course of
the narrative. Perhaps this fundamental event, the Sinai theophany (appear-
ance of God), establishing the children of Israel as the Lord’s chosen people,
served as a model for later visionary experiences during the Second Temple
period (517 BCE–135 CE). In other words, the various recipients of visionary
experiences (Enoch, Ezra, Baruch, and so on), like Moses, alternate between
being in God’s presence and being on earth among their fellow human beings.

For only the second time in Revelation, John describes a portent, or omen
(the first mention of a portent is Revelation 12, with the woman and the red
dragon; see Chapter 11). Now, John sees seven angels who administer the seven
final plagues. This is an omen of imminent destruction. That’s the bad news.
If we can even speak of the good news, it’s this: “With them the wrath of God
is ended” (Rev. 15:1), meaning after the bowls are empty, the punishment ends.
Fulfilling two covenants
John sees what appears to be a sea of glass mixed with fire (Rev. 15:2). He
also mentions the sea of glass in Revelation 4:6, indicating that it’s situated
directly in front of the throne of God.
By the Roman era, glass-making techniques were such that translucent glass
vessels were readily available. John seems to describe glass having a highly
polished glaze. John’s reference to “glass mixed with fire” may describe the
reflection and refraction of light coming from the throne of God.
229
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)
Understanding the two covenants
A covenant is a mutual arrangement and agree-
ment defining a relationship between two par-
ties. In the Bible, God enters into a special
relationship with certain individuals, such as
Abraham (Genesis 15:18) and David (2 Samuel
7), and with a particular people, namely, Israel.
A covenant specifies certain obligations
imposed upon the covenant partners.
The covenant between the Lord and Israel, made
at Mount Sinai, was mediated by Moses (Exodus
24). It called for Israel’s faithful observance of the
moral and ritual commandments recorded in
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
For his part, the Lord promised to be their God
and to bless and preserve them as a nation.
Israel repeatedly broke this covenant and placed
its continuance in jeopardy (Hosea 1–2).
Nonetheless, the prophets foresaw a new
covenant being enacted between the Lord and
Israel. The new covenant would be superior to
the old one because the Lord would write it on
Israel’s heart so that Israel would faithfully carry
out its obligations (Jeremiah 31:31–34; Ezekiel
34:25, 34:30–31, 36:25–27).
According to the New Testament, Jesus estab-
lishes this new covenant by his death, which
atones for sin (Luke 22:14–20; 1 Corinthians
11:23–26). By the Holy Spirit, there’s now a faith-
ful obedience on the part of the new people of
God, the new Israel (Galatians 6:16), composed
of both believing Jews and Gentiles (Romans
3:21–26, 8:1–4). 

Surrounding this surreal sea are the saints who remain steadfast in their
commitment to the Lamb. They sing a song named after two key players in
redemptive history: Moses and the Lamb. Moses represents the old covenant
made at Mount Sinai with Israel (now embodied in the Old Testament), and
the Lamb represents the new covenant made at Mount Calvary between
Jesus and all who believe in him as Savior and Lord (now embodied in the
New Testament).
Both the old and new covenants share a common view of atonement: removal
of the stain and guilt of sin requires shedding blood (see Hebrews 9:22). The
blood of an innocent and blameless victim serves as the cleansing agent in
both covenants.
Especially relevant for the study of Revelation is the borrowing of the
Passover imagery from the old covenant:
 The old covenant festival of Passover features a Lamb whose blood is
smeared on the lintel (top of the doorframe) and doorposts of Hebrew
homes so that the destroying angel benignly passes over, sparing the
lives of the inhabitants (Exodus 12:7). The ritual also reminds Israel of
the Lord’s promise to lead them into the Promised Land (Exodus 13:3–10).
In the book of Revelation, believers in Jesus are spared the bowl judgments
containing the wrath of God (7:1–17, 14:9–10, 15:2).
 The new covenant features the ultimate fulfillment of this Old Testament
ritual in Jesus, who is “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the
world!” (John 1:29). It’s more than coincidence that the primary image for
Jesus in the book of Revelation is that of “a Lamb standing as if it had been
slaughtered” (Rev 5:6). At a critical point in the action, the Lamb stands on
Mount Zion with the redeemed (Revelation 14:1). Like the Lamb, the
redeemed are now described as “blameless” (14:5). In the Apostle Paul’s
words, Jesus “rescues us from the wrath that is coming” (1
Thessalonians 1:10). This promise sustains believers through the
ordeals described in Revelation (Revelation 14:12–13). The Promised
Land of the old covenant becomes the New Jerusalem of the new one
(Revelation 21–22).
The short anthem that the victors sing in Revelation 15:3–4 echoes the words
of the Song of Moses in Exodus 15:1–18 and Deuteronomy 32, capturing this
essential message: The holy God deserves all worship and glory. The anthem
is in fact a mosaic of Old Testament texts skillfully pieced together. Not to be
missed in this song is the clear implication that Jesus is the true king of the
earth and the Lord God Almighty himself.
230
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Clearing out of the Temple
A sobering scene ensues in Revelation 15:5. The portals of the heavenly
sanctuary, here called “the temple of the tent of witness,” open ominously.
Proceeding from the sanctuary of the Temple are seven angels. These may be the
seven archangels, seraphim (see Isaiah 6:2–3, 6:6), or cherubim (Ezekiel 10:3–4).
They’re robed like officiating priests — white linen and golden sashes. The
priestly garb draws attention to an important aspect of the heavenly throne
room: the nearly constant worship rendered by the angels in the presence of
God. The book of Hebrews, also manifesting apocalyptic features, describes
angels as “spirits in the divine service” (Hebrews 1:14).
231
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)
Giving God some alone time
Two times in the history of Israel, the glory of the
Lord prevents human beings from ministering in
the sanctuary. After Moses finishes building
and dedicating the Tabernacle (narrated in
Exodus 36–40), the text says, “Moses was not
able to enter the tent of meeting because the
cloud settled upon it, and the glory of the Lord
filled the Tabernacle” (Exodus 40:35). Likewise,
after Solomon builds and dedicates the first
Temple, the text says, “And when the priests
came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the
house of the Lord, so that the priests could not
stand to minister because of the cloud; for the
glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord” (1
Kings 8:10–11).
Furthermore, two prophets of Israel, Isaiah and
Ezekiel, experience visions in which they see the
heavenly sanctuary filled with smoke, symboliz-
ing God’s presence (Isaiah 6:4; Ezekiel 10:3–4).
God’s presence is simply overwhelming.
©CORBIS

One of the four living creatures, those angelic beings who stand closest to the
throne of God (see Rev. 4:6), hands each angel a golden bowl full of the wrath
of God. Immediately, God’s glory, the Shekinah — a Hebrew word meaning
Divine Presence — fills the Temple like thick smoke, and it’s declared off-limits
until the contents of the bowls are poured out and God’s wrath is spent. God’s
reaction to human sin and rebellion is no light matter.
Although the notion of God’s wrath is not popular these days, Scripture insists
that God’s holiness and glory can’t be upheld without reinstating his legitimate
right — even necessity — to punish those who ultimately refuse and reject him
as Lord. The point of this passage in Revelation 15 is to insist that God’s judgment
reveals his glory as surely as does his mercy (see Romans 2:4–11, 3:3–8).
Pouring Out the Seven Bowls (16:1–21)
In Revelation 16:1, a loud voice from the heavenly temple orders the pouring
out of the bowls, the final series of divine judgments. Though the voice is not
identified, ultimate authorization comes from God and the Lamb. In the verses
that follow, seven angels pour out the contents of their bowls—the wrath of God.
In contrast to the seals and trumpets of Revelation 6–8 (see Chapters 9 and
10), the sequence of seven bowls has no distinct subdivisions, nor do any
interludes separate the judgments. They’re poured out without interruption.
The only deviation from this flow of events occurs between the third and
fourth bowl, during which an angel adds a brief commentary on the judg-
ment, justifying God’s action (Rev. 16:5–7).
Interpreting the bowls: Four views
Interpreters understand the bowl judgments in rather different ways. You
may distinguish among four main views, corresponding to the four major
approaches to the book as a whole. Following is a brief overview (for a more
detailed discussion of these approaches, see Chapter 4):
 Preterist: Preterists (those who interpret the book of Revelation solely
from the perspective of the first century) try to connect these bowls with
various historical events or features known to John’s first readers. For
example, the sixth bowl, the drying up of the Euphrates to prepare for the
kings from the east, is often linked to the Parthian threat (this kingdom lay
just to the east of the Euphrates and was hostile toward the Roman
Empire). A legend that Nero would return to life and lead a Parthian invasion
of Rome circulated widely during the latter part of the first century.
Preterists don’t agree, however, on the interpretation of the other bowls.
232
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 Historicist: Historicists (those who interpret the book of Revelation as if
it depicts Christian history from the first century to the Second Coming
of Jesus) diverge even more than preterists on the particulars. The reason
is fairly obvious: There’s much more to consider and therefore so many
more possibilities!
Typically, historicists find most of their “connections” in the Middle Ages
and Reformation. The bowl judgments were often related to the religious
wars that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Protestant historicist commentators, from the Reformation period through
the nineteenth century, often identified the great whore, mystery Babylon,
as the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy — a view rightly rejected by
the overwhelming majority of Protestants today. A major criticism of
historicism is its nearly complete omission of church history outside
Europe. Western bias is apparent.
 Idealist: Idealists aren’t committed to discovering what possible historical
connections lie behind the bowls, because they view the book of Revelation
as an essentially symbolic book depicting the ongoing struggle between
good and evil. The various symbols are simply stock figures drawn from
Jewish apocalyptic literature. On this understanding, the message of the
book is applicable to any time and place and not rooted in the historical
circumstances of the first or any other century. 
The problem here is the reductive nature of the approach. On a face
value reading, the book proclaims more than timeless principles; it
announces the victory of the Lamb in real history.
 Futurist: Futurists hold that Revelation 4 (John’s being taken up to
heaven) signals a transition from John’s day in the first century to the
events of the Day of the Lord — that is, the Great Tribulation — the end
of the age. On this understanding, the bowl judgments occur just prior
to the Second Coming of Jesus. Futurists are fairly uniform in interpretation
of the specific details, but once again, hardly any agree completely with
their fellow futurists.
The majority of modern interpreters recognize some element of truth in each
approach. Perhaps the decisive question is whether the book of Revelation
describes historical events or depicts principles and ideals. We think it’s a
both-and, not an either-or scenario. Without denying that timeless principles
are present, we think a moderate futurism makes best sense of the text. That
is, the book begins at the end of the first century in chapters 1–3 and con-
cludes with the return of Jesus in chapters 19–20 and the inauguration of the
new heavens and earth in chapters 21–22. But from chapter 4 onward, the
focus is on the last brief period of time leading up to Jesus’s return, the so-
called Great Tribulation. The book of Revelation itself suggests that this
period lasts seven years.
233
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)

In our understanding of the relationship among the three series of sevens,
the trumpets and bowls fall within the general time frame of the sixth seal,
unleashing the Great Tribulation, which corresponds to the Old Testament
Day of the Lord (see Chapter 9). This constitutes the final period of earth his-
tory, in which the Lamb decisively intervenes and judges human rebellion
and wickedness. The number seven applied to the seals, trumpets, and bowls
fittingly sums up the notion of completion and finality.
Checking out the bowls’ contents
The plagues that come from the bowls, like the trumpets, are reminiscent of
the plagues on Egypt. The most notable difference is the scale and intensity
of these bowl judgments; they’re simply off the Richter scale of seismic judg-
ments and are truly global in their impact. In rapid succession, the contents
of the seven bowls rain down on the evil empire and obliterate all resistance.
Bowl 1: Foul and painful sores erupt
The first angel pours his bowl of sores on the earth. This plague, reminiscent
of the sixth plague of boils in Egypt (Exodus 9:10–11), affects only those who
bear the mark of the beast (Rev. 13:16–17; see Chapter 11).
Bowls 2 and 3: The sea and fresh water turn to blood 
The second angel pours his bowl into the sea. This time, the entire sea turns
to blood, and all life in it perishes. The third angel pours his bowl into the
fresh waters, and they, too, turn to blood. Notice that bowls two and three
correspond to the first plague on Egypt, which turned the Nile River to blood
(Exodus 7:19–21).
At this point comes a momentary interruption in the sequence of judgments.
The angel of the waters justifies God’s actions in Revelation 16:5–7:
“‘You are just, O Holy One, who are and were, for you have judged these
things; because they shed the blood of saints and prophets, you have given
them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!’ And I heard the altar respond,
‘Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, your judgments are true and just!’”
The principle invoked is deeply rooted in the Old Testament notion of justice:
The punishment should fit the crime. This is known as lex talionis, the law of
retaliation — the well-known eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth principle
(Exodus 21:23–25).
Bowl 4: The sun scorches the earth
The fourth angel pours his bowl on the sun, causing it to increase in heat,
which scorches the earth. Talk about global warming! Like a solar blowtorch,
the sun bears down on earth’s inhabitants with deadly intensity.
234
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The highest recorded temperature on earth to date is 136 degrees Fahrenheit
on September 13, 1922, at El Azizia, Libya. The highest in the United States is 134
degrees Fahrenheit on July 10, 1922, at Death Valley, California. No doubt this
plague far exceeds those temperatures.
How do the inhabitants of earth react to this “act of God,” as so-called natural
phenomena are sometimes referred to by insurance companies? They curse
God and refuse to repent.
What about believers in Jesus? Aren’t they affected as well? Remember that
the trumpet and bowl judgments recall the Egyptian plagues, and the Hebrews
weren’t affected by all the plagues (Exodus 8:22, 9:6, 9:26, 10:23, 11:7).
Presumably, that’s also the case with the bowl judgments of Revelation. 
God seals and protects his people against his wrath.
Bowl 5: Darkness falls
The fifth angel pours his bowl on the throne of the beast. The very epicenter
of the beast’s empire is stricken with total darkness. This is no rolling blackout.
In fact, the darkness is so complete it’s palpable.
235
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)
Paying up for sin
In first-century Roman culture, people com-
monly used libation (pouring) vessels in reli-
gious rituals honoring the gods. Drink offerings
were poured out to the gods on an altar. But
Revelation’s source for the bowl imagery prob-
ably stems from Old Testament rituals con-
nected with Tabernacle and Temple. In
particular, golden bowls were used to catch the
blood of sacrificial animals, which was then lit-
erally thrown against the base of the altar,
where fire totally consumed it (Exodus 24:6;
Leviticus 1:5, 3:2, 7:2).
There’s a profound theological connection
between expiation (making amends or repara-
tion for wrongdoing and guilt) and retribution
(punishment for wrongdoing). God’s holiness,
like a refining fire, totally consumes the blood
offered as an atonement on the altar. In the ful-
fillment of this Old Testament ritual, Jesus offers
his blood as the atoning sacrifice. The book of
Revelation makes this point repeatedly (1:5, 5:6,
12:11, 19:13), and it runs like a scarlet thread
throughout the entire New Testament (see
Romans 6:10; Hebrews 7:27).
However, if sinful human beings refuse God’s
offer of atonement through blood shed on their
behalf, the Bible says they face “a fearful
prospect of judgment” (Hebrews 10:26) because
“God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:29).
Clearly, according to the Bible, that same divine
holiness consumes the unrepentant sinner (Rev.
20:14–15, 21:8). The bowls in Revelation serve a
different purpose: They’re vessels not of expiation
but of punishment.

This blackness only exacerbates the previous plagues and ratchets up the
misery index to nearly unbearable levels. Although some commentators
prefer to interpret the darkness symbolically, many see no need to depart
from a more-or-less literal reading because the previous four bowls appear to
be physical realities. Once again, the plague has no effect — the inhabitants
curse God and refuse to repent.
Bowl 6: Kings arm for Armageddon
The sixth bowl, in Revelation 16:12, has striking similarities to the sixth trum-
pet (Rev. 9:14). In both cases, the Euphrates River figures prominently in the
action, and demonic activity stirs up a final and decisive showdown between
the dragon and the Lamb. The sixth bowl dries up the Euphrates, apparently
allowing the army of an eastern coalition to cross easily.
The sixth bowl, however, doesn’t relate to a return to the Holy Land (Promised
Land) by the Jewish people; it involves an invading force sweeping in from the
east and finding a potential barrier suddenly removed. Presumably, these
forces have a hostile intent toward the Land of Israel.
236
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Turning seas and rivers into dry land
The Euphrates River allows easy access to the
Holy Land for an invasion force coming from the
east. Similar to what’s depicted in Revelation
16:12, twice in the Old Testament does a formi-
dable body of water dry up to allow passage:
 During the Exodus from Egypt, the Red Sea
parts and the Israelites escape certain ret-
ribution and recapture by Pharaoh and his
crack chariot corps (Exodus 14).
 In the days of Joshua, the Israelites have to
cross the Jordan River in order to attack
Jericho, the eastern gateway to Canaan,
the Promised Land. The Jordan, however, is
in flood stage, and the Israelites lack any
means of negotiating the flood plain. The
God of Israel stops the flow upriver, allow-
ing the army of Israel to cross and initiate
their invasion (Joshua 3–4).
A vision of the prophet Isaiah recorded in Isaiah
11 describes what the Lord God of Israel is
going to do “on that day,” a synonym for the Day
of the Lord or Great Tribulation. Among those
items detailed is a two-fold drying up of bodies
of water playing prominent roles in redemptive
history:
 The Red Sea: In short, Isaiah envisions a
new exodus. As in days of old, so in the
future, says the prophet — God enables his
people to escape bondage and make their
way through the desert to the Promised
Land. You can find this motif of a new
exodus in a number of New Testament texts
(such as Colossians 1:13).
 The Euphrates River: Remarkably, Isaiah
also says that the Lord “will wave his hand
over the River [that is, the Euphrates] with
his scorching wind; and will split it into
seven channels, and make a way to cross
on foot; so there shall be a highway from
Assyria for the remnant that is left of his
people, as there was for Israel when they
came up from the land of Egypt” (Isaiah
11:15–16).

Some interpreters think that this military incursion prompts the beast (see
Chapter 11) to intervene and stave off the attack. The beast then proceeds to
invade the Holy Land himself and proclaim himself God in the Jerusalem
Temple. This perspective is based upon a futuristic (and debatable) interpre-
tation of Daniel 11:40–45 and Ezekiel 38–39, along with Paul’s comments
about “the lawless one” in 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12.
237
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)
Battleground: You say Megiddo, I say Armageddon 
The term Harmagedon (NRSV) or Armageddon
(most English versions) refers to the ancient site
of Megiddo, a strategic city guarding the main
north-south route from Egypt to Syria. This road,
later called the Via Maris (“Way of the Sea”),
passes through a low ridge of hills into the fer-
tile Jezreel Valley. Hebrew kings from Solomon
onward fortified the site because it serves as a
choke point controlling traffic and commerce
along this important artery. Whoever controls
Megiddo controls much of Canaan, the
Promised Land.
As early as the sixteenth century, Pharaoh
Thutmose III fought a battle against a Canaanite
coalition at this site. Megiddo figures in the
famous battle between the Canaanites and
Israel in the days of Deborah the prophetess
and judge (Judges 4–5). The Assyrians and later
the Babylonians assaulted and conquered
Megiddo in their brutal conquests of the king-
doms of Israel and Judah. Even Napoleon
Bonaparte won a convincing victory at
Megiddo, and General Allenby, during World
War I, defeated the Ottoman Turks there as well.

The sixth bowl describes the last battle, the location of which has become a
household word: Armageddon. The unholy trinity — the dragon, beast, and
false prophet — send forth demonic emissaries to mobilize the forces of the
earth against the Lamb. The demonic spirits look like frogs and are reminis-
cent of the second Egyptian plague of frogs (Exodus 8:1–6). The demons are
successful in their war propaganda. A massive army assembles at a site laden
with memories of former battles: Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley of Israel (see
the sidebar “Battleground: You say Megiddo; I say Armageddon.”).
Many scholars prefer to view the reference here in Revelation symbolically,
seeing Megiddo as an assembly point for the coalition forces allied with the
beast but not the site for the final battle. This may be, but you can also make
a good case for a literal reading that the warfare takes place at this location.
The Old Testament prophets Joel and Zechariah located the main action of
the Day of the Lord in the Holy Land, particularly in Jerusalem (Joel 3:1–21;
Zechariah 12–14). A massive invasion of Israel would almost certainly involve
Megiddo because of its strategic importance.
Bowl 7: An earthquake and hailstones shake things up
When the seventh angel pours his bowl into the air, John doesn’t delay in
describing what happens next (in contrast to the seals and trumpets in
Revelation 6–8; see Chapters 9 and 10): An unprecedented earthquake con-
vulses the planet, and a massive hailstorm pounds great Babylon and the
entire planet with 100-pound hailstones! The devastation is complete; the evil
empire collapses like a house of cards. Babylon splits into three parts, and all
the cities of the world fall in ruins.
You may wonder how anyone could survive such an onslaught, but appar-
ently many do. Still, though, rather than call upon God for mercy and forgive-
ness, they curse him. John reverts to form and gives readers another
interlude in Revelation 17–18. In so doing, he provides an up-close-and-
personal perspective on the mysterious Babylon, the great whore.
But First, a Word from Our End-Times
Sponsor, the Lamb (16:15)
Tucked into the vision of the sixth bowl is a brief word of exhortation in
Revelation 16:15: “See, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays
awake and is clothed, not going about naked and exposed to shame.” In the
style of the messages to the seven churches (see Chapter 7), John inserts a
word of prophecy from the Lamb himself. Though the Lamb isn’t directly
mentioned in Revelation 16, you can be sure he’s on the scene. The Lamb leads
the charge against the evil empire and orchestrates its total destruction.
238
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

But this little word of prophecy isn’t about the beast and his allies; it’s intended
only for believers. The message is essentially this: Don’t despair at what appears
to be the success of the dragon, beast, and false prophet. Don’t desert from the
ranks of the Lamb and go over to the dark side. Remain steadfast and faithful to
Jesus.
The imagery of the prophetic exhortation is similar to Jesus’s teaching during
his earthly ministry (for example, Matthew 24:42–44). The unexpected, open-
ended timing of the return of Jesus requires constant vigilance.
The notion of nakedness refers to a state of being spiritually unprepared. On
the occasion of the first sin in the Garden of Eden in Genesis 3, after disobey-
ing God’s explicit command, Adam and Eve suddenly sense that they’re
naked. That is, they’re aware of guilt and recognize they’re liable to punish-
ment. In psychological terms, they feel exposed and open to scrutiny. So, too,
says the Bible, followers of the Lamb who defect under pressure may be
exposed in the end. The followers of the Lamb are thus both warned and
exhorted to stay the course.
This prophetic exhortation reminds readers of the underlying purpose of the
entire book: to build a firm, steadfast commitment to what Christians saw as
the true message of Jesus over against all counterfeits, whether they be the
imperial (Roman) cult of the first century or its End-Times counterpart
during the reign of the Antichrist.
Exposing the Mystery of Babylon 
the Great (17:1–18)
Revelation 17–22 is essentially a tale of two cities. No, we didn’t borrow this
from Dickens; he actually borrowed it from the Bible! The two cities, of
course, are Babylon (Rome) and the new Jerusalem — not London and Paris
as Dickens wrote about. The descriptions of these two biblical cities couldn’t
be more opposite. John devotes two chapters to Babylon and two chapters
to new Jerusalem. Babylon passes away; the new Jerusalem lasts forever.
Another way of looking at this section portrays the two cities under the guise
of two women: the great whore and the bride of the Lamb. Again, the contrast
is both stunning and stark.
Calling her names: Harlot on seven hills
In Revelation 17, John hits the rewind button. The seventh bowl in Revelation
16 ends with the utter collapse of Babylon. Now, he backs up and reviews the
career of this wicked city, portraying it as a notorious prostitute. One of the
239
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)

seven angels in charge of the seven bowls becomes John’s guide. John is trans-
ported from the heavenly sanctuary back down to earth to “a wilderness.”
Almost certainly John borrows the imagery of Isaiah 21:1–17, a judgment
oracle upon Babylon of the sixth century BCE. The setting of Isaiah’s
prophecy is southern Iraq and Kuwait, a desolate desert region brought
vividly to television screens in recent history. John reapplies this prophecy
to Imperial Rome as it existed in John’s time, the template for the ultimate
God-defying empire of the Antichrist.
A whore who’s a city who is another city: Seeing behind the imagery
John takes the reader behind the scenes and exposes political intrigues and
treachery that eventually bring down Babylon the Great. You gain an insider’s
view of the relationship between the beast and Babylon — what you may call
a twisted version of Beauty and the Beast! In the end, the beast betrays “beau-
tiful” Babylon and brings about her destruction.
John’s description of Babylon (a city) contains clues pointing to her identity
as the city of Rome (another city):
 “Seated on many waters”: The city of Rome and the empire of which it
was the center controlled the waterways of the Mediterranean. In fact,
by the end of the first century, the Mediterranean Sea was virtually a
Roman lake. The imperial navy had numerous ports of call such as
Syracuse (in Sicily), Corinth and Thessalonica (in Greece and
Macedonia), Troas and Ephesus (in modern Turkey or Asia Minor),
Seleucia (in modern Syria), Alexandria (in modern Egypt), and Cyrene
(in modern Libya), to name but a few. Rome plied the sea lanes to her
commercial advantage, siphoning natural resources away from far flung
provinces and importing luxury items for the upper classes. Rome was
the leading commercial emporium of the known world.
John calls Babylon “the mother of whores” (17:5). John describes her
commercial activity as “fornication” because of its unjust and immoral
nature. Literal prostitution was also a major industry in the empire.
 “Sitting on a scarlet beast”: The fact that the empire sits on the beast
points to the person who really wields the power. The emperor and the
imperial cult (emperor worship) drive this vast political and mercantile
enterprise. Many commentators hold that John’s description transcends
any particular Roman emperor — though Nero Caesar certainly provides
a chilling template — and embodies that ultimate dictator and tyrant,
the Antichrist.
 “Drunk with the blood”: The Roman Empire reveled in luxury and sen-
suality (17:4–5), all the while exhibiting extreme cruelty. Utter indiffer-
ence to human need and dignity characterizes the moral climate. John
draws special attention to the role of Rome in persecuting believers in
Jesus. The image is appalling: “The woman was drunk with the blood of
the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus” (17:6).
240
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

In the book of Revelation, Babylon functions symbolically as the ultimate
center of power for the Antichrist. Freely borrowing language and imagery from
Old Testament prophetic texts speaking of historic Babylon, John reapplies
these to its first-century counterpart, the great city of Rome. Babylon and
Rome are mirror images of each other — both dens of injustice and wonders to
behold. They embody, in the words of a Clint Eastwood movie, “the good, the
bad, and the ugly.” In that respect, the original Babylon and Rome anticipate
the appearance of that final Babylon: organized, rebellious humanity, oblivious
to or pitted against the kingdom of the God and the Lamb.
Unlocking the interpretation
John doesn’t leave you to your own imagination for interpreting the passage
about the whore of Babylon. Actually, an angelic informant reveals the key,
and John records it in Revelation 17:7–18. 
Seven heads
The scarlet beast’s seven heads serve a twofold function: They’re both seven
hills and seven kings:
 Hills: This piece of information almost certainly identifies the city as
Rome, long famous for its seven hills. The seven hills are Palatine,
Capitol, Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Viminal, and Quirinal. References to
these famous seven hills abound in the writings of historians and liter-
ary figures of the ancient world.
 Kings: The seven heads represent seven kings. Interestingly, five of them
have already died at the time of John’s writing, one is currently in office,
and the sixth is coming but has a very short tenure.
241
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)
Rome by any other name
Most New Testament scholars think Babylon is
a code word for Rome. Just as Babylon, under
Nebuchadnezzar II, destroyed Jerusalem and
the first Temple and gloated over it, so Rome
would play a similar role in the complete destruc-
tion of Jerusalem and the second Temple.
In Jewish literature of the late first century,
Rome is labeled as Babylon (2 Esdras, 2 Baruch,
and Sibylline Oracles), recalling its ancient role
as nemesis and persecutor.
Even Peter concludes his first epistle (letter),
written to primarily Gentile Christians in Asia
Minor, by saying, “Your sister church in Babylon,
chosen together with you, sends you greetings;
and so does my son Mark” (1 Peter 5:13). Is Peter
living at the ancient site of great Babylon?
Probably not. So why doesn’t Peter just come
right out with it and mention Rome by name?
Well, the first epistle probably dates to just after
the bloodbath that Nero initiated in 64 CE.
Thousands of Christians perished. Peter is sen-
sitive to the fact that another wave of persecu-
tion is possible. He doesn’t want his letter to fall
into the hands of government informers and be
misconstrued as anti-government propaganda.

An eighth king, says John, belongs to the seven and is none other than the
beast from the bottomless pit — the one who was, is not, and is yet to come.
In short, the eighth king is the Antichrist, who appears to die and returns to
life. This correlates closely with the description of the beast in Revelation 13.
Some commentators argue that John is referring to the Roman emperors in
this passage — and claim that the eighth king was Domitian. After all, if you
begin with Augustus Caesar, generally reckoned as the first emperor, the
chronological sequence is as follows:
1. Augustus (27 BCE–14 CE)
2. Tiberius (14–37 CE)
3. Gaius [Caligula] (37–41 CE)
4. Claudius (41–54 CE)
5. Nero (54–68 CE)
6. Vespasian (69–79 CE)
7. Titus (79–81 CE)
8. Domitian (81–96 CE)
After Nero committed suicide in July of 68 CE, three men unsuccessfully laid
claim to the title: Galba, Otho, and Vitellius. All three were assassinated after
very short tenures. Vespasian, who had been in the Holy Land subduing the
Jews during the first Jewish revolt (66–73 CE), was acclaimed emperor by his
legions in Palestine. He quickly returned to Rome and secured his hold on the
empire. This turbulent period was called “the year of the four emperors.”
Many scholars leave the three wannabes out of the reckoning because their
stints were too short to qualify them as emperors.
The problems fitting this historical sequence of emperors into John’s scheme
are considerable:
 The only one on the list who fits nicely with John’s scheme is number seven,
Titus: “When he comes, he must remain only a little while.” (Rev. 17:10).
 Julius Caesar was actually the first to be called imperator (emperor). If
you begin with him, this throws off the entire scheme in that Domitian
now becomes the ninth.
 Three claimants to the throne — Galba, Otho, and Vitellius — were actually
considered legitimate emperors by the Jewish historian Josephus, as
well as by a first-century work called the Sibylline Oracles. Including
them makes Domitian the twelfth emperor.
242
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 John indicates that the king who is currently reigning is the sixth.
According to the numbered sequence, the sixth king is Vespasian. But
most scholars opt for the reign of Domitian as the time of writing, and
we concur. In order for the actual sequence to fit John’s scheme,
Domitian needs to be the sixth king.
But perhaps you shouldn’t even try to harmonize John’s scheme with the list
of Roman emperors. Given the symbolic nature of the number seven, this
may only suggest the complete power and dominance of these kings. The
beast is identified with these kings in that he, too, embodies virtually absolute
authority over his subjects. In that sense, he is one with them and thus the
eighth.
Despite problems and uncertainties, John’s essential point seems clear:
Imperial Rome, with its seriously flawed emperors, is mystery Babylon. But
as many commentators claim, John may be using imperial Rome as the lens
through which to portray that ultimate Babylon, the tool of the beast from
the bottomless pit, the Antichrist.
Ten horns
The beast’s ten horns refer to a separate coalition of kings who ally themselves
with the beast. In biblical thought, the horn of a bull, ram, or goat symbolizes
strength and power. In apocalyptic writings, an animal horn frequently repre-
sents powerful kings or generals (see, for example, Daniel 8). This alliance of
ten kings was not yet in existence in John’s day — that remains for a desig-
nated time called “one hour” (Rev. 17:12).
John draws this imagery from the book of Daniel, in which a fourth and final
earthly kingdom, described as “terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong,”
is also depicted as having ten horns (Daniel 7:7). Later in the same chapter,
Daniel discovers that the ten horns represent ten kings that arise in connec-
tion with an insolent person who speaks against God and persecutes believ-
ers (Daniel 7:24–25). This fits rather closely with the beast of Revelation, the
Antichrist. Ominously, John informs the reader that the ten kings join in the
war against the Lamb. However, they’re unable to carry out their objective,
and the Lamb carries the day. 
Waters
The waters represent a multinational, multiethnic empire. This empire is forged
by the beast as a tool for achieving his own ambitions and, of course, those of
the great dragon who energizes and eggs him on. This interpretive key points
to imperial Rome as the template for the final evil empire.
243
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)

The Roman Empire, at the end of the first century, was the largest and most
diverse empire the world had ever known. Lest there be any lingering doubt
or confusion in his readers’ mind, John makes it crystal clear who the woman
is: “The great city that rules over the kings of the earth” (Rev. 17:18). No
other city but Rome fills the bill. End-Times Babylon exercises the same clout
and sway as imperial Rome did in the first century.
Turning on her: The beast bites back
As the chapter ends, John mentions something that comes as a shock: “And
the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the whore; they will
make her desolate and naked; they will devour her flesh and burn her up with
fire. For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing
to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be fulfilled.”
In spite of using Babylon (Rome) to achieve his own ends, the beast and his
allies (ten kings) harbor deep hatred for the imperial capital. They actually
plot and carry out its complete destruction. The book of Revelation doesn’t
say precisely why, but remember that these kings are ambitious politicians
who loathe to share power and glory more than they have to. They likely
envy the wealth and influence of Babylon the Great and want it all for them-
selves. As witnessed so many times in human history, evil is self-destructive.
What is clearly stated, however, is that God decrees the total destruction of
mystery Babylon. This destruction is portrayed as a burning up (19:3), the
fate of most ancient cities sacked by invading armies. In this case, however,
the burning is depicted as everlasting in duration, a sure indicator of divine,
not human retribution.
Loveless in the Ruins: Celebrating
Babylon’s Fall (18:1–24)
Remember that old nursery rhyme that goes, “London bridge is falling down,
Falling down, Falling down. London bridge is falling down, My fair lady”? The
reference is actually quite grim. Historians trace it back to the medieval
period when London bridge was ruined multiple times by war, tornado, and
fire. The “fair lady” may refer to the practice of burying a dead virgin in the
foundation of a bridge to ensure its strength and longevity. Or she may be
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, the mother of two kings of England, Richard the
Lionhearted and John Lackland.

245
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)
Uncovering the real Babylon
The story of Babylon begins in the book of
Genesis, when the hero Nimrod founds a city
named Babel (Genesis 10:10). The name means
gate of god, perhaps already hinting at the city’s
self-claims to fame. At any rate, the city first
appears in the historical record when
Sharkalisharri (about 2250 BCE) mentions that
he moved dirt from Babel to Agade, thereby
transferring Babel’s authority and sanctity to the
new location.
During the second millennium BCE, the city of
Babylon achieved new heights of prosperity
under the guidance of Hammurabi (1792–1950
BCE), famous for his Code of Hammurabi, one the
earliest written law records. He greatly enlarged
the city and extended its commercial ties.
The first millennium BCE found Babylon at the
center of power struggles between the
Assyrians (north of modern-day Iraq) and the
more southerly tribes of Babylonia. Sargon II,
king of Assyria and conqueror of Samaria (2
Kings 17:6), the northern kingdom of Israel’s
capital city, swept into Babylon in 710 BCE.
Babylonia didn’t regain independence until
about 626 BCE.
The city came into its own under the leadership
of the Babylonian superstar Nebuchadnezzar II
(605–562 BCE). After claiming the throne in 605
BCE and defeating an Egyptian and Assyrian
coalition at Carchemish, Nebuchadnezzar
headed the most powerful military in the ancient
Near East. Judea finally fell after rebelling
against being a servant state of Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar is notorious as the destroyer
of Jerusalem and the first Temple in 586 BCE. He
used Judean craftsmen and builders to enlarge
and beautify Babylon. The massive Ishtar gates,
hanging gardens of Babylon, soaring temples
and ziggurats (towers), and waterways and
palaces made it the most impressive city the
world had yet seen. Hebrew prophets like Isaiah
(Isaiah 13) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 50–51),
however, prophesied her fall because of cruelty
to Judah.
And Babylon did fall — with no shots fired!
Cyrus the Persian entered the city after divert-
ing the Euphrates River that flowed right down
its middle. By night, his soldiers simply walked
up the now empty river bed right into the heart
of the city. The city itself welcomed Cyrus as a
liberator, and he assumed the title “King of
Babylon” (539 BCE). For Jews, Babylon became
a byword for all that’s cruel and evil. Later, when
Rome became master of the Mediterranean,
Jews used Babylon as a code word for Rome.
A famous Jewish oracle (Sibylline Oracles)
gleefully prophesies the demise of this “new
Babylon.” As you can see in the book of
Revelation, early Christians shared a similar
sentiment with regard to Rome.
Persian monarchs after Cyrus the Great, like
Xerxes, neglected Babylon. This lasted until
Alexander the Great swept across Asia Minor and
into the heartland of the Persian Empire. After he
defeated the Medes at Gaugamela, the city of
Babylon welcomed him as a liberator (331 BCE).
Alexander had great plans for the city, but he
didn’t live long enough to realize them. In the
power struggles between Alexander’s succes-
sors, Babylon fared poorly. Eventually, a new city,
Seleucia, became the seat of government, and
Babylon declined in importance. Though not
totally abandoned, the city never regained its
former glory. During New Testament times, a small
town rested in the vicinity of the ancient site.
Today, ancient Babylon is uninhabited; it is, how-
ever, an archaeological site of great importance.

Seen in this light, the nursery rhyme actually has two things in common with
Revelation 18: Both recount a catastrophic collapse, and both feature a femme
fatale. In Revelation 18, the spotlight falls on Queen Babylon, the great whore
(17:1–2). John allows her to speak on stage in a soliloquy, affording a window
into her thoughts: “I rule as a queen; I am no widow, and I will never see grief”
(Rev. 18:7). She revels in her power and considers herself invincible, a mistake
many powerful people make.
Nebuchadnezzar II was once swept away by his own self-importance and
achievements as he surveyed the great city of Babylon: “Is this not magnifi-
cent Babylon, which I have built as a royal capital by my mighty power and
for my glorious majesty?” For his vanity, God visits Nebuchadnezzar with a
serious mental illness. Later, when he recovers, he makes quite a different
confession: “I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored the one who
lives forever. For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, and his king-
dom endures from generation to generation” (Daniel 4:34). Before his fall
from power, Saddam Hussein expended great sums to restore and recon-
struct the ancient site of Babylon. He even had gigantic statues of himself
portrayed like Nebuchadnezzar! Like these two dictators, Queen Babylon
never gets the point and pays dearly for her arrogance.
Singing stinging sarcasm
A mighty angel announces the fall of Babylon the Great. This section is com-
posed as a dirge, a lament sung at funerals:
“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! It has become a dwelling-place of
demons, a haunt of every foul spirit, a haunt of every foul bird, a haunt of
every foul and hateful beast. For all the nations have drunk of the wine of
the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from
the power of her luxury.” (Rev. 18:2–3)
In popular imagination, undesirable creatures, whether animal or demonic,
haunted the abandoned ruins of ancient cities. Isaiah 13:21–22 gives expression
to these fears: “But wild animals will lie down there, and its houses will be full
of howling creatures; there ostriches will live, and there goat-demons will dance.
Hyenas will cry in its towers, and jackals in the pleasant palaces [. . .]” Such
places were avoided, and frightening tales told about the horrible things that
happened there reinforced the stigma. Ghosts and ghouls hover in the rubble
of formerly magnificent buildings. Such is the portrait of once-great Babylon
in Revelation 18:2.
246
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The reference to “the wine of the wrath of her fornication” is difficult to 
interpret. It seems to combine two ideas:
 Strong passion (the basic meaning of the Greek word thumos) aroused
by the seductive power of Queen Babylon. 
 God’s wrath (divine punishment), which comes as a consequence of
participating in the corrupt, immoral, and oppressive economic system
of the great whore
This is a lament with a twist, however. It’s actually a taunt song, a mocking
dirge. That is, it celebrates the demise of a tyrant or wicked regime under the
guise of a funeral lament. The wording of Revelation 18:2–3 draws on the lan-
guage of several Old Testament taunt songs (Isaiah 21:9; Jeremiah 50:39,
51:8). Significantly, one of the most famous Old Testament taunt songs 
celebrates the death of a Babylonian dictator (Isaiah 14:3–21).
Revelation 18:3 serves to justify the treatment of Babylon. Why does she
experience this fate? Using the language of the Old Testament prophets, John
fastens on the damning sin of this vast political, economic, and military enter-
prise. The key word is fornication.
To fornicate often means, to the Old Testament prophets, to break faith with
the God of Israel and follow other so-called gods. It amounts to disloyalty, the
fundamental sin of the Ten Commandments: “You shall have no other gods
before me” (Exodus 20:3). Babylon the Great proclaims another god: the god
of consumption, wealth, pleasure, and self-indulgence. Her motto is essen-
tially spend your way to happiness. In short, the great sin of Babylon is to
prefer creation to the Creator. In his letter to the Romans, the Apostle Paul
provides an apt commentary on this section: “They exchanged the truth
about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the
Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen” (Romans 1:25).
Fleeing the scene to safety
Revelation warns believers to escape from Babylon and to have nothing to do
with her (18:4). The passage functions as a summons to believers. Drawing on
language similar to that used by Jeremiah in the sixth century BCE (Jeremiah
51:45), John applies it to Rome, the Babylon of his day. Many scholars believe
Rome serves as the template for End-Times Babylon, that final world empire
utterly opposed to God and the Lamb.
John warns believers not to become enmeshed in the attitudes and lifestyle
of Queen Babylon. To do so is to betray the values of the Lamb and his king-
dom. Christians during the first century constantly struggled with the difficul-
ties of making a clean break from the idol-worshipping Greco-Roman culture
in which they lived and worked. Several New Testament passages highlight
247
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)

the temptation to slide back into their previous lifestyle (see 2 Corinthians
6:14–18; Galatians 4:8–11; Ephesians 4:17–24, 5:6–14; 1 John 2:15–17).
Shedding no tears for the fallen
In Revelation 18:5–8, John justifies the harshness of the sentence on Queen
Babylon. Babylon deserves what she gets. In fact, her sins “are heaped high
as heaven” (a phrase drawn from Jeremiah 51:9). Because of her self-indulgence
and refusal to acknowledge God, she receives a sentence twice as harsh as
might be expected, “double for her deeds” (see Jeremiah 50:29; Isaiah 40:2). 
We think of Queen Marie Antoinette prior to the French Revolution. Quite
oblivious to human needs just outside the royal palace, she occupied herself
in trivial pleasures and luxurious living. Queen Babylon is likewise totally
absorbed in sensual enjoyment — a sure recipe for spiritual disaster.
Reeling from markets’ collapse: 
Goods gone bad
In Revelation 18:9–20, John describes what amounts to a first-century version
of SkyMall magazine — a catalog featuring the wares and finery of the very
best stores in Rome. This long list of goods, imported from the far flung cor-
ners of the empire, illustrates the insatiable appetite of the rich and powerful
upper crust of Roman society. But instead of a tale in which money buys hap-
piness, the passage reads like a wake.
Lamenting market loss
Kings, merchants, shipmasters, seafarers, and sailors, standing at a safe dis-
tance, lament the demise of this mercantile marvel. The political leaders are
the first to intone their regret and shock: “Alas, alas, the great city, Babylon
the mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come” (Rev. 18:10).
They’re stunned. No one saw this coming.
Next, the merchants of the earth express their distress and grief in weeping
and wailing. No more sales! No more profits! They can’t comprehend that
their livelihood has been suddenly snatched away: “All your dainties and
your splendor are lost to you, never to be found again!” (Rev. 18:14).
Americans who experienced the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Black Tuesday,
can probably best appreciate the feeling of these distraught merchants.
The merchant marines next offer their condolences. The scope of destruction
is beyond their comprehension. First-century Rome was like a magnet attract-
ing an unending flow of goods arriving on a vast network of waterways.
Needless to say, the volume of commerce created a huge transportation
248
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

industry. Following Middle Eastern funeral customs, the mariners throw dust
on their heads as a sign of extreme grief and sorrow (Rev. 18:19). They, too,
are completely caught off-guard by the suddenness of this disaster: “For in
one hour she has been laid waste” (Rev. 18:19).
Ill-gotten gains
The bottom line is that with the fall of Babylon, the movers and shakers lose
control of their economic and political empire. But before you feel too sorry
for them, look more closely at how that wealth was acquired and spent. Most
of the imports were forcibly taken from subject peoples; furthermore, the
items listed in Revelation 18:1–13 are, for the most part, luxury items. The
great majority of citizens and non-citizens of the empire could never afford
them, anyway. Here’s what the Roman socio-economic pyramid looked like:
 Slaves: Anywhere from one-third to one-half of the population of imperial
Rome were slaves. Not to be overlooked in this catalogue of goods are
the last two items: “slaves — and human lives.” Slave trafficking was a
common evil in the economic fabric of the empire (Rev. 18:13).
 Freedmen: These were individuals who were either born free or were
able to work themselves out of slavery. Most of these folks, who made
up a fairly large segment of Roman society, were craftsmen and day
laborers who did the grunt work for the empire.
 Nobility and upper-class families: These minorities controlled the
wealth and resources of the empire.
In reality, then, only a small proportion of society directly benefited from this
immense wealth. To be sure, the wealthy and powerful often acted as bene-
factors and provided public works and programs for the masses. But this was
little more than an appeasement, and it didn’t significantly lower the misery
index for the average citizen, freedman or slave.
According to John, this system is fundamentally immoral. It must be disman-
tled and replaced. The book of Revelation envisions a vastly superior world
to come. The other woman in the story, Queen Jerusalem, the beautiful bride
of the Lamb, offers a truly “Great Society.” 
Ding-dong! The witch is dead!
One segment of society doesn’t lament the demise of Queen Babylon. The
people of God, designated as “saints and apostles and prophets” (Rev. 18:20),
say goodbye and good riddance to this “mother of whores.” It’s a day of
rejoicing. The setting for this portion assumes a courtroom. Queen Babylon
is in the dock. She is arraigned for a wide array of crimes and offenses, not
the least of which is the murder of many saints (Rev. 17:6, 18:24). The verdict
249
Chapter 12: Seven Angels, Seven Bowls, and a Final Smackdown (15:1–18:24)

comes down from God, the supreme judge. Babylon is guilty as charged and
sentenced to extinction (Rev. 18:20).
The imagery describing Babylon’s end is striking. A mighty angel tosses a huge
millstone into the sea and gives voice to this dramatic symbolic action: “With
such violence Babylon the great city will be thrown down, and will be found no
more” (Rev. 18:21). (If this seems to conflict with the earlier image of destruction
by fire, remember that this is poetry, not prose — strict logic need not apply.)
The point is clear enough: Babylon sinks to the bottom of the sea, a fitting end
to a city and system conjured up from the depths of the abyss.
John probably borrows his imagery from Jeremiah’s prophecy against the
Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar’s day in the sixth century BCE.: “When you finish
reading this scroll, tie a stone to it, and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates,
and say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disasters that I
am bringing on her’” (Jeremiah 51:63–64).
The dirge that accompanies the symbolic action opens another window into
the life and times of first-century Rome. The reader glimpses musicians, arti-
sans, and merchants, along with bridegrooms and brides. The language
draws heavily from two Old Testament passages:
 Jeremiah 25:10: The first, ironically, is a prophecy directed against
Judah and Jerusalem, predicting that Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will
most certainly destroy the land. John, however, reverses the recipient of
destruction: Babylon, not Jerusalem, falls this time.
 Ezekiel 26:13: The Ezekiel passage is a judgment oracle uttered against
the city of Tyre (located in modern Lebanon just to the north of Israel).
Once again, Nebuchadnezzar is the agent of retribution against this
ancient city, notorious for its greed and corruption. John simply borrows
the imagery of destruction to make his point: No music, no creativity, no
business and commerce, no joys and pleasures of life animate great
Babylon; instead, she sits silent and solitary in the darkness at the
bottom of the sea. She’ll never seduce anyone again.

Chapter 13
Coming of the Kingdom
(19:1–20:15)
In This Chapter
 Rejoicing in God’s justice and dressing up for a wedding
 Observing a shocking supper
 Entering the Millennium
 Binding and loosing Satan
 Standing at the great white throne
T
he focal point of Revelation 19 is the long-awaited return of the King.
Revelation 19 also juxtaposes two suppers and sketches more details about
the battle of Armageddon and the Lamb’s stunning triumph before the end.
Next, Revelation 20 features a golden age, an idyllic time, in which the Lamb
and his followers reign on earth for a millennium, 1,000 years. However, the
exact meaning of the Millennium has generated considerable debate through
the centuries. In this chapter, we sort out the differences of belief.
Finally, we explore another mystery in Revelation 20. Satan, the ancient arch-
enemy and antagonist, is bound at the beginning of the Millennium. Inexplicably,
at its conclusion, he’s released from his prison. True to form, he sets about
doing what he’s always done: deceiving people and stirring up rebellion. He
enlists another army more powerful than even the beast and the ten kings
could muster in Revelation 19. They assault the very center of the Lamb’s
kingdom, the beloved city. The response to this attack is devastating and
decisive: Fire consumes Satan and his army.
When the smoke clears, a great white throne dominates the scene. It’s the
last judgment, popularly called Doomsday. In the end, there are only two
options: the new Jerusalem or the lake of fire. John indicates the basis for
judgment and the outcome.
In this chapter, we run through these events. And at the end, we take a closer
look at some theological takes on hell and the Millennium.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Returning as Promised (19:1–21)
In Revelation 19, five angelic anthems or acclamations herald the imminent
return of the Jesus, the King. Each one provides additional commentary on
the demise of Babylon the Great and the defeat of the beast and false prophet.
Four different titles for the Lamb appear in this section, each adding luster to
the character and status of Jesus.
This part of Revelation essentially describes what happens to the beast, the
false prophet, and their vast army of ten kings. A sharp sword issuing from
the mouth of him who is called “Faithful and True” and “the Word of God”
destroys the allied forces. As for the beast and false prophet, they’re captured
and consigned to the lake of fire. Believers, on the other hand, are invited to
the marriage supper of the Lamb and his bride.
Having a roaring good time
A massive heavenly choir leads off the celebration with a doxology (a giving
of praise or blessing to God). The anthem begins with a rousing “Hallelujah!”
This keynote captures the mood of the heavenly courts.
The choir voices the reason thanksgiving and praise are so appropriate. In
short, God acts in accord with his faithfulness and justice (Rev. 19:2). He
upholds his promises, and his character never changes. Because this is so,
the great whore receives her just “reward.” She, by contrast, reveals her true
character as unfaithfulness. Not only does she break faith with God, but she
also viciously persecutes his covenant partners, the people of God.
A second hallelujah rings out, declaring the duration of her punishment: 
“forever and ever” (Rev. 19:3). This raises some hard theological questions,
which we explore in the section titled “Struggling to understand hell,” later 
in this chapter.
Another word for booyah!
Hallelujah! Christians the world over, who other-
wise may not know Hebrew from Hindi, regularly
sing, chant, pray, shout, or whisper this Hebrew
word. Meaning literally praise the Lord, it res-
onates with deep spiritual and emotional over-
tones.
By the time you get to Revelation 19, you see
that the people of God are shouting Hallelujah!
all over the place in the wake of the Lamb’s total
victory over the unholy trinity (dragon, beast,
and false prophet) and their allies.

The 24 elders and the four living creatures bow deeply before God’s throne
and add their voices to the heavenly liturgy (public worship): “Amen. Hallelujah!”
(Rev. 19:4). The word amen comes from Hebrew, and it conveys the notion of that
which is firm, established, and true. The angelic beings closest to God’s throne
thus affirm and agree with God’s judgment.
Next, an unidentified voice “from the throne,” perhaps one of the four living
creatures, sings a solo part: “Praise our God, all you his servants, and all who
fear him, small and great” (Rev. 19:5).
The angelic choir responds, antiphonally (singing in alternating parts) and in
unison. The sound is overwhelming. Like waves crashing against a rocky
shoreline during a thunderstorm, the concluding anthem resounds through
the heavenly sanctuary. Two events are the subject of this song:
 The Lord reigns: All resistance crumbles. The ringleaders of the Dark
Lord’s kingdom are incarcerated. The fulfillment of the Lord’s Prayer is a
reality: “Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in
heaven”(Matthew 6:10).
 The saints prepare for a wedding: The imagery is striking but not
unique; it draws upon a rich tradition in which Old Testament Israel is
compared to a bride and God (Yahweh) is her husband (Isaiah 54:6–8;
Jeremiah 2:1–3; Ezekiel 16:8–14; and Hosea 2:14–23). John now applies it
to the Lamb (the groom) and the Church (the bride), as he also does in
his Gospel (John 3:29). The bride dresses in white as a symbol of purity.
Avoiding angel worship
In Revelation 19:9, John writes,
“And the angel said to me, ‘Write this: Blessed are those who are invited
to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’ And he said to me, ‘These are true
words of God.’ Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to
me, ‘You must not do that! I am a fellow-servant with you and your com-
rades who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony
of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.’”
The authenticity of the invitation is certified: “These are true words of God.”
No need to check with Sotheby’s auction house on the genuineness of this
invitation! This is the fourth of seven beatitudes or blessings John records in
his book. (See Rev. 1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7; 22:14.)
253
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

Once again, the prophet John interacts with his heavenly guide. This time, he
prostrates himself (bows low) with the intent of worshiping the angel.
Perhaps he thought it was the Lord himself. At any rate, John is sharply
rebuked: “You must not do that!” (Rev. 19:10). This episode may serve as a
warning to congregations in Asia (the seven churches; see Chapter 7) against
the veneration of angels.
Paul’s letters to the Colossians and Ephesians (both in the province of Asia)
and the anonymous letter to the Hebrews suggest that venerating angels and
alleged visionary ascents to the heavenly throne room to participate in
angelic worship were potential sources of error and false pride (Colossians
2:18; Ephesians 1:20–23; and Hebrews 1:4). The corrective is clear: “Worship
God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” (19:10). This affir-
mation links the Old and New Testaments. In short, Jesus is the central bibli-
cal figure of redemptive history, as is stated at the outset of the Book of
Revelation (Rev. 1:2; see also John 1:1–3, 1:14; 1 John 1:1–3).
Making a grand entrance
In Revelation 19:11, John writes, “I saw heaven opened, and there was a white
horse!” For only the second time in the book, the heavens open. In the first
instance, John himself ascended to the heavenly throne room and began
recording his visions of “what is to take place after this” (1:19). This time,
there won’t be an ascent but a dramatic descent: King Jesus comes down on
a white horse, followed by the armies of heaven. These two openings frame
the action in chapters 4–20.
254
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
You can’t crash this wedding
Jesus uses the metaphor of a wedding banquet
in his ministry. In Matthew’s Gospel, a parable
about a king who prepares a lavish wedding
banquet for his son only to be humiliated by the
invited guests’ refusal to come, highlights the
spiritual blindness of the religious leadership of
his day (Matthew 22:2–10).
Jesus takes the parable further by sketching a
scenario in which a person does show up at the
wedding banquet but without the appropriate
attire. The point is clear: One must be an invited
guest to attend — no wedding crashers allowed!
(Matthew 22:11–12). The point of Revelation 19:9
is similar: A state of spiritual blessedness and ful-
fillment awaits those who belong to the fellow-
ship of the Lamb, the true bride of Jesus.

Determining who’s on this white horse
The white horse in Revelation 19:11 is reminiscent of Revelation 6:2, where
the first seal also features a rider on a white horse. Some commentators
believe that Revelation 6’s white horse refers to Jesus and the preaching of
the gospel.
However, even though both riders are on white horses, they don’t necessarily
both represent good guys. Other commentators believe that Revelation 6’s
white horse refers to the spirit of the Antichrist, already present at the end of
the first century, exercising his influence through deception and error (see 1
John 2:18–25). If this is the case, the two riders on white horses frame
Revelation 6–20 and provide a dramatic contrast. The last rider on a white
horse trumps the first. No rivals stand against Jesus.
Getting four names for one rider
Four names identify the rider on the white horse. Of course, John’s readers
already know who this is. These names speak to the character and qualifica-
tions of the King. Each name of Jesus highlights certain attributes or charac-
teristics that qualify him to be the redeemer and rightful ruler of humanity:
 “Faithful and True”: The faithfulness of Jesus is a keynote in the Book
of Revelation. He is “the faithful witness” (Rev. 1:5, 3:14). There’s no
falsehood in him, so he stands in stark contrast to the beast and false
prophet, who specialize in deceit.
 Name known only to the rider: This title reminds the reader that
because Jesus is God, there are dimensions of his being and person that
are inaccessible to mere mortals.
 “The Word of God”: This title connects the book of Revelation with the
Gospel of John and is one of the indicators of common authorship. John
doesn’t elaborate on the pre-existence and creative activity of Jesus in
Revelation as he does in his Gospel (John 1:1–5). But he does allude to
it. Jesus strikes with a sword from his mouth. This figure of speech
means that he simply speaks a word of command, and it happens.
255
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)
Knowing God’s name
Widespread in the ancient Near East was the
notion that knowing a deity’s name granted spe-
cial power or favor. The Bible does reflect the con-
viction that knowing the name of the deity brings
one into personal fellowship and relationship, but
not in a magical sense (Exodus 33:12, 18–19; John
17:6). The Bible is emphatic, however, that know-
ing God’s name doesn’t amount to controlling
God; on the contrary, the name of God controls
all that is (Genesis 32:29; Exodus 3:13–15; Judges
13:17–18; Acts 19:13–16; Philippians 2:9–11).

 “King of kings and Lord of lords”: This title answers a central question
posed in the book of Revelation: Who’s in charge? The repetition in the
title (King of kings) reflects a characteristic of the Hebrew language:
using repetition to emphasize something superlative or unique. In short,
Jesus is a king and a lord without peer. Even though John writes in
Greek, you can still detect here and there the influence of the Hebrew
language on his Greek.
Of interest is the location of this title. The image appears to be that of a
long robe trailing out behind the rider. The title is emblazoned both on
the robe and upper leg, where warriors typically wear their sword.
Perhaps the sword itself bears this title.
The robe has another distinctive mark: It’s dipped in blood (Rev. 19:13).
Does this refer to Jesus’s sacrificial death, or is the image that of a warrior
whose garment is stained with the blood of fallen enemies? Perhaps both
images are intended; both ideas are rooted in biblical thought (see Rev. 1:5,
5:6, 5:12, 7:14, and 12:11 on the sacrifice idea, and see Isaiah 42:13, 63:3–6;
Habakkuk 3:11–14; and Zephaniah 3:17 on the conquering hero image).
Taking multiple, descriptive names is a traditional practice among monarchs,
both ancient and modern. At their coronation, leaders often assume throne
names, which become part of the royal ideology. For example, Isaiah 9:6 lists
four throne names of the prophesied Messiah: “Wonderful counselor, Mighty
God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Prince.” Each name is a fitting description
of John’s Jesus, the returning King.
256
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Taking up throne titles
Here’s a sampling of the throne titles of two
ancient kings:
 Ramses II of Egypt: King of Upper and
Lower Egypt, Son of Re, Giver of life forever,
Beloved of Amon-Re, Lord of the Two Lands,
Appearing on the Horus-throne of the
Living, like his father Har-akhti forever
 Sennacherib of Assyria: Sennacherib, the
great king, the mighty king, king of the world,
king of Assyria, king of the four quarters, the
wise shepherd, favorite of the great gods,
guardian of right, lover of justice, who lends
support, who comes to the aid of the desti-
tute, who performs pious acts, perfect hero,
mighty man, first among all princes, the pow-
erful one who consumes, the insubmissive,
who strikes the wicked with the thunderbolt
Modern monarchs continue the tradition! Here
are Queen Elizabeth II’s throne titles: Elizabeth
the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and of Her Other Realms and Territories Queen,
Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the
Faith.

Readers of the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible may object, noting that
there are five, not four names in Isaiah 9:6. The KJV places a comma after the
word Wonderful, distinguishing it from the following word Counselor, making
it appear as a separate name (that’s also how the passage appears in the
“Hallelujah Chorus” of Handel’s Messiah). There are, however, good arguments
for taking Wonderful Counselor as one title. Jewish scribes, called the Masoretes,
added punctuation and vowel points (marks indicating how a syllable is to be
pronounced) to the ancient Hebrew text, which had only consonants, about 700
CE. According to their understanding, the text consists of four titles composed
of two words each. The result is a nicely balanced unit.
Picking the bones clean 
and taking prisoners
John rewinds the tape of the last days’ events as Revelation 19 concludes. He
wants to show the battle scene at Armageddon one last time. The vision fea-
tures another invitation to a banquet called “the great supper of God” (Rev.
19:17). But what a contrast to the marriage supper of the Lamb! If the former
is glorious — a white-robe only affair — this one is gory, a macabre feast of
decaying flesh. An angel summons scavenger birds, like vultures, to the scene
of the battle. They’re the clean-up crew. So ends the army recruited by the
beast and false prophet. We think of those photographs of the aftermath of
Civil War battles that so shocked the American public — bloated, blackened,
stiff corpses litter the fields.
Attention now shifts to the ringleaders themselves. What happens to the
beast and the false prophet? Both are captured: “These two were thrown
alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur” (Rev. 19:20). No mention of
who captures them or how it’s accomplished. Perhaps that’s the point:
They’re defenseless against the Lamb. But how did their army perish so sud-
denly? The sword issuing forth from the mouth of the rider on the white
horse kills them. That is, by a mere word of command, they die. God (the
Lamb), who called the worlds into existence by a mere word (Genesis 1), can
also operate in the other direction.
257
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

Dawning of the Millennial Age
(20:1–6)
Revelation 20:1–6 pictures an unprecedented time in human history. The arch
deceiver, Satan, bearing four descriptive titles, is unmasked and incarcerated.
Here are some of his aliases:
 Dragon: This descriptive title, perhaps indebted to an ancient Near Eastern
myth in which a chaos monster threatens to destroy the created order,
depicts Satan as a dragon. As such, Satan is the archetypal chaos monster.
 Serpent: This title may also reflect ancient Near Eastern mythology in
which a snake tricks humanity and prevents their obtaining immortality.
But even more relevant is the account of the serpent’s deception of the
first human couple in Genesis 3. Revelation 20:3 explicitly states why
Satan is cast into the bottomless pit: “so that he would deceive the
nations no more.”
 Devil: The Greek word diabolos, translated as “Devil,” means “one who
slanders.” Characteristic of the Devil’s tactics are his slanderous accusa-
tions brought against God and his people (see Job 1–2; Revelation 12:10).
 Satan: The basic meaning of this word is “adversary.” This pretty much
sums up Satan’s mode of operation: he resists, obstructs, and subverts
all attempts to realize God’s kingdom on earth. He is the “mother of all
adversaries.”
As soon as the Devil is locked up, the Lamb takes charge! Jesus brings back
to life those who were martyred for their faith, and they reign with him for
1,000 years. A special blessing is pronounced upon all who participate in this
golden age (Rev 20:6). In this section, we go over the downfall of the dragon
and the resurrection of the martyrs.
Seizing the dragon
Checkmate! The Devil has no moves left on the cosmic chessboard. An
unidentified but obviously powerful angel, “holding in his hand the key to the
bottomless pit and a great chain,” drags the Devil off to prison. In the pit, he
no longer practices his trade: deceiving the nations. Revelation states the
length of his sentence twice: 1,000 years (20:2, 20:3). But then comes the omi-
nous statement: “After that he must be let out for a little while” (Rev. 20:3). At
least one last event in the career of Satan is to play out later in the chapter.
258
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Reigning with the Lamb
A new administration takes charge. John turns to thrones containing individ-
uals entrusted with the authority to dispense justice. Though John doesn’t
identify them, they’re clearly followers of the Lamb. In the Gospels, Jesus
promises his disciples that they’ll occupy positions of leadership and judg-
ment when his kingdom fully arrives: “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all
things, when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of his glory, you who
have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel” (Matthew 19:28; see also Luke 22:29–30, and compare 1 Corinthians
6:2–3 for Paul’s contribution to the subject).
John’s attention fastens on one particular group of Jesus’s followers: those
who pay the ultimate price for their commitment to the Lamb. John sees the
souls of the Christian martyrs who were beheaded by the beast. Earlier, during
the fifth seal, John saw “the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the
word of God and for the testimony they had given” (Rev. 6:9). They were located
under the altar, and they cried out for justice. That day has now come, and
they collect their reward for faithfulness.
These souls are suddenly embodied — that is, they receive new, physical
bodies, just like Jesus did in his resurrection: “They came to life and reigned
with Christ a thousand years” (Rev. 20:4). This event is designated as “the
first resurrection” (Rev. 20:5), and it constitutes the fifth of seven blessings
recounted in the book. To experience resurrection places one beyond death;
immortality is now an inherent and irreversible attribute. Added to this
unending life is the privilege of serving as a priest of God and Jesus. These
believer-priests, seated on thrones, reign with Jesus throughout the millen-
nial era — that is, the period of 1,000 (Rev. 20:6).
Notice the brief editorial comment concerning the fate of nonbelievers who
die before Jesus’s millennial reign. They, too, experience a resurrection of
sorts, but its nature is drastically different from that of the saints; it receives
a fuller discussion later in Revelation 20 (see “Termination of Death and
Hades,” later in this chapter).
Perhaps no single passage in the Book of Revelation captures readers’ imagi-
nations more than the description of a 1,000-year reign of Jesus on earth, as
described in the opening verses of Revelation 20. Hopes for a millennial,
golden age have stirred the hearts and minds of reformers, politicians, the-
ologians, and poets for generations. Popular media resonate with millennial
aspirations under varied figures and images. The question continually resur-
faces: Will there truly be a prolonged period of peace and prosperity? Is a
golden age in our future? We examine some of these issues in detail at the
end of this chapter.
259
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

Letting Satan Loose (20:7–10)
Surprisingly, after 1,000 years of lockup, Satan actually gets paroled! Why
does God allow this fiend to go free? We can only speculate.
Perhaps the point is to demonstrate once and for all how deeply sin affects
the human heart. Even though Jesus himself personally reigns over the earth
during the Millennium and Satan is unable to incite rebellion, as soon as
Satan is released, he finds willing accomplices. Perhaps the prophet Jeremiah
gives the best possible explanation: “The heart is devious above all else; it is
perverse — who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9). At any rate, Scripture
affirms that “all things work together for good for those who love God, who
are called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). Somehow, Satan’s parole
fits into God’s plan.
In this section, we explain how Satan spends his last great escape.
Reverting to form
Satan, as portrayed in the Bible, is incorrigible. Many theologians think
redemption is provided for human beings only, not angels, and Satan himself
is a fallen angel (see Job 1:6–12; Ezekiel 28:11–16; Luke 10:18).
In the Bible, angels, like humans, are free moral agents who can decide for or
against God. Maybe when Satan leads the primeval angelic rebellion (see 2
Peter 2:4; Jude 4), those who side with him are confirmed in wickedness (this
idea appears, for example, in the Jewish apocalyptic work 1 Enoch 15–16).
Perhaps this is so because of the enormity of their offense in light of their
exalted privilege and position. In the case of angels, God seems to require
perfect obedience. Satan and his minions opted out and are now, by nature,
utterly opposed to the good.
At any rate, once released from his prison, Satan wastes no time. He immedi-
ately sets about duping the crowning achievement of God’s creation, human
beings. It’s shocking how easily he accomplishes his aim. He’s a master of
deception with a vast repertoire. Added to that, he knows humans — the
sons and daughters of Adam and Eve — better than they know themselves.
Googling Gog
More mysterious figures enter the fray: Satan goes to the four corners of the
earth (an expression meaning the entire planet) to summon Gog and Magog
to battle. Who are they?
260
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Finding other biblical references
The name Gog appears in three separate texts: 1 Chronicles 5:4, Ezekiel 38–39
(ten times), and Revelation 20:8:
 In 1 Chronicles 5:4, Gog is a son of Joel of the tribe of Reuben. Obviously,
he’s not under consideration in Revelation 20.
 Ezekiel 38:2 mentions a Gog, “the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.” This
text is doubtless the background of John’s thought. In Ezekiel 38–39, Magog
is a region to the extreme north of the land of Israel (Ezekiel 38:6). Gog of
Magog, lured by the Lord, leads a coalition invasion force against Israel. In
Ezekiel’s vision, the Lord destroys this vast army on the mountains of
Israel.
The name Magog occurs five times: Genesis 10:2; 1 Chronicles 1:5; Ezekiel
38:2, 39:6; and Revelation 20:8. According to Genesis and 1 Chronicles, Magog
is one of the sons of Japheth, the ancestor of non-Semitic, Euro-Asian peoples.
Discerning what John meant
Although there undoubtedly was an ancient people known as Magog living far
to the north of Israel, we don’t think John’s intent was to be politically and
geographically correct. In Revelation, he wants to depict an evil alliance,
embracing peoples traditionally considered to live at the farthest corners of
the world. This End-Times “axis of evil” seeks to unseat the Lamb from his
throne. In short, most scholars conclude that Gog and Magog (G&M) are sym-
bolic names, not literal, which was the standard interpretation of the expres-
sion among the Jewish rabbis.
The aim of this G&M coalition, however, is far from symbolic. Once again,
Satan orders a frontal assault, this time on the city of Jerusalem, the abode of
the redeemed. They attack the rider on the white horse and his army (Rev.
19:19), but G&M are stopped in their tracks — but not cold in their tracks!
“And fire came down from heaven and consumed them” (Rev. 20:9). Talk
about blunt force and trauma! The battle is short and, thankfully, the last.
No sympathy for the devil. His sentence is swift and severe. He joins his cre-
ations, the beast and false prophet, in the lake of fire and sulfur (Rev. 20:10).
From his first appearance in the Bible in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3),
Satan has consistently sought to frustrate the purposes of God. He’s responsi-
ble for an incalculable amount of suffering, and his punishment corresponds
to his crimes: “tormented day and night forever and ever.” The curtain comes
down on the final act of his career.
261
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

Standing at the Great White Throne
(20:11–15)
An awe-inspiring vision unfolds in the last third of Revelation 20. A great
white throne dominates the scene, speaking of authority and sovereignty.
John doesn’t have to say who sits on the throne — that point is clear: God
the Father and the Lamb preside over this court.
The New Testament attributes Judgment Day to both the Father and the Son
(see John 5:22; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Romans 14:10; and 2 Timothy 4:1). This
final judgment differs from a number of other divine judgments that occur
within history:
 Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:22–24)
 Cain’s banishment for murdering his brother Abel (Genesis 4:12)
 The flood in the days of Noah, destroying the entire earth because of
human and demonic wickedness (Genesis 7:11–24)
 The destruction of Pharaoh’s empire for infanticide and forced slavery
(Exodus 7:14–12:36)
 The extermination of the Canaanites for their extreme depravity and 
cruelty (Joshua 1–12)
262
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Coming from Russia without love?
Some students of Bible prophecy claim that Gog
is a symbolic name for the leader of Russia and
that Magog is an ancient tribal name for that
region. They claim that because Russia is far to
the north of Israel, this fits geographically.
Furthermore, they claim that Meschech and
Tubal (Ezekiel 38:2) are equated with the Russian
cities Moscow and Tobolsk.
Going a step further, they suggest that Gogshould
not be translated as “chief prince” in Ezekiel 38:2
but as “Rosh.” (The Hebrew word Rosh usually
means “head, leader, commander,” and so forth.)
They take it as a proper name and appeal to the
fact that one of the leading tribes in Russian his-
tory is the Rus. From this, they infer that Russia
invades the land of Israel in the End Times. A dif-
ference of opinion surfaces, however, as to the
placement of this invasion. Some locate it before
the Millennium, at the battle of Armageddon
(Revelation 9:13–19, 16:12–17), but others follow
the order of Ezekiel 38–39 and place it, like
Revelation 20:7–10, after the Millennium. Still
others entertain several different options in order
to harmonize Ezekiel with Revelation.
Today, most scholars are wary of identify-
ing ancient biblical names for various tribal,
ethnic groups with modern nation-states.
Understanding the genre of the book of
Revelation is crucial: John employs these
ancient tribal names symbolically in order to
depict a final coalition of peoples opposed to the
kingdom of Jesus. Beyond that, readers have to
be very cautious about making bold predictions
involving contemporary nations and states.

These historical judgments pale in comparison to this the final righting of
wrongs and vindication of the righteous. According to the Bible, all human
beings must give an account for their deeds before God (Romans 14:10–12; 2
Corinthians 5:10; 2 Timothy 4:1; 1 Peter 4:5). For that reason, this scene is
properly called the Last Judgment.
John’s vision shares some features with Daniel’s earlier vision of the Last
Judgment: “As I watched, thrones were set in place and an Ancient One took
his throne. [. . .] The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened”
(Daniel 7:9–10). Almost as an afterthought, John mentions that earth and
heaven flee from the presence of the one on the throne (Rev. 20:11). John
returns to this rather startling idea in Revelation 21:1. The issue at center
stage in this paragraph is the Final Judgment.
In this section, we explain who is judged, the standard and basis for judg-
ment, and the two diametrically opposed outcomes.
Judgment by the books
The judgment process appears to involve two books. To be more precise,
Revelation speaks of a collection of books and a single, very likely large book
(20:12). Scholars hold three main views with regard to the correlation between
the two:
 Only the names of the redeemed are listed in the book of life, and
only nonbelievers are listed in the books of deeds. This view, however,
runs contrary to the teaching of Scripture that even believers will be
judged on the basis of their deeds (2 Corinthians 5:10; Romans 14:10).
263
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)
Judging art
Many artists and writers have tried to imagine the
moment of the Final Judgment in Revelation
20:11–15. Michelangelo completed his fresco ren-
dition of “The Last Judgment” in the Sistine
Chapel at Rome. Dante Alighieri expressed the
Judgment to great literary effect in The Divine
Comedy, especially in the first cantica (section),
“Inferno.” And Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni
(“the most perfect opera ever written,” accord-
ing to theologian Søren Kierkegaard) gives a
musical interpretation when the notorious
seducer descends into the fires of Hell. These
artists are all indebted to the primary descrip-
tion of Doomsday in Revelation 20. This scene
is unsettling. Standing before God to be judged
for is indeed cause for concern!

 Only the names of the redeemed occur in both the books of deeds and
the book of life. On this understanding, the deeds of believers simply
demonstrate the presence of saving faith. Obviously, nonbelievers aren’t
listed in the book of life, and their deeds likewise testify against them
that they don’t possess genuine faith. In short, faith produces good
works (James 2:14–26).
 Those whose names are missing from the citizen list, the book of life,
may appeal to the books of deeds. Perhaps, proponents argue, some
may even be admitted to the heavenly city at this late hour, testifying to
an implicit trust in God and his Messiah. The Apostle Paul is sometimes
cited in support of this conjecture:
“When Gentiles who do not possess the law, do instinctively what
the law requires, these, though not having the law, are a law to
themselves. They show that what the law requires is written down
on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness;
and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them
on the day when, according to my gospel, God, through Jesus
Christ will judge the secret thoughts of all.” (Romans 2:14–16)
We leave the interpretation an open question. What’s clear in both the Old and
New Testaments, however, is that salvation is not based on works; salvation is
by grace (unmerited favor from God) through faith. Furthermore, good works
are the fruit of genuine faith (Ephesians 2:8–10), and believers are judged on
the basis of their works with regard to reward or loss of reward in the new
Jerusalem (1 Corinthians 3:10–15).
Looking at the books of deeds and the people before the throne
John says, “And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne”
(Rev. 20:12). The collection of books contains an account of all their works.
On a premillennial understanding of Revelation, these dead include all the people
who have ever lived and have not responded to God’s offer of salvation — in
other words, the great majority are nonbelievers. Premillenialists assume that
believers prior to the Millennium have already been judged at Jesus’s judgment
seat and received their rewards for faithful service or suffered loss for failure to
do so (see 1 Corinthians 3:10–15; 2 Corinthians 5:10; and Romans 14:10–12). But
many people survive the Great Tribulation and enter the millennial era. They and
their descendants born during the Millennium must make a personal decision to
trust Jesus as Savior. Presumably, many of them do and, presumably, they’re
included in this judgment scene. But obviously, many do not because Satan is
able to deceive a great host at the end of the Millennium. So nonbelievers from
the millennial age are present as well.
On an amillennial approach to Revelation, things aren’t so complicated.
Everyone, believers and nonbelievers alike, participate in this final court
session because no interim earthly kingdom precedes the eternal state.
264
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Searching in the book of life
The book of life is a listing of all the heirs of God and joint heirs of Jesus (see
Romans 8:12–17). In a sense, Jesus is the sole heir of God; however, he will-
ingly shares his inheritance with the redeemed. Believers thus become joint
heirs with their elder brother. The sealed scroll in Revelation 5:1–10 seems to
function like a last will and testament. A will indicates who is to inherit the
estate, and now you discover who the beneficiaries are.
Perhaps first, a search is made of the book of deeds. The life of the individual
is, so to speak, an open book. The transcript speaks for itself. But the crucial
question is this: Is a person’s name also found in the book of life? A listing in
the book of life, biblically, indicates that a person is a certified believer.
According to Revelation 20:15, this is decisive: “And anyone whose name was
not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.”
265
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)
Salvation in the works?
According to the Bible, good deeds alone don’t
assure a place in heaven. Not fair! cries the
reader. What if a person has an admirable record
of good deeds? What orthodox Christians have
always affirmed, in light of the total message of
the Bible, is that essential, good works are a
result of believing in Jesus but aren’t the key to
heaven. Here’s what noted theologians have rea-
soned from the Bible for centuries:
 No one is saved on the basis of good
works. The reason is that even noble deeds
can be carried out with impure or false
motives; the human heart is deceitful
(Jeremiah 17:9). The Apostle Paul’s exposé
in Romans 3:9–18 builds to this conclusion:
“For no human being will be justified in his
sight by deeds prescribed by the law, for
through the law comes the knowledge of
sin” (Romans 3:20). He then summarizes his
argument with this indictment: “For there is
no distinction, since all have sinned and fall
short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).
The verdict is certain: Innumerable offenses
litter everyone’s personal transcript.
 If judgment is on the basis of works, the flip
side is that salvation is by grace through
faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:8–9). Those who
truly come to Jesus recognize their short-
coming and cast themselves on the mercy
of the court. The work of the Holy Spirit in
the heart, what theologians call regenera-
tion or the new birth (see John 3:3–10), is
such that good deeds follow as a natural
consequence. Indeed, good deeds are an
outward indicator of an inner work of grace
but are not sufficient to secure salvation
(Galatians 5:6, 6:15; 1 Corinthians 7:19).
 Salvation comes down to a relationship, not
human effort (Galatians 2:15–16). Those who
trust in Jesus are reconciled to God and
become part of his spiritual family; they enjoy
the privileges of being his children (Galatians
4:6; Romans 5:1, 5:6–11, 8:12–17) and show
the fruit of the Spirit in their lives (Galatians
5:16–26). In short, those with admirable
deeds turn out to be those who are spiritu-
ally reborn and have their names in the book
of life. At the end of the day, then, the two
sets of books in Revelation are in harmony.

Termination of Death and Hades
John’s readers may have wondered what happens to those who die at sea. And
though he doesn’t mention it, readers may also wonder about those whose
bodies were cremated. Does this prevent any possibility of resurrection?
Though John doesn’t spell it out, his vision is in harmony with the biblical
view that everyone experiences a bodily resurrection before the Final Judgment.
The quality of the resurrection of the righteous, however, differs drastically
from that of the unrighteous. The root of this conviction goes back to the Old
Testament book of Daniel. There you read, “Many of those who sleep in the dust
of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and ever-
lasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2). Jesus reaffirms this teaching:
“Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in
the graves will hear his voice and will come out — those who have done
good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the res-
urrection of condemnation.” (John 5:28–29)
John personifies the realm of the departed under the twin names of Death and
Hades. Hades is a Greek term for the place and condition of those who experi-
ence the separation of body and spirit called death. Dramatically, John sees the
realm of the dead virtually emptied out and poured into the lake of fire. He adds
this editorial comment: “This is the second death, the lake of fire” (20:14). With
this statement, John closes the books, so to speak, on redemptive history. His
next series of visions usher the reader into a new earth and a new Jerusalem.
Sorting Out Two Theological Issues
In this section, we briefly discuss two difficult theological problems —
namely, the nature of final punishment and the nature of the Millennium.
Instead of arguing for a specific position, we try to describe fairly and accu-
rately the various options. We do, however, indicate our preferences.
Struggling to understand hell
Christians and others struggle with the idea of hell. What are you to make of
the idea of eternal punishment of nonbelievers in the lake of fire? Is such a
teaching really compatible with the core doctrines of Christianity, especially
the love and mercy of God for all human beings?
We don’t pretend to have definitive answers. Much more competent theologians
have grappled with this question and admitted failure in resolving the problem
266
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

satisfactorily. We simply present some of the views of respected Christian
thinkers.
A traditional view: No rest for the wicked
Traditionally, hell is viewed as a condition of eternal, conscious torment.
Most Christian theologians through the ages have held this view. However,
many of these same theologians haven’t insisted on a strictly literal interpreta-
tion of the lake of fire.
Rather than press the language in this way, they’ve instead preferred to
stress the essential nature of hell as exclusion from God’s presence.
Nonbelievers are cast out or excluded from the blessings and joy of God’s
presence, the source of all that’s truly good. The torment experienced by the
impenitent (those who are viewed biblically as unrepentant sinners) is under-
stood as primarily mental and spiritual anguish and remorse.
A minority view: Being wiped out of existence
Some scholars are troubled even by the notion that God would inflict an eternal
punishment. They raise questions such as the following:
 How can you avoid calling such a thing torture, and how can this be
worthy of God?
 Can’t he forgive his enemies as he commands people to do?
 Doesn’t this present an enormous philosophical and theological problem
in that this place or condition of punishment exists forever?
 How can there be an ultimate solution to the problem of evil if this
pocket of punishment always exists?
In light of these questions, they suggest that the lake of fire represents annihi-
lation. That is, nonbelievers cease to exist, kind of like being blasted by some
sort of space gun. Because they no longer exist, they’re not conscious and
suffer no pain. A slight modification of this view agrees that there’s a time of
conscious torment for nonbelievers, but it’s limited in duration. After their
deserved punishment, they cease to exist. The philosophical and theological
advantage for those holding the annihilation view is that it eliminates the
continuing presence of evil in the universe.
A more radical view: Everyone’s forgiven
A more radical solution to what some see as the “problem of hell” affirms that
God eventually pardons and receives virtually everyone into fellowship with
himself — except, perhaps, for the devil and his angels! This position is often
labeled as universalism. A few Christian theologians have dared to champion
this position. One of the most noteworthy was the brilliant scholar and church-
man Origen (who died 254 CE). His view, however, was later condemned in 553
CE at the Fifth Ecumenical Council in Constantinople (an ecumenical council is
267
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

a private meeting of representative leaders from the entire church having
authority to define doctrine and practice for all Christians).
No simple answers
Many Christian scholars see aspects of annihilation and universalism as
attractive, but they note weighty objections. The Scriptures seem to treat the
destiny of believers and nonbelievers as parallel in duration. That is, believ-
ers are pictured as enjoying the new Jerusalem forever. Nonbelievers are pic-
tured as being in the lake of fire forever. Does limiting the extent of the one
jeopardize the other?
Perhaps the fundamental problem is the limitation of human language to
describe spiritual realities. Scripture employs a range of conventional, even
contradictory, figures and expressions to describe hell (for example, fire and
darkness). But as with any analogy, these shouldn’t be pressed too far.
Don’t charge the suffering of the impenitent to God’s account. The biblical
case is that this is what they’ve chosen for themselves; you are what you
choose to be, and God allows you to make that choice — and to reap the con-
sequences. The Bible resounds with warnings about the reality of final judg-
ment. It insists that there’s “a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire
that will consume the adversaries” (Hebrews 10:27).
Mulling over the meaning 
of the Millennium
Five times in six verses, John mentions a 1,000-year reign. But how are you to
interpret this chronological notation? Symbols, figures, metaphors, and images
abound in the Book of Revelation. Is the Millennium simply another symbol for
a spiritual reality? This question has generated considerable debate in Christian
circles for a long time. Perhaps the best way to proceed is simply to lay out the
respective viewpoints and their arguments.
Pessimistic premillennialism: A literal 1,000 years
The earliest documented approach to the celebrated millennial passage 
(Rev. 20:1–6) is dubbed premillennialism. This view, as the name suggests,
holds that Jesus returns to earth and then establishes an earthly kingdom,
reigning for 1,000 years with his saints. Hence, the name premillennial describes
Jesus’s return — that is, before the Millennium. Here are the chief arguments
supporting it:
268
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 It’s based on a literal reading of the text and coheres with a similar reading
of the Old Testament prophets, who proclaim a very this-worldly future
kingdom in connection with the Day of the Lord (see, for example, Amos
9:11–15; Joel 3:18–21; Isaiah 2:1–4, 4:2–6; and Jeremiah 31:38–40).
 The earliest church fathers who write on matters dealing with the End
Times appear to be premillennialists. Among these are Papias, Irenaeus,
Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and Victorinus. Although such an argument is
hardly decisive, neither should it be dismissed. Papias and Justin Martyr
are quite close to the apostolic age (when John wrote Revelation), and
it’s difficult to imagine they already misunderstood the nature of 
the 1,000 years.
 The mention of resurrection, specifically designated as “the first resur-
rection,” is most naturally understood as the resurrection of the body,
not a spiritual resurrection. The physical nature of the resurrection
seems to require a corresponding physical dimension to the 1,000-years
reign — in other words, an earthly kingdom.
Premillennialism is typically not optimistic about converting the great majority
of the world’s population to the gospel (“good news” of Jesus). Premillennialists
have always been in the forefront of world missions but have not imagined
that their evangelistic efforts would ultimately lead to a truly Christian world.
Rather, premillennialism holds that at the end of the age, the Dark Lord and
his evil emissaries succeed in deceiving a majority of people then-living to
accept the mark of the beast (see Matthew 24:10–14).
Some critics, especially postmillennialists (see that view later on), find fault
with premillennialists for not having more confidence in the power of the gospel
to convert the great majority. Premillenialists respond that Jesus and the apos-
tles never teach that most will accept the gospel. Jesus and the apostles do,
however, command that the gospel be preached to all the nations of the world.
Premillenial dispensationalism: Two separate destinies
Dispensationalism is a highly influential variant of premillennialism (see 
the preceding section). The distinguishing feature of dispensationalism is the
conviction that there are two separate peoples of God: Israel (the Jewish
tribes) and the church (all Christian believers). The mission and destiny of
these two peoples are quite distinct:
 The ultimate destiny of the Jewish people is to be regathered in their
historic homeland and be restored as a nation. They’re also to put their
faith in Jesus of Nazareth as their promised Messiah. Dispensationalism
believes that all the Old Testament prophecies about the restoration of
Israel are fulfilled literally during the Millennium of Revelation 20. They
hold that the literal fulfillment of the Old Testament–covenant promises
to Abraham and his descendants is the primary purpose of the Millennium.
269
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

 The church does not share in this future program but rather is raptured
out of this world (taken up to heaven) prior to the Great Tribulation. For
this reason, another pre- gets added to the mix! Dispensationalists are
almost exclusively pre-Tribulationalists — that is, they believe Jesus
returns for the church prior to the “70th week” of Daniel, the Great
Tribulation, the Day of the Lord. The church is a heavenly people and
has a destiny different from Israel’s, reigning with Jesus in the heavens,
not on the earth in a literal Jerusalem. (See Chapters 3 and 9–12 for
details on the Great Tribulation.)
The linchpin for dispensationalists is the steadfast insistence upon a strictly
literal interpretation of biblical prophecy. If you do adhere to such a strict lit-
eralness, you’ll most likely arrive at a view very close to that advocated by
dispensationalists.
Dispensationalists share, perhaps even accentuate, the premillennial pes-
simistic view that the gospel will not convert the whole world before Jesus
returns.
Negative amillennialism: A long, spiritual reign
The prefix suggests that amillennialists reject the notion of a Millennium. This
is somewhat misleading. To be sure, they don’t believe in an earthly, interim
kingdom before the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 21). On the other
hand, they do believe in a figurative Millennium, referring to the present gospel
era, the reign of deceased saints with Jesus in heaven, or both. In this sense,
they affirm a Millennial age. The arguments for this approach may be
summarized as follows:
 Amillenialists refer to the figurative use of threes, sevens and multiples
of seven, and twelves and multiples of twelve throughout the book.
Nowhere else in the Bible is a literal, 1,000-year reign of the Messiah over
the earth mentioned. In the book of Revelation, where symbols abound
and numbers carry a spiritual rather than a literal significance, the 1,000
years simply conveys the idea of a long period of time (on this point,
many premillenialists agree). Amillenialists view the 1,000-year reign in a
spiritual, not an earthly, sense.
 To amillennialists, the notion of an earthly, interim kingdom seems to be
a backward step. The trajectory of Scripture, according to amillennialists,
encourages people to see a movement from the earthly to the heavenly,
from types and shadows to fulfillment and reality, from the temporary to
the eternal. Amillennialists definitely reject the dispensational type of
premillennialism (see the preceding section) because it seems to under-
cut the unity of one people of God that’s so important to the covenant
concept found in the Bible. The distinction between Israel and the church
is flatly rejected and often viewed as heretical! Old Testament–Israel is
the church, and the New Testament church is the new Israel — ultimately
all one group.
270
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

 The reference in Revelation 20:4 to those who “came to life and reigned
with Christ a thousand years” is interpreted as a spiritual resurrection.
That is, it’s really a figurative way of speaking about conversion, about
being born again. Thus, the “first resurrection” of Revelation 20:5 is the
entire era during which the gospel is preached until Jesus returns.
Amillennialists understand the second resurrection to occur in Revelation
20:11–14, when Jesus returns and all the righteous and the wicked are res-
urrected and stand at the great white throne of judgment (see the earlier
section “Standing at the Great White Throne [20:11–15]”).
Amillennialists point out that this is certainly a cleaner, simpler position
than the premillennialist stance, which involves two resurrections and
two different judgments. The dispensational variant, they say, is even more
convoluted, with two different “second comings” of Jesus: the pre-
Tribulational rapture for the saints before the Great Tribulation and the
return (or revelation) of Jesus to the earth with the saints seven years later.
 Amillenialists frequently call attention to a literary technique that John
uses. Several times, he recaps the storyline or flow of the narrative. He
backs up and looks in more detail at certain pivotal persons or events.
Amillenialists often insist that Revelation 20:1–6 is another instance of
recapitulation. After describing Armageddon (Rev. 19:17–21), John backs
up and surveys the entire gospel era prior to the last battle. In their
view, then, Revelation 20 offers no support for a literal Millennium.
Optimistic postmillennialism: Jesus’s fashionably late return
As the prefix suggests, postmillennialism holds that Jesus returns after the
Millennium. Here’s a summary of this position:
 Postmillennialists do not typically insist on a literal 1,000 years; they
believe the expression simply means an extended period of time.
 In agreement with premillennialists and contrary to amillennialists, post-
millennialists hold to an actual, earthly kingdom. In contrast to premil-
lennialists, however, Jesus is not physically present on earth during this
golden era. He is present spiritually, and by the power of the Holy Spirit,
the gospel transforms society so that Christianity dominates the world.
For this reason, you can consider this view optimistic.
 Postmillennialists appeal to the power of the gospel to convert and
transform — and accuse premillennialists and amillennialists of not having
enough confidence in God’s saving power. Postmillennialists cite Biblical
texts in which believers are commissioned to tell the good news to the
ends of the earth. If the world is the mission field, then God must intend
to save the great majority of the world, so the argument runs (see
Matthew 28:19–20; Acts 1:8; and Romans 1:16). In particular, people who
hold this view appeal to where John sees “a great multitude that no one
could count from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages,
standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with
palm branches in their hands” (Rev 7:9).
271
Chapter 13: Coming of the Kingdom (19:1–20:15)

Postmillennialism is not a widely held view. Although its confidence in the
power of the gospel is commendable, the Scriptural support is slim. A number
of texts from Jesus and the Apostles rather strongly suggest that the world
won’t be Christianized, nor will a majority embrace the gospel (see Luke 18:8;
Matthew 24:3–31; 2 Thessalonians 2:3–12; Revelation 13). The actual course of
history in the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century offers little
encouragement that the gospel is transforming society. The overall misery
index shows no sign of improvement.
The primary contenders in this debate are really premillennialists and amil-
lennialists. The relative merits and deficiencies of the arguments are difficult
to assess, and the reader with no vested interest in the outcome may be for-
given for thinking it’s just a tempest in a teapot! None of the great ecumenical
creeds (statements of belief) render a verdict on this question, so we won’t
either. What do you think?

Chapter 14
Seeing the New Jerusalem and a
Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)
In This Chapter
 Exploring a new heaven and new earth
 Walking in the streets of the new Jerusalem
 Returning to the Garden of Eden
O
ut with the old, in with the new. A new world now replaces the old! In fact,
the Greek word that John uses (kainos) stresses a quality of newness that
means unused, unprecedented, unworn, uncommon. Although the old world is
destroyed, God doesn’t leave it in ashes.
In this chapter, you walk through the glorious newness of Revelation 21–22.
John first describes the new heaven and earth in Revelation 21:1–8. Then his
attention zeroes in on the centerpiece of this new world order: the new
Jerusalem. He takes readers on a virtual tour of the celestial city (so-called
because its origin is in heaven), noting some of its features and landmarks
along the way (Rev. 21:9–22:6).
Finally, we explore John’s imagery, which provides a fitting conclusion not
only to his book but to the entire Bible. In short, he portrays the new Jerusalem
as a garden of Eden (22:1–5). In fact, John Milton, the seventeenth-century
English poet, picks up on this theme in his epic poem, Paradise Regain’d: God’s
people return to the garden.
Exploring a New Creation (21:1–8)
In Revelation 20:11, John says “the earth and the heaven” flee from the presence
of the one on the great white throne, and “no place was found for them.” As
Revelation 21 begins, John describes the nature of the new earth and what life
on it will be like for believers. Interestingly, though he says there’s a new heaven,
it remains shrouded in mystery. Instead, he fastens onto a few features of the
new earth. This section unpacks these new features.

274
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Understanding the heavens
For modern readers, the Bible may seem to be
quaint and quite out-of-date when it comes to the
natural order. This shouldn’t be worrisome. The
Bible was written long before the scientific
method of hypothesis and empirical observation,
which was first developed in the seventeenth
century. Remember that the Bible reports on the
physical world in terms of simple observation,
unaided by telescopes or microscopes. Only the
portion of creation visible to the naked eye
appears in the creation account in Genesis 1.
From the perspective of the Bible and later
Jewish and Christian tradition, heaven consists
of three main divisions (the Hebrew word for
heaven, shamayim, is plural in number, in keep-
ing with its three primary meanings):
 The first heaven is the atmosphere above
the earth in which the birds fly (Genesis
1:20), the winds blow, the clouds float, and
from which rain and snow fall (Genesis 9:14;
Judges 5:4; Isaiah 55:9–10). According to
Genesis 1:6–8, God made a dome (rendered
as “firmament,” “expanse,” or “vault” in
other English translations) separating the
waters of the sea from the waters above the
dome or atmosphere (see also Psalm 148:4).
Genesis 7:11 says this reservoir above the
dome was a major source of the flood
waters; the other source was subterranean
waters upon which the dry land of the earth
was supported by the “foundation” and
“bases” of the earth (Job 38:4–6; Psalm
102:25; 104:5). Apocalyptic works like 1
Enoch (chapters 72–82) devote much atten-
tion to how the wind, rain, snow, sleet, and
hail fall upon the earth through windows in
this atmospheric dome.
 The second heaven refers to the celestial
heaven: the planets, sun, moon, and stars
(Genesis 15:5; Matthew 24:29). This is the
realm of outer space. 1 Enoch (chapters
72–82) also goes into great detail about how
the sun, moon, and stars move across the
second heaven and appear through various
portals in the dome below. Their move-
ments occur in a predetermined sequence,
thus causing the daily, monthly, and yearly
cycles of life.
 The third heaven is above the first two.
There, God resides on his throne, sur-
rounded by his angelic retinue. The Apostle
Paul says he “was caught up to the third
heaven” in a vision (2 Corinthians 12:1–4).
It’s this latter meaning that’s most often in
view in John’s visions. For example, he, too,
is caught up to the third heaven in
Revelation 4:1, because there he’s able to
view the throne room (Rev. 4:2–5:14).
Occasionally, however, John refers to
heaven in the sense of meanings one or two
(see 8:13, 14:6, and possibly 10:6).
Despite its nonscientific understanding, the bib-
lical notion of multiple heavens adequately
depicts God’s relation to his creation. After all,
even sophisticated astrophysicists still speak
about beautiful “sunsets”! The Bible affirms
that God “made heaven, the heaven of heavens,
with all their host, the earth and all that is on it,
the seas and all that is in them” (Nehemiah 9:6;
see also Genesis 1:1; 14:19; Psalms 8, 19; John
1:1–3; Colossians 1:15–20). Not only did he make
all things, but he also sustains all things.
Furthermore, he intends to recreate all things
for his own glory (2 Peter 3:13). 

Scrapping the old world
John merely states that the first heaven and earth pass away without explaining
how this actually happens. The Apostle Peter, on the other hand, provides a
graphic description of the end, which is the culmination of the judgments poured
out on the earth described earlier in Revelation (see Chapters 10–13). Peter
writes, “But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will
pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and
the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed. [. . .] The heavens
will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire” 
(2 Peter 3:10).
Some speculate that this kind of global wipeout results from a human-inflicted
nuclear mishap or perhaps even from a gigantic meteor strike. This is unlikely.
From his Jewish background, John knows that God spoke the original world
into existence ex nihilo (out of nothing). In this regard, see Genesis 1, in which
God creates simply by voicing a command (see also Hebrews 11:3). So bringing
the old world to an end and recreating a new world is no big deal for God!
Reaching the end of the sea
Some wish John had spent more time describing the new creation. What he
says is tantalizing, but it raises as many questions as it answers. John says
simply, “The sea was no more” (Rev. 21:1). What does this mean? Does the
new earth lack oceans, a feature distinguishing the present earth from all
known planets?
Taken literally, the new earth radically differs from the old, increasing the amount
of land available by almost 2.5 times (because approximately 71 percent of
the earth’s surface is presently covered in water). And perhaps this is what
John intends to say. If so, it suggests a very large number of God’s people and
a very spacious dwelling place (see John 14:2; Revelation 7:9).
On the other hand, apocalyptic writings frequently describe the sea in figurative
terms. In some poetic passages in the Old Testament, the sea is likened to the
primeval chaos — the earliest period of earth history — and speaks of that
which is restless and unruly (see Genesis 1:2; Job 16:12; Psalms 74:13, 89:9,
107:23–29). John has already spoken of the sea as the source of the dragon’s
great counterfeit: the beast, or Antichrist (Rev. 13:1). Perhaps, then, John’s
statement is just another way of saying that all that’s potentially threatening is
no longer present in the new creation.

Chapter 14: Seeing the New Jerusalem and a Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)

Making a fresh start
Long before John’s vision on Patmos, the Old Testament prophet Isaiah foresaw
a new heavens and a new earth. As a matter of fact, the Apostle John almost
certainly borrows some of Isaiah’s language and imagery. In a key passage,
Isaiah speaks in the name of the Lord himself: “For I am about to create new
heavens and a new earth; the former things shall not be remembered or come
to mind” (Isaiah 65:17; see also 66:22–23).
Another key Isaiah text depicts a wonderfully transformed world order: “In
days to come the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established as the
highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills” (Isaiah 2:1).
Jerusalem becomes a magnet for world pilgrimage and worship. The nations
cease their warfare, and the Lord arbitrates their disputes (Isaiah 2:3–4).
276
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
Not just another makeover?
You may wonder why God has to make a new
creation. Couldn’t he simply fix up the old one?
In fact, some theologians think renovation is
precisely what God does. On this understand-
ing, the dissolving of the elements that Peter
mentions in 2 Peter 3:10 doesn’t mean matter
disappears; rather, matter is reconstituted or
reconfigured. (By the way, Peter isn’t thinking of
the modern periodic table when he refers to the
elements. Rather, he assumes the ancient Greek
notion, widely accepted in the Near East by the
first century, that the world is made up of four
fundamental “elements” — earth, fire, water,
and air. At any rate, Peter’s point is that the pre-
sent world is seriously flawed.)
The list of things gone wrong in the world is
deeply disturbing: war, ethnic cleansing, geno-
cide, murder, theft, robbery, rape, injustice, dis-
honesty, pollution, waste, exploitation, greed,
poverty, starvation, indifference, selfishness —
and on and on. The Old Testament prophets
were right: The created order suffers because
of human sin (Isaiah 24:4–13).
The magnitude of evil is such that only a brand
new creation is appropriate for the redeemed
people of God. The Apostle Paul personifies the
created order and depicts it as longing to be set
free from its bondage:
“For the creation waits with eager longing
for the revealing of the children of God; for
the creation was subjected to futility, not of
its own will but by the will of the one who
subjected it, in hope that the creation itself
will be set free from its bondage to decay
and will obtain the freedom of the glory of
the children of God. We know that the
whole creation has been groaning in labor
pains until now. [. . .]” (Romans 8:20–22)
Apocalyptic thought, clearly reflected in the
New Testament and especially the book of
Revelation, radiates with a long-term optimism:
God restores the fallen world to a pristine state.
In fact, he does better than that — he recreates
a perfect world.

Yet another passage from Isaiah describes the Messiah, the great descendant
of the house of Jesse, and his righteous reign over the earth. Remarkably, his
reign transforms even the animal kingdom:
“The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid,
the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead
them. The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down
together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall
play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on
the adder’s den. They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain;
for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the water cover
the sea.” (Isaiah 11:6–9)
If you take this passage literally, even the predatory cycle of nature (the big
ones just eat the little ones) is transformed. Some theologians believe that
before Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the garden’s natural animal order
was not lion-eat-sheep. On this view, the new earth reinstates the primeval,
non-violent character of the garden of Eden. On the other hand, Isaiah may
simply be employing figurative language in order to depict sweeping, moral
transformation in the human sphere. Either way, it highlights the radical
newness of the new earth.
Welcoming a city from the sky
Immediately after his cryptic statement “the sea was no more” (Rev. 21:1),
John’s attention is totally absorbed by a truly awesome scene. Almost like a
spacecraft coming in for a landing, the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descends
upon planet earth (see Figure 14-1). John is quite clear about it: It comes “down
out of heaven from God” (Rev. 21:2). This rings a bell. In John’s Gospel, Jesus
reassures his distressed disciples that he is going away to prepare a place for
them (John 14:3). That “place” is doubtless the new Jerusalem that John now
sees and describes in Revelation 21. The really significant thing to note in
Revelation 21 is where the new Jerusalem finally docks. John’s city isn’t up
there in space, nor does it orbit planet earth. It comes down to the new earth.

In heaven or on earth?
A new earth with a new Jerusalem raises some questions regarding where
believers will end up. Will they be up in heaven, or will they take up residence
down on the new earth? The New Testament is somewhat ambiguous on this
point and so, not surprisingly, Christian theologians arrive at different positions:
 Many hold that believers spend eternity in heaven with God, the Lamb,
and the holy angels. Biblical support for this view comes primarily from
the Apostle Paul’s letters. In two passages, he sketches a scenario in
which, at death, the believer passes immediately into the presence of
Jesus in heaven:
“For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed [a
metaphorical expression for death], we have a building from God,
a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. [. . .] We
would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.”
(2 Corinthians 5:1–8)
“[. . .] My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far
better. [. . .] But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there
that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Philippians
1:23; 3:20)

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Thus, many theologians assume that Christians spend eternity in heaven,
a view similar to that found in a Jewish apocalyptic writing called 2 Baruch.
This is by far the majority view among Christians. It’s often embellished
by incorporating the mention of harps in the book of Revelation
(Rev. 14:2, 15:2). Popular culture encourages all sorts of supposed
delights for this celestial jam session!
 Others think believers spend eternity on a new earth. In this view, the
passages cited from Paul’s epistles refer not to the eternal state but to
an intermediate state that gives way to an eternal reign with Jesus on a
new earth, either at the Second Coming of Jesus (amillennialism) or after
the Millennium (premillennialism and postmillennialism). Evidence from
Revelation in support of this is in the passage describing the fifth seal.
There, disembodied souls of the martyrs are depicted under the heavenly
altar and are very much conscious of what is going on (Rev. 6:9–11).
Furthermore, this view is in keeping with Jewish apocalyptic writings
like Jubilees and 4 Ezra, in which a new Jerusalem descends from heaven
and replaces the old Jerusalem.
We think the latter view better fits all the evidence. Paul argues in 1 Corinthians 15
that God intends to raise up believers in physical bodies, even if those bodies
are considerably souped-up versions (1 Corinthians 15:42–49)! It’s hard to
imagine why God bothers to bestow new bodies for a purely heavenly exis-
tence. Life on a new earth is more in line with the original creation mandate
to rule over earth (Genesis 1:26–30) and the this-worldly prophetic vision of
the new heavens and new earth in Isaiah 65:17–25 and books of other Old
Testament prophets (see Amos 9:13–15 and Jeremiah 31). In short, the popu-
lar view probably owes more to Plato, with his disdain for the material, than
to the Bible.
Getting ready to see the bride
John uses what may seem like an odd image to describe the holy city as it
descends, saying it’s “prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (Rev. 21:2).
The original recipients of John’s Revelation would’ve readily understood this
description.
The Old Testament occasionally compares Israel to the bride of the Lord (see
Isaiah 62:5; Jeremiah 3:1–13; Ezekiel 16:6–14). A marriage bond or covenant
shares many similarities with the covenant the Lord made with Israel at
Mount Sinai (Exodus 19 and 24); in both cases, mutual obligations must be
fulfilled. One prophet, Hosea, who divorced his wife Gomer for unfaithfulness,
uses his own crisis as a powerful metaphor to describe how Yahweh is also
going to divorce Israel for her covenant unfaithfulness (Hosea 1–2). Thankfully,
Hosea prophesies that, in the end, Yahweh takes Israel back and reconciles
with her (Hosea 3).

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
God’s city
In the Bible, human beings’ desire to form a soci-
ety began shortly after the fall into sin and the
consequent alienation from God (Genesis 3–11).
To compensate for his rejection by his fellow
humans, Cain built a city (Genesis 4:12–17).
Following the great flood of Noah (Genesis 7–8),
the descendants of Noah came together to build
the great city of Babel (Genesis 11:4) as an act of
defiance against God’s command to disperse and
replenish the earth (Genesis 9:1–7).
These early attempts to create community were
followed by an endless succession of great cities:
Nineveh, “that great city,” (Jonah 1:2); Babylon,
of which Nebuchadnezzar boasts, “Is this not
magnificent Babylon, which I have built as a royal
capital by my mighty power and for my glorious
majesty?” (Daniel 4:30); Athens, the cradle of
democracy and taproot of Western civilization;
and Rome, boasting over 1 million inhabitants and
the lens through which the Apostle John depicts
mystery Babylon, the great whore. Today, the
global community is dominated by sprawling met-
ropolitan centers, the top 20 all exceeding 10 mil-
lion persons. A new word was coined to describe
this modern phenomenon: the megacity. Human
aspirations haven’t changed all that much! Still,
none of these attempts succeeded in building the
truly great society.
The Bible refers to another city, a city that God
is building. The letter to the Hebrews describes
this city in these words:
“But you have come to Mount Zion and to
the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in
festal gathering, and to the assembly of the
firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to
God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the
righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the
mediator of a new covenant, and to the
sprinkled blood that speaks a better word
than the blood of Abel.” (Hebrews 12:22–24)
The Apostle Paul reminds his Gentile converts
in Galatia that they belong “to the Jerusalem
above; she is free, and she is our mother”
(Galatians 4:26). He also alludes to this when
writing to the Philippians: “But our citizenship is
in heaven, and it is from there that we are
expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ”
(Philippians 3:20). In both of these texts, Paul
views Jerusalem as a heavenly reality to which
people belong, even though it hasn’t yet
descended to earth. He makes the same point
in Colossians 3:3 without explicitly mentioning
the heavenly Jerusalem: “[. . .] For you have
died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ who is your life is revealed, then
you also will be revealed with him in glory.”
The church father Augustine, in the fourth cen-
tury, wrote a book entitled City of God, contrast-
ing the human attempt to build community with
God’s great building project. Augustine’s thesis
is this: Christians don’t truly belong to this world;
they’re part of the community of faith having its
citizenship in heaven. This is the ultimate desti-
nation of believers, and this idea must shape
values and behavior. John Bunyan, the Baptist
minister imprisoned for being a non-conformist
to the Church of England, also captured this
vision in The Pilgrim’s Progress. All these believ-
ers testified that God is creating a community of
redeemed people who fully experience what it
means to be part of a truly great society.

The New Testament likewise presents the spiritual relationship between the
Lord and his redeemed people in marital terms (1 Corinthians 11:2). The
most notable instance is in Paul’s famous passage about Christian marriage
in Ephesians 5:25–32, where the church is likened to the bride of Christ. In
order to be the bride of Jesus, however, the church must dress the part —
that is, reflect the requisite virtues worthy of Jesus’s bride.
The word adorned, in Greek, is the word from which English speakers get the
word cosmetics. Of course, in Revelation, John envisions a Jewish wedding in
which the adorning of the bride is a very costly and elaborate affair. Much time
is given over to the preparation of her appearance, apparel, and accessories.
Her complexion must shine with a luster like marble. Her hair is braided and
interwoven with jewels, gold, and pearls. She is decked with all the precious
stones and gems that the family inherited from previous generations and, if
need be, borrowed from friends and neighbors. The bride leaves her father’s
house in all her finery, with a crown on her head and perfume wafting about
her person.
John couldn’t have chosen a better way to describe the splendor of the holy
city. The prophet Isaiah depicts the Lord’s bride in similar terms: “[The Lord]
has clothed me with the garments of salvation [. . .] as a bride adorns herself
with her jewels” (Isaiah 61:10). The Apostle Paul rhapsodizes on the church as
the bride of Jesus in these words: “[. . .] so as to present the church to himself
[Jesus] in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind — yes, so
that she may be holy and without blemish” (Ephesians 5:27).
Moving in with God
In the new world order, God is continuously and intimately present — and
that sort of closeness hasn’t happened since God walked with Adam and Eve
in the garden of Eden (and Jesus walked the earth). John says simply, “See,
the home of God is among mortals. He will dwell with them; they will be his
people and God himself will be with them” (Rev. 21:3). This encounter is
sometimes called the beatific vision because of its utter bliss and blessed-
ness. Clearly, this city is not so much a place as it is a community.
The progression in John’s thought is significant. First, he says that the “home
of God is among mortals.” This contrasts with earlier phases of redemptive
history, in which the degree of closeness was markedly less. After being kicked
out of the garden of Eden, the first human couple no longer had daily visits
with God “at the time of the evening breeze” (Genesis 3:8). Instead, during the
primeval era (the early period of earth history, as recorded in Genesis 4–11)
and the patriarchal era (the time of the founding fathers of the Israelites in the
second millennium BCE, as recorded in Genesis 12–50), there were infrequent
theophanies, appearances or manifestations of God through heavenly represen-
tatives, in dreams or visions, and so on.
281
Chapter 14: Seeing the New Jerusalem and a Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)

But then, the Bible says, a child is born to a Jewish virgin in Bethlehem (around 6
or 5 BCE). He is a descendant of King David and is named Jesus, meaning “the
Lord saves.” John offers the theological meaning of this birth in his Gospel: “And
the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory
as of a father’s own son, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). Note that the Greek
word translated as “lived” in John 1:14 is the same Greek word that’s translated
as “dwell” in Revelation 21:3. A very literal rendering of this Greek word would be
he tabernacled among us. For John’s original readers, the connection to the Old
Testament Tabernacle (the portable tent Moses erected in the Sinai desert to
house the Ark of the Covenant, as recorded in Exodus 25–40) and this new
Temple is unmistakable. (See Chapter 10 for more on the Ark of the Covenant.)
Enjoying a new existence
John notes that life in the new world (whether it’s in heaven or on earth) is
radically different and way better. He states that crying and pain end and that
water (better than bottled!) is freely available, and people can enjoy a special
inheritance.
Relishing the end of suffering
Characteristics of life as you now know it are banished from the new earth
and the new Jerusalem (Rev. 21:4):
 No more death: For many, death is the ultimate human tragedy. Why
must loved ones be taken away? Why can’t we continue to live with the
vitality and energy of youth? The author of the Old Testament book of
Ecclesiastes claims, “All go to one place; all are from the dust, and all turn
to dust again” (Ecclesiastes 3:20). But that’s not the end of the story, says
John: Death will be no more!
 No more mourning or crying: Tears speak of the whole array of human
tragedy. Grief, rejection, failure, disappointment, frustration, suffering,
and persecution characterize life outside the Garden of Eden. Who
knows how many tears have been shed during the long, dark night of
human history? Once again, Ecclesiastes gives expression to the human
condition: “Again, I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the
sun. Look, the tears of the oppressed — with no one to comfort them!”
(Ecclesiastes 4:1). Thankfully, human responses to tragedy are no longer
needed in the new world order.
 No more pain: The word John uses for pain is typically used in Scripture
to refer to hard, exhausting work. It’s labor so strenuous it saps all one’s
strength. It’s the kind of toil the Israelites experienced during their
bondage in Egypt (Exodus 1:13–14).
282
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

But John may also mean that physical pain itself no longer exists. If so,
this points to a radically different kind of existence after the resurrection.
In the present, earthly bodies, pain is essential to long-term survival.
Without it, people would be unaware of many life-threatening situations.
But with immortal bodies (1 Corinthians 15:42–44), this is no longer an
issue. (The superiority of the spiritual body that the Apostle Paul
describes sounds better and better with each passing year to those of us
who are part of the AARP crowd!)
Having a drink
John fastens on one fundamental human need that answers the question of
death. In Revelation 21:6, the one on the throne says, “To the thirsty I will
give water as a gift from the spring of the water of life.” This metaphor has
deep roots in the Old Testament and in the teaching of Jesus. Isaiah the
prophet is the root of this idea. In a short hymn, the prophet portrays
redeemed Israel in this word picture: “With joy you will draw water from the
wells of salvation” (Isaiah 12:3). In a generally arid land, where water was
often a matter of life and death (Isaiah 21:14), it’s no surprise that water
becomes a symbol of spiritual life.
In John’s Gospel, Jesus tells a Samaritan woman he can give her “living water”
(John 4:10). To her bewildered response, Jesus adds, “The water that I will give
will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life” (John 4:14). No
wonder she jumps at the chance!
The supreme moment in which Jesus employs the symbol of water occurs
during the festival of Booths in Jerusalem (John 7:1–43). This feast included a
seven-day ritual in which the priest carried a golden pitcher of water from
the Pool of Siloam up to the Temple. This was a reminder of the miraculous
supply of water when the Israelites wandered in the wilderness (Exodus
17:1–5). Dramatically, on the last day of the festival, Jesus cries out to the
assembled multitudes, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and let the one
who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said, ‘Out of the believer’s
heart shall flow rivers of living water’” (John 7:37–38). Living water symbol-
izes eternal life, and this is what John is referring to in Revelation 21:6. All
inhabitants of the new Jerusalem possess this inexhaustible resource.
Inheriting an eternal treasure
John declares, “Those who conquer will inherit these things, and I will be their
God and they will be my children” (Rev. 21:7). “These things” affirms all the
items previously mentioned: the banishment of all evil and the presence of all
that’s truly good. The ultimate heritage of believers is belonging to God’s
family (Romans 8:14–17).
And what happens to those who aren’t part of this inheritance? There are
some sad consequences. We discuss the issue of judgment in more detail in
Chapter 13.
283
Chapter 14: Seeing the New Jerusalem and a Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)

Taking a Virtual Tour of the New
Jerusalem (21:9–27)
Time for a virtual tour of this new city! Most interpreters of the book of
Revelation recognize that John’s description, although it conveys spiritual
realities, shouldn’t be squeezed into a literal mold; symbolism and imagery
abound. We don’t mean to deny that John has a real city in mind; however,
readers should acknowledge that he employs stock images from the apoca-
lyptic thesaurus in order to depict certain features of this city that are espe-
cially noteworthy, such as splendor, security, and sanctity.
An angel John has seen before takes him on a tour of the new Jerusalem,
called “the bride, the wife of the Lamb” (Rev. 21:9). The contrast of Jerusalem
(the Lamb’s bride) with “Babylon the great, mother of whores and of earth’s
abominations” (17:5) is deliberate. The two images symbolize two opposing
societies. Their completely different stories dominate Revelation 17–22.
John is caught up by the Spirit in order to get a good look at the holy city. In
accordance with apocalyptic conventions (see Ezekiel 40:2; 1 Enoch 17:2), the
seer is whisked off to a high mountain that provides a spectacular viewpoint.
From there, he watches the holy city descending from heaven to the earth
and provides a detailed description.
His first impression of the city is its glory, its sheer radiance. The city pos-
sesses a luminescence that overwhelms the senses; it’s the ultimate “crystal
cathedral”! John resorts to mentioning precious gems and jewels in order to
convey the splendor of the new Jerusalem.
284
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 
The end-all, be-all, from A to Z
Three times, the book of Revelation uses the
divine title “Alpha and Omega.” In Revelation 1:8,
it refers to God the Father. In Revelation 21:6 and
22:13, it indicates Jesus. So what does it mean?
Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet,
from which we get the English letter a. Omega
is the last of the 24 letters in the Greek alphabet
and is equivalent to the English o. In English,
when you want to speak of the entire range of
possibilities, you can use the expression from A
to Z. In Greek, you can express that same idea
as alpha and omega. When coupled with “first
and last,” and “the beginning and the end,” the
meaning is something like this: that which com-
prehends and contains everything else. In this
case, that something is someone. The Bible
says only God is before and after all things and
is the source of all that is (see 1 Corinthians 8:6).
What’s important in applying this title to Jesus
is the implication that all that God is, Jesus is. In
short, this title affirms the full deity of Jesus.

This section examines the city, including its gates, foundations, and walls.
John dutifully records the height, number, names, measurements, and materi-
als used in their construction.
Admiring the architecture: Walls, 
gates, and foundations
The city itself is surrounded by a massive wall built on 12 foundations and
entered by 12 gates. The gates are named after each of the 12 tribes of Israel,
and the foundations are named after the 12 Apostles. Taken together, the gates
and foundations emphasize the continuity and unity of the people of God.
In the book of Exodus, 12 pillars are set up at the foot of Mount Sinai to repre-
sent each of the tribes of Israel as part of the covenant ratification ceremony
(24:4). In the wilderness, the Tabernacle forms the center of the Israelite
camp. Arrayed around it in a specific order are the 12 tribes, three on each
side (Numbers 2:1–34). A portion of the land of Canaan is distributed to each
tribe after the conquest (Joshua 13–17). The fact that there are 12 gates
named after each of the 12 tribes of Israel conveys a clear theological mes-
sage in Revelation: The Old Testament people of God, the 12 tribes of Israel,
are a vital part of the new Jerusalem. Those who put their trust in the God of
Israel will be there.
The 12 foundations are named in honor of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb. The
12 Apostles were the appointed successors of Jesus, the guardians of the
gospel. Paul wrote that believers in Jesus are “built upon the foundation of
the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In
him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple
in the Lord [. . .]” (Ephesians 2:20–21).
Siege warfare often involved undermining the foundations of walls. City walls
are only as strong as their foundations, so builders put enormous effort into
constructing walls on solid bedrock. Thus, the 12 foundations memorialize
the role of the Apostles and attest to their strength.
Considering dimensions and shape
The city is a massive cube with all streets intersecting at right angles. Its
dimensions are 1,500 miles in length, width, and breadth. (This is the English
equivalent of the Greek expression “twelve thousand stadia.” The NRSV thus
obscures the fact that another 12 actually occurs in the Greek text.) The
thickness of the walls is 144 cubits (about 216 feet), which is 122.
285
Chapter 14: Seeing the New Jerusalem and a Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)

The cube, composed of perfect squares, features prominently in biblical history.
The Holy of Holies (inner sanctuary) of the Tabernacle constructed in the
wilderness was a cube, being about 15 feet in each dimension (Exodus 26). In
Solomon’s Temple, the Holy of Holies was also a cube (20 cubits, or 30 feet 
in each dimension). In Ezekiel’s vision of a new Temple, the Holy of Holies
was 34 feet per side (Ezekiel 41:3–4).
What’s so radically different about John’s vision is that the entire city is a cube.
In theological terms, the city of God, which is also the bride of Jesus, is where
God himself dwells with his people. The cubic nature of the new Jerusalem
symbolically proclaims its perfection. What John portrays symbolically, Paul
describes metaphorically by comparing believers to a “holy temple in the
Lord” (Ephesians 2:21–22).
Scoping out the building materials
John’s description of the city defies precise analysis. Although the wall is
built of jasper, the city itself is composed of translucent gold. Added to that,
each of the 12 foundations is adorned with 12 different precious stones, and
the 12 gates consist entirely of gigantic, single pearls. The streets, like the
city, are “pure gold, transparent as glass” (21:21). John’s language symbolizes
spiritual realities.
In the Old Testament and Apocrypha, precious stones provide a standard
recipe for depicting splendor and glory. Isaiah the prophet describes a
restored Jerusalem in the following way: “I am about to set your stones in
antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires. I will make your pinna-
cles of rubies, your gates of jewels, and all your wall of precious stones”
(Isaiah 54:11–12).

Apocrypha: Now where’d we put those books?
The Apocrypha, a word meaning “hidden or
esoteric,” refers to 14 books appearing in the
Old Testament portion of Roman Catholic and
Greek Orthodox Bibles. The Roman Catholic
Church recognizes 11 of them as canonical —
that is, as inspired and authoritative. Protestants
admit none of the 14 to the canon of Scripture.
Palestinian Jewish rabbis didn’t reckon these
works as inspired Scripture, and thus, they don’t
appear in the Hebrew Bible. Protestants accept
this determination as valid, though many (such
as Martin Luther) acknowledge that the apoc-
ryphal works contain enriching material.

The prophet Ezekiel, in a funeral song over the fall of the king of Tyre, compares
the deposed dictator to a cherub (an angelic being) in Paradise before its fall
from grace. Consider the description of his splendor: “You were in Eden, the
garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, carnelian, chrysolite,
and moonstone, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald; and
worked in gold were your settings and your engravings” (Ezekiel 28:13).
In the apocryphal book of Tobit, dating to about the third century BCE, the
anonymous author describes Jerusalem’s future greatness and glory in these
terms: “The gates of Jerusalem will be built with sapphire and emerald and all
your walls with precious stones. The towers of Jerusalem will be built with
gold, and their battlements with pure gold. The streets of Jerusalem will be
paved with ruby and with the stones of Ophir” (Tobit 13:16).
One more piece of information fills out the picture. The 12 stones of the foun-
dations seem modeled after the breastplate worn by the Israelite high priest,
according to the description of it in Exodus 28:15–20. After detailing the 12 dif-
ferent precious stones, the text concludes by saying, “There shall be 12 stones
with names corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they shall be like
signets, each engraved with its name, for the 12 tribes” (Exodus 18:21).
John’s description of the holy city is especially indebted to the breastplate.
The new Jerusalem is a priestly city, and all the people of God — the 12 tribes,
the new Israel — are priests of God, precisely what Jesus intended for the fel-
lowship of the Lamb: “To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his
blood, and made us to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father [. . .]”
(Rev. 1:5–6, emphasis ours). View the precious stones in light of this symbolism.
Recognizing what’s not there
The new Jerusalem is defined as much by what isn’t there as by what is.
Revelation 21:22–22:5 details five items or groups of items that aren’t there.
When you add these five to the two that John has already mentioned, you
arrive, not surprisingly, at the magic number seven: The city is the epitome of
perfection! Here’s the complete list:
 No sea (21:1)
 No death, mourning, crying, or pain (21:4)
 No Temple (21:22)
 No need of sun and moon (21:23)
 No night (21:25)
 Nothing unclean (21:27)
 No curse (22:3)
287
Chapter 14: Seeing the New Jerusalem and a Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)

The lack of a Temple is quite surprising because the Temple was central to
Jewish tradition. The Apostles Paul and Peter both use Temple imagery to
describe the present church (1 Corinthians 3:16–17, 6:19; 2 Corinthians 6:16;
Ephesians 2:21; 1 Peter 2:5). The Old Testament prophet Ezekiel spends eight
chapters describing and extolling the glories of a third Temple he seems to
envision on the site of the first and second Temples (Ezekiel 40–48).
The first Temple was built by Solomon, and it stood from about 970 BCE until
it was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BCE. The second Temple was
dedicated in 517 BCE and was greatly enlarged and enhanced by Herod the
Great beginning in 20 BCE. The Romans destroyed the second Temple in 70
CE, near the end of the first Jewish revolt against Rome, only some 20 years
before John wrote the book of Revelation. In Jewish literature of this period,
prayers for a new and glorious Temple appear frequently.
Furthermore, in the book of Revelation, the conquerors in Philadelphia are
promised, “I will make you a pillar in the temple of my God; you will never go
out of it” (Rev. 3:21). And Revelation includes numerous references to a heav-
enly Temple (7:15, 11:19, 14:15, 15:5–8, 16:1, 16:17); most people would just
assume that it must have a counterpart in the new Jerusalem. Consequently,
it’s unexpected that the new Jerusalem lacks one. On the other hand, John’s
explanation makes perfect sense: There’s no Temple building because all that
the Temple stood for in the past is now realized by the very presence of God:
“Its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb” (21:22). God dwells
with his people face to face.
Item four is also hard to imagine: no more sun or moon! The city is so suffused
with glory it actually illuminates itself. The glory of God and the Lamb are a
perpetual source of light (Daniel 12:3; 2 Thessalonians 1:10; Romans 8:30; 2
Corinthians 3:18). Add to that, there’s no more night. Physicists and cosmolo-
gists may speculate about how the new earth operates, but in the end, John’s
explanation suffices: “The first things have passed away” (Rev. 21:4).
Coming Home to the Garden (22:1–6)
The culmination of the vision Jesus gave to John is like stepping back into the
garden of Eden — only it’s better than the original. The long, dark night of
banishment is over at last; cherubim no longer guard the garden’s entrance
with a flaming sword (Genesis 3:24). If you’re a C.S. Lewis fan, you’ll appreci-
ate a comparison to Narnia; the wicked witch of the North is deposed, the
snow melts, and springtime returns!
In this section, we revisit John’s description of Paradise. It features a crystal
clear river with life-giving properties; its banks are lined with 12 kinds of fruit
dispensing healing for the nations. The single most important feature, however,
is the two people who have made it all possible. Planted squarely in the
288
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

middle of the garden is the throne of God and the Lamb, surrounded by their
willing and worshiping servants. Only the redeemed may see them because
only the redeemed are there. And there’s no more night, a fitting metaphor
for salvation.
Dipping into the river of life
In Revelation 22, the first image that the angel points out to John is a river;
and what a river it is! The river symbolizes spiritual life. No innate human
need is more urgently felt and essential than water. The symbolism of this
river is so special it requires further unpacking.
So what’s the source of the mysterious river of life, with its water as bright
and clear as crystal? Right in the very center of the city stands the throne of
God, and this marvelous river flows from it. The theological point is that God
is the true source of life.
The origin of this word picture lies deep in the Old Testament Scriptures. In
the book of Genesis, the narrator explains that “a river flows out of Eden to
water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches”
(2:10). John’s new Jerusalem incorporates features of the garden of Eden; in
other words, biblical history comes full circle. Genesis 2–3 and Revelation
21–22 are like bookends, framing redemptive history between them — or to
change the analogy, they’re like two massive towers of a bridge on opposite
banks of a river, suspending the roadway between them. Apocalyptic thought
often includes the hope of a return to the original, pristine world.
But John’s description owes the most to Ezekiel 47:1–12 (see also Joel 3:18).
In this passage, Ezekiel describes a river that springs from beneath the
threshold of a rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem. It flows eastward “below the
south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar” (Ezekiel 47:1).
Particularly striking about Ezekiel’s river is the rapid increase in volume and
depth as it courses its way from the Temple courtyard toward the Dead Sea.
After the river exits the Temple compound on the east side and flows 150
feet, it’s ankle-deep (Ezekiel 47:3). Another 150 feet, and the river is knee-
deep (Ezekiel 47:4). And by the time it’s gone a further 150 feet, the river is
waist-deep (Ezekiel 47:4). Finally, 150 more feet brings Ezekiel to a place
where the river is so deep it “could not be crossed” (Ezekiel 47:5).
No known river increases in volume so rapidly, but this is no ordinary river. It’s
a symbolic river that speaks of God’s power to cleanse the guilt and pollution
of sin, sin that affects not only individuals but the entire universe. In Ezekiel’s
vision, the water transforms the desert into an oasis, and the Dead Sea (so
named because the salt content is so high that only the most highly adapted
organisms live in it), known as the Salt Sea in the Old Testament, is converted
into a sweet-water lake teeming with fish and lined with trees along its shore. In
289
Chapter 14: Seeing the New Jerusalem and a Triumphant Church (21:1–22:6)

fact, an abundance of fruit trees line this channel of life. Ezekiel notes that
“their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail. [. . .] Their fruit will be for
food, and their leaves for healing” (Ezekiel 47:12). John sketches the river of
life in the new Jerusalem using Ezekiel’s vision as template. (See the earlier
section titled “Having a drink” for more details on water symbolism.)
Recovering the tree of life
John’s description of the garden changes Ezekiel’s many trees with fruit
(Ezekiel 47:12) into one tree having 12 kinds of fruit (there’s another 12!) —
one for each month of the year. In short, there are no non-productive months.
John wasn’t the first to come up with the notion of a tree of life. The concept
has a long history going back into antiquity. Ancient Mesopotamia already
gave evidence of a myth about a magic tree that granted life to those fortu-
nate enough to discover and eat its fruit. The Chinese and Egyptian cultures
also gave visual and written evidence of a mythological tree of life. This testi-
fies to longstanding reflection on the human plight and the hope that, some-
how and someway, people may achieve immortality.
John is primarily indebted to the Hebrew story of the Garden of Eden and its two,
most important trees (Genesis 2:8–3:24). In the center of the Garden of Eden is a
tree that provides knowledge of good and evil. Its fruit is off-limits and not to be
eaten — or touched (Genesis 3:3). On the other hand, there’s also the tree of life,
which is accessible. The story of the fall into sin concludes with these words:
“See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil: and now, he
might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live for-
ever” (Genesis 3:22). (Note: The us in this verse is likely either an implied refer-
ence to the Trinity or a council of angelic beings.) To prevent this unthinkable
outcome — living forever in alienation from God, like Satan and the fallen 
angels — Adam and Eve are expelled from the garden and its entrance is sealed.
The tree of life is no longer accessible. Redemption is necessary, and as the book
of Revelation makes clear, the sacrificial death of the Lamb is the remedy.
Against that backdrop, John’s vision brings salvation history to a satisfying
conclusion. The garden is once again open, and all citizens have full and
equal access to the tree of life. And the Lord God resumes his daily walks
with the crown of his creation! “They will see his face, and his name will be
on their foreheads. [. . .] And they will reign forever and ever” (Rev. 22:4).

Promising to Return (22:6–21)
In This Chapter
 Authenticating the message and the messenger

 Warning and inviting unbelievers
 Making the message tamper-resistant
I
n the movie The Terminator (which, by the way, is an End Times story),
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character utters the famous phrase, “I’ll be
back.” In relation to the return of Jesus, that sentiment is the central point of
the closing verses of Revelation.
All good things must come to an end — or must they? As John wraps up his
prophecy, he reminds the faithful of some basic promises Jesus intends to
keep. Not only does Jesus vow to return, but he also promises to reward
everyone’s work. Good will prevail and last forever in the celestial city. The
faithful must hold on because it won’t be long in coming.
In this chapter, you see John recap the essential message of his entire
prophecy. He issues one last invitation to accept the good news of salvation
through Jesus and a stern warning against tampering with the finished prod-
uct. Prophecies are no light matter!
Verifying the Source of the 
Message (22:6–8)
Most Christians generally accept that the entire Bible is a divine revelation.
To examine the research and arguments regarding the authenticity and
authority of the Bible is well beyond the scope of this book. However, what’s
striking is the unshakable conviction of biblical prophets, sages, psalmists,
and the Apostles that God’s word, the Bible, is self-authenticating. Listen to
John’s wording: “These words are trustworthy and true, for the Lord, the God

of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what
must soon take place” (Rev. 22:6).
According to John, God authenticates the message that both comes from and
reveals Jesus. The message is delivered by means of an angel, apparently the
same angel mentioned in a similar capacity in Revelation 1:1. John now adds
his personal stamp of certification to the process: “I, John, am the one who
heard and saw these things” (Rev. 22:8).
Getting to the End on Time (22:7)
In Revelation 22:7, John quotes Jesus as saying, “I am coming soon.” The
problem is that we’re almost 2,000 years removed from the time of Revelation’s
writing and Jesus hasn’t returned yet! For many, Jesus passed the fashionably-
late mark ages ago, and this seeming tardiness may call into question the
credibility of the message. For centuries, people have asked over and over
again, “Is he here yet?”
The Old Testament prophets who spoke of the End-Times Day of the Lord
(see Chapter 3) also describe it as imminent, impending, even threatening.
For example, Isaiah, speaking in the name of God, proclaims, “For soon my
salvation will come, and my deliverance be revealed” (Isaiah 56:1). Through
Ezekiel, the Lord promises “they [the exiled people of Israel] shall soon come
home” (Ezekiel 36:8). Many similar passages make the same point.
The New Testament adopts the same note of imminence about Jesus’s Second
Coming — the day of the Lord Jesus Christ (see Romans 13:12; James 5:8; 1
Peter 4:7; 1 John 2:18). At the very least, there’s a consistency of expectation
between the two Testaments: Both Testaments view the Day of the Lord as
imminent.
So what’s the holdup? Perhaps, as many commentators point out, the real
problem is one of perspective. From humans’ limited point of view, 2,000
years seems incompatible with the notion of imminence. On the other hand,
from God’s eternal perspective, 2,000 years is a mere blip. As the psalmist
says, “For a thousand years in [God’s] sight are like yesterday when it is past”
(Psalm 90:4).
Just about 2,000 years after God promised Abraham that he would have as
many descendants as the stars in the sky (Genesis 15:5, 22:17) and the sand
on the seashore, Jesus appeared on earth and the Christian church was
launched (Galatians 4:4; Acts 1:8; 2:1–47). The Apostle Paul describes those
who believe in Jesus as Abraham’s spiritual children (Romans 4:1–25). It’s
now about 2,000 years after Jesus first walked the earth. We’re not making
any predictions, just pointing out this very interesting fact!
292
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

John himself may well have thought that Jesus would return in his lifetime.
But John doesn’t, nor does any other New Testament spokesperson (not even
Jesus himself! See Matthew 24:36), teach that Jesus will return in the writer’s
lifetime (1 Thessalonians 5:1–11).
The sixth beatitude of Revelation — “Blessed is the one who keeps the words
of the prophecy of this book” (22:7) — returns to the theme of the first bless-
ing (Rev. 1:3). It emphasizes the importance of actually doing what is enjoined
in the book. The first and sixth beatitudes, like bookends, frame the entire
book of Revelation.
Knocking “Other” Worship (22:8–9)
Perhaps as an almost involuntary response to the enormity of all that John
has witnessed, he falls down to worship at the feet of the angelic messenger
(22:8–9). For this he is again curtly reprimanded (see Rev. 19:10).
Some commentators believe that John was so distracted by the awesome-
ness of all he had witnessed that he did what he did without thinking.
Regardless of why John did it, the angel’s reprimand does serve to make a
point to the Christians in Asia Minor, and by extension, all Christians in all
times and places. Only God is to be worshipped — not angels, emperors, or
anyone or anything else in all creation.
Leaving the Scroll Unsealed
(22:10–15)
Many refuse to join the Fellowship of the Lamb. They make their own bed and
now must lie in it. The angel instructs John not to seal the scroll. Let its
contents lie open for inspection and reflection. This stands in contrast to the
book of Daniel (and standard apocalyptic literature), where Daniel is told sev-
eral times to “seal up” his visions in a scroll because they refer “to many days
from now” (Daniel 8:26; see also Daniel 12:4, 9). In the case of John’s message,
the time is short and the churches need to hear the message now.
In antiquity, scrolls were sealed and often stored in jars for safekeeping (see
Chapter 8 for more on scrolls and seals). In Revelation, there’s no need to
reseal the scroll because the churches have immediate need of its message.
In this section, we observe how John begins to draw out the practical impli-
cations of what he has seen in his visions. He spells out what is going to
happen on the day of reckoning. Decisions must be made one way or the
other — one is either for or against the Lamb. The consequences of each
293
Chapter 15: Promising to Return (22:6–21)

person’s choice are mutually exclusive. And God makes no mistakes in the
sorting-out process; the God of eternity, who knows the end from the begin-
ning, dispenses perfect justice.
Making your own choices
At first sight, Revelation 22:11 seems callous: “Let the evildoer still do evil,
and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still
be holy.” Doesn’t God care what people do? Is he really indifferent to whether
or not they repent?
The verse has a proverb-like ring to it. It seems to be saying that most people,
given the shortness of time left, simply won’t change their attitudes and
commitments — they won’t switch horses mid-stream! By this time, those
who have decided against the kingdom are unlikely to have a change of heart;
on the other hand, those who have counted the cost and committed to the
Fellowship of the Lamb are unlikely to opt out — they stay the course 
to the end.
Looking to an eternal judge
Jesus says, “See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according
to everyone’s work. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the
beginning and the end” (Rev. 22:12–13). You hear from the Lamb himself.
The message is crisp and to the point — everyone may expect to be treated
with complete fairness and justice. Each receives precisely what his or her
work merits. At first sight, this message may sound contrary to the New
Testament teaching that salvation is by grace through faith, not works
(Ephesians 2:8–9). The resolution to this seeming contradiction is this:
Genuine faith produces good works (Ephesians 2:10; Galatians 5:6). Lack of
good works points inevitably to lack of saving faith (James 2:14–26). In the
end, there’s no real conflict.
How can the Lamb assume such responsibility? Here’s the short answer: He’s
God. Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and
together, they’re one way of expressing the notion of eternity, an attribute
only God possesses. The Lamb can be an impartial judge because he’s not
subject to the varying opinions of time and place about what constitutes jus-
tice and fairness. From everlasting to everlasting, he knows what’s right and
wrong, just and unjust.
294
Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Reaping reward
The final blessing of Revelation reads, “Blessed are those who wash their robes,
so that they will have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the
gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and
idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood” (Rev. 22:14–15).
This text presents two starkly contrasting outcomes. The first is couched in lan-
guage previously used to describe the new Jerusalem: a return to the Garden of
Eden and access to the tree of life (see Rev. 22:1–3 and Chapter 14). The reward
amounts to everlasting life and unending companionship with the Lamb and the
saints.
Friends forever
Can a state of friendship really exist forever? The Bible says so. On the way to
the garden of Gethsemane, just before Jesus was arrested, the Gospel of John
reports Jesus saying to his disciples, “I do not call you servants any longer,
because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called
you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard
from my Father” (John 15:15). Then a bit later, in what’s often called the high
priestly prayer, Jesus requests, “Father, I desire that these also, whom you
have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory, which you have
given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world” (John
17:24). The duration of the relationship is clearly stated: “This is eternal life”
(John 17:3). For believers in Jesus, this is not just a possibility; they “have the
right to the tree of life” (Rev. 22:14, emphasis ours).
Blood-washed robes, the ticket inside
What qualifies a person to be a friend of Jesus? A familiar metaphor reappears
in Revelation 22:14: Ones’ robes must be washed in the blood of the Lamb. As
seen earlier in the book of Revelation (5:9, 7:14, 12:11, 19:13), this figure of
speech portrays a spiritual transformation. The notion of washing one’s robes
invokes the symbolism of baptism, a cleansing initiation ceremony.
Very early in the Christian church, a special ritual during baptism gave visible
expression to this “washing of one’s robes.” The baptismal candidate came to
the baptismal font and took off his or her outer garment. After being immersed
in the water, the candidate was clothed in a white robe.
Figure 15-1 shows a delicate carving that features three objects: a lamb, a
cross, and a dove. The Lamb has its muzzle inserted into the arm of the
cross, reminding the viewer that the blood of the Jesus the Lamb, voluntarily
shed on a cross, is what washes away sins. The dove is a symbol of the Holy
Spirit and has in its mouth a wreath of victory. The Lamb wins! Every time
Christians celebrate the Lord’s Supper, they “proclaim the Lord’s death until
he comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26).
295
Chapter 15: Promising to Return (22:6–21)

Don’t miss the seventh and final benediction of the book (Rev. 22:14). The
first thing the book of Revelation praises Jesus for doing is freeing “us from
our sins by his blood” (1:5). Fittingly, the book concludes with a blessing upon
those who benefit from that gift. What’s unspoken but assumed in this blessing
is clearly stated in Revelation 7:14 (emphasis ours): “They have washed their
robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”
Facing punishment: The outsiders
Those who reject the Lamb forfeit entrance into the new Jerusalem. The ominous
word outside says it all. As we discuss in Chapter 13, the teaching of final 
punishment is best expressed by the notion of exclusion.
You may wonder, however, who the dogs are in Revelation 22:15. In the book
of Deuteronomy, the Hebrew word for dog is rendered as “male prostitute”
(23:18). This may be what John means. Also, calling someone a dog was a
common insult. It was a term Jews used to refer to Gentiles. Generally, how-
ever, it indicated anyone who was “unclean” by the standards of Jewish ritual
purity laws (as found in the Old Testament books of Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, and Deuteronomy and further expanded and elaborated on in the
Mishnah, a compilation of rabbis’ interpretations of these laws).

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

John doesn’t give a complete listing of those excluded from God’s presence.
After mentioning behaviors widespread in Greco-Roman society — occult
practices and magic, sexual immorality, murder, and idolatry — he inserts a
generalizing description: “and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.”
In many ways, this comes right to the heart of the matter. Paul analyzes
human rebellion in much the same way: “They [Gentiles] exchanged the truth
about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the
Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen” (Romans 1:25).
So how can sinners even be “outside” the city if supposedly they’ve already
been cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15)? Most likely, John is simply using
conventional language to make his point: They won’t, in fact, be there.
And Now, In Conclusion (22:16–21)
The concluding six verses of the book of Revelation accomplish four objectives:
 Authenticating the source of the message
 Inviting the reader or listener to respond to the message
 Warning against tampering with the message
 Wrapping up the entire book
Jesus himself validates John’s message: “It is I, Jesus, who sent my angel to you
with this testimony for the churches” (Rev. 22:16). The immediate audience is
specified as “the churches.” These churches were the seven churches of the
Roman province of Asia and others in the same region (see Chapter 7). The
early Christian church throughout the second and third centuries valued the
book of Revelation and eventually, though not without a few dissenting voices,
officially recognized its place in the canon of Scripture in the fourth century
(see Chapter 1 for further discussion of this issue). Consequently, this book
continues to proclaim “the testimony of Jesus” and summons believers in God
to undivided loyalty.
In this section, we draw attention to John’s finishing flourishes. He wraps up
with a sweeping invitation and a severe warning. Fittingly, John allows Jesus
to have the last word.
Signing the message
Saying, “I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star”
(22:16), Jesus signs off on the revelation given to John, using two titles that
speak to the lineage and nature of Jesus.
297
Chapter 15: Promising to Return (22:6–21)

Jesus, the Son of David
The title “root and descendent of David,” firmly anchors Jesus’s story in the
larger story of Israel by reminding readers that he descends from one of 
the superstars of Hebrew history — David, the shepherd boy, slayer of giants,
and son of Jesse. Both Matthew and Luke include a genealogy showing Jesus’s
lineage from the House of David (Matthew 1:1–18; Luke 3:23–38). Other Bible
passages related to this title include the following:
 “When your [David’s] days are fulfilled and you lie down with your
ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth
from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house
for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. [. . .]
Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me;
your throne shall be established forever.” (2 Samuel 7:12–13, 16)
 “For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon
his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His authority shall grow continually,
and there shall be endless peace for the throne of David and his kingdom.
He will establish and uphold it with justice and with righteousness from
this time onward and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do
this.” (Isaiah 9:6–7)
 “A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow
out of his roots. The spirit of the Lord shall rest on him, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and the fear of the Lord. His delight shall be in the fear of the
Lord. [. . .] On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the
peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.”
(Isaiah 11:1–2, 10; see also Isaiah 55:3)
The prophets Jeremiah (Jeremiah 23:5–6, 30:9, 33:15, 33:21, 33:25–26), Ezekiel
(Ezekiel 34:23–24, 37:24–25), Hosea (Hosea 3:5), and Zechariah (Zechariah
12:7–9) all add distinctive touches to an emerging portrait of a great descen-
dant of David. Psalmists also join the prophetic chorus in heralding this
descendant (Psalms 89:3–4, 89:19–37, 132:11–18).
The Apostle Paul clearly recognizes the portrait they painted. He announces
the gospel of God as “promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy
scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David
according to the flesh [. . .]” (Romans 1:1–3).
Jesus, the bright morning star
The derivation of the “bright morning star” in Revelation 22:16 is not as clear
as that of the connection to David. Because of the brightness of the planet
Venus seen in the morning skies, the Greeks identified Venus with Aphrodite
(goddess of light, love, and beauty), and some commentators think John may
have borrowed from this imagery.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

Others, however, say it probably refers to an Old Testament prophecy. In
Numbers 23–24, the prophet Balaam utters four oracles about the future of
Israel and its relationship to the surrounding countries. The fourth oracle
includes the following passage: “I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not
near — a star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall arise out of Israel...”
(Numbers 24:17). In its context, the prophecy alludes to David who descends
from Judah, one of the 12 sons of Jacob. The scepter speaks of his royal power
as the founder of the Davidic dynasty. Several Jewish apocalyptic texts, predat-
ing the time of Jesus, interpret Numbers 24:17 as a reference to the Messiah.
Among the church fathers, Numbers 24:17 was interpreted as a reference to
Jesus as the promised Messiah. They simply follow in John’s footsteps. Already,
Jesus’s message to the church of Thyatira holds out this reward to those who
keep the faith: “To the one who conquers I will also give the morning star”
(Numbers 2:28). In short, the bright morning star is Jesus himself. The bright-
ness of the morning star probably speaks of the glorified state that consists
of brilliant light.
Invoking and inviting
Revelation 22:17 contains two invocations (calls) and two invitations. Both
sets involve the climax of redemptive history. Jesus appears to be the one
speaking: “The Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come.’”
The Spirit is the Holy Spirit, and the bride is the church, or the Fellowship of
the Lamb. The command come is singular, and it refers to Jesus the bride-
groom. The Holy Spirit and the church — the reclamation project of the Holy
Spirit — are both eager to bring biblical history to its grand consummation.
The bridegroom himself encourages his bride to pray for his soon arrival.
This striking metaphor conveys the spiritual union between Jesus and his
church, mediated by the Holy Spirit.
Jesus urges those who read his prophecy to embrace its central message and
join in the invocation: “And let everyone who hears say, ‘Come.’” This is a
genuinely universal offer of salvation.
The two invocations are followed by two invitations: “And let everyone who
is thirsty come. Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift” (22:17).
These recall similar wording from the prophet Isaiah and from Jesus himself
as recorded in John’s Gospel:
 “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you that have no
money, come, buy and eat!” (Isaiah 55:1)
 “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in
me drink.” (John 7:37; see John 4:13–14)
299
Chapter 15: Promising to Return (22:6–21)

What does it mean to “come and drink”? This word picture conveys the notion
of entering into a worshiping, obedient relationship with the Lord. It recalls the
Lord’s summons to Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and 70 elders of Israel to climb
Mount Sinai and commune with him (Exodus 24). It also recalls Jesus’s invitation
to his listeners during his earthly ministry: “Come to me, all you that are weary
and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon 
you and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest
for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew 11:28–30).
By coming to Jesus — that is, accepting him as Savior and Lord — in the here-
and-now, believers guarantee their eternal place in the there-and-forever.
Warning against tampering
One of the conventions of apocalyptic writings is a severe warning against
alterations and deletions (see 1 Enoch 108:6). John’s apocalypse is no exception:
“I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone
adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book: if
anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take
away that person’s share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are
described in this book.” (22:18–19)
John designates his entire book as a prophecy (see 1:3) even though it also
incorporates a few features of first-century letters and, of course, not a few
features of apocalyptic writings.
Covenant documents (such as testaments, marriage contracts, and national
treaties) also carried weighty sanctions against tampering. In the Old Testament,
the Lord warns against additions and subtractions to the Sinai covenant
(Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32; see also Proverbs 30:5–6). Covenant documents are
of binding authority and are not amended or altered at the whim and fancy of
those who are in possession of them and under its solemn obligations.
John simply makes it clear that any addition to the book or subtraction from
it will bring on some nasty consequences. This is some serious copyright
protection!
Getting a final word from the Lamb
For the third time in Revelation 22, the Lamb promises, “I am coming soon.”
(22:7, 22:12, 22:20). Only this time, there’s one small but significant addition: the
word surely. This translates the little Greek word nai, which, in this context,
indicates a solemn declaration. This is no idle prediction: The Lamb says he
really is coming again.

Part III: Taking a Grand Tour of the Book of Revelation 

The Apostle John attaches his enthusiastic agreement: “Amen. Come, Lord
Jesus!” This affirmative cry from the heart captures the very wording of the
earliest Christians who voiced this prayer in Aramaic, almost certainly the
primary language of Jesus and his Apostles. This little phrase also pops up
(in Greek) in Paul’s letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 16:22). In Aramaic,
it’s two words that you may have seen or heard as one word: marana tha
(“Our Lord, Come!”).
P.S. Be blessed with grace!
Letters from the first century typically conclude with the equivalent of com-
plimentary closings in business letters today. For example, you may append
phrases like Very truly yours, Sincerely yours, Cordially yours, Respectfully yours,
and so forth. On the other hand, a personal letter may end with a closing like
Affectionately yours, All my love, or something similar, depending on the degree
of familiarity between sender and reader.
John’s closing is a grace benediction: “The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all
the saints. Amen” (Rev. 22:21; see also see Romans 16:20; 1 Corinthians 16:23;
2 Corinthians 13:13; Galatians 6:18; Ephesians 6:23; Philippians 4:23; 1
Thessalonians 5:28; and 2 Thessalonians 3:18).
The word grace captures the heart of what the gospel is about: the free,
undeserved intervention of God’s saving power. It’s easy to lose sight of 
the message of grace in the book of Revelation, with its horrific plagues and
terrifying lake of fire. But the overarching message of the book is this: Grace
and mercy triumph over sin and death. The devil and his demons do not have
the last word; the last word belongs to Jesus, the Lamb.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
B
y now, you’ve probably discovered that the special
number of Revelation is seven. For Dummies books
have a special number as well — ten (though it doesn’t
exactly have prophetic significance). That’s why this part
devotes itself to two chapters based on the number ten.
You begin by examining ten of the most common questions
people ask about the end times. Finally, we round out the
book with ten practical guidelines to consider when reading
and interpreting Scripture.

Chapter 16
Ten Common Questions 
about the End Times
In This Chapter
 Understanding what eschatology means
 Defining the seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments
 Making sense of the Tribulation and rapture
 Examining the Millennium and the lake of fire
A
lthough the last book in the Bible is officially titled Revelation, you may
have other names that seem more appropriate (The Book of Confusion?
John’s Letter of Really Intriguing, Perplexing, and Confounding Stuff? Chronicles
of a Bad Acid Trip?). However, as we explain, Revelation need not be a source of
confusion if you get a handle on the symbolism and terminology.
In that light, this chapter is designed to provide you with answers to ten
commonly asked questions people have about the End Times. Then, as you’re
ready, you can dive deeper into these questions at other locations in this book.
(We mention much of the symbolism in terms of futurist, preterist, historicist,
and idealist perspectives; for more on these interpretations, see Chapter 4.)
What Does Eschatology Mean?
The word eschatology originates from two Greek words — eschatos, meaning
“last,” and logos, meaning “subject-matter or teaching.” Eschatology is the study
of last things that are prophesied in the Bible. These final events, primarily
those recorded in Revelation 4–22, include the Tribulation, the return of Christ,
the Millennium, the Last Judgment, Armageddon, and heaven and hell.

What Do the Seals, Trumpets, 
and Bowls Symbolize?
Reference: Revelation 6–16
The seals, trumpets, and bowls symbolize the three stages of a series of events
foretold in Revelation. As Jesus opens the seven seals of a heavenly scroll, an initial
series of earth-rattling events begins to unfold (Rev. 6:1–8:1). A second series of
more-severe events occurs when seven angels play trumpets (Rev. 8:7–11:15).
Finally, seven bowls are poured out to symbolize the final, unrestrained set of
disastrous events (Rev. 16:2–17).
Some commentators believe that the seals, trumpets, and bowls are successive
and progressive events, with one set kicking off the next. Others believe that
these symbols refer to a set of events that occur at the same time.
Here’s how the different schools of interpretation view these symbols:
 Futurists teach that the seals, trumpets, and bowls are the key events
that will transpire in the Tribulation period prior to Jesus’s Second Coming.
 Preterists believe that these events were carried out at the destruction
of Jerusalem in 70 CE.
 Historicists hold that these symbolic events are being carried out
progressively throughout the church age, which is going on now.
 Idealists teach that the seals, trumpets, and bowls are allegories of the nat-
ural disasters and social evils that have existed throughout human history.
See Chapters 9, 10, and 12 for more on the seals, trumpets, and bowls.
What’s the Great Tribulation?
References: Matthew 24:21; Revelation 7:14
The Tribulation, or Great Tribulation, is a short period of intense persecution
of God’s people living on the earth; it’s the time in which the seal, trumpet,
and bowl events of Revelation are carried out:
 Futurism teaches that the Tribulation is a seven-year period just before
the return of Jesus. They usually divide it into two 3.5-year periods. The
first half has restrained oppression and judgment, but the second half is
typified by unrestrained disaster.
306
Part IV: Part of Tens 

 Preterists believe that the Tribulation took place back in the first century
at the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.
 Some historicists think the Tribulation refers to the plight of the Jews
since the first century, including events such as the Holocaust, and
ending with the restored state of Israel in 1948.
 Idealists hold that the Tribulation period symbolizes the suffering that
believers have had to endure throughout history.
See Chapter 13 for details.
What’s the Rapture?
References: 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; Matthew 24:29–31, 24:40–41; 1
Corinthians 15:52
The Bible never actually uses the word rapture in the sense people use it in
respect to Revelation — that is, a sudden, instantaneous taking up of all living
believers into heaven. But the idea isn’t without precedent. In biblical history,
two men experienced a similar phenomenon: Enoch (Genesis 5:24) and Elijah
(2 Kings 2:11). Paul presents this idea in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, where he states,
“Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together
with them to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord forever.”
The End Times rapture is the theory that believers living in the End Times will
be physically removed from the earth and transported directly to heaven.
Futurists and premillennialists hold this view, and they have various theories
concerning the timing of the rapture:
 Pretribulationists (including dispensationalists, whom we discuss in
Chapters 3, 4, and 13) hold that the rapture of the church will occur
before the Tribulation period begins (at Rev. 4:1). By this approach,
people who are believers prior to the rapture will be spared the terrible
Tribulation period. This is the perspective of the Left Behind series.
 Midtribulationists hold that the rapture will occur midway through the
Tribulation.
 Postribulationists argue that the rapture will occur at the end of the
Tribulation, just prior to the Second Coming of Jesus. They hold that the
church will be called upon to persevere through the Tribulation period
and not escape it as pretribulationists believe.
 A final theory is that the rapture is already taking place, albeit in a more
figurative manner.
307
Chapter 16: Ten Common Questions about the End Times

Many within the universal Christian church (including Roman Catholic, Eastern
Orthodox, and some Protestant churches) don’t accept the idea of a literal
rapture. This is true even among some who adhere to a literal interpretation 
of Revelation. These rapture dissenters say that the concept isn’t based on
explicit teaching of Scripture or historical teaching of the early church.
See Chapter 8 for the lowdown on the various views of the rapture.
Who Are the Four Horsemen 
of the Apocalypse?
Reference: Revelation 6:1–7
The four horsemen of the Apocalypse are one of the most familiar images of
Revelation and the end of the world. The horsemen are the ultimate bearers
of bad news and are implementers of nasty events; they’re released when the
Lamb, Jesus, opens the first four seals in Revelation 6. Here’s the lineup:
 The first horseman rides on a white horse. He holds a bow, wears a
crown, and rides out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
 The second horseman rides out on a fiery red horse. He carries a large
sword and is given power to make war.
 The third horseman rides on a black horse. He carries a pair of scales,
denoting scarcity of food and goods.
 The fourth horseman rides out on a pale horse. His rider is Death. The
pale color of the horse represents sickly, deathly, greenish color.
Together, they’re given power over 25 percent of the world to kill through war,
famines, diseases, and other natural disasters. Though the text names only
the fourth horseman, they’re traditionally known as the Conqueror, War,
Famine, and Death.
Opinions differ on whom the first horseman represents. Some suggest that he
is Jesus riding in victory, others view him as a spirit of conquest, and a few
believe that this rider is actually the Antichrist. Preterist idealists believe that
all the horseman are symbolic of the ultimate power of God over evil. Some
preterists argue that the first-century reader would’ve identified the first
horseman as the Parthians, Roman enemies who traditionally rode white
horses into battle.
See Chapter 9 for more on the four horsemen.
308
Part IV: Part of Tens 

Who is the Antichrist?
References: 1 John 2:18, 22, 4:3; 2 John 7; Rev. 13:1–4; Daniel 7:7–8; 2 
Thes. 2:3–4, 2:8–10
In connection with Revelation, the Antichrist (uppercase) is the archenemy of
Jesus and the ultimate false prophet. The Antichrist emerges as a powerful
leader who will deceive the world and defy God. He receives his power directly
from Satan.
Although often associated with the Revelation’s Tribulation period, the term
antichrist (lowercase or uppercase) never appears in Revelation itself. Instead,
it shows up only a handful of times in the epistles of John to label anyone who
attempts to pervert the gospel (good news) of Jesus and lead God’s people into
false doctrines and beliefs. For example, in 1 John 1:7, John writes, “For many
deceivers have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge the
coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.”
Here are the four major interpretations of the Antichrist:
 Futurists believe that the beast from the sea, depicted in Revelation 13,
represents the Antichrist. Others hold that the first horseman (see the
preceding section) represents him.
 Preterists often understand Nero as the Antichrist, or beast.
 Historicists often understood the Antichrist as the Roman papacy, the
office of the pope.
 Idealists don’t identify the beast or Antichrist with a single individual;
rather, he symbolizes the evil socio-political systems of the world.
People often believe numerous other Scriptures point to the Antichrist,
including the fourth beast in Daniel 7, the false Christs that Jesus talks about
in Matthew 24:5, 24:23–24, and the “man of lawlessness” that Paul discusses
in 2 Thessalonians 2:3–4.
See Chapter 11 for the lowdown on the Antichrist.
What’s the Mark of the Beast (666)?
Reference: Revelation 13:16–18
Literal interpretations understand the mark of the beast as a way in which the
false prophet will control the economic system. The mark itself will be placed
on a person’s right hand or forehead and is required in order to buy and sell
309
Chapter 16: Ten Common Questions about the End Times

goods. John clearly states that believers must not receive the mark, because
doing so identifies a person with the beast and defies God (Rev. 14:9–12).
John says in Revelation 13:18 that this mark is the number 666. This number
has brought endless speculation. Some attempts to associate these numbers
with letters of the alphabet have yielded several people as the Antichrist,
including Nero, Hitler, Ronald Reagan, and even Homer Simpson. (Okay, we
made that last one up, but the speculation can get pretty silly at times.)
John refers to 666 as “man’s number.” From a biblical standpoint, seven is
often associated as the perfect number of God, and six is a human number —
something less than perfect. So this implies that six is the number of imper-
fection, or even evil, and that 666 equates to a kind of trinity of evil. It’s at
least an interesting idea.
Here are some major interpretations of the mark:
 Futurists believe that the Antichrist will use the mark of the beast during
the Tribulation as a way to control the economic system of the world.
Theories about how technology could play a part in the beast’s plans
range from computer-chip implants to fingerprint-scanning devices.
 Preterists hold that the mark of the beast refers to the economic perse-
cution that existed against Christians in the first century. Preterists
often associate the beast with Nero.
 Historists traditionally believed that the mark of the beast was being
Roman Catholic and worshipping in Latin.
 Idealists teach that the mark of the beast is a figurative symbol of false
religion.
We believe that if we could definitively explain what 666 means and exactly
pinpoint who the Antichrist is, this book would sell in the zillions! But we
can’t, and neither can anyone else.
If you’d like to know more, turn to Chapter 11.
What’s the Significance 
of the Term Babylon?
References: Revelation 14:8, 16:19, 17:5, 18:2
In Revelation, Babylon symbolizes an organized entity that defies God. A first-
century reader of John’s Revelation would’ve clearly understood the evils of
a symbolic Babylon. Ancient Babylon (a city located in contemporary Iraq)
310
Part IV: Part of Tens 

was a powerful empire in the Old Testament era, and it typified a powerful
society that openly and aggressively defied the God of Israel.
Here are the futurist, preterist, historicist, and idealist takes on Babylon:
 Many futurists hold that Babylon symbolizes an actual city, country, or
political system that will arise in the End Times; it emulates the idolatrous
values of ancient Babylon. Others suggest that Babylon, at least in the first
half of the Tribulation, refers to an apostate (God-defying) religious body,
organized by the Antichrist.
 Preterists have mixed views about the symbol of Babylon. Some argue
that it’s a clear reference to Jerusalem; others believe it refers to Rome.
 Classic historicism holds that Babylon symbolizes the Roman Catholic
Church.
 Idealism maintains that Babylon is a figurative description of human
society organizing itself against God; society attempts to lure people
away from Jesus.
See Chapter 12 for more on Babylon.
What’s the Millennium?
Reference: Revelation 20:1–6
The Millennium is a 1,000-year period that John talks about in the first six verses
of Revelation 20. He tells readers that at the start of this period, Jesus will bind
Satan to prevent him from deceiving nations. After that, Jesus will reign with his
people over the earth.
Three interpretations speculate on what the Millennium refers to:
 Premillennialism holds that John is referring to a literal 1,000 years after
the return of Jesus.
 Amillennialism maintains the Millennium is a figurative term referring to
the extended period between Jesus’s birth and his return to earth.
Instead of a literal reign of Jesus, this view teaches that he is reigning in
heaven and, spiritually, on earth through his church.
 Postmillennialism teaches that the Millennium refers to the church age,
the time between the birth and return of Jesus. This view maintains that
the forces of Satan will eventually be stomped out as the Kingdom of
God extends over the world. As soon as this has been accomplished,
Jesus will return.
See Chapter 13 for more details on the Millennium.
311
Chapter 16: Ten Common Questions about the End Times

What’s the Lake of Fire?
References: Revelation 19:20, 20:10, 20:14–15
Talk about your hot-potato topic! Few people like the idea of being tossed
into a literal lake of fire. However, according to the Bible, the lake of fire is the
final destination for everything evil, including Satan, the beast (Antichrist),
the lost prophet, and everyone except God’s people. John refers to the lake of
fire as the “second death.”
Some believe the lake of fire is not a literal burning lake but that it represents
never-ending physical torture of some kind; others hold it to mean the spiritual
torture of being eternally separated from God. A final group believes the lake of
fire will consume those who enter, and they’ll cease to exist.

Ten Tips for Interpreting Scripture
and Prophecy
In This Chapter
 Why a plain reading of a passage is often the best way to discover its meaning
 Why the context of a passage is so important
 How “fulfilled prophecy” can guide you as you explore Revelation
M
ost modern writing is pretty straightforward. For example, you don’t
have to consult outside references and read commentaries to make
sense of a John Grisham novel. Or when you read the news online, you usually
don’t contact a friend so you can debate the true meaning of the reporter’s
sentences. The goal of most everyday writing is to communicate thoughts,
ideas, stories, and information as clearly as possible.
However, as is true with many ancient texts, the meaning of the Bible isn’t so
easy to understand — even though it’s now in your native language, just like
your morning paper. You encounter a variety of obstacles:
 Translation: The original languages — Hebrew and Greek — are far dif-
ferent in structure, grammar, and idioms from modern English. Therefore,
translating is both an art and science; it depends to some extent on the
person doing the translation.
 Culture: The standards of conduct and presuppositions of the ancient
Middle Eastern culture were radically different from the 21st-century
Western mindset. The reason behind some actions performed or things
left unsaid were obvious to the original readers, but modern readers
may overlook or misinterpret these things.
 Writing style: The types of literary styles used throughout the
Scriptures add a layer of complexity to the text. This is especially true
with the apocalyptic writings, such as Revelation.
Whenever you read Scripture, you need to bridge these obstacles to gain a
proper understanding of the text. Here are ten rules of thumb to help you out.

314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Depend on English Words for
Sorting Out Hidden Meanings
In most Scripture, you can take ordinary words and figures of speech at face
value; you don’t want to be looking for hidden meanings. A plain reading of
the text usually gives you the best sense of the passage. However, according
to some interpreters, the apocalyptic nature of Revelation often makes this
book an exception to the rule.
Look at the words in the Bible in light of the meaning of the original language
(Hebrew or Greek). A study Bible or commentary is a useful tool for diving
into the original meanings of specific words. Online Bible studies and com-
mentaries, such as StudyLight (www.studylight.org) and BibleGateway
(www.biblegateway.com), may be good places to start.
Keep Verses in Context
In the Bible, words, when combined together, often form theological themes
and concepts. Always try to understand these themes in their context so you
can accurately interpret what the author is getting at. You should look at any
theological concept within context of the particular verse it appears in, then
the chapter, the book, and finally the entire Bible.
If you ignore context, then you can come up with some wacky theology. For
example, in one epistle, the Apostle John says that “God is love” (1 John 4:16).
When you examine that concept in context, you realize that John is saying that
an integral part of God’s nature and personality is his love. Yet if you just rip
out that “God is love” idea and don’t look to see how it fits into the overall
picture of Scripture, you can conclude that God is nothing more than a benign,
impersonal force behind the universe, which is not what John intended. In
fact, he was stressing the motivating, driving force of a very personal God.
Look to Other Scripture as a Guide
Scripture always helps shed light on other portions of Scripture. So when
you’re investigating the meaning of a given passage, compare it to related
portions of Scripture. For example, as Chapter 3 discusses, Revelation con-
tains many symbolic references to the Old Testament. In order to fully under-
stand a symbol’s significance in Revelation, you should begin by looking at
the original usage in Daniel, Ezekiel, or elsewhere.

Many Bibles have cross-reference systems located in the margins of the text.
Use them!
Remember the Target Audience
Each portion of Scripture was written for a particular audience in the
author’s day. The more you understand about who these people were, what
their culture was like, and the circumstances in which they lived, the more
you can understand the author’s intent. (For info on John’s world, see
Chapter 2; Chapter 7 discusses Revelation’s intended audience.) A Bible com-
mentary can provide background information to help you better understand
the historical and cultural context of the day.
Look for the Original Meaning
The idea of relativism — what’s true or right is in the mind of the individual —
can creep into the way you interpret Scripture. In other words, instead of
looking at the intended meaning, you can fall into the trap of focusing only on
the relevance or significance of a passage to your life. 
In order to look at the original meaning of the author, you need to view a
given passage from multiple angles. Here are some steps you can take:
 Look at what the text actually says. Look at the original wording as best
as you can. Online tools like StudyLight (www.studylight.org) or a
Greek/Hebrew dictionary can enable you to look at the exact words
used. So, too, modern study Bibles often provide an easy-to-understand
version of this information integrated into the text.
 Get a basic idea of the author’s and book’s historical backdrop. Try to
gain an understanding of what would’ve been in the author’s mind during
his lifetime. To get this info, you can use online Bible resources. Many
study Bibles also provide this information at the start of each book.
Remember that Christians consider all Scripture to be inspired, written with
an intended meaning from God. Therefore, when you read Scripture, your
mission is to discover that meaning. The relevance of that message is always
secondary.
315
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Interpreting Scripture and Prophecy

Identify the Literary Style
The Bible contains a variety of literary styles, including historical, expository,
worship, poetry, prophecy, and apocalyptic. As you read, be aware of the
style of text you’re reading because that can affect interpretation. For instance,
 You can understand expository/explanatory messages, as in Paul’s epistles,
quite literally.
 Poetry, as in Song of Solomon, may contain allusions, similes, and
metaphors that you need to be look at in that context. 
 Apocalyptic literature, such as in Revelation and Ezekiel, needs to be read
with the understanding that the vivid imagery is highly symbolic in nature.
 You should read prophecy, as in Daniel, as important messages from
God to his people.
 Read worship, as in Psalms, as prayers to God, some of which contain
rich symbolism and poetic imagery.
 Historical text, as in Exodus, can be read as a chronicle or narrative of
what happened in ancient history.
Therefore, as you consider the meaning of a particular passage, try to identify
its literary style. A Bible commentary or study Bible is a great resource to
turn to.
Remember that figurative language has always been a natural part of human
communication. Symbolism, metaphors, and figures of speech are present
across the Scriptures, regardless of literary style. However, these are usually
clearly identifiable as such, so you can determine their meaning within the
context.
View Fulfilled Prophecy as a Prototype
Many prophecies, particularly those in the Old Testament, have already been
fulfilled. For example, Daniel or Isaiah foretells a coming judgment on Israel,
and years later, that judgment actually occurs. In fact, probably around one-
half of the prophecies were fulfilled within the timeframe of the Bible itself.
Use these prophecies as signposts to help you better understand how
prophecy in Revelation may be fulfilled. For example, over 400 years before
crucifixion was invented as a means of capital punishment, Zechariah (12:10)
describes the Messiah’s death in language that reflects crucifixion.
316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Try to Pin Down Timelines 
for Fulfillment
Although people are always trying to do so, you’ll never be able to figure out
the exact timing or duration of the fulfillment of a prophecy. In the Old Testament,
some prophecy was fulfilled shortly after being given by the prophet; others took
hundreds of years to transpire, and some still hasn’t been fulfilled.
A plain reading of Old Testament prophecy usually makes it possible to deter-
mine whether the prophet is talking about things happening in the past, the
present, or the future.
Note that Biblical Prophecy Can 
Have Stages of Fulfillment
Many people read prophetic messages and believe that their fulfillment will
occur in one big swoop. Although that’s true in many cases, some prophecies
have multiple stages of fulfillment. Joel 2:28–32, is an example of a “swoop”
prophecy that most commentators believe was fulfilled in Acts 2:17–21. In
contrast, many see that Malachi 4:4–5, is fulfilled through the ministry of John
the Baptist as well as through another prophet in the future (as discussed in
Rev. 11:6).
Consider that Some Biblical 
Prophecy Is Conditional
As you read prophecy in the Bible, keep in mind two types of prophetic
messages. Some prophecy is conditional, dependent upon how humans
respond to God’s calls for repentance and obedience; other prophecy is
unconditional and inevitable. Context can usually help reveal what type of
prophecy you’re reading.

Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Interpreting Scripture and Prophecy

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Appendix
Glossary
allegoricalism: See idealism.
amillennialism: A system of Christian eschatology (End-Times teaching) that
holds that the Millennium depicted in Revelation 20 is not a literal 1,000-year
reign of Jesus on earth. Instead, it symbolizes the current age of the church.
Amillennialists believe the Second Coming of Jesus occurs at the end of the
church age.
angel: A spiritual messenger of God used to carry out God’s purposes.
Antichrist: During the Tribulation, the evil world leader who opposes Jesus
(Rev. 13:1–10).
Apocalypse: A term that sometimes refers to the book of Revelation or to the
end of the world. It’s derived from the Greek word apokalupsis, which means
“an unveiling.”
apocalyptic literature: A genre of writing that’s characteristic of Second Temple
Judaism (around 300 BCE to 200 CE) and the early Christian church. The
apocalyptic style makes heavy use of vivid imagery and symbolism.
apostasy: A desertion of or a departure from one’s faith.
Ark of the Covenant: The sacred chest in which ancient Israel kept the
tablets containing the Ten Commandments.
Armageddon: A geographic location at which the last battle between good
and evil will take place (Rev. 16:16). The term comes from the Hebrew Har
Megiddo, which refers to a hill near the town of Megiddo in modern-day
Israel, a strategic military location that was the site of many ancient battles.
Asia Minor: A peninsula in southwestern Asia that forms the Asian part of
Turkey.
Augustine: One of the great fathers of the early Christian church who lived in
North Africa from 354–430 CE.

Babylon: Originally an ancient city located in what is now Iraq. In Revelation,
John uses Babylon to refer to an organized entity that defies God.
bowl judgments: The final, unrestrained set of judgments that occurs when
angels pour out seven bowls (Rev. 16:2–16:17).
beast of the earth: See false prophet.
beast of the sea: See Antichrist.
book of life: A registry of believers recorded in heaven.
bride of the Lamb: A symbol that refers to the church.
chiliasm: The belief in a literal 1,000-year reign of Jesus on earth (Rev. 20). It’s
derived from the Greek word chilioi, meaning 1,000.
Christ: See Messiah.
church age: The period of history that lasts from Jesus’s ascent into heaven
(following his resurrection) until his Second Coming.
covenant: A solemn agreement between God and his followers in which God
promises to take care of them and his people promise certain behavior in
return.
diadem: A crown signifying a sovereign ruler.
dispensationalism: A system of belief, introduced by J.N. Darby of the
Plymouth Brethren Church in 1830, that held that human history is divided
into seven “dispensations” (eras) that are represented by the seven churches
of Revelation 2–3. Dispensationalists hold that humans today are living near
the end of the sixth dispensation and that the seventh period will be immedi-
ately preceded by the rapture and the Tribulation.
Dionysius: A bishop and later the pope of the influential church of Alexandria
during the third century. He was one of the first church leaders to contend
that John the Apostle did not write Revelation, believing instead that an
obscure early church leader name John the Presbyter was the author.
Domitian: A Roman emperor from 81 to 96 CE and a persecutor of Christians
throughout the empire.
doxology: A hymn or Christian liturgy that focuses on giving glory to God.
epistle: A book of the New Testament that’s written in the form of a letter
from an Apostle.
320
The Book of Revelation For Dummies 

eschatology: A term that refers to the study of the last days. It comes from
the Greek word eschatos, which means “last” or “extreme.”
Ezekiel: An Old Testament prophet who lived in the 500s BCE, during the
Babylonian exile. Ezekiel authored the book of Ezekiel, one of the most vivid
examples of apocalyptic literature in the Bible.
false prophet: An evil spiritual leader who teams up with the Antichrist to
deceive people on earth (Rev. 13:11–17, 19:20).
final judgment: See Last Judgment.

in Jerusalem in the tenth century BCE. It was destroyed in 586 BCE.
four horsemen of the Apocalypse: Executioners of judgment that are
released when the Lamb (Jesus) opens the first four seals in Revelation 6.
futurism: The interpretation of Revelation that holds that, starting with
Revelation 4:1, John’s prophecy chronicles literal events that will take place
on earth sometime in the future. Many futurists are also dispensationalists.
Gabriel (archangel): An angel who serves as a chief messenger from God in
the Bible. He appears to the prophet Daniel and to Mary, the mother of Jesus.
Some people believe him to be the unnamed angel who blows his horn in
Revelation 10.
gentile: A person who is not Jewish.
gospel: Literally meaning “good news,” the gospel refers to the good news of
redemption (being saved from the punishment of sin) that Jesus proclaimed
in his life and teachings.
Gospel: One of the first four books of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John.
grace: God’s unmerited favor made possible by the death and resurrection 
of Jesus.
Great Tribulation: See Tribulation.
great white throne judgment: See Last Judgment.

321
Appendix: Glossary

hell: The permanent place of punishment for the wicked.
historicism: The interpretation of Revelation that maintains that John’s
prophecy reveals the entire course of history during the church age — 
starting in the early church and being continuously fulfilled. The historicist,
therefore, sees Revelation as history in the making.
Holy of Holies: The inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle and the Jerusalem
Temple in Jerusalem that only the High Priest could enter one time of the
year — on Yom Kippur.
idealism: The interpretation of Revelation that holds that the book is a figurative
description of the age-old battle between good and evil that exists throughout
human history. The idealist, therefore, does not look for prophecy to be
fulfilled in literal events. Also known as spiritualism or allegoricalism.
imperial cult: During the Roman Empire, the imperial cult was the worship of
the Roman emperor as a god.
inspiration (of Scripture): The orthodox belief of the church that holds that
God guided the writing of the Scripture in such a way that authors, through
their own unique personalities and writing styles, wrote God’s revelation
exactly in the manner in which God wanted the text to be written.
Isaiah: An Old Testament prophet whose ministry took place between 740–687
BCE. He is best known for writing the book of Isaiah.
Jeremiah: A prophet who, from 628–586 BCE, warned Jews of coming disas-
ter and urged his people to turn back to God. He’s author of the book of
Jeremiah.
Joel: A minor prophet in the Old Testament and author of the book of Joel.
Johannine: Relating to the Apostle John.
lake of fire: The eternal state of unbelievers and Satan separated from God
because of their evil and their rejection of Jesus (Rev. 19:20). It’s associated
with the second death in Revelation 20:14 and Revelation 21:8.
Last Judgment: The judgment in which everyone whose name isn’t written in
the book of life is cast into the lake of fire (Rev 20:12–15). Also known as the
great white throne judgment.
mark of the beast (666): Literal interpreters of Revelation believe the mark of
the beast is a way in which the Antichrist will control the economic system of
the world. The mark itself is placed a person’s right hand or forehead, and it’s
required in order for someone to buy and sell goods (Rev. 13:16–18, 14:9–12).
Meggido: See Armageddon.
322
The Book of Revelation For Dummies 

Messiah: A Hebrew title, literally meaning “the anointed one,” that refers to
the promised savior of ancient Israel. Christ is the Greek translation of Messiah.
Michael (archangel): An angel who is mentioned in Revelation 12:7 and is
often considered to be the commander of the Army of God.
midtribulation rapture: The belief that the rapture will occur in the middle of
the Tribulation (after 3.5 years).
Millennium: The period of time depicted in Revelation 20 in which Jesus
reigns on earth for a 1,000 years. Amillennialism holds that this time period is
symbolic, but chiliasm believes it to be a literal 1,000-year space-time event.
new Jerusalem: The new dwelling place for God’s people after the Last
Judgment.
Olivet Discourse: A sermon that Jesus gave on the Mount of Olives (found in
the Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21); many scholars interpret it as
prophecy concerning future events. It’s also known as Little Apocalypse.
Parousia: See Second Coming.
Patmos: A small Greek island that John was exiled on when he scribed
Revelation.
postmillennialism: The belief that the Second Coming of Jesus occurs after
the Millennium.
posttribulation rapture: The belief that the rapture will occur at the end of
the seven-year Tribulation period at or close to the Second Coming of Jesus.
premillennialism: The belief that all the events from Revelation 1–19 will
occur before the Millennium begins.
preterism: The interpretation of Revelation that holds that John’s prophecy
refers not to future events but to events that already took place back in the
first century. From this perspective, Revelation is largely fulfilled prophecy.
pretribulation rapture: The belief that the rapture will occur before the
seven-year Tribulation begins.
prophecy: A special message from God, often concerning future events that
God promises will happen on earth and in heaven. More generally, it can also
refer to the act of speaking the mind and counsel of God.
323
Appendix: Glossary

rapture: An event in which all believers on earth are suddenly transported to
heaven to be with Jesus. Futurists believe the rapture to be a literal space-
time event in the future, occurring just before, in the middle, or at the end of
the Tribulation. The term itself comes from the Latin translation of 1
Thessalonians 4:16–17.
seal judgments: An initial set of judgments that occurs on earth when the
Lamb (Jesus) opens seven seals of a heavenly scroll (Rev. 6:1–8:1).
Second Coming: The time in history in which Jesus returns to the earth.
second death: Being physically and spiritually removed from the presence of
God. Revelation refers to the second death in 2:11, 20:6, 20:14, and 21:8. See
also lake of fire.
70th week of Daniel: This term refers to the Tribulation period, or the last
seven-year period of the 70 weeks (490 years) that Daniel prophesies in
Daniel 9:24–27. See also Tribulation.
666: See mark of the beast (666)
spiritualism: See idealism.
synoptic Gospels: A term referring to the first three books of the New
Testament (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). These books are similar in sequence
and structure, and they often use similar wording.
theophany: The appearance of God to a human.
Tribulation: The seven-year period of unprecedented evil that futurists
believe will occur prior to the Second Coming of Jesus. During this period,
Satan will show power of the earth through the Antichrist, and a series of
judgments from God will occur on the earth (Rev. 6–19). Some people believe
the period of great suffering that Jesus refers to in Matthew 24:21 is the last
half of the Tribulation (sometimes known as the Great Tribulation). See also
70th week of Daniel.
trumpet judgments: A set of judgments more severe than the seal judgments
that are carried out when seven angels play trumpets (Rev. 8:7–11:15).
