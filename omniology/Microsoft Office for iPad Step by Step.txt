Introduction
Welcome! This Step by Step book has been designed so you can read it from the 
beginning to learn about the infrastructure that supports the Microsoft Office for 
iPad apps, the common user interface elements, and the skills you can use when 
working in any of them; and then build your skills as you learn to perform increas-
ingly specialized procedures. Or, if you prefer, you can jump in wherever you need 
ready guidance for supporting the apps or performing tasks in Microsoft Word for 
iPad, Excel for iPad, PowerPoint for iPad, and OneNote for iPad. The how-to steps 
are delivered crisply and concisely—just the facts. You’ll also find informative, full-
color graphics that support the instructional content.
Who this book is for
Microsoft Office for iPad Step by Step is designed for use as a learning and reference 
resource by home and business users of Office programs who want to use Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote to create and edit documents, workbooks, presen-
tations, and notebooks on iPads. The content of the book is designed to be useful 
for people who have previously used Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote on 
other platforms and for people who are discovering Office apps for the first time.
The Step by Step approach
The book’s coverage is divided into parts representing general Office app skills or 
specific apps. Each part is divided into chapters representing skill set areas, and each 
chapter is divided into topics that group related skills. Each topic includes expository 
information followed by specific procedures. At the end of the chapter, you’ll find a 
series of practice tasks you can complete on your own. You can use the practice files 
that are available from this book’s website to work through the practice tasks, or you 
can use your own files.
xi

Download the practice files
Before you can complete the practice tasks in this book, you need to download the 
book’s practice files to your Microsoft OneDrive or OneDrive for Business storage 
drive from http://aka.ms/iPadOfficeSBS/files. Follow the instructions on the webpage.
IMPORTANT The Office for iPad apps are not available from this website. You should 
install those apps before using this book.
You can open the files that are stored on your OneDrive from within the Office for 
iPad apps and save a duplicate copy of each file on your iPad. The apps automati-
cally save changes to the practice files. If you later want to repeat practice tasks, you 
can download the original practice files again.
SEE ALSO For information about opening and saving files, see “Create, open, and save 
files” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

Introduction

Adapt exercise steps
This book contains many procedures for performing tasks in Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote on your iPad. The procedural instructions use this 
format:
1. To select the paragraph that you want to format in columns, triple-tap 
the paragraph.
2. On the Layout tab, tap Columns to display the scrollable menu of 
column layout options.
3. On the Columns menu, tap Three.
On subsequent instances of instructions that require you to follow the same 
process, the instructions might be simplified in this format because the 
working location has already been established:
1. Select the paragraph that you want to format in columns.
2. On the Columns menu, tap Three.
The instructions in this book assume that you’re interacting with on-screen 
elements on your iPad by tapping the screen (with your finger or a stylus) 
and interacting with on-screen elements on desktop computers by clicking 
(with a mouse, touchpad, or other hardware device). If you’re using a differ-
ent method—for example, if you have an external keyboard connected to 
your iPad or if you use a touchscreen computer—substitute the applicable 
tapping or clicking action when you interact with a user interface element. 
xiv
Introduction

Instructions in this book refer to iPad user interface elements that you tap 
on the iPad screen as icons, to Office app user interface elements that you 
tap on the iPad screen as buttons, and to physical buttons that you press 
on the iPad device as buttons, to conform to the standard terminology 
used in documentation for these products.
When the instructions tell you to enter information, you can do so by typing 
on a connected external keyboard, tapping an on-screen keyboard, or even 
speaking aloud, depending on your iPad or computer setup and your per-
sonal preferences.
Images in this book depict the iPad interface as it appears when the iPad 
is oriented horizontally. This maximizes the ribbon width in the Office for 
iPad apps so the buttons aren’t crowded. (And, as a bonus, the horizon-
tally oriented images require less vertical space on the page than vertical 
images, leaving more space available for words.) You can orient your iPad 
vertically or horizontally depending on your preference. For example, 
when the ribbon and on-screen keyboard are both open, you might want 
to work with your iPad oriented vertically to have more space available 
between those elements. When the iPad is oriented vertically, some ele-
ments of the Office app user interface might appear slightly different from 
those depicted in the book. For example, some buttons on the ribbon 
might be represented by icons instead of words.

Practice files
No practice files are necessary to

chapter.
Microsoft Office for iPad is the collective name for a 
group of individual apps you can use on your iPad to 
display, create, and work with different kinds of informa-
tion. The Office for iPad family includes three core apps:
 
■
Word for iPad
 
■
Excel for iPad
 
■
PowerPoint for iPad
Another useful Office app that is available for the iPad 
is Microsoft OneNote for iPad. This book includes cover-
age of all four of these Office apps, which are widely 
used in home, business, and school environments.
Other Microsoft products that are available for the iPad 
include the Microsoft SharePoint Newsfeed and Yammer 
networking tools, the Skype and Skype for Business (for-
merly Microsoft Lync) online communication apps, the 
Microsoft Outlook Web App enterprise communication 
app, and apps that help you access and manage content 
in Microsoft OneDrive and OneDrive for Business online 
storage locations.
This chapter provides information about the environment 
necessary to support the Office apps on an iPad. It then 
guides you through procedures related to installing, con-
figuring, updating, removing, and reinstalling Office apps 
and configuring iPad settings for features and functions 
that can be used in the Office apps.

Install Office for iPad apps
The Office for iPad apps are free, as are the features necessary to display, create, and 
edit Word documents, Excel workbooks, Power Point presentations, and OneNote 
notebooks. All you need is a free Microsoft account (which you probably already 
have). You can use Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, PowerPoint for iPad, and OneNote 
for iPad to open and explore Office files regardless of whether the files were origi-
nally created on a computer running Windows, a Mac computer, or an iPad.
You install the individual Office apps from the App Store. After you sign in to an app 
by using your Microsoft account credentials, you can get right to work.
IMPORTANT You have the option of unlocking premium app features by associating 
the apps with an Office 365 account. Premium features include advanced change-
tracking features, unlimited use of paragraph styles, and advanced chart, table, and picture 
formatting tools.
SEE ALSO For information about Microsoft accounts and Office 365 accounts, see 
“Microsoft account options” and “Office 365 subscription options” later in this topic.
Hardware requirements
The Office apps can be installed on any iPad running iOS 7 or iOS 8 (the current 
version at the time of this writing). Each app requires about 450 megabytes (MB) 
of local storage space (on the iPad) to install. The documents, workbooks, presenta-
tions, and other files you create or work with require additional storage space, but 
you can store those either locally on the iPad or in a remote storage location such 
as a OneDrive, SharePoint, or Dropbox site.
SEE ALSO For information about remote storage locations, see “Connect to additional 
storage locations” in Chapter 2, “Get connected.”
TIP If your iPad doesn’t have enough free space to install the Office apps you want, 
you can regain space by deleting other apps, or by moving photos, music, and other 
files to remote storage locations. If you want to make an entirely clean start, you can restore 
the iPad to its original state and then install the most recent version of iOS. Always synchro-
nize iPad content with your computer before you restore an iPad to its original state.

iTunes support for the iPad
You can manage the content, software, and data on iPads and other Apple 
devices by installing iTunes on your computer. When your iPad is connected 
to the computer, clicking or tapping the iPad icon on the toolbar displays 
information that includes the total storage capacity and the iOS version.
iTunes provides information about your connected device
From the Summary page, you can also configure backup settings and other 
options. Two notable options for the iPad-to-computer connection are:
 
■
Open iTunes when this iPad is connected This option is selected by 
default. Clear it if you want to start iTunes manually.
 
■
Sync with this iPad over Wi-Fi Select this option to save yourself the 
trouble of connecting the iPad to the computer by using a USB cable.
From the File Sharing area at the bottom of the Apps page, you can add files 
from your computer to the iPad and save files from the iPad to your computer.
Connected devices are available from the toolbar
SEE ALSO You can learn about and install iTunes from itunes.apple.com.

There are several ways to find out about your iPad’s operating system version and 
available storage space. You can check directly on the iPad or, if the iPad is con-
nected to a computer, from iTunes or the file explorer system on the computer.
To display information about your iPad operating system and storage space
1. On the Home Screen, tap the Settings icon to start the Settings app.
2. In the Settings list, tap General.
3. At the top of the General page, tap About.
The Available entry displays the available storage space. The Version entry 
displays the installed iOS version.
4. Return to the General page.
5. About halfway down the General page, tap Usage to display the total used 
and available storage space on the device.
6. On the Usage page, tap Manage Storage to display the totals and the storage 
space consumed by each app and its related documents and data.
7. Tap any app to display a breakdown of the content stored for that app.
Or
1. Connect the iPad to a computer that iTunes is installed on.
2. Start iTunes if it doesn’t start automatically.
3. On the iTunes toolbar, tap or click the iPad button.
IMPORTANT The iPad button isn’t labeled, other than by an icon that looks 
like an iPad device.
The first section of the Summary page displays the total storage capacity on 
the left side, and the iOS version on the right side. The bar at the bottom of 
the window displays used and available storage space.
Colored blocks indicate the portion of storage used by photos, apps, and other content
SEE ALSO For information about deleting apps to free up storage space, see “Remove 
and reinstall Office apps” later in this chapter.

Installation options
You always install the Office apps from the App Store. To install an app directly from 
the App Store, you must first locate it by searching for the app and then identifying 
it among the related results. This approach seems straightforward, but many apps 
have been released that support or resemble the Office apps, so you might have to 
scroll through a lot of search results to identify the actual app you want to install.
A more direct path to the Office apps is through the Office website. You can learn 
about and link to the App Store listings for all the Office apps that are available for 
a specific mobile device (in this case, the iPad) from the Office website for mobile 
devices  at office.microsoft.com/mobile.
The Office for Mobile Devices website provides information for iPad, iPhone, Windows Phone, and Android 
phone users
Install Office for iPad apps

When you start an app installation, the app icon is automatically added to the iPad 
Home Screen. Until the app is ready to use, the icon is screened (dark) and labeled 
with the installation status rather than the app name.
The Installing status appears during the initial app installation and subsequent updates
When the app is ready for use, the icon is unshaded and labeled with the app name.
To locate Office for iPad apps in the App Store
1. Display any view of the App Store (Featured, Top Charts, Near Me, Purchased, 
or Updates).
2. In the Search box in the upper-right corner, enter Office 365 or the name of 
the specific app you want to locate.
3. Tap a corresponding search term in the Results list.
4. Scroll the page if necessary to locate the official apps.
The official app installation links feature the app icons and names shown here

TIP If you’re accustomed to working with Office programs on other platforms, you 
might notice that the names of the iPad app versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 
OneNote don’t include version numbers (such as 2013) like the desktop programs. The Office 
for iPad apps automatically update when new versions become available. The current version 
is shown on the app page in the App Store and on the splash screen that appears after the 
installation of an update.
To install Office for iPad apps from the App Store
1. In the App Store, locate the app you want to install.
2. To begin the installation, do one of the following:
 
●
In the upper-right corner of the app listing, tap the Install icon.
 
●
Tap the app listing, and then on the app information page, tap the Install 
icon to begin the installation.
TIP The Install icon depicts a downward-pointing arrow on a cloud. If an 
app is already installed on the iPad, the app information page displays an 
Open button instead of an Install icon.
The Install icon changes to indicate the progress of the installation
To install Office for iPad apps from the Office website
1. On the iPad, using Safari or another web browser, go to office.microsoft.com 
/mobile.
2. With iPad selected at the top of the page, scroll to the Introducing Office for 
iPad section, and then tap Get Word, Get Excel, or Get PowerPoint to open 
the information page for the selected app in the App Store.
3. On the app’s information page, tap the Install icon.

Microsoft account options
If you use Skype, OneDrive, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, or a Windows Phone, you 
already have a  Microsoft account. (Microsoft account credentials are also used by 
many non- Microsoft products and websites.) If you don’t already have a Microsoft 
account, you can register any existing account as a Microsoft account, sign up for a 
free Outlook.com or Hotmail.com account and register that as a Microsoft account, 
or create an alias for an Outlook.com account and register the alias.
TIP Many software programs and websites authenticate transactions by using 
Microsoft account credentials. For that reason, it’s a good idea to register a personal 
account that you control, rather than a business account that your employer controls, as your 
Microsoft account. That way, you won’t risk losing access if you leave the company.
You can start the process of creating a Microsoft account while signing in to an 
Office app, or you can create the account independently of the sign-in process.
SEE ALSO For information about creating a Microsoft account while signing in to an 
Office app, see “Start and activate apps” in Chapter 2, “Get connected.” You can learn 
about Microsoft accounts, register an existing email address, or sign up for a new Microsoft 
account at www.microsoft.com/account.
To create a Microsoft account from any computer
1. If necessary, sign out of the current computer user’s Microsoft account.
IMPORTANT If the current user is signed in to a Microsoft account on the 
computer or iPad, the management page for that account appears instead of the 
Create An Account page. To create a new account, first sign out of the existing account.
2. Go to https://signup.live.com to display the Create an account page.
TIP You can use a different password for the Microsoft account than the one 
you use to access your email.

Office 365 subscription options
Office 365, which was originally available only to businesses, now has many subscrip-
tion options designed for individual home and business users, students, households, 
small businesses, midsize businesses, enterprises, government agencies, academic 
institutions, and nonprofits; in other words, whatever your needs may be, there is an 
Office 365 subscription option that will be a close fit. Subscription prices range from 
about $2 to $22 per user per month (and some versions are free).
Many of the Office 365 subscription options include licensing for the desktop Office 
programs and unlock the premium features of the Office for iPad apps. Most sub-
scriptions that include licensing permit each user to run Office on up to five devices, 
including computers running Windows, Mac computers, tablets, and iPads. 
SEE ALSO For information about associating Office for iPad apps with an Office 365 
subscription, see “Start and activate apps” in Chapter 2, “Get connected.”

If you have an Office 365 subscription, you can find out whether you have the licens-
ing necessary to activate the premium app features on the Software page of the 
Office 365 portal, which you can access at portal.microsoftonline.com. 
You can access your licensed software from the Office 365 Settings page of the Office 365 portal
If you intend to run Office apps only on your iPad and don’t need a higher-level  
subscription, you can subscribe to Office 365 Personal for about $6 per month. An 
Office 365 Personal subscription allows you to install and use full versions of the 
 following software:
 
■
The current versions of Microsoft Access, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, 
 PowerPoint, Publisher, and Word on one computer running Windows
Or
The current versions of Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word for 
Mac on one Mac computer
 
■
Office apps on one iPad or Windows tablet
 
■
Office apps on Android phones, iPhones, and Windows Phones
An Office 365 Personal subscription also provides 1 terabyte (TB) of online storage 
and 60 minutes of international Skype calling per month.

Configure iPad and Office app settings
As a rule, settings for iPad apps are configured centrally from the iPad Settings app 
rather than from each individual app. Some of the settings that affect your Office 
app experience are specific to the iPad, including the following:
 
■
Wi-Fi An active Internet connection is necessary to install the app and updates, 
to validate your Microsoft account and Office 365 subscription, to view online 
content (such as Help file content) from within the apps, and to connect to 
online storage resources.
 
■
General You can configure many user experience settings, such as those that 
do the following:
 
●
Make features and commands easier to access for people with limited 
vision, hearing, or dexterity.
 
●
Specify the length of time before the iPad screen automatically locks.
 
●
Require a passcode to install or delete apps; purchase content, upgrades, 
or subscriptions from within apps; or use the AirDrop functionality to 
transfer files to nearby devices.
 
●
Permit or restrict access to app content and website content based on 
content ratings.
 
●
Control whether apps can access the microphone (for use when dictating 
content in Word).
 
●
Provide access to alternative on-screen keyboards so you can easily enter 
characters from other alphabets or add emoticons to your content.
Make sure that you’re familiar with the available options so that you recognize 
areas within the apps that would benefit from changes.
 
■
iCloud Manage your iCloud Drive storage options and app sharing settings.
 
■
iTunes & App Store Turn on or off the option to automatically install purchased 
apps on all the devices registered to your iTunes account.
 
■
Photos & Camera Configure storage locations for pictures that you can insert 
in Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and other Office files.
Configure iPad and Office app settings

Each configurable app you install on your iPad has a page in the Settings app. The 
iPad versions of the Office apps have far fewer configurable settings than the desk-
top versions that you might be familiar with. Each app has a Reset option that you can 
use to delete the credentials associated with the app and any locally stored files.
Office app settings are configured from the iPad Settings app rather than from the individual apps
To display the configurable settings for an Office app
1. Start the Settings app.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the Settings list, and locate the app name in the list.
3. Tap the app name to display the related settings in the right pane.

Update Office apps
From time to time, Microsoft releases updates to the Office apps, usually for the 
purpose of adding functionality but sometimes to fix or avoid problems.
When you install an Office app such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on your iPad 
from the App Store, you’re installing the most recent version that is available. When 
the iPad is online, the App Store periodically checks for any available app updates 
and downloads them to the iPad. 
After updates are downloaded, the number of currently available updates appears in 
a red circle on top of the App Store icon. Updates that have been downloaded but 
not installed are shown in the Pending Updates section of the Updates page of the 
App Store.
Information about recent updates is available from the Updates page of the App Store
Chapter 1: Office for iPad basics
18

You can install updates from this page, or you can configure the iPad to automati-
cally install downloaded updates. The automatic installation option is useful if you 
want to be certain that you have the most current version of all apps on your iPad 
for optimal functionality and security.
TIP Information about available and recently installed updates is available from the 
Updates page of the App Store. A history of all the updates installed for an individual 
app is available from the app’s information page. 
When you start an Office app after installing an update, a splash screen describes 
the changes implemented by the update.
The splash screen provides the version number and the name and description of each new product feature

minimize the local storage space requirements of the app so it runs efficiently on the iPad and 
other mobile devices.

Remove and reinstall Office apps
If at some point you want or need to remove an Office app from your iPad, you can 
do so in the same way that you do any other app. The process of removing an app 
from an iPad is referred to as deleting the app. You can delete apps from the Home 
Screen or from the Settings app.
Deleting an app from one device doesn't affect the state of the app on any other 
devices. If you've installed the app on multiple iPads, either manually or through the 
Automatic Downloads feature, the app will remain active on the other iPads. Deleted 
apps remain in the list of purchased apps and can be easily reinstalled from the 
Purchased page of the App Store, or from iTunes when the iPad is connected to a 
computer.
To remove an app from your iPad
1. On the Home Screen, locate the page or folder containing the app icon.
2. Tap and hold any app icon to activate all the app icons on the screen for editing.
3. In the upper-left corner of the icon that represents the app you want to 
delete, tap the ×.
When an icon is active, you can reposition it or delete the related app
4. In the Delete “App” message box, tap Delete.
5. Press the Home button to deactivate the remaining icons.

Practice files
No practice files are necessary to 
complete the practice tasks in this 
chapter.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, “Office for iPad basics,” 
the only credentials necessary for displaying, creating, 
and editing files by using Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, 
PowerPoint for iPad, and OneNote for iPad is a registered 
Microsoft account. You can activate premium features of 
the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint iPad apps by associating 
a Office 365 subscription with the apps.
Microsoft accounts and Office 365 accounts provide 
access to specific online storage locations associated 
with the account: either a OneDrive or OneDrive for 
Business site, and possibly a SharePoint site.
You can access content on your OneDrive and SharePoint 
sites, and also on a Dropbox site if you have one, from 
within the Office for iPad apps or from individual iPad 
apps created specifically for those resources.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
starting and activating Office apps, connecting to user 
accounts, storing files locally and online, locating helpful 
resources, and exiting files and apps.
27

Start and activate apps
Before you can start using an Office app, you need to activate the app. Depending 
on the method you choose, you can end up with any one of three versions of the 
apps: display only, standard, or premium.
Connect to an account
When you first start Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, or PowerPoint for iPad, the app 
displays a series of informational screens. The final screen prompts you to sign in to 
the app. You have three options for continuing from this screen to the app:
 
■
Sign In You can sign in to the app by using any Microsoft account or Office 365 
account. If the account you sign in with is associated with an Office 365 sub-
scription that supports the premium Office for iPad features, the app starts 
with  full functionality. If the user account is not associated with a qualified 
subscription, the app presents you with two options after you enter your 
credentials:
 
●
Create and Edit for Free  This option activates the basic feature set of the 
app, which enables you to display, edit, and create documents, workbooks, 
presentations, and notebooks.
 
●
Go Premium This option displays a selection of current personal Office 365 
subscription plans. You can follow the subscription process to activate the 
premium features of Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and PowerPoint for iPad. 
(OneNote for iPad doesn’t have a premium version.)
 
■
Create an Account This option starts the process of creating a Microsoft 
account, and then returns you to the Sign In screen. You can sign in with 
your new Microsoft account to activate the standard version of the app, or 
 subscribe to Office 365 to activate the premium version of the app.
 
■
Sign In Later This option starts the app in a limited functionality mode in which 
you can display (but not edit) documents, workbooks, and presentations. If you 
choose this option, you can connect to an account (and activate the standard 
or premium feature set) at a later time.
TIP At any time, you can continue to the app by clicking an option, or cancel the 
sign-in process by closing the window. 
28
Chapter 2: Get connected

One activation option that isn’t obvious is that of connecting to an Office 365 
subscription that is associated with your Apple ID but that is not yet connected to 
the iPad you’re working on. You can access the process necessary to reconnect to a 
disconnected account by following the Go Premium path and selecting any of the 
subscription options. 
Activating any one Office product on your computer, iPad, or other device automati-
cally activates all the Office apps on the device.
Sidebars in the first chapter of each app-specific part of this book provide informa-
tion about the features that are available in the iPad, online, and desktop versions of 
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Outside of the procedures in this topic that 
are specific to connecting to Microsoft accounts and Office 365 accounts, the pro-
cedures in this book assume that you have access to the full feature sets of each app.
SEE ALSO For information about the functionality available in Word for iPad, see 
Chapter 4, “Create professional documents”; in Excel for iPad, see Chapter 7, “Store and 
retrieve data”; in PowerPoint for iPad, see Chapter 9, “Create compelling presentations”; and in 
OneNote for iPad, see Chapter 11, “Store information in digital notebooks.”
To start an Office app 
1. On the Home Screen, locate the icon for the app you want to start, and then 
tap the icon.
TIP It might be necessary to swipe left or right to a different Home Screen to 
find the app icon or the folder that contains the app.
Or
Locate the app on any page of the App Store, and tap the Open button next 
to the app name.
Or
Display the app information page, and then tap the Open button.
29
Start and activate apps

Organize apps in folders
To simplify the process of finding the Office apps (or any set of related 
apps) that you’ve installed on your iPad, you can put them all into one 
folder. Grouping apps in folders also cuts down on the amount of swiping 
you have to do to locate apps on the Home Screen. This is especially useful 
if you have a lot of apps installed.
To create a folder, follow these steps:
1. On the Home Screen, tap and hold any app icon to activate all the 
app icons.
2. Locate the icons for two of the apps you want to group. Drag one app 
icon on top of the other app icon and hold it there briefly until a box 
appears around the icons.
When you release the icon, the new folder opens. Depending on the 
apps you grouped, the folder might already have a meaningful name.
To add apps to an existing folder, simply drag the app icons onto the folder 
to drop them inside it. You can access all your folders from the Home 
Screen. (You can’t create subfolders within these top-level folders.)
To change a folder name, follow these steps:
1. Open the folder and activate the app icons.
2. Tap the existing folder name to activate it for editing. Then edit or 
replace the name.
3. Press the Home button to leave the editing mode.
To remove an app from a folder, follow these steps:
1. Open the folder and activate the app icons.
2. Drag the app icon from the box that denotes the folder to the space 
outside the box.
When only one app remains in the folder, the folder is automatically deleted.

To connect to an Office app for the first time
1. Tap or flick through the Office 365 sign-in screen series.
2. On the Sign in now screen, do one of the following:
 
●
To sign in with an existing account, tap Sign In, enter your credentials on 
the Sign in screen that appears, and then follow the process to activate the 
standard or premium versions of the Office for iPad apps.
 
●
To create a Microsoft account that you can use to activate the standard 
versions of the Office for iPad apps, tap Create an Account, and then 
follow the process for creating a Microsoft account.
SEE ALSO For information about creating Microsoft accounts, see “Install 
Office for iPad apps” in Chapter 1, “Office for iPad basics.”
 
●
To start the app in read-only mode, tap Sign In Later.
Manage account connections
When you start Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on your iPad for the first time, or if you 
weren’t working in a specific file the last time you exited the app, the app displays 
the Open page of the Backstage view. (This is different from the experience on the 
desktop version of the program, which displays a blank file.) 
If the app isn’t connected to a user account, the words Sign In appear below the 
Account button and only the local iPad storage is available.
OneDrive, SharePoint, and Dropbox storage locations aren’t shown until you connect to an account
TIP In this book, information that applies both to Microsoft accounts and to organiza-
tional accounts refers generically to the account you use to sign in to Office apps as a 
user account. The process of connecting an app to a user account is accomplished by signing 
in using the account credentials. 
31
Start and activate apps

If you signed in to the app with a user account, the Account button displays your 
name, and the Account menu that appears when you tap the Account button pro-
vides access to your connected storage resources, and to account-specific settings.
You can manage account-specific settings from the Account menu
SEE ALSO For information about cloud storage options, see “Connect to additional 
storage locations” later in this chapter.
Until you activate the premium features of an app, the Go Premium button (which is 
represented by a shopping cart icon) appears at the bottom of the File bar. Although 
the button displays a shopping cart, if you have an existing Office 365 subscription, 
no purchase is required.

Alternative file access methods
If you’re accustomed to working with Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on other 
platforms, one experience that you might find different when working with 
the iPad apps is that the most usual method of working in a file is to first 
start the app, and then open the file you want to work with from within the 
app. Because the iPad doesn’t have a native browsable file storage system 
like those pro vided by the Windows and Mac operating systems, you can’t 
navigate to and open the files stored on your iPad from outside of the app.
SEE ALSO For information about managing files from iTunes, see the side-
bar “iTunes support for the iPad” in Chapter 1, “Office for iPad basics.”
Methods for opening files on your iPad from outside of the apps include the 
following:
 
■
You can browse through the contents of your OneDrive or OneDrive 
for Business site by using the related iPad app, and open files directly 
in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote from within those apps.
 
■
You can browse through the contents of your Dropbox site and open 
files directly in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint from within the Dropbox 
app.
 
■
You can open a OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, or Drop-
box site in Safari or another web browser and open files from that site.
 
■
If you receive a document, workbook, or presentation as an attach-
ment to an email message, you can display the file content or open 
the file for editing.
 
■
If you receive a link to a OneNote notebook in an email message, you 
can open the notebook from the message in OneNote Online, and 
from there you can open the notebook in OneNote.

Connect to additional storage locations
Signing in to a user account connects the Office apps to the online storage loca-
tion associated with that account. Microsoft accounts have associated OneDrive 
storage sites, personal Office 365 accounts have OneDrive storage sites, and business 
Office 365 accounts have OneDrive for Business storage sites.
SEE ALSO For more information about Microsoft accounts and Office 365 accounts, 
see “Install Office for iPad apps” in Chapter 1, “Office for iPad basics.”
The default storage location for Office files you save to your iPad is your iPad. You 
can connect to multiple online storage locations, including OneDrive, OneDrive for 
Business, SharePoint, and Dropbox sites.
IMPORTANT Apple offers the iCloud online storage solution. iCloud is not available 
as a storage location for files you create and edit in Word, Excel, or other Office apps. 
You can configure iCloud as a backup location for the contents of your iPad.
Each storage location is referred to as a Place. You can add Places by connecting 
to services or specifying locations. You can open files that are stored in any of the 
Places you connect to, and save files to those same Places.
Individual SharePoint sites are organized within the SharePoint Place
TIP You can connect to multiple OneDrive sites or SharePoint sites. Each OneDrive site 
appears as a place and each SharePoint site as a subset of the SharePoint place.
35
Connect to additional storage locations

Use OneDrive to work anywhere
If you’re new to the world of OneDrive, here’s a quick tutorial to help you 
get started.
OneDrive is a cloud-based storage solution. The purpose of OneDrive is to 
provide a single place for you to store and access all your files. Although this 
might seem like a simple concept, it provides major value for people who 
use Word or other Office products on multiple devices, including computers 
running Windows, Mac computers, iPads and other tablets, and Windows, 
iPhone, and Android smartphones. 
For example, you can create a file on your desktop computer at work, edit 
it on your iPad at home, and review it on your smartphone while you’re 
waiting for your lunch to be served at a restaurant. If you use the full suite of 
Office products within your organization, you can even present the file in a 
Skype for Business (formerly Lync) meeting from your tablet PC, all while the 
file is stored in the same central location.
There are currently two types of OneDrive—one for personal use and one 
for  business use:

OneDrive A personal OneDrive storage site, formerly known as a 
SkyDrive, is provided free with every Microsoft account. Each OneDrive 
is linked to a specific account. 
 
■
OneDrive for Business An organizational OneDrive storage site, for-
merly part of SharePoint MySites, is provided with every business-level 
Office 365 subscription license. These storage locations are part of an 
organization’s Office 365 online infrastructure.
You might have both types of OneDrive available to you; if you do, you can 
connect to both from the Office for iPad apps.
In this book, the personal and organizational versions are referred to 
generically as OneDrive sites except in instructions that are specific to one 
version or the other.

To make OneDrive a realistic one-stop storage solution, Microsoft has 
chosen to support the storage of very large files (up to 10 gigabytes [GB] 
each) and to provide a significant amount of free storage—from a minimum 
of 15 GB for every Microsoft account, to unlimited storage for Office 365 
subscribers! 
By default, files that you store on your OneDrive site are password-protected 
and available only to you. You can share specific files or folders with other 
people by sending a personalized invitation or a generic link that allows 
recipients to view or edit files. You can also create a collaboration space 
called a OneDrive Group, in which multiple people can freely create and 
manage files.
You can access files stored on your OneDrive from your iPad in several ways:
 
■
From within the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote apps when 
opening or saving a file.
 
■
Through the OneDrive or OneDrive for Business apps.
 
■
Through a web browser such as Safari. Personal OneDrive sites 
are available at https://onedrive.live.com; organizational OneDrive 
sites have addresses linked to your Office 365 account, such as  
https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/joan_contoso_com/.
When you’re working on a computer, you have even more access to the files 
that are stored on your OneDrive site:
 
■
On a computer running Windows, you can synchronize your OneDrive 
site contents with the computer to make the OneDrive contents avail-
able in File Explorer. 
 
■
On a Mac computer, you can install a OneDrive app and synchronize 
your OneDrive with the app.
Because OneDrive and OneDrive for Business file storage locations are 
easily configurable in all versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, 
OneDrive is a simple and useful cloud storage option. And best of all, it’s 
completely free!
37
Connect to additional storage locations

Connect to a remote storage location
Creating a Microsoft account simultaneously creates a OneDrive online storage 
account on which you can store files that you create in Office apps or other apps. 
Since the inception of OneDrive, the amount of free storage granted to OneDrive 
users has continually increased.
OneDrive for Business is the online storage provided to each user who has a busi-
ness subscription to Office 365. You access this storage from your organization’s 
SharePoint site by using your Office 365 credentials. You can also add it to the list 
of Places that is available in an Office app.
To add a storage location from within an Office app
1. At the left end of the ribbon, tap the Back button to display the Backstage view.
2. On the File bar, tap Open to display the storage locations you’re connected to.
3. On the Open page, tap Add a Place.
The Add A Place window displays the types of storage locations you can connect to

TIP SharePoint sites you’re connected to appear in the Connected Services list 
for the account, but you can’t add a SharePoint site from that location.
39
Connect to additional storage locations

Synchronize OneDrive with desktop 
computers
Your OneDrive is easy to access from within the Office apps on the iPad, 
but to fully take advantage of it as a central file storage location, you can 
synchronize it with your desktop computer and browse its contents as you 
would those of any storage folder.
To synchronize your OneDrive contents with a computer running Windows 7 
or  Windows 8, follow these steps:
1. In Internet Explorer or another web browser, display the OneDrive 
download site at https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download.
2. With Windows selected in the operating system list, tap or click the 
Download now button for the OneDrive software you want to install.
3. Run the OneDriveSetup installation file and configure your 
preferences.
To synchronize your OneDrive contents with a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Install the OneDrive app from the App Store (not from iTunes—the 
full app is available only from the App Store).
2. Start the OneDrive app, and then configure your preferences, which 
include:
 
●
Whether to start OneDrive automatically.
 
●
Which folders to synchronize with OneDrive.
 
●
Whether to display the OneDrive icon in the Dock.
3. To simplify the process of saving files to OneDrive, add the OneDrive 
folder to your Favorites list by dragging the folder to the Finder.
The OneDrive app for the Mac requires Mac OS X Lion (10.7) or later.

Exit files and apps
In any Office for iPad app, you can have only one file open in the app window at a 
time. Opening a second file doesn’t start a second instance of the app, as you might 
be accustomed to when working with Office files on other platforms—the second 
file simply replaces the first file in the same app window.
When working in the primary Office for iPad apps, you can’t simply close an open 
file. You have the following options for leaving a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file:
 
■
Delete the file, if you haven’t yet saved it for the first time.
SEE ALSO For information about deleting unsaved files, see “Create, open, and 
save files” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”
 
■
Open a different file in the current app window (thereby closing the current file).
 
■
Exit the app.
You can’t exit an Office for iPad app from within the app window; you must first 
display the list of running apps and then exit the app by dismissing it from the list.
App icons and app preview screens help you quickly identify apps

Switch among running apps
It’s likely that you’ll run more than one app at a time on your iPad (for exam-
ple, you might concurrently run the Word, Excel, Mail, and FaceTime apps), 
but you can interact with only one app at a time. The process of navigating 
among apps is different from that of navigating among program windows 
on a desktop computer. If you’re not already familiar with iPad app-switching 
techniques, here is a quick tutorial.
You can switch among apps in two ways:
 
■
From within an app, use four or five fingers to flick left or right 
between the open apps.
 
■
Use one of the following techniques to display the open apps: 
 
●
Use four or five fingers to flick up from within the app window.
 
●
Press the Home button twice.
Then flick left or right to locate the app you want to make active, and 
tap the app preview screen or icon.
The four-finger and five-finger techniques work only when multitasking 
gestures are turned on (as they are by default). You can turn multitasking 
gestures on and off from the General page of the Settings app.

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice

folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the Introduction.
The elements that control the appearance of an iPad 
app or computer program and the way we interact with 
it are collectively referred to as the user interface. Some 
user interface elements, such as the color scheme, are 
cosmetic. Others, such as toolbars, menus, and buttons, 
are functional. Many apps and programs allow users to 
modify cosmetic and functional user interface elements 
(the “look and feel” of the app) to accommodate indi-
vidual preferences.
The Office for iPad apps—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—
share many common user interface features and func-
tions. The ways in which you interact with each app to 
perform standard tasks such as opening, saving, sharing, 
searching, and printing files are standardized across the 
apps so that you can concentrate your learning efforts 
on the skills and features that are specific to the app 
or to the document, workbook, or presentation you’re 
creating.
This chapter guides you through procedures that are 
common to Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and PowerPoint 
for iPad. It includes procedures related to opening and 
creating files, saving files, sharing files, searching file 
content, and printing documents, workbooks, work-
sheets, or specific portions thereof.
49

Create, open, and save files
When you start an Office app from the Home Screen, it displays the Backstage view. 
From the File bar on the left side of the window, you can create new files, open files 
that you worked with previously, or browse through your connected storage locations 
to find and open a file.
Create files
When creating a file in an Office app, you can create a blank file of the default file 
type or create a file based on one of the templates provided with each app. Each 
template incorporates specific design elements such as fonts and colors. Many tem-
plates also include typical information that you can modify or build on to create a 
useful document, workbook, or presentation.
Some of the available Excel workbook templates
TIP You can’t open online or custom templates from the New page of an iPad app. To 
use a template other than those that are available by default from the New page, save 
the template to one of your connected storage locations and open it from that location.
50
Chapter 3: Create and manage files

3
If you create a file that contains content (either from a template or content that you 
enter) and display the Backstage view before naming and saving the file, the app 
prompts you to save or delete the file.
SEE ALSO For information about creating files in Word for iPad, see Chapter 4, “Create 
professional documents”; in Excel for iPad, see Chapter 7, “Store and retrieve data”; and 
in PowerPoint for iPad, see Chapter 9, “Create compelling presentations.”
You can open an existing file from within the corresponding Office app, from its 
storage location, or from an email message. If the file is stored remotely, the app 
downloads a copy of the file before opening it.
If you no longer need a file that you’ve stored on your iPad or a connected storage 
location, you can delete files from the Open page of the Backstage view.
You can perform several tasks on files from the Open page
TIP It can take a short time for files that you post to a SharePoint or OneDrive site to 
appear in a folder structure that you’ve previously opened. If you don’t want to wait, you 
can manually refresh the display of the folder contents by swiping the folder structure down the 
Open page.
51
Create, open, and save files

To create a new document, workbook, or presentation
1. Start the app or, if you’re already working in a document, tap the Back button 
to display the Backstage view.
2. On the File bar, tap New.
3. On the New page of the Backstage view, tap the type of file you want to 
create.
To delete a new file instead of saving it for the first time
1. At the left end of the ribbon, tap the Back button.
If you haven’t yet named the file and selected a file storage location, the Save 
As window opens.
2. In the upper-left corner of the Save As window, tap Delete to delete the 
 current file and display the New page of the Backstage view.
IMPORTANT The Delete command is available only in the Save As dialog box 
that appears when you tap the Back button in an unsaved file. It is not available 
when you are using the Name or Duplicate function.
To delete a file that has already been saved
1. Display the Backstage view.
2. On the File bar, tap Open.
3. On the Open page of the Backstage view, navigate to the folder that contains 
the file you want to delete.
4. Tap the File Actions button to the right of the file name, and then tap Delete.
5. In the confirmation message box, tap Delete.
Open files
From the Open page of the Backstage view, you can navigate to files stored locally 
on your iPad or on a remote storage resource such as a OneDrive site or a SharePoint 
site. Each app displays only the files that can be opened by that app.
52
Chapter 3: Create and manage files

3
The Open page displays only the app-specific files in the selected location
The Open page displays up to three levels of the storage structure in columns. Initially, 
the Place is in the leftmost column and subsequent sites or folders are in adjacent 
columns. Each column represents one level of the storage structure and displays the 
folders and files at that level in alphabetical order. When you navigate through a 
deep folder structure, the columns move to the left. You can scroll the page left and 
right to display the entire storage path.
If you want to access files that are stored on a OneDrive site directly from your iPad 
(rather than through the apps), you can install the OneDrive or OneDrive for Business 
app on your iPad. These apps allow you to browse through the folders on your stor-
age site and manage the files that are stored there.
TIP When you open a file that is stored in a remote storage location, the words 
read-only appear in parentheses to the right of the file name on the title bar, and a 
yellow banner at the top of the content pane provides an Edit button that you must tap 
before you can make changes to the file. If you don’t intend to modify the file content, you 
can hide the banner by tapping the × at its right end. 
Office keeps track of the files that you work with on any device and makes the 
list available from any other device. (The data is linked to your user account.) This 
is one of the tremendous benefits of the Office 365 subscription model and the 
cloud storage that comes with it—you can be up and running on a new computer 
in minutes, without having to move files or configure settings and preferences.
53

Switch among files
When you’re working in an Office program on a desktop computer, you 
can have multiple files open at the same time and easily switch among 
them. When you’re working in an Office app on your iPad, however, you can 
have only one file open at a time in each app. To switch to another file, you 
must open the file from the Backstage view.
After you create a new, blank file and add content to it, you can’t open a 
different file in the same app until you name and save the new file or delete 
it. The Open page of the Backstage view displays the files and folders stored 
in connected storage locations, but the files are dimmed so you can’t open 
them. This safeguard is built into the Office for iPad apps to protect you 
from losing unsaved information, due to the limitation of having only one 
file open at a time in an iPad app.
Dimmed files are visible but not available to open
SEE ALSO For related information, see the sidebar “Switch among running 
apps” in Chapter 2, “Get connected.”
The Recent page of the Backstage view provides quick access to the files you’ve 
worked with recently on your iPad, desktop computer, or other device. The Recent 
page displays only files that are related to the app you’re working in: documents in 
the Word app, workbooks in the Excel app, and presentations in the PowerPoint app.
TIP Each app recognizes the file types commonly associated with the desktop version 
of the program. For example, Word for iPad recognizes the current and previous 
default Word Document file types (.docx and .doc), and templates created for those standards.

Recently used workbooks associated with a user account
To ensure that you can find a specific file quickly regardless of whether you’ve 
worked with it recently, you can pin it to the Recent page. Pinned files appear in 
the Pinned section at the top of the list and are indicated by a colored thumbtack.
To open a recent file from within the relevant app
1. Display the Recent page of the Backstage view.
2. If necessary, scroll through the list to locate the file you want to open. Then 
tap the file.
3. If the app prompts you to do so, enter the credentials necessary to gain access 
to the file or storage location.
To pin a file to the Recent file list
1. Display the Recent page of the Backstage view.
2. If necessary, scroll through the list to locate the file you want to pin.
3. Tap the Pin button located to the right of the file name to add the file to the 
Pinned area at the top of the Recent page.

Create, open, and save files

Font substitution
The desktop versions of the Office programs support more fonts than the 
Office for iPad apps. The Office for iPad apps have been programmed to 
handle this situation gracefully by substituting an available font for any 
unsupported font. Because of this, the file content is fully visible and avail-
able for editing.
When you open a file on your iPad that uses fonts that aren’t installed on 
the iPad, a black warning banner appears briefly below the ribbon to inform 
you that text in the file might look different than in the original file.
Only the appearance of the text is changed; the original font is still assigned 
to the text, and any edits you make to the text will be in the assigned font. 
When the file is displayed on a computer that supports the assigned font, it 
will appear correctly.
The Font list displays the original font name. You can apply that font to 
other text within the document by copying the text and then pasting the 
format onto other text.
If you apply other fonts to the document content while working with it on 
your iPad, the new fonts will be visible in the document to people who display 
or edit the document in a desktop version of the program.
SEE ALSO For information about copying and pasting formats, see “Change 
the appearance of text” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”
To open a file directly from a OneDrive storage site
1. From the App Store, install the OneDrive app.
2. Start the OneDrive app.
3. In the OneDrive app window, browse to and tap the file you want to open.
4. If prompted to do so, enter the Microsoft account credentials associated with 
the OneDrive, and then tap Sign in.

57
Create, open, and save files

Save files
By default, the Office apps automatically save the file you’re working on and track 
saved file versions online so that you can revert to earlier versions when necessary.
When the AutoSave function is turned on:
 
■
If you’re working in a new, unnamed file, the app saves a temporary copy of 
the file to your default storage location.
 
■
If you’re working in a previously saved file, the app saves a copy of the file to 
the location in which you opened or last saved it.
You can turn off the automatic file-saving function if you prefer to save changes 
manually.
TIP When using the Office for iPad apps, you can save files only in the default file 
format for the app you’re working in. To save a file as a template, macro-enabled file, 
or one of the many other available formats, use the desktop or online version of the program.
To save and name a file for the first time
1. Tap the File button.
2. On the File menu, tap Name or Save.
TIP The File menu includes the Name command when AutoSave is turned on, 
and the Save command when AutoSave is turned off. The command is active 
until a name is assigned to the file; then it becomes dimmed to indicate that it is 
unavailable.
3. On the Save As screen, enter a file name in the Name box.
4. In the Choose Name and Location pane, tap the place where you want to 
store the file. 
5. If a list of folders associated with the selected storage location appears in the 
center pane, tap the folder in which you want to store the file.
6. In the upper-right corner of the pane, tap Save.

2. In the Choose Name and Location pane, tap the place where you want to 
store the file copy. Then if necessary, flick the folder structure to the right 
to display the top-level folders.
3. In the Name box, enter a name for the new version of the file.
4. In the upper-right corner of the pane, tap Save.
View and edit files online
Most Office 365 subscriptions that include licensing for premium features of 
Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and PowerPoint for iPad also include licensing 
for Word Online, Excel Online, and PowerPoint Online. These Office Online 
apps—formerly known as the Office Web Apps—run entirely within your 
web browser and don’t require the installation of an app or desktop soft-
ware. In spite of this, you can sometimes do more in the Office Online apps 
than you can in the iPad apps—but only with files that are stored in cloud 
storage locations that support the Office Online apps, such as OneDrive and 
SharePoint sites.
If you find that you need more editing functionality than is provided by the 
iPad app version of a program—for example, if you want to insert footnotes 
in a Word document—you can start a web browser (such as Safari), browse 
to the storage location on onedrive.live.com or your SharePoint site, and 
then open and edit the file in the relevant Office Online app.
Use common Office interface features
The Office apps designed for the iPad share common user interface features, so if 
you know how to find your way around one app, it’s a less daunting task to learn to 
use another.
59
Use common Office interface features

Identify standard features
The user interface of a typical Office for iPad app
Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and PowerPoint for iPad each have a colored pane at 
the top of the app window, containing these standard window elements:
 
■
The system information bar, which displays the time, battery charge, and 
infor mation about the iPad’s network connections. This system information is 
independent of the Office app.
 
■
The ribbon, which provides access to commands for working with the app, the 
current file, and the file content.
 
■
The name of the active file, which is displayed between the system information 
bar and the ribbon.
TIP The pane color is specific to the app you’re using—blue for Word, green for Excel, 
orange for PowerPoint, and purple for OneNote—so you can quickly differentiate 
between apps when looking at file thumbnails or quick views of app windows.
Excel for iPad also has a status bar at the bottom of the window, which provides 
information about the currently selected file content.
TIP The user interface elements of the Office for iPad apps are designed to be easy to 
access and control by using touch (with fingers) rather than an external pointing device 
such as a mouse. You can use the iPad’s on-screen keyboard or an external keyboard to input 
information. If you’re using an external keyboard, the on-screen keyboard doesn’t appear 
when you’re working in the file content. For more information about the on-screen keyboard, 
see the sidebar “Reconfigure the on-screen keyboard” later in this chapter. 
The Office apps, like other iPad apps, open in full-screen windows. You can’t minimize, 
resize, or close the apps from within the window.

Change the magnification level of file content
The Office for iPad apps don’t have built-in zoom controls like those in the 
desktop Office programs—they aren’t necessary, because the iPad is a 
touch-centric device, and the functionality is built in. You can use gestures 
to change the magnification level of a document:
 
■
Stretch two fingers apart to zoom in, so that the file content appears 
larger.
 
■
Pinch two fingers together to zoom out, to display more of the file 
content.
You can turn on additional magnification tools in the iPad settings, including 
these tools, which are useful for working in the Office for iPad apps:
 
■
Zoom When this function is turned on, you can display a magnify-
ing tool by double-tapping with three fingers. You can then drag the 
magnifier around the screen by its handle, or drag the screen with 
three fingers to change the area shown in the magnifier.

Use common Office interface features

Work with the ribbon
The commands and procedures available for creating and modifying the content of 
a Word document, Excel workbook, or PowerPoint presentation are located on the 
tabs grouped in the center of the ribbon and vary among apps. Each Office app has 
Home, Insert, and Review tabs, and additional function-specific tabs that provide 
commands specific to working with content in that app.
The Home tab for each app contains the most commonly used commands for that app
Tool tabs appear to the right of the primary tabs when certain types of content such 
as pictures, tables, and shapes are active. A tool tab has a white shadow under the 
tab name when it isn’t active, to differentiate it from the standard tabs.
Tool tabs contain commands specific to working with the selected element
Because the screen area of the iPad and iPad Mini devices is limited, active areas of the 
user interface change to make relevant features and commands available. For example, 
the standard ribbon tabs move to the left to make space for each active tool tab.

Commands that relate to managing, searching, and sharing files are grouped on the 
left and right ends of the ribbon.
Tapping the Back, File, Search, and Share buttons displays additional screens or menus
The buttons at the left end of the ribbon provide access to the Backstage view and 
the File menu, and allow you to undo (and redo, if you change your mind) recent 
actions. The buttons at the right end of the ribbon display options for distributing 
the file to other people and for either searching the file content (in Word and Excel), 
or playing a slide show (in PowerPoint).
SEE ALSO For information about searching and sharing, see “Search file content” and 
“Distribute files” later in this chapter.
Tapping the Back button displays the Backstage view of the app. The Backstage view 
of each Office for iPad app provides access to commands for connecting to your 
user account and file storage locations, and for creating and opening files. Some of 
the information in the Backstage view is shared among all the Office apps that are 
installed on your iPad. Other information is specific to the app you’re working in.
SEE ALSO For hands-on practice working in the Backstage view, see “Start and activate 
apps” and “Connect to additional storage locations” in Chapter 2, “Get connected.”
To undo, redo, and repeat recent changes
1. To undo individual changes sequentially, tap the Undo button.
2. To reinstate undone changes, or to repeat the last action, tap the Redo 
button.
TIP If you’re using an external keyboard with your iPad, you can press +Z to undo 
the last action, and Shift++Z to repeat the last action. For other useful keyboard 
shortcuts, see the Appendix, “Touchscreen and keyboard shortcuts.”

Manage files
Commands for managing the currently open file (not its content) are available from 
the File menu that expands when you tap the File button.
The available commands vary based on the settings configured for saving the file
IMPORTANT If the File menu doesn’t display all the commands shown here, tap one 
of the commands that expands a submenu (such as Print) and then tap Cancel (in the 
upper-left corner of the submenu) to refresh the display of the File menu.
You control the following functions from the File menu:
 
■
AutoSave This function, which is turned on by default, saves a temporary 
copy of the file at regular intervals.
 
■
Name This function is available in a new file until the file is saved. Use this 
function to save a file for the first time in a specific storage location, with a 
specific name.
64
Chapter 3: Create and manage files

■
Duplicate This function is available only in files that have previously been saved. 
Use this function to create a copy of the current file. You can set the file name 
and storage location of the copy.
TIP Duplicating a file is an easy way of moving a file to a different location—
simply save the duplicate in the new location and then delete the original file.
 
■
Restore Periodically you might want to experiment with structural or content 
modifications, or you might simply find that a change you’ve made didn’t 
work as intended, and want to undo your changes. The Office for iPad apps 
provide three levels of change reversion:
 
●
You can undo one change at a time (and redo that change if you want to).
 
●
You can undo all the changes in the current app session.
 
●
You can roll back to a previous version of the document.
 
■
Print Standard printing options include printer selection, print range, and 
number of copies to print.
TIP In Excel for iPad, the Print command also provides access to layout options 
such as page size, orientation, and scaling. More extensive layout options are 
available for Word documents, from the Layout tab of the ribbon.
In addition to these functions, you can display the properties of the current file, send 
feedback about an app feature that you like or don’t like, and access online Help 
information about the app.
SEE ALSO For information about the Name and Duplicate functions, see “Create, open, 
and save files” earlier in this chapter. For information about online Help, see “Get help

Reconfigure the on-screen keyboard
By default, the on-screen keyboard extends across the bottom half of the 
screen and covers the content of the file you’re working in. If you prefer to 
display more of the file content, you can split the keyboard into two halves.
A document open in Word with the split on-screen keyboard 
With the active file between the keyboard halves, more of the file content is 
available while the keyboard is open. You can change the magnification of 
the file content, but the keyboard halves remain in the same position.
To change the keyboard configuration:
1. To split the keyboard, do one of the following:
 
●

Search file content
You can use the Search function to quickly locate specific information in a docu-
ment, workbook, or worksheet. (No search functionality is available in PowerPoint 
for iPad.) After you display the search pane, entering a search term in the Find box 
immediately displays the number of instances of that term that are in the document 
or workbook, and selects the first instance. You can move to the next or previous 
instance by tapping the arrows at the right end of the search pane.
TIP You can copy a search term from the document or elsewhere and paste it into the 
Find box to ensure that it is spelled correctly. Tap and hold in the Find box to display 
the shortcut bar, and then tap Paste.
The Search function displays the number of instances of the found term
By default, the Search function locates every instance of the search term. You can 
restrict the results to only those that exactly match the capitalization of the term as 
you specify it in the Find box. When searching in an Excel workbook, you can also 
restrict the search results to cells that contain nothing other than the search term, 
and restrict the range of the search to the current worksheet.
69
Search file content

Tapping the Options button in the search pane displays the search options for the current file type
You can also use the Search feature to easily substitute a specific word or phrase for 
another. When replacing a search term that occurs multiple times in the current file, 
you can evaluate each search result independently and choose whether to replace it, 
or you can replace all instances of the search term at the same time.
The Replace box and replacement scope options appear in the search pane
TIP If you have an external keyboard connected to your iPad, you can move between 
the Find and Replace boxes by pressing the Tab key. The active box is indicated by the 
Delete button at the right end of the box.

Print file content
You can print a document, worksheet, or presentation to a wireless printer on your 
network. It isn’t necessary to “install” the printer (or drivers); the iPad uses a technol-
ogy called AirPrint, which is also incorporated into most modern printers. Your iPad 
will automatically locate available AirPrint printers on your wireless network.
IMPORTANT The printing function will locate only printers that support AirPrint 
technology. A list of these printers is available at support.apple.com/kb/HT4356.
You can configure various options for printing files. The options that are available 
depend on the file type:
 
■
When printing any file, you can select the printer and the number of copies of 
the file you want to print.
 
■
If the selected printer supports double-sided printing, you can turn that function 
on or off. 
 
■
When printing a document or presentation, you can specify the range of 
pages or slides you want to print.
 
■
When printing a workbook, you can specify additional layout options, includ-
ing the page size and orientation, the range of data to print, and whether to 
fit the entire worksheet, all rows, or all columns on the page.
TIP The printing function doesn’t currently offer the opportunity for you to preview 
the file content before printing it.

instructions, see the Introduction.
The development and strong adoption of the Office for 
iPad apps signal the start of an important new era in 
which the iPad is evolving from a device that is primarily 
used for entertainment and other content consumption 
purposes to a device that supports content creation and 
can serve as a useful business tool.
Word is the undisputed frontrunner among the Office 
apps. Entering and editing text in a Word document can 
be more challenging on an iPad than on a computer, 
because the iPad doesn’t have an external keyboard 
for fast text entry and a mouse to navigate within or 
rearrange content. However, you can easily connect an 
external Bluetooth keyboard to your iPad if you plan to 
generate a lot of text from scratch.
You can create a simple document with a couple of taps. 
Whether you create a blank document or start from a 
prepopulated template, the importance of the docu-
ment is in the words and images it contains. You can 
enter text in a document by tapping, typing, or dictat-
ing. Then you can provide structure and meaning by 
formatting the text in various ways.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to creating Word documents, entering and manipulat-
ing text, formatting paragraphs, structuring content 
by using line breaks and tabs, and applying character 
formats, text effects, and predefined styles to text.

The Word feature set
As the platforms we work on have expanded from computers to tablets 
to smartphones, Microsoft has developed versions of Word and other 
 programs in the Microsoft Office suite for each of these platforms. The 
experience of working in each version is similar, but the functionality in 
some versions is restricted by the limitations of the platform. The good 
news is that they all work with the same files.
Here is a brief comparison of the features you can use in each version. If 
you can’t perform a specific task in a document on one platform, you can 
put the finishing touches on the document in a different version of Word.
Word for iPad features

Create documents from templates
It’s common to create new documents from scratch by first creating a new, blank 
document and then adding content.
If you’re creating a more complicated document, you can often save time and 
effort by starting from a template. When working in Word for iPad you can create 
common documents such as brochures, letters, newsletters, resumes, invoices, 
flyers, and syllabi from any of the built-in templates.
Templates include preformatted placeholder text and images
TIP At the time of this writing, Word for iPad includes 23 built-in templates. Additional 
templates might be made available with later releases of Word for iPad.
The only templates available from the New page are those that are installed with 
the Word for iPad app. Hundreds of other templates are available for Word Online 
and the desktop versions of Word. If you create a document based on one of these 
templates and save the document to a shared storage location, you can then open 
and edit the document on your iPad.

You can access templates for Word Online from your iPad by using Safari or another 
web browser to visit store.office.live.com/templates/templates-for-Word.
You can preview information about any template by tapping its thumbnail
Word Online and Word for iPad interact nicely on your iPad, so the process of creat-
ing a document from a Word Online template is reasonably simple. When you open 
a template, Word Online creates a document based on that template and automati-
cally saves the document to the OneDrive associated with your user account. You 
can then open the document in Word for iPad by tapping a button in the Word 
Online window.

IMPORTANT You perform many tasks in Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and Power-
Point for iPad by using the same processes. Common processes include those for giving 
commands in the Office user interface and for opening, saving, searching, and distributing 
files. For more information, see Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

TIP If you’re using an external keyboard with your iPad, you can perform many 
operations by using keyboard shortcuts. For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, 
see the Appendix, “Touchscreen and keyboard shortcuts.”
Enter text in documents
The Office for iPad apps were specifically engineered for the screen area and touch-
input capabilities of the iPad. There are many ways to add text content to a docu-
ment when you are using Word for iPad. You can create new text by tapping the 
on-screen keyboard, typing on an external keyboard, or dictating text. By installing 
additional on-screen keyboards on your iPad, you can use the on-screen keyboard 
to enter letters from multiple languages, emoticons, and a huge variety of iconic 
images into a document.
The Emoji keyboard includes nearly 900 emoticon and icon images
93

Given the limitations of tapping and typing text on a small-form device such as 
the iPad, the Siri dictation function partners smartly with Word for iPad to provide a 
simple method of quickly entering a lot of text. It doesn’t take much time to become 
accustomed to dictating at the correct volume and speed, which you can determine 
by trial and error.
In a Word document, the dictation pane replaces the on-screen keyboard and displays the level of audio 
input detected
IMPORTANT The dictation function and the microphone key are available only when 
Siri is turned on and your iPad is connected to the Internet, and only in specific lan-
guages. You can turn on Siri from the General page of the Settings app. You can find a list of 
supported languages at www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#quickType-keyboard-dictation.
The following tips can help you successfully dictate text into a Word document:
 
■
Speak clearly and enunciate each individual word.
 
■
Don’t worry about missing spaces or mistaken words while dictating. You can 
clean up errors manually after entering the text.
 
■
Bookmark errors by speaking a specific word (such as mistake) or describing 
the required correction (such as delete very) so you can easily find them later.
95

Enter text in documents

Magnify the cursor position
Tapping to position the cursor can be an inexact practice, and it can be dif-
ficult to tap in exactly the right place. Word for iPad includes a convenient 
tool that can help with this. When you tap and do not lift your finger (tap 
and hold), a magnifying glass appears and displays a close-up view of the 
cursor location. When you lift your finger, a shortcut bar appears.
Magnifying the cursor location
To enter text from a keyboard
1. Position the cursor where you want to insert the text.
2. Enter text by tapping the on-screen keyboard.
Or
If you’re using an external keyboard, enter text by typing on the keyboard.
SEE ALSO For information about the on-screen keyboard, see “Configure iPad and 
Office app settings” in Chapter 1, “Office for iPad basics,” and the sidebar “Reconfigure 
the on-screen keyboard” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

To switch among installed keyboards
1. Near the lower-left corner of the on-screen keyboard, tap the Globe key until 
the keyboard you want appears.
TIP When you are switching to an alphabetic keyboard, the keyboard name appears 
briefly on the Spacebar.
To dictate text into a document
1. Display the on-screen keyboard.
2. On the on-screen keyboard, to the left of the Spacebar, tap the microphone key.
3. Speak clearly at a high enough volume to change the flat line in the dictation 
pane to a wave form.
4. When you finish, tap Done.
TIP Take care that you don’t cover the iPad’s microphone or microphones while 
dictating. These are located in different places depending on the model of your iPad. 
An iPad Air has dual microphones located on the edge and back of the iPad adjacent to the 
front-facing camera. An iPad Air 2 has dual microphones located on the edge and back of 
the iPad adjacent to the rear-facing camera.
Check spelling
Even the most accurate typists occasionally make mistakes, and it’s much 
easier to do so when you are entering text on a small on-screen keyboard or 
by using a method such as dictation. Word for iPad includes basic proofing 
tools to help ensure that your document content is free of spelling errors. 
These tools are available from the Review tab.
Tapping the Proofing Tools button located at the left end of the Review tab 
displays the Proofing Tools menu, from which you can select a proofing 
language and turn on or off the automatic checking of spelling as you enter 
text in the document.
99
Enter text in documents

Move, copy, and delete text
During the process of entering text in a document, there will be times when you 
want to move or copy content from one area of a document to another, or repurpose 
content that you already created elsewhere. You can reuse existing text sourced from 
the same document, another file, a website, or any electronic resource from which 
content can be copied.
There are five standard operations involved in moving or reusing text and other 
document content:
 
■
Selecting Choosing the content you want to work with
TIP Selecting is often inaccurately referred to as highlighting, because of 
the colored shading that appears over the selected content. Highlighting 
is applying a translucent screen over text.
 
■
Dragging Moving selected content by sliding your finger on the screen
 
■
Cutting Storing selected content on the Clipboard and deleting it from its 
current location
 
■
Copying Storing selected content on the Clipboard without deleting it from 
its current location
 
■
Pasting Inserting content from the Clipboard into the file
You can also simply delete text that you no longer need.
The Clipboard
The Clipboard is a storage area for cut and copied content. The Clipboard 
can store brief or lengthy content segments that can include text, images, 
formatted tables, worksheet data, and any other type of content you can 
cut or copy from an Office document. Unlike the Clipboard in the desktop 
versions of Office, in Office for iPad apps the Clipboard stores only one item 
at a time, and you can’t display the Clipboard contents. You can, however, 
access the Clipboard contents from any Office for iPad app, which enables 
you to copy or move content from one app to another.

Word for iPad displays a handy shortcut bar when you select text. You can perform 
an operation on the selected text by tapping a command on the shortcut bar.
A document with a paragraph selected and the shortcut bar displayed
Because you can have only one document open at a time in Word for iPad, moving 
or copying content from one document to another isn’t quite as simple as it is in the 
desktop versions of Word, but the basic process is the same.
To select text
1. To select a word, double-tap the word.
2. To select a paragraph, triple-tap anywhere in the paragraph.
TIP Selecting any amount of text displays selection handles on each end of 
the selection, and displays a shortcut bar featuring actions that are relevant to 
the selection.
3. To expand or contract a selection, drag the selection handles.
4. To select all the content in a document, tap and hold anywhere in the docu-
ment, and then tap Select All on the shortcut bar.
101
Move, copy, and delete text

Paste options
By default, when you paste text into another location, it retains its original 
formatting. To change the formatting of pasted text, tap the Paste Options 
button that appears when you paste the text.
The options on the Paste Options menu vary based on the content you’re 
pasting and the destination formatting. The four primary options when 
 pasting text are as follows.
 
■
Keep Source Formatting This is the default option. It retains the 
original formatting of the pasted content.
 
■
Use Destination Theme This option applies the theme, fonts, colors, 
and effects of the destination document to the pasted content.
 
■
Match Destination Formatting This option merges the pasted content 
with the destination styles.
 
■
Keep Text Only This option inserts unformatted text.

Move, copy, and delete text

Align, space, and indent paragraphs
You create paragraphs by entering text and then tapping Return. A paragraph 
 usually consists of at least three sentences but can be as short as a single sentence 
or even a single word. Every paragraph ends with a paragraph mark, which looks like 
a backward P (¶). Paragraph marks and other structural characters (such as spaces, 
line breaks, and tabs) are usually hidden, but you can display them by tapping the 
Show/Hide ¶ button (labeled with a paragraph mark) on the Home tab of the ribbon. 
Sometimes displaying these hidden characters makes it easier to accomplish a task 
or understand a structural problem.
SEE ALSO For information about working with hidden structural characters, see 
“Structure content manually” later in this chapter.
You can change the appearance of a paragraph by modifying its left and right edge 
alignment and vertical spacing from the Home tab of the ribbon, and its left and 
right indents from the Home tab or from the ruler. The ruler is usually hidden to 
provide more space for the document content, but you can display it by tapping the 
Ruler slider on the View tab of the ribbon.
The left indent can be set from the Home tab or the ruler
SEE ALSO For information about displaying the ribbon, see “Configure indents” later 
in this topic.
If you modify a paragraph and aren't happy with the changes, you can restore the 
original paragraph and character settings by resetting the paragraph to the Normal 
paragraph style.
104
Chapter 4: Create professional documents

Configure alignment
The alignment setting controls the horizontal position of the paragraph text 
between the page margins. 
There are four alignment options:
 
■
Align Left This is the default paragraph alignment. It sets the left end of 
each line of the paragraph at the left page margin or left indent. It results 
in a straight left edge and a ragged right edge.
 
■
Align Right This sets the right end of each line of the paragraph at the right 
page margin or right indent. It results in a straight right edge and a ragged 
left edge.
 
■
Center This centers each line of the paragraph between the left and right 
page margins or indents. It results in ragged left and right edges.
 
■
Justify This alignment adjusts the spacing between words so that the left 
end of each line of the paragraph is at the left page margin or indent and the 
right end of each line of the paragraph (other than the last line) is at the right 
margin or indent. It results in straight left and right edges.
The icons on the alignment buttons depict the effect of each alignment option.
To set paragraph alignment
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, or select all the paragraphs 
you want to adjust.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Align Left, Center, Align Right, or Justify button.
To reset a paragraph to the Normal paragraph style
1. Select the paragraph you want to reset.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Formatting button, and then tap Clear Formatting.
105
Align, space, and indent paragraphs

Configure vertical spacing
Paragraphs have two types of vertical spacing:
 
■
Paragraph spacing The space between paragraphs, defined by setting the 
space before and after each paragraph. This space is usually measured in 
points.
 
■
Line spacing The space between the lines of the paragraph, defined by set-
ting the height of the lines in relation to the height of the text. This space is 
usually measured in lines.
Word for iPad provides options for setting the line spacing, but not the paragraph 
spacing. The default line spacing for documents created in Word for iPad is 1.0 lines. 
Other available options are 1.15 lines, 1.5 lines, 2 lines, 2.5 lines, and 3 lines. Changing 
the line spacing changes the appearance and readability of the text in the paragraph 
and, of course, also changes the amount of space it occupies on the page.
The effect of changing line spacing
TIP Word for iPad offers only the six preset line spacing options, and no paragraph 
spacing options. You can refine the line spacing and adjust the paragraph spacing in 
Word Online or a desktop version of Word.
106
Chapter 4: Create professional documents

4
To adjust the space between the lines of a paragraph
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, or select all the paragraphs 
you want to adjust.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Line Spacing button, and then tap the preset line 
spacing option you want.
TIP If the on-screen keyboard is displayed, you can hide the keyboard or flick through 
the Line Spacing list to display all the options.
Configure indents
A paragraph indent is the space from the page margin to the text. When working 
with a document in Word for iPad, you can move the left indent by tapping buttons 
on the Home tab, or you can set the indents directly on the ruler. Three indent mark-
ers are always present on the ruler:
 
■
Left Indent This defines the outermost left edge of each line of the 
paragraph.
 
■
Right Indent This defines the outermost right edge of each line of the 
paragraph.
 
■
First Line Indent This defines the starting point of the first line of the 
paragraph.
The ruler indicates the space between the left and right page margins in a lighter 
color than the space outside of the page margins.
The indent markers on the ruler
107
Align, space, and indent paragraphs

The default setting for the Left Indent and First Line Indent markers is 0.0”, which 
aligns with the left page margin. The default setting for the Right Indent marker is 
the distance from the left margin to the right margin. For example, if the page size 
is set to 8.5” wide and the left and right margins are set to 1.0”, the default Right 
Indent marker setting is 6.5”.
In Word for iPad, you can set the indent marker positions on the ruler only by drag-
ging them; you can’t enter a specific measurement for them as you can in Word 
Online and desktop versions of Word. However, when you drag the markers, the 
ruler position of the marker appears on the ruler as you drag it.
Dragging a marker displays its position on the ruler
You can arrange the Left Indent and First Line Indent markers to create a hanging 
indent or a first line indent. Hanging indents are most commonly used for bulleted 
and numbered lists, in which the bullet or number is indented less than the main text 
(essentially, it is outdented). First line indents are frequently used to distinguish the 
beginning of each subsequent paragraph in documents that consist of many consec-
utive paragraphs of text. Both types of indents are set by using the First Line Indent 
marker on the ruler.
SEE ALSO For information about setting page margins, see “Configure page layout” in 
Chapter 6, “Enhance document content.”
To display the ruler
1. On the View tab, tap the Ruler slider to change its background to green.
To indent or outdent the left edge of a paragraph
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, or select all the paragraphs 
you want to adjust.
2. To move the left edge of the paragraph in 0.25” increments, tap the Increase 
Indent or Decrease Indent button on the Home tab.
Or
108
Chapter 4: Create professional documents

4
To move the left edge of the paragraph manually:
a. Display the ruler.
b. On the ruler, drag the Left Indent marker to the ruler measurement at 
which you want to position the left edge of the body of the paragraph.
TIP You can’t outdent a paragraph beyond the left page margin by tapping the 
Decrease Indent button. You can achieve this effect only by dragging the Left Indent 
marker on the ruler. Be aware, though, that content outdented beyond the page margin might 
not print.
To create a hanging indent or first line indent
1. Set the left indent of the paragraph body.
2. On the ruler, drag the First Line Indent marker to the ruler measurement at 
which you want to begin the first line of the paragraph.
TIP The First Line Indent marker is linked to the Left Indent marker. Moving the Left 
Indent marker also moves the First Line Indent marker, to maintain the first line indent 
distance. You can move the First Line Indent marker independently of the Left Indent marker 
to change the first line indent distance.
To indent or outdent the right edge of a paragraph
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, or select all the paragraphs 
you want to adjust.
2. Display the ruler.
3. On the ruler, drag the Right Indent marker to the ruler measurement at which 
you want to set the maximum right edge of the paragraph.
TIP Unless the paragraph alignment is justified, the right edge of the paragraph will 
be ragged, but no line will extend beyond the right indent or outdent.
109
Align, space, and indent paragraphs

Structure content manually
At times it’s necessary to manually position text within a paragraph. You can do this 
by using two different hidden characters: line breaks and tabs. These characters are 
visible only when the option to show paragraph marks and formatting symbols is 
turned on. The hidden characters have distinctive appearances:
 
■
A line break character looks like a bent left arrow: ↵
 
■
A tab character looks like a right-pointing arrow: ➝
You can use a line break, also known as a soft return, to wrap a line of a paragraph 
in a specific location without ending the paragraph. You might use this technique 
to display only specific text on a line, or to break a line before a word that would 
otherwise be hyphenated.
A line break ends the line but not the paragraph
A tab character defines the space between two document elements. For example, 
you can separate numbers from list items, or columns of text, by using tabs. You 
can then set tab stops that define the location and alignment of the tabbed text.
You can align text in different ways by using tabs
To show or hide paragraph marks and formatting symbols
1. On the Home tab, tap the Show/Hide ¶ button.

3. Drag the tab marker to the ruler measurement at which you want to set the tab.
To remove a tab stop
1. Drag the tab marker off the ruler.
Change the appearance of text
The appearance of your document helps to convey not only the document’s mes-
sage but also information about the document’s creator—you. A neatly organized 
document that contains consistently formatted content and appropriate graphic 
elements, and that doesn’t contain spelling or grammatical errors, invokes greater 
confidence in your ability to provide any product or service.
111
Change the appearance of text

Earlier in this chapter, you learned about methods of applying formatting to para-
graphs. This topic covers methods of formatting the text of a document. Formatting 
that you apply to text is referred to as character formatting. In Word for iPad, you 
can apply three types of character formatting:
 
■
Individual character formats including font, font size, bold, italic, underline, 
strikethrough, subscript, superscript, font color, and highlight color
 
■
Artistic text effects that incorporate character outline and fill colors
 
■
Preformatted styles associated with the document template, many of which 
not only affect the appearance of the text but also convey structural informa-
tion (such as titles and headings)
SEE ALSO For information about graphic elements, see Chapter 5, “Add visual 
elements to documents.”
The commands you use to apply individual character formats and artistic text effects 
are grouped on the left end of the Home tab of the ribbon.
Less frequently used formatting commands are available from the Formatting menu
Tapping the Fonts box displays the Fonts menu, which is divided into groups: Theme 
Fonts, Recent Fonts, Office Compatible Fonts, and iOS Fonts. (The Theme Fonts and 
Recent Fonts groups exist only if the current document contains fonts associated 
with those groups.) As you flick through the Fonts menu, the name of the current 
group is shown at the top of the menu so you can select a font that is compatible 
with your intended usage.

Word for iPad includes 15 artistic text effects (sometimes referred to as WordArt). 
Applying a text effect retains the original font and font size but adds various font 
color, gradient, outline, dimensional, and reflection elements.
TIP In the desktop versions of Word, you can apply these same text effects as a 
starting point and then customize the color, outline, shadow, reflection, and glow 
characteristics of the formatted text.
The Text Effects menu displays the 15 available artistic text effects
Each document template includes a selection of preformatted styles that control 
the appearance of entire paragraphs or selected characters. The most basic style, 
Normal, is the one that controls the appearance of unformatted text that you enter 
into the document. Common paragraph styles include Title, Subtitle, Heading 1, 
and Heading 2. Common character styles include Strong and multiple variations of 
Emphasis and Reference. 
113
Change the appearance of text

The styles are available from the menu that expands when you tap the Styles button 
at the right end of the Home tab. The available styles differ based on the document.
The Styles menu displays the styles associated with the current document template
The styles and characteristics of styles that are available in a document are linked 
to the document template. If you create a document from one of the prepopulated 
document templates, or if you’re working in a document that is attached to a custom 
template, the styles will be different from those available when you create a new, 
blank document directly in Word for iPad.
IMPORTANT The overarching concept behind styles is that you can entirely change 
the appearance of the document content by modifying the styles. Unfortunately, you 
can’t directly modify styles in Word for iPad. However, you can modify the styles in a desktop 
version of Word, and they’ll be available when you open the document on your iPad.
Word for iPad includes only a limited number of individual character formats and 
styles. However, if the document you’re working in was created in Word Online or a 
desktop version of Word and contains formatting or styles that you want to reuse, 
you can easily copy existing formatting from one element to another.

Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice

folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the Introduction.
Most Word documents consist primarily of text. In many 
instances, presenting that text within a clear visual struc-
ture is key to ensuring that readers can both discover 
the information you want them to read and locate the 
information they want to find. In larger documents and 
publications, such as this book, reader aids and refer-
ence materials provide structure and  guidance. Typical 
elements include tables of contents, part openers that 
list the related chapters, chapter openers that list the 
chapter objectives, thumb tabs that indicate breaks 
between chapters, and, of course, the extensive index. 
It’s not always possible or realistic to include those ele-
ments. You can, however, provide a navigable structure 
and improve the readability of certain types of content 
by using headings, lists, tables, and images.
The addition of visual or graphic elements such as 
 pictures and drawings can enhance the content of a 
document, and the presentation of information within 
the structure of a list or table can more effectively 
convey information to the reader than if that informa-
tion were provided in narrative format.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating lists and tables, inserting pictures and shapes, 
and formatting the appearance, position, and flow of 
text around those graphic elements.
121

Present content in lists
A list is an effective structure for communicating multiple related pieces of infor-
mation. In Word for iPad, you can create bulleted lists and numbered lists, and you 
can combine these list types within multilevel lists. Each type of list serves a specific 
purpose.
The commands most frequently used when creating lists are located on the Home 
tab of the ribbon.
The Bullets, Numbering, Decrease Indent, and Increase Indent commands
Create bulleted lists
Bulleted lists are appropriate for presenting information when the order of the infor-
mation is not important. For example, bulleted lists can be used to present a set of 
related items (such as names, tasks, or groceries) or a series of informational para-
graphs. Formatting multiple pieces of information as a bulleted list can help them 
stand out from the surrounding text as a cohesive set.
TIP Bulleted lists are also referred to as unordered lists because the list structure 
doesn’t connote a specific order, such as order of occurrence or priority. You can, 
however, introduce a bulleted list with a statement of order, such as “These are my favorite 
vacation destinations, in alphabetical order.”
You can format existing paragraphs of text as a bulleted list or format an empty 
paragraph as a bulleted list item and then enter text. Each bulleted list item is one 
paragraph of text. You can choose from the seven bullet symbols that are available 
in Word for iPad.
Chapter 5: Add visual elements to documents
122

5
Multilevel bulleted lists can use a variety of bullet symbols to indicate level and add meaning to list items
TIP In the desktop versions of Word, you can choose any symbols, characters, or 
pictures as bullet symbols, and you can control the font, size, and color of the bullet 
symbols. If you need to designate a more complex bullet symbol, save the document to a 
shared location and open it in a desktop version of the program.
To format existing text as a bulleted list
1. Select the paragraphs that you want to format as bulleted list items.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Bullets button, and then tap the bullet symbol you 
want to use at the beginning of each list item.
To format a single paragraph as a bulleted list item
1. Position the cursor at the beginning of the paragraph.
2. Enter * (an asterisk) followed by a space.
 TIP If you want to start a paragraph with an asterisk rather than formatting it as a 
bulleted list item, tap the Undo button.
Present content in lists
123

To create a bulleted list as you type
1. Create a blank paragraph where you want to start the list, and position the 
cursor in the paragraph.
2. Enter * (an asterisk) followed by a space to format the paragraph as a bulleted 
list item.
Or
On the Home tab, tap the Bullets button, and then tap the bullet symbol you 
want to use.
3. Enter the content of the first list item, and then tap the Return key to create 
the next bulleted list item.
4. Continue to enter content and tap Return to add subsequent list items.
5. To end the list, do one of the following:
 
●
To start the next paragraph at the left margin, tap Return twice.
 
●
To indent the next paragraph at the same level as the list, tap Return and 
then tap Backspace.
TIP Starting the paragraph that follows a list item at the margin indicates that 
it is a continuation of the text that preceded the list. Indenting the paragraph 
indicates that it is a continuation of the list item.
To change the bullet symbol of an existing bulleted list
1. Tap anywhere in the bulleted list you want to change.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Bullets button, and then tap the symbol you want 
to use.
To change the bullet symbol of one bulleted list item
1. Select any text in the list item you want to change.
TIP You can select from one character to the entire paragraph to change the 
bullet symbol for only the individual list item.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Bullets button, and then tap the symbol you want 
to use.
Chapter 5: Add visual elements to documents
124

5
Create numbered lists
Numbered lists are intended for the presentation of items in a specific order or 
quantity; for example, sequential steps for performing a process, or a “top 10” list.
TIP Numbered lists are also referred to as ordered lists because the list structure does 
connote an order, such as order of operation, preference, or performance level. The 
sentence that introduces the list usually specifies the meaning of the order.
You can format existing paragraphs of text as a numbered list or format a blank 
paragraph as a numbered list item and then enter text. Each numbered list item is 
one paragraph of text.
Multilevel numbered lists present information in a hierarchical structure and permit readers to refer  
to specific information by item number
To format existing text as a numbered list
1. Ensure that each list item is in its own paragraph, and then select the 
paragraphs.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Numbering button, and then tap the number 
format you want to use.
Present content in lists
125

IMPORTANT At the time of this writing, if you enter or format numbered list items 
and then separately format adjacent paragraphs as list items, the two lists do not merge; 
the numbering of each separately formatted set of items starts at 1. To resolve this issue, select 
all the list items that you want to number consecutively. Display the Numbering menu, tap 
None, redisplay the Numbering menu, and then tap the numbering style you want to use.
To format a single paragraph as a numbered list item
1. Position the cursor at the beginning of the paragraph.
2. Enter the number 1 followed by a period and a space.
TIP If you want to start a paragraph with a number rather than formatting it as a 
numbered list item, tap the Undo button.
To create a numbered list as you type
1. Create a blank paragraph where you want to start the list, and position the 
cursor in the paragraph.
2. Enter the number 1 followed by a period and a space to format the paragraph 
as a numbered list item.
3. Enter the first list item, and then tap the Return key to create the next 
 numbered list item.
4. Enter items and tap Return to add subsequent list items.
5. To end the list, do one of the following:
 
●
To start the next paragraph at the left margin, tap Return twice.
 
●
To indent the next paragraph at the same level as the list, tap Return and 
then tap Backspace.
To change the numbering style of an existing numbered list
1. Tap anywhere in the numbered list you want to change.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Numbering button, and then tap the numbering 
style you want to use.
Chapter 5: Add visual elements to documents
126

5
Create multilevel lists
Bulleted and numbered lists can have multiple levels, each with a different bullet 
symbol or numbering style. You can create multilevel lists by increasing the indent 
of each lower-level list item. Increasing the indent automatically applies the hanging 
indent, tab stop, and bullet symbol or number style of the next level.
The standard bullet for a first-level list item is a black circle. By default, Word uses a 
hollow circle for second-level lists and a black square for third-level lists, and then it 
repeats that pattern for subsequent list levels.
A simple three-level bulleted list
The standard numbering for a first-level list item is the number followed by a period. 
By default, Word uses lowercase letters for second-level list items and lowercase 
roman numerals for third-level list items.
A simple three-level numbered list
Present content in lists
127

It is also common to provide information in bulleted (unordered) lists within num-
bered (ordered) lists—for example, when presenting options for a specific step of a 
procedure. In Word for iPad, you can assign any of the available bullet symbols or 
numbering styles to multilevel list items.
Multilevel lists can mix numbers and bullets
To demote multiple bulleted or numbered list items
1. Select the list items you want to demote.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Increase Indent button.
To demote a single bulleted or numbered list item
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the list item, and then tap the Increase Indent 
button.
Or
If you’re working with an external keyboard connected to your iPad, position 
the cursor at the beginning of a list item, and then press the Tab key.
To promote multiple bulleted or numbered list items
1. Select the list items you want to promote.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Decrease Indent button.
TIP Use the procedures described in the preceding sections of this topic for changing 
bullet symbols and numbering styles in multilevel and mixed-type lists.
Chapter 5: Add visual elements to documents
128

To promote a single bulleted or numbered list item
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the list item, and then tap the Decrease 
Indent button.
Or
If you’re working with an external keyboard connected to your iPad, position 
the cursor at the beginning of a list item, and then press the Delete key.
Present content in tables
Tables provide a structure within which you can organize information into a series of 
columns and rows. Tables can contain text, numeric data, or images.
A basic table with the default formatting and alignment settings
In Word for iPad, you can create a table in a document by using any of these three 
methods:
 
■
Insert a blank table, modify the table structure, and enter content.
 
■
Convert existing text to a table.
 
■
Paste a table from another document or source file, such as an Excel 
worksheet.
The intersection of each column and row is a cell. Each cell of the table can contain 
content. If appropriate, you can merge multiple cells within a row or column. Head-
ings that classify the table data are usually presented in the first row of the table, 
and sometimes in the first column.
Present content in tables
129

When you’re working in a table, the Table tool tab appears on the ribbon. This tab 
contains commands for inserting and deleting table elements, formatting the appear-
ance of the table, aligning content within cells (both vertically and horizontally), and 
sizing table columns to fit their content, to fit the page, or to be a specific width.
Changing column width and alignment makes a table look more professional
TIP You can modify the left and right indents of the table and the width and padding 
of the columns by dragging the markers on the ruler. When a table, is active, the ruler 
displays markers for the table columns and the content of the current column.
SEE ALSO For information about configuring the alignment of text within tables, see 
“Align, space, and indent paragraphs” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”
Word for iPad provides options for formatting the appearance of a table by applying 
preset border and shading combinations. The placement of the border and shading 
helps to emphasize any of these table features that you select:
 
■
Header row
 
■
Banded rows
 
■
Total row
 
■
First column
 
■
Banded columns
 
■
Last column

IMPORTANT Formatting a Total row in Word for iPad doesn’t make any mathematical 
operations available within the row. You can insert mathematic formulas into table cells 
in the desktop version of Word. If you want to perform extensive calculations on the content 
of a table, you can create or work with the table content in Excel for iPad. For information 
about formulas and functions, see “Perform data-processing operations” in Chapter 8, 
“Process and present numeric data.”
The available table color schemes are set by the document theme, so the table for-
matting will blend in with other colored elements in the document (such as headings 
and drawings) to give it a professional appearance. You can also select from the 10 
standard colors available in all the Office for iPad apps or choose custom colors from 
a color spectrum.
Style options such as banded shading can help readers locate information
To format existing text as a table
1. To create a multicolumn table, put the content of each row into one paragraph 
and insert a tab character to separate the content of each column.
TIP To insert a tab character, tap and hold. On the shortcut bar that appears, 
tap Insert, and then tap Tab.
2. Select the paragraphs.
3. On the Insert tab, tap Table.
IMPORTANT To create a multicolumn table, ensure that every paragraph in the 
selection includes at least one tab character. If any paragraph doesn’t contain a tab 
character, Word for iPad creates a single-column table with one row for each paragraph and 
retains the tab characters within the content.

a variety of picture formats and effects to the image, and control the layout of the 
image and surrounding text on the page.
Insert and modify pictures
By using Word for iPad, you can insert images into a document from a variety of iPad 
and iCloud sources, including your iPad Camera Roll and Photo Stream albums. 
TIP In other versions of Word, you can insert images from external online sources. It’s 
possible that as Microsoft releases additional updates to Word for iPad, other sources 
will become available. Until then, you can get external images to your iPad by saving them to 
your iPad from email messages or from another computer to your Photo Stream.

Use pictures to enhance and expand on text content
You can insert a picture in its own paragraph or within another paragraph. The best 
location is somewhat dependent on how you want text to flow around the image 
on the page. When you insert an image, it is associated with a paragraph, which is 
referred to as an anchor. When paragraph marks and formatting symbols are dis-
played and the image is selected, an anchor symbol indicates the anchor paragraph.
Each image is anchored to a paragraph

and text” later in this chapter.

About Photo Streams
A Photo Stream is an online storage folder that is hosted on iCloud. You 
can configure your iPad and other devices to automatically copy images 
that you capture on the devices to the Photo Stream. This creates a backup 
version of the locally stored image and also makes the image available from 
other devices (including computers running Windows). You can store up to 
1,000 images for up to 30 days each in your Photo Stream.
To turn on the Photo Stream feature for your Apple account, follow these 
steps:
1. Open iCloud on your Mac or PC.
2. Enter your Apple ID if required, and select either or both photo 
options: My Photo Stream or Photo Sharing.
To configure your iPad to automatically upload photos to your Photo 
Stream, follow these steps:
1. Open the Settings app.
2. In the Settings list, tap Photos & Camera, or tap iCloud and then tap 
Photos.
3. On the Photos & Camera or Photos page, tap the My Photo Stream 
slider to change its background color to green.
Your Photo Stream is automatically available on the devices that upload 
images to it—in other words, the devices you sign in to by using your 
Apple ID. You can also access it from other computers by installing iCloud.
For information about setting up iCloud on an iPad, a Mac computer, or a 
computer running Windows, visit www.apple.com/icloud/setup/ios.html.
Inserting or selecting a picture activates its sizing handles and the Picture tool tab. 
This tab contains commands for formatting the appearance of a picture and control-
ling its position relative to text, images, and other page elements.
If a picture depicts more content than you want to show—for example, if the back-
ground dwarfs the primary subject of the picture or the picture contains content

that isn’t pertinent to your purpose, you can crop it. Cropping an image simulates 
cutting away parts of the image to display only a portion of it.
You have several different options when you crop an image. For example, you can:
 
■
Specify or disregard the aspect ratio of the cropped image.
 
■
Move the picture to position the intended subject within the cropped image.
 
■
Adjust the size of the cropped image to fit the picture content.
 
■
Adjust the size of the picture to fit the content to the cropped size.
A picture cropped to display a portion of the image at a 1:1 aspect ratio
Resizing, rotating, or cropping a picture affects the appearance of the picture in the 
document; it doesn’t make any permanent changes to the original picture. You can 
undo your changes at any time.
You can make several types of changes to pictures that are embedded in documents. 
Some of these changes appear to change the picture itself; others apply effects to 
the picture.

You can modify the height and width of a picture by dragging the handles that 
appear when you tap the picture to select it or activate it for editing. You can also 
rotate the picture so that it appears at a different angle than the original.
You resize and rotate an image by dragging its handles
TIP Rotating a picture can make it appear that the picture was taken with the camera 
held at a different angle—you can use this method to straighten a picture that isn’t 
properly aligned.
To insert a picture in a document
1. Position the cursor in the location where you want to insert the picture.
2. On the Insert tab, tap Pictures to display the Photos menu.
The content of the Photos menu varies depending on your device, the 
installed version of iOS, and the storage locations you’ve configured. The 
Photos menu might display the contents of your local Camera Roll album, 
your Photo Stream album, your iCloud photo library, or shared albums that 
you’ve created or subscribed to.
3. On the Photos menu, tap the storage location from which you want to insert 
the picture. Then locate and tap the picture you want to insert.

c. Drag the sizing handles to make the image larger or smaller while keeping 
the crop size the same.
d. Drag the corner crop handles to change the size of the cropped image 
while maintaining the selected aspect ratio.
TIP You can repeat the cropping process to change the aspect ratio, picture size, or 
magnification, or to remove the cropping effect. For information about resetting an 
image to its original size and aspect ratio, see “Replace and reset pictures” later in this topic.
To rotate a picture
1. Select the picture.
2. Drag the Rotate handle in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction until the 
picture is at the angle of rotation you want.
Apply styles and effects to pictures
You can apply preset combinations of visual effects, called picture styles, to a pic-
ture. Picture styles incorporate elements such as frames, shapes, edges, shadows, 
reflections, and angles. Some of these combinations of effects cause the image to 
appear three-dimensional.
TIP Word for iPad supports the same 28 picture styles as the full desktop versions 
of Word.
If you want to enhance a picture without quite as many special effects, you can add 
a shadow or reflection to it.
You can choose from 23 different shadow effects: nine outer shadows (each empha-
sizing the outside of one corner or side of the picture, or placed directly behind the 
picture); nine inner shadows that emphasize the inside of the same locations; and five 
Chapter 5: Add visual elements to documents

“perspective” shadows that give the picture a three-dimensional appearance. There 
are nine reflection variations, presented in three rows. Each row includes the same 
three options: Tight, which reflects the bottom third of the picture; Half, which 
reflects the bottom half of the picture; and Full, which reflects the entire picture. The 
first row positions the reflection touching the picture, the second row positions the 
reflection 4 points below the picture, and the third row positions the reflection 8 
points below the picture.
The available reflection variations represent three levels of reflection at varying distances from the picture
To apply a style to a picture
1. Tap the picture to select it.
2. On the Picture tool tab, tap Styles.
3. On the Styles menu, tap the style you want to apply to the picture.

Replace and reset pictures
After you insert and format a picture, you might find that another picture is more 
appropriate for the situation. You can replace an embedded picture with another, 
without losing the changes you’ve made.
When you replace a picture, Word applies the changes you made to the original 
picture to the replacement picture. You can take advantage of this if you want to 
 display multiple pictures with the same sizing and effects—insert and format the 
first picture, copy the picture and paste as many copies as you need into the docu-
ment, and then replace each of the copies with another picture.
When you apply a style or effect to a picture in a document, the appearance of the 
picture changes, but the original picture doesn’t. You can change or remove effects 
that you apply to the picture at any time.
IMPORTANT If a picture is significantly larger than the page you insert it on, Word 
adjusts the proportions of the picture to fit it onto the page. Resetting the size of a 
picture returns it to its actual dimensions, which will not necessarily be the size it was when 
you inserted it. You might, therefore, need to resize the picture again to fit the page.
To replace a picture
1. Tap the picture to select it.
2. On the shortcut bar that appears, tap Replace.
3. On the Photos menu that appears, tap the storage location of the replace-
ment photo, locate the photo, and then tap it.
To remove all changes made to a picture
1. Tap the picture to select it.
2. On the Picture tool tab, tap Reset.
3. On the Reset menu, do one of the following:
 
●
To remove styles and effects from the picture, tap Reset Picture.
 
●
To revert the picture to its original size but retain styles and effects, tap 
Reset Size.
 
●
To undo all modifications to the picture, tap both options in turn.

Insert and format shapes
If you want to add visual interest and impact to a document but don’t need anything 
as specific as a picture, you can use shapes.
The Shapes menu includes a wide variety of shapes
You can choose from many different shapes, which are grouped by category: Lines, 
Rectangles, Basic Shapes, Block Arrows, Equation Shapes, Flowchart Shapes, Stars 
and Banners, and Callouts. All the shapes other than those in the Lines category 
 support the addition of text, although some display it better than others.
Many shapes are designed to display text
Word for iPad inserts each shape into the document at the default size and aspect 
ratio, and anchors it to a paragraph. You can then change the shape’s dimensions, 
angles, and rotation to create exactly the shape you want. You can arrange multiple 
shapes to draw iconic images.
Chapter 5: Add visual elements to documents
146

TIP You can add text to any shape other than a simple line. You can format the text on 
a shape by using the same methods you would to format document text. For more 
information, see “Insert and animate shapes” in Chapter 9, “Create compelling presentations.”
Nine shapes arranged to create a recognizable image
When you insert a new shape it has a blue outline and, depending on the shape, 
might be filled with blue. You can modify the outline color and fill color indepen-
dently, or you can apply any of the 42 preformatted shape styles.
The available styles reflect the document color scheme
Insert and format shapes
147

Shape styles combine fill color, outline color, transparency, and shadows to create 
a professional palette of options based on the color scheme of the document.
You modify the height, width, and rotation of a shape in the same way that you 
modify those aspects of a picture.
SEE ALSO For information about resizing and rotating images, see “Insert and format 
pictures” earlier in this chapter. For information about controlling the position and 
order of shapes, see “Arrange images and text” later in this chapter.

Arrange images and text
In a text-heavy document, the relationship of pictures or shapes (collectively referred 
to in this section as images) to the text on the page can make a significant difference 
in the readability and professional appearance of the document. You can move 
images within the document to change their relationship to the document text. You 
can also configure an image to control the way that text wraps around it.
Text wrapping allows you to incorporate graphics into existing content
Arrange images and text
151

The text wrapping options have descriptive names and icons that accurately depict 
the application of each option. The options are:
 
■
In Line with Text The image is placed directly within a paragraph.
 
■
Square Text wraps around all four sides of the image. The image sits within a 
rectangular space that is the maximum height and width of the image.
 
■
Tight Text wraps around all four sides of the image, but no space is reserved 
on the left and right sides; the text flows to the edge of the image.
 
■
Through Text wraps around all four sides of the image, including through any 
open space on the top or bottom of the image.
 
■
Top and Bottom Text flows above and below the image, but not on either 
side. This is the default text wrapping for a picture or shape you insert in 
Word for iPad.
 
■
Behind Text The text flow is not affected by the image, which appears behind 
the text. The text might interfere with the reader’s view of the image.
 
■
In Front of Text The text flow is not affected by the image, which appears in 
front of the text and might block the reader’s view of the text.
If you insert several images and then position them so that they overlap, they are 
said to be “stacked.” The stacking order (which object appears on top of which) is 
initially determined by the order in which you inserted the images, but it can also 
be determined by other factors such as the text wrapping setting of each image. If 
all the images use the same text wrapping style, you can change the order of the 
images by moving them toward (or to) the top or bottom of the stack.
If you can’t find a way to make an image work within a document, you can, of 
course, delete it.
To move an image within a document
1. Tap the image to select it.
2. Drag the image to the target location.
Or
On the shortcut bar that appears, tap Cut. Display the target location, double-
tap to position the cursor and display the shortcut menu, and then tap Paste.

instructions, see the Introduction.
Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents,” discussed 
the various graphic elements you can add to a document 
to convey information, brand the document, or simply 
provide decoration. Beyond these visual elements, there 
are ways that you can format the content of a document 
to put the finishing touches on it.
You can lay out long segments of text in columns to 
make them more readable, or long lists of items in col-
umns to fit more on the page. You can draw attention to 
a quotation by displaying it in a text box that floats on 
the page. You can provide ancillary text in text boxes or 
in footnotes, or you can provide a link from within the 
document directly to a reference webpage.
When the document content is ready, you can specify 
the dimensions of the printable space and add headers, 
footers, and page numbers if appropriate. You can then 
invite other people to review the document, provide 
feedback, and make edits for your review and approval.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to laying out text in columns or text boxes, linking to 
external content, creating footnotes, controlling the 
layout of content on the page, tracking changes, and 
working with comments.
159

Configure text in columns
You can configure a section of text to display in two or three columns, rather than a 
single page-width column. You can use columns for different purposes. For example, 
long sections of text (such as newspaper articles) are often formatted in partial-page 
columns so that people can more easily read the content. Columns are also useful 
for displaying more than one page of short entries (such as a word list) on one page.
The ruler displays the margins and indents for the active column
By default, Word divides the columns as evenly as possible. If you don’t like the loca-
tion of the column breaks—for example, if you don’t want to break a column in the 
middle of a paragraph—you can set them manually.

Chapter 6: Enhance document content

Display column-related marks and tools
Columnar text is set off from the surrounding text by dividers called section 
breaks, which are visible when you display paragraph marks, spaces, tabs, 
and other hidden formatting symbols in the document. It can be useful 
to display the section breaks when you want to modify the content of the 
columns or remove them.
Continuous section breaks mark the beginning and end of the columnar content
Another tool that is useful for working with columns, but not shown by 
default, is the ruler. You can modify the margins and indents of the active 
column by dragging the markers on the ruler.
To display hidden formatting symbols, tap the Show/Hide ¶ button located 
at the right end of the Home tab. To display the ruler, tap the Ruler slider on 
the View tab to change the slider background to green.
SEE ALSO For information about using page and section breaks to structure 
document content, see “Configure page layout” later in this chapter. For 
information about indent and tab markers on the ruler, see “Align, space, 
and indent paragraphs” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”

Configure text in columns

Draw and format text boxes
When you want to display text that is independent of the standard flow of con-
tent on a page, you can do so by inserting the content in a text box. Text boxes are 
containers that you can position either in a specific location on a page or relative to 
other page elements. Common uses for text boxes are as containers for sidebars and 
quotes that you pull from the content (referred to as pull quotes).
Sidebars can contain ancillary content that you want readers to notice
If the text you want to feature in a text box already exists in the document you can 
select the text and create a text box around it. Otherwise, you can insert a blank text 
box and enter content into it. Then you can move, resize, and format the text box.
You format the content of a text box independently of the surrounding text. You can 
define the outline color, fill color, and text effects (referred to on the Shape tool tab 
as WordArt Styles). 
164
Chapter 6: Enhance document content

6
Text boxes that you create in Word for iPad are always square or rectangular, 
although you can make the text box appear to be a different shape by placing a 
shape on top of an unformatted text box.
You control the way that text flows around a text box in the same way that you 
control the flow of text around a graphic. You can position the text box in line with 
other text, wrap text around the text box, or position the text box behind or in front 
of the document content.
SEE ALSO For information about working with shapes, see “Insert and format shapes” 
and “Arrange images and text” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents,” and 
“Add visual elements to slides” in Chapter 9, “Create compelling presentations.”
You can apply a thematic style to the text box or format the text box outline and fill 
colors independently. You can also apply a WordArt text effect to the text within the 
text box. (The WordArt effects could be appropriate when placing a title or short 
slogan in the text box, but aren’t well-suited to longer sections of text.)
SEE ALSO For information about text effects, see “Change the appearance of text” in 
Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”
The commands that you use to format text boxes are on the Shape tool tab, which is 
visible when the text box or its content is active.
Each command on the Shape tool tab displays a menu of options
To create a text box that contains existing text

the page. To do so, first select the text you want to rotate. Then, on the Layout tab, tap Text 
Direction, and tap Rotate All Text 90°. When working with text in a text box, you also have 
the option to rotate text 270° so that it reads from bottom to top.
Reference additional information
When you are creating a document, it is sometimes useful to be able to refer the 
reader to external content on the Internet. You can make that content easily avail-
able to readers by inserting a hyperlink from a location in your document to the web 
content. It is customary to hyperlink from a word or short phrase (such as click here), 
but you can also hyperlink from images and other content elements. The hyperlinked 
text or object (the anchor) appears underlined. The reader taps or clicks the underlined 
content to open the webpage you’ve specified, in his or her default web browser.
If you want to provide only a small amount of ancillary information and make it 
quickly available within the context of the document, you can insert a footnote at 
a specific location in the document that refers the reader to the related supporting 
content at the bottom of the page. Footnotes are often used to attribute quoted 
information to its original source.
Footnotes that you insert in Word for iPad are identified by numbers, starting with 
1, rather than by letters, roman numerals, or symbols. If you want to use something 
other than consecutive numbers to identify footnotes in a document, or if you want 
the footnotes to appear immediately after the text on the page or at the end of the 
document, rather than at the bottom of the page, you can configure those from a 
desktop version of Word.

Reference additional information

Configure page layout
Page layout is the way that text and other content fits onto the pages of a document. 
You can define the basic layout of a document by specifying the dimensions of the 
content area and the document information that appears outside of the content area. 
You can control the amount of content that falls on each page. If necessary, you can 
divide a document into sections and define the characteristics of each section.
Specify the dimensions of the content area
When you are configuring the presentation of a document, the primary boundaries 
are defined by three settings: the dimensions of the page (the page size), the direction 
of the page (the page orientation), and the space between the content boundaries 
and the edge of the page (the page margins).
The commands that are most frequently used to define the content area are available 
from the Layout tab of the ribbon.
The page layout commands and margin options
There are two page orientation options: Portrait and Landscape. These options are 
appropriately named for the type of content that would be printed at each orienta-
tion. In practice, most documents have a portrait orientation (with the page higher 
than it is wide). Landscape orientation (with the page wider than it is high) is standard 
for content that requires a greater width to display appropriately, such as documents 
with complex tables, worksheets with many columns of data, and full-page slides.
170
Chapter 6: Enhance document content

6
The page size is almost always defined by the paper you’re planning to print on. 
Word for iPad supports seven page sizes: Letter (8.5 by 11 inches), Legal (8.5 by 14 
inches), A3, A4, A5, B4 JIS, and B5 JIS.
 
■
The Letter and Legal paper sizes are part of a group of paper size standards 
known as “loose” standards, which don’t follow any specific guidelines but are 
the official paper standards of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
 
■
The A series of paper sizes has an aspect ratio of one to the square root of 
two (approximately 1:1.4) and is the official paper standard of most European 
countries and regions.
 
■
The JIS-B series represents the Japan Industrial Standard (JIS) paper size 
standard and has an area approximately 1.2 times that of the corresponding 
A series paper sizes.
The most common paper sizes are 8.5-by-11 inches in the United States and Canada, 
and A4 in most other countries and regions. Your installation of Word for iPad is 
probably set to default to the common paper size for your country or region. Some-
times, though, you’ll create a document that you intend to print at a different size, 
such as a legal contract, and you’ll need to change the page size.
The page margins define the space around the outside edge of the page that is 
blank other than any headers, footers, or page numbers you choose to display. The 
following table details the six margin options that Word for iPad supports.
Margin name

TIP These are the same standard margins supported by the desktop versions of Word. 
The desktop versions also allow you to set custom margins.

Add page headers and footers
As previously mentioned, document margins are empty of any content other than 
headers, footers, and page numbers.
The header is a defined area within the top page margin, and the footer is a defined 
area within the bottom page margin. You can insert text and images in the page 
headers and footers. By default, the header and footer content appears on every page 
of the document. You can configure different header and footer content for the first 
page and for all subsequent pages, and for odd pages and even pages. Here are some 
examples of when you might want to configure different headers and footers:
 
■
If your document has a cover page, leave the header and footer of the cover 
page blank, and display information only in the headers and footers of subse-
quent pages. 
 
■
If your document will be printed double-sided and page-turned like a book, 
configure different headers and footers for odd and even pages, and position 
the information on the outside margin of each.
You can turn on both options (different first page and different odd and even pages) 
for documents that have a cover page and will be printed double-sided.
172
Chapter 6: Enhance document content

The active header and footer and corresponding options
The header and footer areas have preset tab stops to position content at the left 
margin, in the center, and at the right margin. Inserting one tab character aligns the 
subsequent content with the horizontal center of the page; inserting two tab charac-
ters right-aligns the subsequent content with the right margin.
You can format the header content and adjust the tab stops to fit your needs
SEE ALSO For information about tabs, see “Align, space, and indent paragraphs” in 
Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”
173
Configure page layout

As you flick through a document vertically in Word for iPad, the page number 
appears temporarily near the bottom of the app window. The page number shown 
corresponds to the page of the document when it is printed at the current page 
layout settings. You can also display the page number in the header or footer so that 
it is visible in the printed document. You don’t have to enter the correct number on 
each page; Word enters it for you and keeps it up to date.
The default setting when you turn on page numbers is for the number to appear at 
the right end of the footer on every page of the document. You can configure the 
position, alignment, and format of the page number, and whether the page number 
is shown on the first page. (When a document has a cover page, it is standard prac-
tice to omit the page number from that cover page.)
To activate the document header or footer area for editing
1. Double-tap the document header area or document footer area.
Or
1. On the Insert tab, tap the Header & Footer button.
2. On the Header & Footer menu, tap Edit Header or Edit Footer.
To display information in a document header or footer

2. On the Header & Footer menu, tap the Different First Page slider to change 
its background to green. Then tap Edit Header.
3. Move to the first page of the document. Enter the  content in the header and 
footer that you want to display on only that page (or leave them blank).
4. In the second page header and footer, enter the content you want to display 
on the second and subsequent pages.

To display different headers and footers on odd and even pages
1. On the Insert tab, tap the Header & Footer button.
2. On the Header & Footer menu, tap the Different Odd & Even slider to 
change its background to green. Then tap Edit Header.
3. In the second page header and footer, enter the content you want to display 
on even-numbered pages.
4. In the third page header and footer, enter the content you want to display on 
odd-numbered pages.
TIP When you turn the pages of a document that is printed double-sided, the 
odd-numbered pages appear on the right (recto) and even-numbered pages on the 
left (verso). You can ensure that header or footer content is always on the outside edge of the 
page by positioning it on the left side of even pages and on the right side of odd pages.
To remove all content from the header or footer
1. On the Insert tab, tap the Header & Footer button.
2. On the Header & Footer menu, tap Remove Header or Remove Footer.

Manage page and section breaks
When the content of a document doesn’t fit between the top and bottom margins 
of one page, Word inserts soft page breaks to create additional pages. If you don’t 
like the location of a page break, you can break the page earlier by inserting a 
manual page break. (Or you can change the margins, but that will affect the layout 
of the entire document.)
TIP Word for iPad doesn’t provide access to paragraph line and page break settings 
that permit you to specify whether or where paragraphs can break across pages. For 
this finer level of control, edit the document in a desktop version of Word.
If you want to change more than a page break, you can divide a document into 
sections. For each section of the document, you can configure the page layout 
 differently. For example:
 
■
If you’re working in a document that has the usual portrait page orientation 
(with the page higher than it is wide) and you need to display a large table or 
graphic, or other content that is wider than the page, you can put that content 
in its own section and configure the section to display and print in a landscape 
orientation (with the page wider than it is high).
 
■
If you want specific document content to have wider or narrower page mar-
gins than the rest of the document, you can put that content in its own section 
and configure the margins of each section separately.
 
■
If you plan to print a multipage document double-sided and want to make 
sure that a specific page (such as the beginning of a new chapter of a book) 
prints on the “front” side of the page, you can start a new section and config-
ure the section to start on the next odd-numbered page.
TIP Section breaks are also used to start and end columnar formatting. For more 
information, see “Configure text in columns” at the beginning of this chapter.
176
Chapter 6: Enhance document content

6
The type of section break you insert determines the starting location of the content 
immediately following the section break. The section break options are Continuous 
(which doesn’t force a page break), and Next Page, Even Page, and Odd Page (which 
forces the content that follows the section break onto the next page, the next even-
numbered page, or the next odd-numbered page.
TIP Section breaks are also used to start and end columnar formatting. For more 
information, see “Configure text in columns” at the beginning of this chapter.
To start a new page
1. Position the cursor at the beginning of the content that will start the next page.
2. On the Layout tab, tap the Breaks button.

Collaborate on document content
Teams of people frequently work together to develop business documents. Gone 
are the days of passing around printouts and trying to figure out what changes to 
enter—by using Word, you and your colleagues can collaborate directly within the 
document file. Word has many features to simplify the process of collaborating on 
documents. Chief among these are change tracking and comments.
Track and review changes
During the writing and reviewing processes, document authors can track the changes 
they make to content, either for their own reference or for other people to review. 
When change tracking is turned on, Word tracks the insertion, deletion, and move-
ment of text, and changes to formatting. You can turn off the tracking of each of 
these elements individually.
You can display insertions and deletions inline or in balloons
The commands that you use to manage change tracking and tracked changes are 
located on the Review tab.

Simultaneous coauthoring
Within the Office 365 structure, it is increasingly easy for Word users to col-
laborate with other document authors while developing content. Word for 
iPad, Word Online, and the desktop versions of Word all support co authoring 
of documents that are stored in shared locations such as SharePoint or One-
Drive. Multiple people who have access to the document storage location 
can open the document on their own computers or iPads, review the docu-
ment content, and make changes to the document content simultaneously.
Coauthoring of files stored in a SharePoint document library works only for 
files that aren’t checked out for the exclusive use of any one person.
When multiple people are editing a document, the Share icon at the right 
end of the ribbon changes to display the number of concurrent authors. You 
can tap the Share icon to display the user account names of the people who 
currently have the file open.
You can coauthor documents with colleagues who are using Word on any device
Word locks the content of any paragraph for the exclusive use of the person 
who is editing that paragraph. Depending on the version of Word an author 
is working in, changes are available to other document authors as soon as 
they’re made or when the document is saved.
When reviewing a document, you can display it with the tracked changes visible, dis-
play the document as it would look if all the changes were incorporated, or display 
the original version without any of the changes. A vertical gray line in the left margin 
indicates each line of text that contains changes.
Word assigns a color to each reviewer for the purpose of tracking changes and 
inserting comments. In Word for iPad the color is based on your user account.
179

Excel provides a practical yet powerful data manage-
ment framework. You can store massive quantities of 
data within this deceptively simple structure, analyze 
that data, and present the resulting information in a 
variety of structures. The key ingredient in all of these 
tasks is the original data. The final presentation or 
analysis is only as good as the data it’s based on. This 
“garbage in, garbage out” rule is true for many business 
tools, programs, and processes; Excel is no exception.
A worksheet can contain a vast amount of static and 
calculated data. You can structure worksheet content so 
that data is presented correctly on the screen and when 
printed, and you can format data so that it is easier for 
readers to locate and understand specific categories of 
information.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to creating workbooks and worksheets, managing 
worksheets and worksheet elements, populating work-
sheets with text or numeric data, modifying worksheet 
structure, and formatting data for presentation. It also 
includes procedures for efficiently displaying, filtering, 
and sorting data to provide specific information and 
perspectives.

Create workbooks
As with other Office files, you can create a blank Excel workbook or a workbook 
that contains content from a template. Excel templates focus more on purpose 
than on appearance; they provide structure and functionality for specific types of 
information.
The templates that are available from within Excel for iPad range from a simple to-do 
list to a complex financial report and include expense reports, sales reports, household 
budgets, marketing budgets, time sheets, invoices, loan calculators, and ledgers. Most 
of the templates include basic calculations; some include advanced calculations and 
visual representations of data. Even if these don’t meet your specific needs, they can 
serve as a good example of ways to collect, track, process, or present data.
Excel for iPad has 16 built-in templates, including the blank workbook
Only the templates that are installed with Excel for iPad are available from the New 
page. Other workbook templates are available for Excel Online, and hundreds are 
available from within the desktop versions of Excel. If you create a workbook based 
on one of these templates and save the workbook to a shared storage location, you 
can then open and edit the workbook on your iPad.

You can access templates for Excel Online from your iPad by using Safari or another 
web browser to visit store.office.live.com/templates/templates-for-Excel.
Additional templates are available online
To create a blank Excel workbook
1. In the Backstage view, on the File bar, tap New.
2. On the New page, tap New Blank Workbook.
To create a workbook from a built-in template
1. In the Backstage view, on the File bar, tap New.
2. Locate and then tap the thumbnail of the workbook template you want to use.
TIP The processes of creating workbooks from Excel and Excel Online templates for 
use in Excel for iPad are the same as those of creating documents from Word and 
Word Online templates for use in Word for iPad. For step-by-step instructions, see “Create 
documents from templates” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.” For general 
information about creating files in Excel for iPad and other Office apps, see “Create, open, 
and save files” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”
195
Create workbooks

Create and manage worksheets
Workbooks provide structure for the storage of information, but you store the 
information on worksheets within the workbook. A worksheet provides a seemingly 
simple cellular structure that can store more than 17 billion data points.
TIP The current worksheet size limitation is 16,384 columns by 1,048,576 rows (which 
won’t be a limitation for most Excel users). A single cell can contain up to 32,767 characters.
You don’t have to store all your data on one worksheet. You can organize informa-
tion on separate worksheets so that the content of each worksheet is easier to review 
and manage. You don’t even have to store all related data on the same worksheet—
you can easily reference data on other worksheets for purposes such as performing 
calculations or creating reports. You can also reference data in other workbooks, 
so it isn’t necessary to have a copy of a worksheet that you reference from multiple 
workbooks in each of those workbooks.
Scroll sideways to access worksheet tabs that don’t fit in the sheet tab area
SEE ALSO For information about referencing other worksheets and workbooks, see 
“Perform data-processing operations” in Chapter 8, “Process and present numeric data.”
Add, rename, and remove worksheets
A new, blank Excel workbook contains one worksheet named Sheet1. You can add 
more worksheets to the workbook for the purpose of storing or displaying data, and 
give each worksheet a meaningful name. If you want to use an existing worksheet 
as a starting point for another, you can make a copy of the worksheet, rename the 
copy, and then modify the data on the copy. The data on the copy is not linked to 
the data on the original worksheet.

versions of Excel, you can export a chart from a worksheet to its own chart sheet. For more 
information, see “Display data in charts” in Chapter 8, “Process and present numeric data.”
197
Create and manage worksheets

Move and hide worksheets
Many workbooks contain multiple worksheets. The data you store or display on 
individual worksheets might exist independently or interact with content on other 
worksheets. For example, you might:
 
■
Store data for individual time periods or projects on separate worksheets.
 
■
Store static information such as resources, list options, and holiday dates on 
one worksheet and reference that information in calculations on several other 
worksheets.
 
■
Display a chart on a worksheet that is separate from the data that supports it.
 
■
Display data from multiple worksheets on a summary worksheet.
You can organize worksheets in a workbook by reordering them.
If you don’t need to have the information on a worksheet immediately available, or 
if you want to protect or conceal a worksheet, you can hide it. Hiding a worksheet 
removes the worksheet tab from the sheet tab area on the status bar but doesn’t 
remove any data.
To move a worksheet within a workbook
1. Display the worksheet that you want to move.
2. In the sheet tab area, tap and hold the active worksheet tab, and then drag it 
to its new location.

Show and hide worksheet elements
Data stored in an Excel worksheet is organized in columns and rows. The junction of 
each column and row is a cell, and this is where you enter data.
An empty worksheet resembles a piece of graph paper, with each cell outlined so 
you can easily locate it. Lettered headings across the top of the worksheet identify 
specific columns, and numbered headings down the left side of the worksheet iden-
tify specific rows. Worksheet tabs at the bottom of the window identify worksheets 
within the workbook.
You can hide all these user interface elements to display more of a worksheet or 
to focus on the worksheet content. You can also hide the Formula Bar when it isn’t 
required, so that it appears only temporarily while you edit cell content.
A summary sheet displays information based on the data on other worksheets
Hiding the Formula Bar or worksheet tabs affects all the worksheets in a work-
book. Hiding the gridlines or headings affects only the active worksheet. Excel 
preserves the gridline and heading settings, so if you exit and reopen a workbook 
the gridlines and headings on each worksheet will be as you left them.
199
Create and manage worksheets

To hide Excel user interface elements
1. On the View tab, tap the Formula Bar, Gridlines, Headings, or Sheet Tabs 
slider to change its background to white.
To temporarily display the Formula Bar
1. Double-tap a worksheet cell to activate it for editing.
To permanently redisplay Excel user interface elements
1. On the View tab, tap the Formula Bar, Gridlines, Headings, or Sheet Tabs 
slider to change its background to green.
TIP Exiting and reopening a workbook redisplays the Formula Bar and worksheet tabs 
if they’ve been hidden.
Enter and edit data on worksheets
Excel for iPad has a Ready mode and an Edit mode. When you’re working with the 
structural aspects of cells, Excel is in Ready mode and the active cell or cell range has 
selection handles. When you’re working with cell content, Excel is in Edit mode and 
there are no selection handles.
When you enter Edit mode, the Formula Bar opens above the worksheet, and the 
on-screen keyboard opens below the worksheet. This compresses the workspace sig-
nificantly. You can orient your iPad horizontally to display more columns or vertically 
to display more rows.
TIP If your iPad is connected to an external keyboard, the on-screen keyboard doesn’t 
open in Edit mode. You can perform many operations by using keyboard shortcuts on 
an external keyboard. For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, see the Appendix, “Touch-
screen and keyboard shortcuts.”
When Excel is in Edit mode, you can select individual cells, columns, or rows, but you 
can’t expand the selection directly on the iPad. (You can do so from a connected 
external keyboard.) Selecting a column or row activates the first cell in the column or 
row for editing.

Select cells, columns, and rows
A key step in the process of entering, modifying, or formatting worksheet 
content is selecting the cell or cells you want to work with. You can use these 
selection methods in the Excel for iPad touch interface:
 
■
To select a cell, tap it once.
TIP Selecting a cell or range of cells displays selection handles in the 
upper-left and lower-right corners of the selection and a related sta-
tistic on the status bar. For more information, see the sidebar “Quickly 
display statistics” in Chapter 8, “Process and present numeric data.”
 
■
To select a range of cells, select the upper-left cell in the range, and 
then drag the lower-right handle to the lower-right cell of the range 
or flick the handle down or to the right to select all populated cells in 
that direction (from the current cell to the next blank cell).
 
■
To select a column, tap the column heading (the colored block above 
the worksheet that is labeled with a letter). Selecting a column dis-
plays selection handles on the left and right sides of the column and 
the content of the first visible cell of the column in the Formula Bar.
 
■
To select a row, tap the row heading (the colored block to the left of 
the worksheet that is labeled with a number). Selecting a row displays 
selection handles on the top and bottom of the row and the content 
of the first visible cell of the row in the Formula Bar.
TIP Selecting a column or row displays a shortcut bar of relevant 
commands. To close the shortcut bar and maintain the selection, tap 
an empty area of the ribbon.
 
■
To select multiple columns or rows, select one column or row and 
then drag the handles to select adjacent columns or rows. 
TIP When an Excel table is active, tapping the column or row head-
ing might select only the corresponding column or row of the table.
 
■
To select an entire worksheet, tap the Select All button, which is 
located at the junction of the column headings and row headings and 
is labeled with a triangle that points toward the worksheet.
201
Enter and edit data on worksheets

When you enter Edit mode from a cell that already contains content, or switch to 
a cell that contains content while you’re in Edit mode, Excel displays and selects the 
cell content in the Formula Bar.
The content of the active cell shifts to the far left when Excel is in Edit mode
TIP It’s easy to forget that you’re in Edit mode. If you can’t select cells, columns, or 
rows in the worksheet, check the Formula Bar for the telltale Cancel and Finish buttons.
In Excel for iPad, you enter and edit all text in the Formula Bar. The cell immediately 
displays the text, but the cursor is never active in the cell as it is in the desktop ver-
sions of Excel. In addition to the standard letters and numbers, you can enter the 
special characters that are available from the standard, number, and function online 
keyboards. Most notably, you can insert a line break within text to manually wrap 
cell content in a specific location.
If the data you want to enter follows a specific pattern such as 5, 10, 15, 20 or 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you can establish the pattern and then 
have Excel continue the pattern and fill in the rest of the cells for you.
If the data you want to store in a worksheet already exists in another location, you 
can copy it from the source and paste it into the worksheet. This avoids the errors 
that can occur when entering data manually. The process of pasting content in Excel 
is the same as in other Office for iPad apps. If you paste a table into a worksheet, the 
table cells will map to the worksheet cells so that the table retains its structure.
TIP You can locate information within a workbook by searching for values, formula 
elements, or named objects. For information about searching Excel workbooks, see 
“Search file content” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

Display and hide the shortcut bar
Regardless of your experience with Excel, it can take some practice to master 
the techniques for selecting and manipulating content by touch on an iPad 
rather than by using a mouse. When you are working with content in Excel 
for iPad, the shortcut bar can be very convenient because it provides access 
to the most frequently used commands for a selected entity. It can also be 
inconvenient because sometimes it opens on top of content or tools that 
you want to work with. 
Tapping a cell and then tapping it again displays the shortcut bar for the 
cell. (This action of tapping twice isn’t the same as double-tapping; it’s 
slower and has a different result.) Tapping a column or row heading once 
selects the column or row and also displays the shortcut bar.
You can perform most common tasks from the context-specific shortcut bar
You can hide the shortcut bar and still maintain the selection by tapping a 
colored part of the ribbon.
IMPORTANT You perform many tasks in Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and Power-
Point for iPad by using the same processes. Common processes include those for giving 
commands in the Office user interface and for opening, saving, searching, and distributing 
files. For more information, see Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

sions and resolution of your screen. The content that you enter in a worksheet will 
rarely fit perfectly in the default structure, especially if you’re entering text content.
You can vary the size and visibility of columns and rows to suit your data
Resize columns and rows
After you enter data in a worksheet, you can easily modify the structure of the 
worksheet to fit the content. You can change the size of columns and rows so their 
content is visible on screen and when printed. You can change the width of a column 
or height of a row manually or by using the AutoFit feature to size the column or 
row to fit its contents.
TIP You can’t display or set the specific column width or row height measurements in 
Excel for iPad; you can adjust them only by dragging or by using the AutoFit feature.
To fit a column or row to its contents
1. Double-tap the column or row heading.
Or
Select the column or row, and then tap AutoFit on the shortcut bar.
To change the width of a column
1. Select the column. Notice the handle that appears on the right side of the 
column heading.
2. Drag the handle to the left to make the column narrower or to the right to 
make the column wider.

To change the height of a row
1. Select the row. Notice the handle that appears below the row heading.
2. Drag the handle upward to make the row shorter or downward to make the 
row taller.
Insert and delete columns and rows
After you populate a data range or table, you can easily insert additional columns or 
rows into the range or table without overwriting existing data; existing columns shift 
to the right and rows shift down. Excel automatically updates any references in the 
workbook to the cells that shift to accommodate the insertion.
SEE ALSO For information about referencing cells and cell ranges, see “Perform 
data-processing operations” in Chapter 8, “Process and present numeric data.”
You can specify the insertion location for columns or rows, or the columns or rows 
you want to delete, by selecting them, or by selecting only representative cells.
If a column or row containing the data you want to insert already exists, you can 
move that column or row to a different location or copy it to another location. When 
you delete columns or rows, Excel shifts the remaining content to fill the gap and 
updates any cell references in the workbook to reflect the change.
TIP Note the difference between deleting and clearing cells. When you delete a cell, it 
is completely removed from the worksheet, and other cells move to replace it. When 
you clear a cell, the content of the cell is deleted, but the cell structure remains in place.
To insert a blank column
1. Select the column, or any cell in the column, that is in the position where you 
want to insert the blank column.
TIP If you want to insert multiple columns in one location, drag the selection 
handle to the right to select the number of columns you want to insert.
2. On the shortcut bar, tap Insert Left.
Or
On the Home tab, tap the Insert & Delete Cells button, and then tap Insert 
Sheet Columns.

Modify columns and rows

Hide and unhide columns and rows
If a data range includes a column or row of information that you either don’t want to 
display or don’t want to include in a chart, but that you don’t want to delete, you can 
hide it instead. The headings of a hidden column or row don’t change, so you can 
identify locations of hidden columns and rows by the missing headings and the thick 
lines that replace them.
IMPORTANT You can’t hide columns or rows of Excel tables when you are working 
with a workbook in Excel for iPad. If you need to hide a table column or row, you can 
convert the table to a data range, hide the column or row, and then convert the data range to 
a table. For more information about Excel tables, see “Create and manage Excel tables” in 
Chapter 8, “Process and present numeric data.”
To hide a column or row
1. Tap the heading of the column or row you want to hide.
TIP If you want to hide multiple contiguous columns or rows, drag the 
selection handles to select the adjacent columns or rows.
2. On the shortcut bar, tap Hide.
To unhide a hidden column or row
1. Tap the column heading to the left of the hidden column, then drag the right 
selection handle to the right to select the next visible column.
Or
Tap the row heading above the hidden row, then drag the lower selection 
handle down to select the next visible row.
2. On the shortcut bar, tap Unhide.
Modify cells and cell content
Sometimes you need to modify the structure of a worksheet on the cell level rather 
than modifying an entire column or row. For example, you might need to remove 
only one entry from a column that contains a list of entries. Deleting (clearing) the 
cell content would leave a gap—you must delete the entire cell to close the gap.
210
Chapter 7: Store and retrieve data

Insert and delete cells
When you insert or delete individual cells from a worksheet, you must stipulate the 
direction in which Excel should shift the worksheet content that is below and to 
the right of the cell.
You choose the direction to shift content when inserting or deleting cells
To insert a blank cell in a populated range
1. Select the cell that is located where you want the blank cell.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Insert & Delete Cells button, and then tap Shift 
Cells Down or Shift Cells Right, depending on where you want to move the 
adjacent cells.
To insert multiple cells
1. Select the range of cells that occupy the space in which you want to insert the 
new blank cells.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Insert & Delete Cells button, and then tap Shift Cells 
Down or Shift Cells Right, depending on where you want the surrounding 
cells to be moved.
To delete a cell
1. Select the cell (or range of cells) that you want to delete.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Insert & Delete Cells button, and then tap Shift 
Cells Left or Shift Cells Up, depending on where you want the surrounding 
cells to be moved.
211
Modify cells and cell content

Modify cell structure
By default, text content that exceeds the width of its column extends across adjacent 
columns if they are empty. If the adjacent column contains content, only the text 
that fits in the first column is visible. If you don’t want to resize the column to fit the 
text, you can wrap the text to display it on multiple lines.
TIP In Excel for iPad, you can wrap the content of a single cell or multiple cells, but not 
of an entire column.
If a number is too wide to be displayed in a column, Excel displays the result in 
scientific notation, or displays number signs (#) instead of the number. You can’t 
wrap a long number, but you can widen the column or change the font size to fit the 
number in the cell.
Methods of handling content that exceeds the width of the cell
Sometimes it is appropriate to merge the content of multiple cells into one cell; for 
example, to indicate that a heading or label applies to multiple columns or rows. A 
merged cell occupies the space of the original cells.
IMPORTANT When you merge multiple cells, Excel keeps only the data from the 
upper-left cell, and discards the other values. If the other cells contain data that you 
want to keep, move the data before merging the cells. 
212
Chapter 7: Store and retrieve data

7
You can merge cells vertically, horizontally, or both
TIP Merged cells can interfere with some types of operations on the surrounding 
columns or rows, such as filling cell data. If this happens, you can unmerge the cells, 
perform the operation, and then remerge the cells.
To wrap or unwrap text
1. Select the cell you want to format, and then tap the selected cell.
Or
Select multiple contiguous cells that you want to format.
2. On the shortcut bar, tap Wrap or Unwrap.
To merge a range of cells
1. Select the cells you want to combine.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Merge & Center button.
Format cell appearance
You can format worksheet content to help people identify key information. Beyond 
the standard font formatting options, you can add shading (also called fill color) 
and borders to cells. You can fill cells and apply borders independently or as part of 
a preset cell style. Some of the cell styles available in Excel are intended to convey 
specific information and others are linked to the workbook theme.
TIP Conditional formatting is an incredibly useful tool for exposing trends in numeric 
data. You can’t apply or modify conditional formatting rules in Excel for iPad, but you 
can open worksheets that include conditional formatting rules created in other versions of 
Excel, and the rules function correctly in Excel for iPad.
213
Modify cells and cell content

All the cell styles are purely decorative. None of the styles that are designated as 
titles and headings actually affect the structure of the content or link to an outline 
level, as headings in a Word document do.
You can use cell styles to add visual interest and meaning to a cell
SEE ALSO For information about changing the font, size, color, and style of text, see 
“Change the appearance of text” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”
A workbook can store many types of numeric data, and not all of these numbers 
should be displayed or processed in the same way. You can format specific types of 
numbers to display correctly and so that Excel correctly recognizes whether to process 
the number as a value or as something else (such as a date).
Excel for iPad includes 11 categories of number formats: 
 
■
General This is the default format for numbers. It permits Excel to process 
numbers in mathematic operations and to display numbers by using scientific 
notation if necessary to fit within the cell.
 
■
Text This number format instructs Excel to display and process the number 
exactly as you enter it. It is particularly useful for numbers with leading zeros 
and long numbers, such as credit card numbers, that Excel would otherwise 
change to scientific notation.
214
Chapter 7: Store and retrieve data

7
 
■
Accounting This format allows you to display a specific number of decimal 
places and a currency symbol, which is left-aligned in the cell so the values are 
easier to read.
 
■
Currency This format allows you to display a specific number of decimal places 
and a currency symbol, which is flush against the numbers. You can also specify 
the format of negative values.
 
■
Date This format allows you to choose from among many standard options 
for displaying short and long dates to regional standards.
 
■
Fractions This format expresses a decimal number as the equivalent fraction. 
You can specify the denominator or degree of precision up to 1/999.
 
■
Number This format allows you to display a specific number of decimal places 
and specify whether to display the thousands separator and how to format 
negative numbers.
 
■
Percentage This format displays a decimal number as the equivalent per-
centage followed by the percent symbol. If you want to display more precise 
percentages, you can specify the number of decimal places.
 
■
Scientific This format expresses a number in scientific notation. You can 
specify the number of decimal places of the expression.
 
■
Time This format allows you to choose from among many standard options 
for displaying times or date/time combinations to regional standards.
 
■
Special This category includes region-specific formats for numbers such as 
ZIP codes, postal codes, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers.
To add, change, or remove cell borders
1. Select the cell or cell range for which you want to format borders.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Cell Borders button.
3. On the Cell Borders menu, do one of the following:
 
●
To apply a border to only one side of the selection, tap Bottom Border, 
Top Border, Left Border, or Right Border.
 
●
To apply borders to multiple sides of the selection, tap All Borders, Outside 
Borders, or Thick Box Border.
 
●
To remove all cell borders, tap No Border.
215
Modify cells and cell content

TIP Additional border styles and customization options are available in the desktop 
versions of Excel. If a worksheet cell has a border style that is unavailable in Excel for 
iPad, you can apply the border to other cells by copying the cell and then pasting only the 
format to the other cells.
To specify or remove a cell background color
1. Select the cell or cell range you want to format.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Fill Color button.
3. On the Fill Color menu, do one of the following:
 
●
Tap the color you want to apply.
 
●
Tap No Fill to remove any applied color.
TIP The Fill Color dialog box displays six variations of each theme color, 10 standard 
colors, and a Custom Color link that displays a spectrum you can select a color from. 
To apply a preset cell style
1. Select the cell or cell range you want to format.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Cell Styles button.
3. On the Cell Styles menu, tap the style you want to apply.
To specify a number format
1. Select the cell or cell range you want to format.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Number Formatting button.

the right of the category name. Set the format-specific options, and then 
tap away from the menu to close it.
TIP You can summarize large amounts of data for analysis by using a PivotTable, and 
present visual representations of data as charts. For more information about these 
presentation tools, see Chapter 8, “Process and present numeric data.”

Manage the display of data
When a worksheet contains a large amount of data, it can be challenging to review 
the data, especially on a small screen such as that of the iPad. If you need to keep all 
the data at hand, you can rotate the iPad to display more columns or more rows at the 
same magnification; hide headings, worksheet tabs, and other user interface elements 
to increase the space available for the worksheet; or zoom out to display more content 
in the app window. You can freeze the column and row labels so they stay visible—and 
identify the on-screen content—while you flick through the data range.
If you’re focusing on specific data, you can hide columns and rows that you don’t 
need to review. To really narrow things down, you can hide data that isn’t relevant to 
your needs by filtering it, and then present different aspects of the data for evalua-
tions by changing the sort order.
SEE ALSO For information about hiding user interface elements, columns, and rows, see 
“Create and manage worksheets” and “Modify columns and rows” earlier in this chapter.
Freeze panes
When a worksheet contains more data than you can display on one screen, you 
must scroll vertically or horizontally to display additional fields and entries. When 
you scroll a worksheet that contains a data range, the lettered column headings and 
numbered row headings can help you to identify the visible data, but it’s easy to 
lose track of specific fields or entries. To simplify this process, you can “freeze” the 
columns and rows that contain labels so they stay in place when you flick through a 
worksheet. 
For a typical data range that starts in the upper-left corner of a worksheet (cell A1), 
the top row contains the column labels and the first column contains the row labels. 
Because this is common, Excel provides options to freeze the top row and the first 
column. Alternatively, you can select the first cell that you want to scroll and then 
choose the option to freeze the worksheet panes above and to the left of that.
Frozen panes are indicated by thin lines on the worksheet that start between the 
column headings or row headings. When the display of gridlines is turned off, the 
lines are visible in the worksheet background.
217
Manage the display of data

You can freeze panes at any location in a worksheet
To freeze the panes to the left of and above a specific cell
1. Position the worksheet so that the rows you want to have visible after you 
freeze the panes are the first rows in the window.
IMPORTANT In Excel for iPad, freezing rows prevents the frozen rows from 
scrolling, so if you want to have multiple rows visible when scrolling, ensure 
that they are exposed before you freeze the rows.
2. Select the first cell that you want to scroll (this cell will not be frozen).
3. On the View tab, tap Freeze Panes. Then on the Freeze Panes menu, tap 
Freeze Panes.
To freeze the first visible column
1. Position the worksheet so that the one column you want to freeze as you scroll 
horizontally is the first column in the window.
2. On the View tab, tap Freeze Panes. Then on the Freeze Panes menu, tap 
Freeze First Column.
To freeze the first visible row
1. Position the worksheet so that the one row you want to freeze as you scroll 
vertically is the first row in the window.

2. On the View tab, tap Freeze Panes. Then on the Freeze Panes menu, tap 
Freeze Top Row.
To unfreeze panes
1. On the View tab, tap Freeze Panes.
2. On the Freeze Panes menu, tap the current selection, and then tap a blank 
area of the ribbon to close the menu. 
Sort and filter data
A key feature of Excel is the ability to locate specific data or data that meets specific 
requirements. You can use the search function to locate specific text or characteris-
tics and then move among the results one by one. For many purposes, however, it’s 
more useful to manipulate the data range to display data in a certain arrangement 
or to display only (and all) the records that share specific characteristics. 
You can sort a data range or Excel table by the entries in any column to present the 
data in different ways. For example, if you have a list of products offered by different 
companies at different prices, you can sort the data by company name, by product 
name, or by price. Then you can narrow down the options by filtering the data to 
display only (and all) the records that share specific characteristics.
Filtering displays only the rows that contain the selected entry
219
Manage the display of data

TIP You can filter a data range by more than one column to display only entries that 
meet multiple criteria. In Excel for iPad, you can sort a data range by only one column 
at a time; you can’t perform multilevel sorts from the Sort & Filter menu.
Filtering is off by default for data ranges, but you can easily turn it on. When you do, 
Excel evaluates the data and displays a Sort & Filter button at the right edge of each 
data column heading. The button label changes to indicate the column status, as 
follows:
 
■
When a column is neither sorted nor filtered, the button is labeled with a 
downward-pointing triangle.
 
■
When data is sorted by a specific column, the button is labeled with an arrow 
that points up to indicate an ascending sort order from smallest to largest (or 
A to Z) or down to indicate a descending sort order from largest to smallest 
(or Z to A).
 
■
When the data range is filtered by a specific column, the button is labeled 
with a funnel-shaped symbol that represents a filter.
Filtering a data range by one or more columns displays the entire entry (row) that 
matches the filter criteria specified for the columns.
To display the Sort & Filter buttons for a data range
1. Select any cell in the data range.
2. On the Home tab, tap the Sort & Filter button, and then tap the Filter slider 
to change its background to green.
TIP It isn’t necessary to display the Sort & Filter buttons to sort data, but if you’re 
going to perform more than one sort it’s convenient to have them there.
To sort a data range by a specific column
1. In the heading of the column that contains the sort criteria, tap the Sort & 
Filter button, and then tap Ascending or Descending.
Or

One of the primary purposes of storing numeric data 
in Excel is so that you can process that data program-
matically. You can create simple to complex equations 
to perform calculations based on the numeric content 
of specific cells or data ranges. By using the many and 
varied functions built in to Excel, you can interpret raw 
data stored in a workbook in meaningful ways. You can 
increase the consistency and reliability of the informa-
tion you extract from the data by using formulas to 
calculate, evaluate, and express it.
It is sometimes difficult to comprehend or draw conclu-
sions from raw or processed data, especially when there 
is a lot of it. You can organize data in tables that pro-
vide added functionality, and visually represent data in 
charts. You can create many types of charts in Excel for 
iPad, and easily give tables and charts a consistent and 
professional appearance by applying styles.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating Excel tables, using formulas and functions to 
perform calculations, creating charts from worksheet 
data, and working with PivotTables and comments that 
other people create in shared workbooks.

Create and manage Excel tables
An Excel table is a series of contiguous cells that have been formatted as a named 
Excel object that has functionality beyond that of a simple data range. When work-
ing with data in an Excel table, you can do things that you can’t do with a data range, 
such as automatically apply and update purpose-specific formatting and quickly 
insert column totals and other statistics.
Excel tables have added functionality
The simplest way to create a table is by converting an existing data range. Alterna-
tively, you can create a blank table and then add data to it. (Adding data to a table 
is often referred to as populating the table).
Regardless of the method you use to create a table, Excel displays Sort & Filter but-
tons in each column header and applies thematic formatting (a table style). The table 
style defines the shading, borders, and font colors used in the table. It also incor-
porates formatting and functionality based on the default style options. After you 
create the table, you can apply a different table style and specify the style options 
you want to use. 
228
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

As with other object styles in the Office for iPad apps, the available table styles are 
governed by the color scheme of the file you’re working in. Excel table styles are 
divided into Light, Medium, and Dark categories. These designators refer to the color 
and coverage of the table cell shading. The default table style in a new workbook is 
near the middle of the Medium category and incorporates several shades of blue. 
When you create a table from existing data, Excel evaluates the table content to 
identify the cells that are included in the table and to define functional table ele-
ments (such as header rows and Total rows). You can specify the table elements you 
want to emphasize by selecting the following style options:
 
■
Header Row This option emphasizes the first row of the table and is intended 
for use in tables that have column headings.
 
■
First Column and Last Column These options emphasize the first or last 
column of the table by applying font effects or shading.
 
■
Banded Row and Banded Column These options shade every other row of 
the table to help readers track horizontal entries, or every other column of the 
table to help readers track vertical entries.
 
■
Total Row This option adds a row at the bottom of the table that is preconfig-
ured to display common statistics. By default, the Total row displays either the 
sum of numeric values or count of nonempty cells in the final column of the 
table. Tapping any cell in the row displays an arrow. Tapping the arrow displays 
the following list of statistics and options for you to choose from:
 
●
None The default option for all cells in the row other than the last column 
in which Excel locates numeric values, this option leaves the cell blank.
 
●
Average This function displays the average of the numeric values in the 
table column.
 
●
Count This function displays the number of nonempty cells in the table 
column.
 
●
Count Numbers This function displays the number of cells in the table 
column that contain numbers.
 
●
Max This function displays the largest numeric value in the table column.
 
●
Min This function displays the smallest numeric value in the table column.
229
Create and manage Excel tables

 
●
Sum The default option for the last column in the row in which Excel 
locates numeric values, this function displays the sum of all numeric 
values in the table column.
 
●
StdDev This statistical function estimates the amount of variation from 
the average within the table column, ignoring logical values and text.
 
●
Var This statistical function estimates the spread of values within the table 
column, ignoring logical values and text.
TIP The StdDev and Var functions are available for compatibility with Excel 
2007 and earlier. More-specific functions were introduced in Excel 2010.
 
●
More Functions Tapping this option activates the Formula Bar. If the cell 
already contains a formula, it’s shown in the Formula Bar and the function’s 
arguments are color-coded in the table. If the cell is currently blank, Excel 
inserts an equal sign (=), and activates the on-screen keyboard so you can 
enter a formula that uses any function you want.

TIP The format-related style options available for Excel tables (such as banded 
columns and rows) are the same as those for Word tables. For more information, see 
“Present content in tables” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents.”
When you’re working in an Excel table, the Table tool tab appears on the ribbon. You 
can manage the table structure and styles from this tab and from the shortcut bar 
that appears when you double-tap a table cell.
Table management tools
TIP Excel assigns a name to each table based on its order of creation in the workbook 
(Table1, Table2, and so on). The table name isn’t exposed in Excel for iPad but is available 
when you open the workbook in a desktop version of Excel. You can reference tables and fields 
by name in formulas.
Inserting, deleting, or moving columns or rows in the table automatically updates 
the table formatting to gracefully include the new content. For example, adding 
a column to the right end of a table extends the formatting to that column, and 
inserting a row in the middle of a table that has banded rows updates the banding. 
You can modify the table style options at any time.
TIP Filters are turned on by default when you create a table or format a data range as 
a table. If you want to copy or cut an existing table from a worksheet and paste it into 
a different worksheet, first clear any filters that have been applied, to ensure that all the table 
content is copied. For more information about filters, see “Manage the display of data” in 
Chapter 7, “Store and retrieve data.”
When a table includes formulas, Excel automatically copies a new formula to the 
rest of the table column. If you make a change to a formula, Excel updates the other 
instances of the formula so you don’t have to. When you create a formula that 
references data stored in a table, you can refer to the table and the data in each 
column of the table by name rather than by columns and rows. 
231
Create and manage Excel tables

For example, the following formula returns the total of the December column of an 
Excel table named SalesTable.
=SalesTable[[#Totals],[December]]
If you want to remove the table functionality from a table, you can easily convert it 
to a data range. Note that the conversion does not remove formatting (such as cell 
colors and fonts) from the data range. You can retain the formatting or clear it.

Create and manage Excel tables

Perform data-processing operations
You process data by creating formulas that take the input from one or more cells 
and perform calculations. You can create formulas that evaluate independent data 
points or entire data series stored in data ranges or Excel tables.
Every formula begins with an equal sign (=) to indicate to Excel that it must perform 
a calculation. The equal sign can precede a simple equation, a function that evalu-
ates the arguments defined by a series of parameters, or a formula that combines 
both elements.
Excel for iPad automatically builds formulas for five common mathematical functions 
—SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, and MIN—and leads you through the process of 
building formulas that use other functions.
When you create a formula in a table, Excel automatically copies the formula that 
you enter in one cell to the other cells in that column, and to new rows that you add 
to the table later. When you reference data stored in an Excel table, you can refer-
ence the content of an entire column by name rather than specifying the range of 
cells within the column. For example, if column C of a table has the heading Cost in 
row 1 and rows 2 through 98 contain data, a formula that calculates values based on 
the cost data can reference Cost instead of C2:C98. The benefit of this is that adding 
or removing rows won’t invalidate the formula; the Cost reference will always include 
all and only the cells in that column.
TIP This book provides basic information about formulas and the mechanics of creating 
formulas in Excel for iPad. Hundreds of functions are available for use in formulas. The 
Formula Builder leads you through the process of constructing a formula with the correct 
syntax for the function you’re using. To learn about specific functions in more depth, consult 
a book such as Microsoft Excel 2013 Inside Out by Craig Stinson and Mark Dodge (Microsoft 
Press, 2013), or Microsoft Excel 2010 Formulas and Functions Inside Out by Egbert Jeschke, 
Helmut Reinke, Sara Unverhau, and Eckehard Pfeifer (Microsoft Press, 2011).
Create simple formulas
The most basic formulas involve only operands (numbers or cell references) and 
operators. For example, the formula =A2+B2 returns the sum of the numbers in 
cells A2 and B2.

The formula adds the hourly wages and piecework compensation to calculate the total pay
You can perform simple calculations by using basic mathematical operators, such as 
those in the following table.

A simple formula can include one operation or multiple operations. Formulas that 
involve multiple operations can include suboperations enclosed in parentheses. For 
example, the formula =(A2+B2)/C2 divides the sum of the numbers in cells A2 and 
B2 by the number in cell C2.
The formula divides the total pay by the hours worked to calculate the hourly rate
TIP Excel processes operations of equal precedence in order from left to right and 
operations that include multiple parenthetical calculations from the innermost 
parentheses to the outermost.
237
Perform data-processing operations

After performing parenthetical calculations, Excel processes operations in the order 
of precedence indicated in the preceding table. For example, the formula =A2+B2/C2 
first divides the number in cell B2 by the number in cell C2, and then returns the sum 
of A2 and the result of the first operation.
The formula incorrectly calculates the hourly rate
When you begin entering a formula in a cell, the Formula Bar opens automatically if 
it isn’t already open, and the formula appears both in the cell and in the Formula Bar. 
If you prefer, you can enter the formula directly into the Formula Bar. While you’re 
entering a formula that includes cell references, Excel color-codes the cells and the 
corresponding references so you can easily verify the data used by the formula.
Cell references and selectors are color-coded so you can more easily parse long formulas
You can enter formula components from the standard on-screen keyboard or from 
an external keyboard if your iPad is connected to one. Excel also has a version of the 
on-screen keyboard called the function keyboard that contains the non-text characters 
most commonly used in formulas. Green corners indicate multifunction keys on the 
function keyboard. Pressing a multifunction key displays a list of other characters; you 
can insert one of these characters by sliding from the multifunction key to the charac-
ter in the list. You can easily switch between the standard keyboard and the function 
keyboard by tapping the toggle button located at the right end of the status bar.
The standard keyboard also has multifunction keys, but they aren’t labeled.
SEE ALSO For information about multifunction keys on the standard on-screen 
keyboard, see “Enter text in documents” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”

The function keyboard
You can begin the entry of a formula in a cell or directly in the Formula Bar. Either 
way, the formula appears in the Formula Bar. When you complete the formula, Excel 
validates it to ensure that it meets the syntactic requirements.
The Formula Bar
Formulas can reference cells in other worksheets within the workbook and in other 
workbooks. The syntax for these references is as follows:
 
■
References to cells on other worksheets are preceded by the worksheet name 
(the name on the worksheet tab) and an exclamation mark. For example, 
the formula =December!A2 displays the content of cell A2 of the December 
worksheet.
 
■
References to other workbooks are preceded by the workbook file name, the 
worksheet name, and an exclamation point. The workbook name is enclosed 
in square brackets; that phrase and the worksheet name are enclosed in single 
quotes. For example, the formula =’[Sales.xlsx]December’!A2 displays the con-
tent of cell A2 of the December worksheet of the Sales workbook.
You can include the values of external cells in formulas that perform calculations, or 
you can simply display the values.
239
Perform data-processing operations

Efficiently reference cells in formulas
Formulas in an Excel worksheet usually involve functions performed on the 
values contained in other cells on the worksheet (or on another worksheet). 
A reference that you make in a formula to a worksheet cell is either a rela-
tive reference, an absolute reference, or a mixed reference. It is important to 
understand the difference and know which to use when creating a formula.
A relative reference to a cell takes the form A1. When you copy, fill, or move 
a formula from its original cell to other cells, a relative reference changes 
to maintain the relationship between the cell containing the formula and 
the referenced cell. For example, if a formula refers to cell A1, copying the 
formula one row down changes the A1 reference to A2; copying the formula 
one column to the right changes the A1 reference to B1.
An absolute reference takes the form $A$1; the dollar sign indicates an 
unchanging reference to the column or row. When you copy, fill, or move 
a formula from its original cell to other cells, an absolute reference will not 
change—regardless of the relationship to the referenced cell, the reference 
stays the same. For example, if a formula refers to cell $A$1 and you fill the 
formula five cells to the right, the formula in each cell still refers to $A$1. 
A mixed reference refers absolutely to either the column or the row and 
relatively to the other. The mixed reference $A1 always refers to column A, 
and A$1 always refers to row 1.
If you want help entering absolute and mixed cell references or don’t want 
to enter a lot of dollar signs, Excel provides a simple way of changing a ref-
erence from one type to another. Follow these steps:
1. Enter any version of a cell reference (relative is easiest) in the formula. 
2. Select the cell reference in the Formula Bar, and then tap the selection 
to display the shortcut bar.
3. On the shortcut bar, tap Reference Types to display a menu of 
 reference options.
4. On the Cell Reference Types menu, tap any reference to replace the 
original reference in the Formula Bar.
240
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

It is common to use a version of one formula in multiple cells. For example, if you 
enter a formula in cell C2 that adds the values in cells A2 and B2, you might want to 
perform the same operation in row 3 and the remaining rows of the table. You can 
copy a formula to other cells or fill adjacent cells with the formula. When you use 
either method, Excel adjusts any relative references in the formula to maintain the 
relative relationship to the cell that contains the formula.

tap the Insert Function button at the left end of the Formula Bar to enter an 
equal sign (=).
The Functions menu opens.
2. If you want to close the Functions menu, tap the Formula Bar or worksheet.
TIP An open Functions menu does not prevent you from entering text. If you 
enter characters that don’t match a built-in function, the menu closes automati-
cally. The menu displays functions that match your entry. You can tap the information 
button next to any function name to display a description of the function, or you can 
tap the function name to insert the function and its parameters in the Formula Bar.

IMPORTANT Ensure that the cell references in the formula are correctly entered 
as relative, absolute, or mixed cell references before copying the formula.
2. Tap the selected cell, and then on the shortcut menu that appears, tap Fill.
Arrows appear on the bottom and right borders of the active cell.
3. Drag the bottom border of the active cell down to fill the formula to the 
 adjacent rows or to the right to fill the formula to the adjacent columns.
TIP You can’t fill formulas up or to the left in Excel for iPad as you can in the desktop 
versions of Excel.
Insert formula constructs
The simplest way to familiarize yourself with the use of functions is by inserting an 
AutoSum formula in a data range or Excel table and then studying the results. The 
following functions are available as AutoSum formulas:
 
■
SUM This function returns the sum of the numeric values in the selected 
range.
 
■
AVERAGE This function returns the average of the numeric values in the 
selected range.
 
■
COUNT When invoked as an AutoSum operation, this function returns the 
number of cells in the selected range that contain numbers.
TIP When invoked from the Total row of an Excel table, the COUNT function 
returns the number of nonblank cells in the range.
 
■
MAX This function returns the largest numeric value in the selected range, 
ignoring logical values and text.
 
■
MIN This function returns the smallest numeric value in the selected range, 
ignoring logical values and text.
When you insert an AutoSum formula in a cell, Excel evaluates the surrounding data 
and selects the most likely data for the specified operation.
244
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

8
Excel selects consecutive cells that contain numeric values as likely function arguments
You can change the data selection to any consecutive range of cells by dragging the 
selection handles rather than directly editing the formula. You can include noncon-
secutive cells by selecting each cell or cell range, inserting a comma after the cell 
reference in the Formula Bar, and then selecting the next. When you confirm the 
selection, Excel builds the formula for you.
To insert an AutoSum formula
1. Select the cell you want to display the result in.
2. On the Formulas tool tab, tap the AutoSum button, and then tap the function 
you want to use.
TIP To use the SUM function, you can tap the Formula Bar to display the 
keyboard, and then tap the AutoSum key on the function keyboard.
3. Verify that the automatically selected range (indicated by an animated dashed 
outline) contains all the cells you want to include as arguments for the func-
tion. If it doesn’t, do one of the following:
 
●
To modify the cell range from the existing selection, drag the selection 
handles to encompass the cells you want to include.
 
●
To select a different cell range, select a cell within the range you want to 
include and then drag the selection handles to encompass the cells.
 
●
To select nonconsecutive cells, select the first cell or cell range, tap the 
Formula Bar, insert a comma, select the next cell or cell range, and so on.
4. Complete the formula entry.
245
Perform data-processing operations

Quickly display statistics
Selecting multiple cells displays a statistic about the selected cells at the 
right end of the status bar. The default statistic for numeric values is the sum, 
and for text values it is the number of nonblank cells within the selection.
Tapping the statistic on the status bar displays the average, count, numerical 
count, maximum, minimum, and sum of the selected cells.
Status bar statistics for a table column that contains numeric values
The status bar displays the statistic that you tap on the menu and makes it 
the default statistic for future selections in the same computing session.
Build complex formulas
Functions evaluate specific arguments (values defined by parameters) and return the 
results of that evaluation. This sounds difficult, but Excel simplifies it by leading you 
through the process, providing AutoComplete suggestions for function names and 
specifying the required and optional parameters for a function.
TIP Parameters define the required and optional data that will be evaluated by a 
function; arguments are the actual values that are passed for the parameters.

The functions available in Excel for iPad are divided into 10 categories: Financial, Logi-
cal, Text, Date & Time, Lookup & Reference, Math & Trig, Statistical, Engineering, Info, 
and Database. The categories are available from the Formulas tab or from the list that 
appears when you tap the More Functions button near the right end of that tab.
Functions are divided into categories on the Formulas tab
When perusing the categories of functions, you’ll notice that they evaluate param-
eters including numbers, dates, text values, system information, and conditions. In 
all, more than 200 functions are available that evaluate a wide variety of parameters 
and return values based on the arguments provided for those parameters.
An alphabetical list of functions appears when you begin entering a function into the 
Formula Bar. Tapping the information icon next to a function on a category menu or 
function list displays the syntax for and definition of the function.

Refresh calculations manually
When using a desktop version of Excel, workbook authors can put a work-
book into manual calculation mode. This mode is useful when a workbook 
contains either a large number of complex calculations that might slow 
down the program if they are automatically recalculated when data changes, 
or calculations that reference external sources that are unavailable or take a 
long time to connect to.
Excel for iPad doesn’t support switching between manual calculation mode 
and automatic calculation mode. If you are working in a workbook that has 
been set to manual calculation mode, you can update the calculations within 
the workbook by tapping the Calculate Now button at the right end of the 
Formulas tab.
Display data in charts
Charts are visual representations of data that are created by plotting data points 
onto a two-dimensional or three-dimensional coordinate system. Charts can be a 
very useful data analysis tool because they identify trends and relationships that 
might not be obvious from reviewing the raw data.

Display data in charts

A single chart can reference up to 255 data series. Different types of charts are best 
suited for different types of data. Excel for iPad supports the creation of the follow-
ing chart types:
 
■
Area Displays multiple data series as cumulative layers showing change 
over time.
 
■
Bar Displays variations in value over time or the comparative values of several 
items at a single point in time.
 
■
Column Displays variations in value over time, or comparisons.
 
■
Line Displays multiple data trends over evenly spaced intervals.
 
■
Pie Displays percentages assigned to different components of a single item 
as wedges of a circle or doughnut. (Values must be nonnegative and nonzero, 
and there may be no more than seven values.)
 
■
Radar Displays percentages assigned to different components of an item, 
radiating from a center point.
 
■
Stock Displays stock market or similar activity.
 
■
Surface Displays trends in values across two different dimensions in a con-
tinuous curve, such as a topographic map.
 
■
X Y (Scatter) Displays correlations between independent items.
Each chart type has multiple layouts. A layout specifies which elements the chart dis-
plays and how they are arranged. Chart elements include the chart title, data labels, 
data table, and legend.
TIP Some types of charts that plot data points onto standard XY axes are also 
commonly referred to as graphs.
250
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

Create charts
To create a chart, all you have to do is identify the data you want to plot and specify 
the chart type.
If you want to create a specific type of chart, make sure that your data is correctly set 
up for that chart type before you start. For example, a pie chart can display only one 
data series, whereas a bar or column chart can display multiple data series. When 
you are creating a chart in Excel for iPad, the data you plot must be in a contiguous 
range of columns or rows. If it isn’t already contiguous, you can move or hide col-
umns and rows until it is.
If you want to plot only a subset of the data that is stored in a data range or table, 
you have three options: you can create a chart based on all the data and then reduce 
the amount of data that is included in the chart by selecting less of the data table, 
you can hide the data you don’t want to plot and then create the chart, or you can 
select only the data you want to plot and then create the chart.
Excel doesn’t plot hidden data
When you’re ready to create the chart, you can choose a chart that Excel recom-
mends based on an analysis of the data pattern, or you can select a chart type on 
your own. The thumbnails on the Recommended menu display a preview of the 
actual data you’ve selected for the chart.
251

Excel recommends charts based on your specific data
TIP The charts that Excel recommends might include combination charts that you 
couldn’t otherwise create in Excel for iPad.

The Charts menu displays generic representations of each chart type.
Simple previews are available for all chart types
To begin plotting an entire data range or table as a chart
1. Locate the data range or table that contains the data you want to plot.
2. Tap any cell in the data range or table. When you create the chart, Excel will 
plot all the data contained therein.
To select part of a data range or table to plot as a chart
1. Locate the data range or table that contains the data you want to plot.
2. If the data you want to plot is not in a contiguous range, organize the data by 
doing any of the following:
 
●
Move columns or rows so the data values are adjacent to each other and 
to the axis values.
 
●
Hide columns or rows that you don’t want to plot.
3. When the data you want to plot is arranged in a contiguous range, tap any cell 
in the data set.
4. Drag the selection handles to select the data set.

3. On the Charts menu, tap the type of chart you want to create.
4. On the submenu, review the available versions of the selected chart type.
5. Tap the specific chart configuration you want to create.
Modify chart structure
The area within which the chart (and only the chart) is drawn is the plot area. The 
larger area that encompasses the plot area and any accompanying chart elements 
(such as the title, legend, and axis labels) is the chart area. The chart and chart ele-
ments change size to fit the chart area. You change the size of a chart by changing 
the size of the chart area. It might be necessary to specifically change the width or 
height to make the chart the size you want.
SEE ALSO For information about displaying chart elements, see “Format charts” later 
in this topic.
Excel creates each chart on the same worksheet as its source data. You can move the 
chart to a different location on the worksheet or you can move it to its own work-
sheet. If you plan to present a chart, you can move it to its own worksheet, resize the 
chart to fill the screen, and then hide the gridlines and headings on the worksheet to 
focus viewers’ attention on the chart.
A chart is linked to its worksheet data, so any changes you make to the plotted data 
are immediately reflected in the chart. 
254
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

8
If you want to add or remove values from a chart, you simply increase or decrease 
the range of the plotted data in the worksheet.
You can change the amount of data displayed in the chart
Charts plot data in the order that it appears in the data source. To change the order 
of the data in the chart, you must change it in the data source. Excel automatically 
updates the chart to reflect your changes.
Sometimes a chart does not illustrate the results you expect because the data series 
are plotted against the wrong axes; that is, Excel is plotting the data by row when it 
should be plotting by column, or vice versa. You can quickly switch the columns and 
rows to determine whether that produces the effect you want.
TIP For more precise control of chart content and configuration, edit the chart in a 
desktop version of Excel.
To select a chart
1. Tap the chart to select it.
Excel displays the chart sizing handles around the chart area, and the Chart 
tool tab appears on the ribbon.

Format charts
When you select a chart type, Excel inserts a generic version of that chart with the 
default colors and chart elements. You can apply predefined chart styles and color 
schemes, and you can modify the layout of the chart elements to convey the impres-
sion you want.
A pie chart with a title and legend
Chart styles configure a variety of display attributes such as the color of the chart 
area and data labels, the font of the chart title, the layout of chart elements, and 
other visual effects such as shadows that give the appearance of depth.
A chart includes many elements, some required and some optional. Each data series 
is represented in the chart by a unique color. You can add or modify these elements 
to help people understand the chart:
 
■
A chart title can identify the chart content.
 
■
A legend can identify the data series by color.
 
■
Data labels next to or on the chart or a data table below the chart can identify 
data point values.
 
■
Axis titles can identify the axes the data is plotted against.
 
■
Gridlines can more precisely indicate data point values.
258
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

8
Other optional elements include trend and variance indicators such as trendlines,  
up/down bars, and error bars.
TIP Data labels can clutter up all but the simplest charts. If you need to show the data 
for a chart on a separate chart sheet, consider using a data table instead.
Most chart elements can be displayed in multiple locations within the chart area or 
plot area (the area defined by the axes). You can remove any or all of the identifica-
tion elements.
You can configure the display of chart elements in several ways:
 
■
By selecting individual chart element settings from the Elements menu
 
■
By applying a chart layout that defines the presence and position of multiple 
chart elements
 
■
By applying a chart style that incorporates a chart layout
You must set the element display location in one of these ways; you can’t manually 
position or format any of the chart elements in Excel for iPad.
To change the style of a chart
1. Tap the chart you want to modify.
2. On the Chart tool tab, tap the Styles button.
3. On the Styles menu, review the available styles, noting the chart area color, 
the presence and position of chart elements, and any visual effects.
4. Tap the style you want to apply to your chart.
To change the color scheme of the data series
1. Tap the chart you want to modify.
2. On the Chart tool tab, tap the Colors button.

Display data from PivotTables
PivotTables are excellent tools for displaying views of multidimensional data. In other 
words, by using PivotTables you can look at a lot of data in a lot of different ways. 
More importantly, PivotTables make it easy to display many combinations of data 
fields and help you turn data into information.
You might think of a PivotTable as a kind of Rubik’s Cube, with each colored side 
representing a data field. In the same way that you can turn each section of the 
Rubik’s Cube to display different combinations of colors on the faces of the cube, 
you can group, filter, and sequence data in a PivotTable.
260

A PivotTable displaying sales of products to customers, grouped by category
SEE ALSO For information about the history of the Rubik’s Cube (and how to solve 
one), visit Rubik’s official website at www.rubiks.com.
For example, an online retailer might store the following data about inventory items 
in Excel:
 
■
Product information such as name, category, supplier, wholesale price, retail 
price, shipping weight, material, size, color, pattern, height, width, depth, and 
whether the item is breakable
 
■
Target market information such as gender, age, and location
 
■
Performance information such as sales volume, sales location, return percent-
age, and reason for return
If the retailer’s marketing manager can extract useful information from that data, 
the marketing team can plan targeted campaigns that build on historical purchasing 
trends. It would be a lot of work to plan and assemble all the reports that might be 
261
Display data from PivotTables

pertinent to this effort. This is where PivotTables are valuable. By using a PivotTable, 
the retailer can quickly and easily identify useful information such as:
 
■
Items sold in the month of January of any year, grouped by state
 
■
Sales volume of books purchased by men in the Southwest region of the 
United States
 
■
All items that have a return rate of more than 25 percent, grouped by supplier
 
■
Clothing items for women that have sold more than 1,000 units per year with 
a return rate of less than 5 percent
 
■
Gift items that weigh less than 2 pounds and have a profit margin of more 
than 30 percent
The key to a useful PivotTable is the data storage structure. PivotTables can reference 
data stored in the workbook or in an external database. The data that is referenced 
in the PivotTable must be stored in a simple, logical structure to return clean results.
You can’t create a PivotTable in Excel for iPad, but you can work with a PivotTable 
that was created in a desktop version of Excel. You can expand and collapse groups, 
filter the data to display specific fields, sort the data in groups by field, and drill 
down from the PivotTable to the details of specific data points. You can modify the 
structure of the PivotTable to display data differently, and you can change the color 
scheme applied to the table. If the PivotTable is based on external data, you can 
refresh the connection to update the results.
IMPORTANT At the time of this writing, you can’t add fields to a PivotTable or pivot 
the data in Excel for iPad. To optimize a PivotTable for display on an iPad, the PivotTable 
creator should include all fields that people are likely to want to use as filter or sort criteria.
PivotTables can be structured in many ways. All PivotTables consist of at least two 
fields of information, but most include groups and subgroups. You can expand the 
groups and subgroups to display more detailed information, or you can collapse 
them to display only summary information.
Depending on the design of a PivotTable, a button called a Pivot Filter might be 
located in the top row, the first column, or both locations. Pivot Filters are similar 
in appearance and functionality to the Sort & Filter buttons in Excel table column 
headers. 
262
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

8
The PivotTable collapsed to show only the primary groups and grand totals
Some PivotTables include one or more Report Filters above the column headers. 
Report Filters display lists of the entries in a specific field. You can filter the displayed 
content by selecting fields from either of these tools. Using filters limits the data 
displayed to only those cells that meet selected criteria.
A filter symbol on a Pivot Filter button indicates that the column or row is filtered.
You can sort and filter at the selected level
263
Display data from PivotTables

You can modify five different aspects of the structure of a PivotTable:
 
■
The display of subtotals for groups
 
■
The display of grand totals for columns and rows
 
■
The form of the PivotTable: compact, outline, or tabular
 
■
The frequency of item labels
 
■
The display of blank rows after items
A PivotTable in tabular form with blank rows between items and without grand totals
You can apply the same styles to PivotTables as you can to Word tables and Excel 
tables. You can choose to emphasize the row headers, emphasize the column head-
ers, band the rows, and band the columns.
TIP The style options available for Excel PivotTables are very similar to those for Excel 
and Word tables. For information about applying table styles and selecting style options, 
see “Present content in tables” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents,” and “Create 
and manage Excel tables,” earlier in this chapter.

can update the PivotTable to reflect changes to the source data by refreshing the 
connection. To refresh the connection, tap Refresh on the PivotTable tool tab, or tap any cell 
and then tap Refresh on the shortcut menu.
Collaborate on workbook content
Excel for iPad doesn’t have the robust coauthoring features of Word for iPad—only 
one person can actively edit a workbook at a time. However, multiple people can 
display and move around in a locked copy of the workbook. When a second person 
opens a workbook from a shared storage location, a message box provides the 
information that the file is locked, and displays these options for working in the 
locked file:
 
■
Read-Only This option opens the file as read-only. You can display the file con-
tent and move around in the file. You can also make changes in the file—you 
simply can’t save those changes in the locked workbook. Instead, you can save 
a separate copy of the modified file with another name or in another location.
 
■
Duplicate Save a duplicate copy of the file that you can work in.
266
Chapter 8: Process and present numeric data

8
Recent desktop versions of Excel include a change-tracking function that highlights 
changes as users make them. Excel for iPad doesn’t support this feature. When you 
open a workbook that contains tracked changes, Excel opens a read-only copy and 
displays an information bar to inform you that the file contains content that isn’t 
supported by Excel for iPad. You can close the information bar and work in a read-
only copy of the workbook, or you can save a copy of the workbook that doesn’t 
include the tracked changes, and edit the copy.
Workbooks that were created or edited in a desktop version of Excel might contain 
comments attached to specific worksheet cells. Hidden comments are indicated by a 
red triangle in the upper-right corner of a cell, and by a comment icon when the cell 
is selected.
You can review and delete comments created in other versions of Excel
You can’t create or edit comments on a worksheet in Excel for iPad, but you can 
display, review, and delete them by using the commands on the Review tab of the 
ribbon.
SEE ALSO For more information about comments, see “Collaborate on document 
content” in Chapter 6, “Enhance document content.”
To move among comments in a workbook
1. On the Review tab, tap Previous or Next.
TIP Tapping the Previous or Next button moves among all the comments on all the 
worksheets in the workbook.

Create and manage Excel tables
Start Excel, open the CreateTables workbook, and then perform the following tasks:
1. Format the range A2:M23 as a table with headers. Notice the default table style.
2. Apply a table style from the Dark category.
3. Add a Total row to the table. Notice that Excel inserts the sum of the December 
sales at the bottom of the Dec column. 
4. Select the Average statistic in cell M24 to display the average sales per 
person in December. Review the formula in the Formula Bar.
5. In the Total row, insert a calculation from the list for each column. Include at 
least one instance of each of the eight options.
6. Delete row 22 from the table, and note the changes to the Total row values.
7. Convert the table to a data range.
8. Create a blank table in cells O2:Q10. Apply a table style from the Light category.
9. Extend the blank table by adding two columns to the right edge, and then 
insert a blank row anywhere inside the table.
Perform data-processing operations
Open the ProcessData workbook, and then perform the following tasks:
1. Review the Schedule worksheet, which provides a structure for scheduling the 
creation of three products that go through eight process phases. Specifically 
notice the following:
 
●
Cell B3 contains the project start date.
 
●
Column C is empty.
 
●
E3:L3 contain the phase numbers.
 
●
E4:L4 contain the corresponding process names.
 
●
E5:L5 contain the number of days required to complete each process.
269
Practice tasks

2. If cell E6 displays ###, AutoFit column E to display the date in the cell.
3. Select cell E6 and review the formula in the Formula Bar. Notice that it calcu-
lates the Phase 1 (Design) completion date for Product 1 (Widgets) based on 
the project start date and the number of days allocated to the Design phase.
4. Copy the formula from cell E6 to E7 and then evaluate the formula. Notice that 
the relative reference tries to calculate the date based on the empty cell B4 
and the date in E6.
TIP To simplify this practice task, the formulas assume that all days are working 
days. In a real-world situation, you could use the WORKDAY function to omit 
weekends and holidays from date calculations.
5. Edit the formula in cell E6 to absolutely reference the project start date ($B$3).
6. Edit the formula in cell E7 to =E6+E5. This indicates that the Design team will 
complete work on Product 1 and then start work on Product 2.
7. Fill the formula from cell E7 to E8 and then evaluate the formula. Notice that 
the relative formula tries to add E7 to E6.
8. Edit the formula in cell E7 to absolutely reference cell E5 ($E$5) so that it always 
adds the number of days specified in cell E5 to the completion date of the pre-
vious product. Then fill the formula from cell E7 to E8 and verify that the date 
returned is 12-Feb (February 12).
TIP  AutoFit columns after copying or filling formulas if necessary to display 
the formula results.
9. Fill only the formula (but not the formatting) from cell E6 to cell F6, and then 
evaluate it. Notice that it calculates the Phase 2 (Review) completion date 
based on the project start date instead of the Phase 1 completion date.
10. Edit the formula in cell F6 to =E6+$F$5 so that it adds the specified number of 
Review days to the previous phase completion date.
11. Copy the formula from F6 to F7 and F8 and verify the calculated dates.
12. Copy the formulas from cells F6:F8 to cells G6:G8, and then evaluate them. 
Notice that they add four days instead of three.
13. In cell F6, change $F$5 to a mixed reference that always references row 5 of 
the current column. Then repeat steps 11 and 12 and notice the change in the 
Document phase dates.
270
Chapter 8

14. Copy the formula from G6:G8 through the remaining project phases and verify 
that the Delivery date for Product 3, in cell L8, is March 11. Notice that the 
formula is =K8+L$5.
15. Select column C and delete it. Notice that the formula in cell K8 automatically 
changes to =J8+K$5 to account for the deleted column.
16. If you want to, update the schedule to use the WORKDAY function, which 
takes the form =WORKDAY(start_date, number_of_days). The final completion 
date should be April 8.
17. Experiment with changing the start date in cell B3 and the number of days for 
each process.

Open the CreateCharts workbook, and then perform the following tasks:
1. Create a bar chart of your choice based on the entire table. Then move the bar 
chart to the right of the table.
2. Correct the order of the data in the bar chart by moving the September data 
in column D to follow the August data in column J.
3. Swap the bar chart data over the axis. Notice that both versions of the bar 
chart are difficult to read due to the number of data points on each axis.
4. Change the bar chart to a clustered column chart layout that displays the 
salespeople’s names on the x-axis.
5. Change the clustered column chart to a stacked column chart, and notice the 
immensely improved readability of the chart.
6. Modify the column chart to include only data from January through June. 
7. Apply some of the available chart styles to the column chart. Finish by apply-
ing the style that you like best.
8. Apply any monochromatic color set to the column chart. Consider the effect 
this has on the information presented by the chart.
9. Apply any layout that includes a chart title and a data table. Review the infor-
mation in the data table, and then remove it from the chart area.
10. Create a line chart of your choice based only on the data in columns A and B 
of the table. 
271
Practice tasks

11. Move the line chart to the January Sales Chart worksheet and resize it to 
about 25 percent larger. Notice that the chart still references the Sales data in 
the table on the Sales worksheet.
12. Apply various chart types to the line chart and consider the benefits of each 
chart type. Finish by applying the chart type and style you like the best.
Display data from PivotTables
Open the PivotData workbook, and then perform the following tasks:
1. Review the table on the Sales Data worksheet, and then review the informa-
tion in the PivotTable on the Sales Analysis worksheet. Consider the relation-
ship between the table and the PivotTable.
2. On the Sales Analysis worksheet, collapse the Books category.
3. In the Computer Peripherals group, expand the customer records to display 
the specific products sold to each customer.
4. Use the Columns Pivot Filter to display only data from 2014.
5. Collapse the columns to display only the full year and not the quarters. Then 
collapse the rows to display only the product categories. Notice that the over-
view of information is clear and concise, and consider the detail you can drill 
down to.
6. Change the layout of the PivotTable to display grand totals for rows but not 
for columns.
Collaborate on workbook content
Open the ReviewComments workbook, and then perform the following tasks:
1. Move among the comments in the workbook. Notice that hidden comments 
appear only while they are active for review.
2. Hide the $50 per day maximum comment. Then display all the comments in 
the workbook.
3. Delete any one of the comments.

PowerPoint presentations are no longer used solely 
by business executives to present information at board 
meetings. They’re commonly used in business and edu-
cational settings to share information, not only in group 
presentations, but also in electronic communications 
and online settings. Because of the way that elements 
on a PowerPoint slide float independently, PowerPoint 
presentations offer simpler options for creatively pre-
senting information than Word documents and have 
become an alternative delivery format for reports. Even 
primary school students are assigned PowerPoint presen-
tations as homework projects.
There are many methods by which you can convey 
information on PowerPoint slides. Gone are the days 
of presenters reading a list of bullet points to the 
 audience—now you can use images, diagrams, anima-
tions, charts, tables, and other visual elements. Presenters 
can concentrate on delivering the details, which can be 
conveniently documented in the speaker notes attached 
to the slides.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating presentations and slides; presenting information 
on slides by using text, tables, and animated graphics; 
inserting video content on slides; and managing the 
playback of audio and video recordings.

The PowerPoint feature set
Microsoft has created multiple versions of PowerPoint that are optimized 
for various computer, mobile device, and online platforms. The functional-
ity available in each version varies—the version of PowerPoint designed 
for computers running Windows has the full feature set, and the versions 
designed for other platforms have less functionality. You can display presenta-
tions in all versions, but the extent of the elements that you can create and 
fully utilize varies. Here is a brief comparison of the features of the versions 
of PowerPoint you’re likely to have access to if you’re reading this book.

The PowerPoint feature set

Create presentations
When creating a new presentation, you can create a blank presentation or create a 
presentation that is based on a template. Unlike the templates provided for Word 
and Excel, PowerPoint templates are most commonly design templates that control 
thematic elements (colors, fonts, and graphic effects) and slide layouts rather than 
content templates designed to give you a head start when creating purpose-specific 
documents or workbooks. Each template has a corresponding theme, so you can 
create a presentation based on one template but then entirely change its appear-
ance by applying a different theme.
TIP If you’re using an external keyboard with your iPad, you can perform many 
operations by using keyboard shortcuts. For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, 
see the Appendix, “Touchscreen and keyboard shortcuts.”
An important thing to be aware of when you create a presentation in PowerPoint 
is that you have the choice of two slide aspect ratios, which are referred to (slightly 
inaccurately) as slide sizes. The default slide size is Widescreen (16:9), which is opti-
mized for narrow rectangular displays such as those found on many laptop screens 
and desktop monitors these days.
Widescreen slides are shorter than Standard slides
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations
280

9
The alternative slide size is Standard (4:3), which is optimized for wide rectangular 
screens such as that of the iPad.
IMPORTANT You perform many tasks in Word for iPad, Excel for iPad, and PowerPoint 
for iPad by using the same processes. Common processes include those for giving 
commands in the Office user interface and for opening, saving, searching, and distributing 
files. For more information, see Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”
Standard slides fit the iPad screen
When you display the built-in templates on the New page of the Backstage view, 
the Slide Size setting appears in the upper-right corner of the page. You can 
change the setting to display the template thumbnails at each slide size.
It’s advisable to select the slide size before you tap a template thumbnail, because 
tapping the thumbnail creates the slide deck. You can change the slide size after 
you create the slide deck, but doing so might cause graphic elements (especially 
those on master slides) to look different, and text and other slide elements to not 
fit on slides as intended. In other words, if you’re going to change the slide size of 
a presentation, it’s best to do it before you create the content.
Create presentations
281

Tap the slide size to display the alternative option
If you find it necessary to change the slide size of a presentation to best fit the 
display you’re presenting it on, you can easily do so. Remember, though, that you’ll 
need to carefully review the slides to ensure that your original content still fits. The 
desktop versions of PowerPoint give you the option of scaling slide content to fit 
the new slide size; PowerPoint for iPad doesn’t currently provide this option.
IMPORTANT Images that are part of the slide layout rather than the content sitting 
on top of the layout will be squeezed (when changing from Widescreen slide size to 
Standard) or stretched (when changing from Standard slide size to Widescreen) when the slide 
size changes. You can correct the problem by changing the Scale Width setting for affected 
pictures on the slide masters, which you can edit in the desktop versions of PowerPoint. The 
Scale Width setting is available from the Size & Position task pane for the picture.
The 19 templates that are built in to PowerPoint for iPad have unique color schemes, 
font sets, and graphic elements. None of the built-in templates include text or any 
content other than the placeholders and graphic elements on the slide layouts. You 
can get a good idea of the thematic elements from the thumbnails displayed on the 
New page of the Backstage view. 
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations
282

9
The thumbnails depict the title slide layout, graphic elements, and the theme fonts—
the uppercase letter represents the Headings font (the default font for headings) 
and the lowercase letter represents the Body font (the default font for regular text). 
The other slide layouts generally use similar but sleeker versions of the title slide 
graphics.
The basic thematic elements of the built-in templates are featured on the title slide thumbnails
Notice that PowerPoint for iPad doesn’t have a Blank template option like that avail-
able in Word and Excel. There is no Blank template because every template includes 
predefined slide layouts in addition to the color and font settings. The Office Light 
template is the closest match to a blank presentation; it has black text on white 
slides, uses the default Office fonts—Calibri Light for headings and Calibri for body 
content—and has no colors or graphic elements integrated with the slide layouts. 
The Office Dark template is identical to Office Light, other than that it has white text 
on black slides. If you’re planning to design your own unique template, one of these 
would be a good place to start.
TIP A few additional design templates are available for PowerPoint Online, and more 
than 300 templates are available for PowerPoint for Windows. Some of the PowerPoint 
2013 templates include both content and design specifications. For information about creating 
files from the online and desktop versions of the Office apps, see “Create documents from 
templates” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.”
Create presentations
283

When you create a presentation from a design template, the only slide that is imme-
diately available is the title slide. This slide is visible in the Thumbnails pane on the 
left side of the app window and in the Slide pane that takes up most of the window.
A title slide in the PowerPoint for iPad app window
The width of the Thumbnails pane is fixed in PowerPoint for iPad. You can’t change 
the relationship between the Thumbnails pane and the Slide pane by dragging the 
divider.
TIP The Notes pane is below the Slide pane but is collapsed by default. For information 
about working in the Notes pane, see “Add notes to slides” in Chapter 10, “Prepare and 
deliver slide shows.”
SEE ALSO For information about saving and duplicating Office files, see “Create, open, 
and save files” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

To create a new presentation
1. On the New page of the Backstage view, on the File bar, tap New.
2. In the upper-right corner of the window, tap Slide Size, and then tap either 
Widescreen (16:9) or Standard (4:3) depending on your intended presenta-
tion method. If in doubt, tap Standard because it creates a narrower slide; if 
you later need to change the slide size, the slide content is likely to fit on a 
widescreen slide.
3. Locate and then tap the thumbnail of the presentation template you want 
to use.
To change the slide size of a presentation
1. On the Design tab, tap the Slide Size button, and then tap Standard (4:3) or 
Widescreen (16:9).
2. Review your slides for any content that might have shifted due to the change 
in aspect ratio.
Create and manage slides
If you’re accustomed to using a desktop version of PowerPoint, one of the first dif-
ferences you might notice in the PowerPoint for iPad environment is that you can 
develop and manage slides in Normal view only. This view displays thumbnails of the 
existing slides in the Thumbnails pane on the left side of the window and a larger 
version of the currently selected slide in the Slide pane. You insert, cut, copy, paste, 
duplicate, and delete slides in the Thumbnails pane, and create slide content in the 
Slide pane.
The appearance and structure of slides is defined by the slide layouts associated with 
the design template. Slide layouts define the elements on specific types of slides, 
such as:
 
■
Slide backgrounds and incorporated graphics.
 
■
Text box locations, sizes, and formats.
 
■
Default paragraph and character formats for each text box location.
 
■
Standard headers or footers.
Create and manage slides
285

TIP Text boxes can contain static content that can’t be changed by the presentation 
author (for example, a company logo) or serve as placeholders that define the default 
formatting of content entered within the text box.
A template could have only one slide layout, but most have unique slide layouts for 
slides that display the presentation title, section titles, and various combinations 
of slide titles and content, and a blank slide with only the background. Each slide 
layout is named; the name suggests the primary application of the slide layout, but 
you aren’t limited to that suggestion; you can enter any type of content in any slide 
layout and modify the layout of any slide. The slide layouts that are available in a 
presentation are displayed on the New Slide menu.
The structure and design of each slide layout is visible on its thumbnail
In the desktop versions of PowerPoint, you can modify the built-in slide layouts, create 
your own slide layouts, or create entirely new sets of slide layouts called slide masters, 
and you can reset slides to match their slide layouts, or apply different slide layouts 
to existing slides. 
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations
286

9
You can’t edit or create slide layouts in PowerPoint for iPad, but you can arrange and 
format text, placeholders, and graphic elements on a slide and then duplicate that 
slide for each similar slide you want to create.
You add a slide to a presentation by selecting the layout of the slide you want to 
create. The new slide is inserted after the current slide; if necessary, you can move 
it to a different location within the presentation.
If you create a slide and then later realize that you don’t need it, you can delete it. If 
you don’t need the slide for a presentation to a specific audience but might need it 
later, you can hide the slide instead. Hidden slides aren’t presented in slide shows. 
They remain available from the Thumbnails pane, but their thumbnails are dimmed 
and marked with a prohibition sign (), which is also referred to as the universal no 
symbol.
Hidden slide content is active and editable
When you select a hidden slide, the Hide Slide button on the Slide Show tab is shaded 
to indicate that the command is in effect. You can edit a hidden slide in the Slide pane 
just as you can any other, so you might use this feature to keep a slide that you’re still 
working on hidden until it’s final. You can unhide a slide to include it in the slide show.
Create and manage slides

Add text to slides
PowerPoint presentations originally consisted primarily of bulleted lists of speaking 
points. Text is still common on slides, but presenters are incorporating fewer bullet 
points and more images and animations. Even with all the imagery, a typical presen-
tation uses text on the title slide, in the slide titles, and in the slide content.
Manage text containers
Most slide layouts associated with presentation templates include various config-
urations of content containers that hold slide titles and slide content. A notable 
difference between PowerPoint for iPad and the desktop versions of PowerPoint 
is that PowerPoint for iPad supports only simple text boxes that define the font 
characteristics of their content, whereas the desktop versions support rich content 
containers from which you can choose to insert a table, chart, SmartArt graphic, 
picture, or video.
TIP When you open a presentation that was created in a desktop version of 
 PowerPoint, any rich content containers that were in the original file appear as 
simple text boxes.
If the text boxes that are part of a slide layout don’t meet your needs, you can 
modify the existing text boxes or create your own. It is safest to create your own, 
because modifications to the slide layout elements can be reset in other versions 
of PowerPoint by reapplying the slide layout. (You can’t reapply a slide layout in 
PowerPoint for iPad.)
When you insert a text box on a slide, PowerPoint creates the text box at a default 
size and location. You can then move and resize the text box, and this is when 
you’ll discover another of the great features of PowerPoint for iPad—Smart Guides. 
Smart Guides appear when an edge of the object you’re moving or resizing aligns 
with another object or creates a symmetrical relationship with other objects. 
Smart Guides make it easy to position slide content in a perfectly balanced layout.
TIP You manage and format text boxes on slides by using the same techniques as you 
do in Word documents. For more information, see “Draw and format text boxes” in 
Chapter 6, “Enhance document content.”
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations

Red guides indicate alignment, and gray guides indicate relationships
You can specify formatting options for a text box and the content that will be entered 
into it. You can format the text box by applying shape styles, fill colors, and outline 
colors. You can format the text box content by specifying the font name, size, char-
acteristics, and color; specifying the paragraph alignment, indent, list formatting, 
and text direction; and applying WordArt styles.
To insert a text box on a slide
1. In the Thumbnails pane, select the slide you want to insert the text box on.
2. On the Insert tab, tap the Text Box button to insert the default text box in the 
center of the slide.
To select a text box for structural modification
1. Tap the text box once.
To move a text box on a slide
1. Select the text box that you want to move.
2. Drag the text box to the new location.

To move a text box to another slide
1. Select the text box that you want to move.
2. On the shortcut bar, tap Cut.
3. Display the slide that you want to move the text box to.
4. In the Slide pane, tap anywhere on the slide to activate it. Then tap the slide 
to position the cursor at the approximate location where you want to insert 
the text box.
5. On the shortcut bar, tap Paste.
To align a text box with other slide elements
1. Drag the text box on the slide until Smart Guides indicate that at least one 
edge of the text box aligns with another object on the slide.
2. If necessary, drag the sizing handles to align other edges of the text box with 
objects on the slide.
To remove a text box from a slide
1. Select the text box that you want to remove.
2. Tap anywhere in the selected text box and then, on the shortcut bar, tap 
Delete.
Insert and manage text
The words you choose to display on the slides of a PowerPoint presentation are 
important; you need them to convey enough information to be useful without pro-
viding so much information that you, the presenter, become unnecessary.
You can enter text directly into any text box on a slide, and then format either the 
text box (to affect all its contents) or individual text elements. If the text you want to 
display already exists elsewhere—for example, in a Word document—you can paste 
the text onto a slide either inside or outside the confines of a text box. 
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations
292

When you paste text outside of a text box, PowerPoint creates a text box that sur-
rounds the text; you can format the text box as you would any other, move the text 
box where you want it, or move the text into another text box.
You can paste text outside of existing text boxes
When you’re moving and editing text on an iPad screen, it can be difficult to posi-
tion the cursor precisely within existing text. A nice feature of PowerPoint for iPad 
and Word for iPad is that you can magnify a circle of text on the slide or document 
to help you place the cursor in a specific position.
Positioning the cursor precisely is easier with magnification
TIP You can insert a tab character or new line character (soft return) in text within a 
text box by displaying the shortcut bar at the cursor and then tapping the character 
you want to insert. You can’t insert a hyperlink in PowerPoint for iPad, but you can edit 
hyperlinks that were created on a slide in another version of PowerPoint.
Add text to slides
293

If a word on a slide doesn’t appear in the dictionary that the Office for iPad apps ref-
erence, a wavy red underline indicates a possible spelling mistake. From the shortcut 
bar that appears when you select the word, you can choose the correct spelling from 
a list of suggestions, or you can add the word to the dictionary.
PowerPoint offers corrections for unknown words
To activate a text box
1. Double-tap anywhere in the text box.
Or
1. Select the text box.
2. Tap the selected text box and then, on the shortcut bar, tap Edit Text.
To enter text on a slide
1. Display the slide on which you want to add text.
2. Activate the text box, and then enter the text from the on-screen keyboard or 
a connected external keyboard.
To insert text from a Word document on a slide
1. Start Word, open the document, and locate the text.
2. Select the text that you want to move and then, on the shortcut bar, tap Copy.
3. Switch to PowerPoint and display the slide that you want to insert the text on.

lists, see “Present content in lists” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents.”
Present information in tables
Tables provide a tidy structure for the presentation of text on a PowerPoint slide. 
When you create a table directly on a slide, PowerPoint for iPad inserts a table that 
has three rows and three columns and matches the color scheme of the presenta-
tion theme. The first row is formatted as a header row, and the following rows are 
banded. You can modify the structure and appearance of the table by using the 
same techniques that you do when working with tables in Word for iPad.
SEE ALSO For information about inserting, deleting, formatting, and moving tables 
and table elements, see “Present content in tables” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements 
to documents.”
If the information you want to present is already in a tabular format in a Word 
document or Excel workbook, you can copy the existing table to your slide and 
then modify it as necessary to fit your presentation.

Review comments
If you’re working with other people to develop a presentation, or if you 
simply want to leave yourself reminder notes when working on a presenta-
tion in a desktop version of PowerPoint, you can enter comments on the 
slides. You can display and move among existing comments in a  PowerPoint 
presentation when using PowerPoint for iPad, but you can’t create or 
manage comments.
You can turn on the display of comments on the Review tab. If the Previous 
Comment or Next Comment button is active, the presentation contains 
comments and you can move between them by tapping the buttons.
Commands on the Review tab
Comments on slides are indicated by transparent comment icons. Moving 
to a comment by tapping the Previous Comment or Next Comment button 
displays the comment text; you can also display the text by tapping a com-
ment icon. The active comment opens in a rounded rectangular callout next 
to the comment icon.
Each comment includes information about the person who entered the comment and the time it 
was entered
SEE ALSO For more information about comments, see “Collaborate on 
 document content” in Chapter 6, “Enhance document content.”

Add visual elements to slides
You can incorporate images into slide content to illustrate a concept, to draw atten-
tion to something, or just for decoration.
Insert pictures
In PowerPoint for iPad, you can insert pictures that are available on your iPad (such 
as those in your Camera Roll or Photo Stream album) or shapes. If you want to use 
an image that is already present in another Office file—for example, a SmartArt 
graphic embedded in a Word document—you can copy the image from the source 
file and paste it onto the slide. PowerPoint inserts pictures in the center of the slide, 
and then you can move them where you want them. When you copy a formatted 
picture from a document to a slide, it retains the formatting. You can reset it and 
format it in PowerPoint if you want to.
You insert and format pictures on a slide the same way you do on a document page. 
The Picture tool tab offers the same options for applying fancy styles, shadows, and 
reflections, cropping and resetting the picture, and stacking pictures.
It’s easy to insert, format, and move pictures on slides
SEE ALSO For information about inserting, formatting, and reordering pictures, see 
“Insert and format pictures” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents.”
Add visual elements to slides
299

It’s easier to manipulate pictures on a slide than it is in a document, because you don’t 
have to concern yourself with the way that text wraps around the picture— pictures 
and text are entirely separate elements. The only modification you might need to 
make is in the order of pictures, text, and other elements that overlap on a slide.
To insert a picture from your Camera Roll or Photo Stream on a slide
1. Display the slide that you want to insert the picture on.
2. On the Insert tab, tap the Pictures button.
3. On the Photos menu, browse to the picture you want to insert, and then tap 
the picture to insert it.
To insert a picture from a Word document on a slide
1. Start Word, open the document, and locate the picture that you want to copy 
to the slide.
2. Tap the picture and then, on the shortcut bar, tap Copy.
3. Switch to PowerPoint and display the slide that you want to insert the 
picture on.
4. In the Slide pane, tap anywhere on the slide to activate it. Then tap the slide in 
the approximate location where you want to insert the picture.
5. On the shortcut bar, tap Paste.
To select a picture
1. Tap the picture once.
To remove formatting from a picture
1. Select the picture.
2. On the Picture tool tab, tap the Reset button, and then tap Reset Picture.

Insert shapes
An extensive library of shapes is available in the Office for iPad apps. You can use 
these shapes to illustrate a concept on a slide, or you can animate the shapes to 
convey actions or draw attention to specific elements.
SEE ALSO For information about animating shapes and text on slides, see “Animate 
slide elements” later in this topic.
Shapes can be simple, such as lines, circles, or squares; or more complex, such as 
stars, hearts, and arrows. Some shapes are three-dimensional (although most are 
two-dimensional).
After you insert a shape, you can change its dimensions
Add visual elements to slides
301

Some of the shapes have innate meanings or intentions, and others are 
simply shapes.
Specialized flowchart shapes represent specific actions or objects
PowerPoint inserts shapes in the center of the slide, and then you can move them 
where you want them. You can apply different colors to the outline and inside (fill) of 
a shape. When working with text in shapes, you can apply colors, or you can apply 
preset text effects (also referred to as WordArt) from the Formatting menu on the 
Home tab or from the WordArt Styles menu on the Shape tab, whichever is more 
convenient at the time, in the same way that you do to regular text.
SEE ALSO For information about font formatting and text effects, see “Change the 
appearance of text” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents.” For information 
about shapes, see “Insert and format shapes” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents.”

Animate slide elements
When used appropriately, animated slide elements can both capture the audience’s 
attention and effectively convey information. You can animate any individual element 
on a slide, including each individual text container. You can’t animate the elements 
on the slide background, other than during the initial transition to the slide.
SEE ALSO For information about slide transitions, see “Animate slide transitions” in 
Chapter 10, “Prepare and deliver slide shows.”
Animations can be very informative, particularly for audience members who are 
more receptive to visual input than to auditory input. Animations have the added 
benefit of being available to provide a very specific, consistent message in a presenta-
tion with or without a presenter to discuss or externally illustrate a process.
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations
304

You can configure animation effects for three processes. The available effects for 
each process are categorized as Basic, Subtle, Moderate, and Exciting (although you 
might have a different concept of exciting than the PowerPoint developer who 
categorized the effects). More animation effects are available for text than for other 
elements. The three types of effects are:
 
■
Entrance effects If an object has an entrance effect, the object is not visible 
on the slide when the slide is first shown. (It is visible during the development 
process, but not when you present the slide show.) It then appears on the slide 
in the manner specified by the entrance effect.
The entrance animation effects available for text and images
Add visual elements to slides
305

 
■
Emphasis effects These effects animate an object that is already visible on the 
slide to draw attention to it, usually by moving it or changing the color.
The emphasis animation effects available for images
 
■
Exit effects These effects take an existing object through a process that 
results in the object no longer being visible on the slide.
The exit animation effects available for images
Chapter 9: Create compelling presentations
306

9
Entrance and exit effects cause slide elements to appear and disappear when you’re 
previewing or presenting a slide. However, all the elements are visible while you’re 
working in the Slide pane. As you prepare a slide that will contain animated objects, 
position the objects for animation as follows:
 
■
Entrance effects Position the object where you want it to end up after it 
enters the slide.
 
■
Emphasis effects Position the object where it will be before and after the 
effect.
 
■
Exit effects Position the object where it will be before it leaves the slide.
Preparing the slide elements before applying animation effects
You can apply multiple animation effects (for example, an entrance effect and an 
emphasis effect) to a slide element.
After all the elements are in place, animate them in the order you want the anima-
tions to occur. It’s helpful to map out the process before starting. For example, when 
presenting information about the elements that a slide show can include, you might 
want to do the following:
1. Start with only the slide title and list items visible.
2. Pulse the list items one by one to draw attention to them.
3. Forcefully display the prohibition sign on top of Words.
4. Subtly remove the prohibition sign.
5. Swoop the PowerPoint icon in like a superhero.

As you animate slide objects, numbers appear on the objects to specify the order of 
the animation effects. To implement your plan, you could use the animation effects 
shown in the following table.

After you create the most important content of your 
PowerPoint presentation—the slides—there are other 
modifications that you can make in preparation for 
actually presenting the slide show to an audience. 
Among these are the addition of notes, slide transitions, 
and embedded media.
Notes are a valuable feature of PowerPoint slide shows. 
You can add notes to each individual slide; for example, 
as development notes, speaking points, or supporting 
information for handouts.
Animated slide transitions can liven up a presentation 
and help to keep the audience's attention. You can assign 
a variety of animations to accompany the change from 
one slide to the next.
If the information you're presenting in your slide show is 
supported by video content—for example, statements 
by experts that support the concepts you discuss—you 
can streamline the presentation process (and also ensure 
that the information is always available with the slide 
show) by embedding the video on a slide.
This chapter guides you through procedures related 
to adding notes to slides, animating the transitions 
between slides, embedding and managing media 
recordings, and presenting slide shows.
315

Add notes to slides
A PowerPoint slide show can include many types of information; the information 
on the slides is intended for the audience, and the information stored in the notes 
attached to the slides is usually intended for the presenter. You can also provide the 
slide content and notes to attendees by printing Notes pages from a desktop version 
of PowerPoint.
TIP PowerPoint for iPad currently prints only full-page slides. You can use the 
desktop versions of PowerPoint to print various permutations of slides, notes, 
and note-taking areas.
You can enter ancillary information in the Notes pane while you're developing a slide 
show in Normal view, or when you preview or present a slide show in Presenter view.
A slide and its associated notes in Presenter view
In Normal view, you open the Notes pane by tapping the Notes button in the lower-
right corner of the Slide pane. This moves the Notes header up to the top of the pane 
316
Chapter 10: Prepare and deliver slide shows 

10
above the note content area. When a slide has associated notes, a red-outlined note 
icon appears to the left of the word Notes in the header to alert you to that fact.
The Notes page of a slide in Normal view
You can't display both the Slide pane and the Notes pane at the same time, but the 
Thumbnails pane remains available and the current slide is indicated therein by a 
thick red outline. You can switch to the Notes pane for a specific slide without 
 closing the Notes pane by tapping the thumbnail of the slide you want to switch to.
Regardless of the font that is assigned to the headings and body text of the slides 
in your presentation, the content of the Notes pane is always 12-point Calibri. Note 
content can include standard paragraphs, bulleted lists, and numbered lists. In 
PowerPoint for iPad, you can apply basic character formatting options—bold, italic, 
underline, and strikethrough—and basic paragraph formatting options—alignment, 
indent level—to the notes when you're working in the Notes pane. Other formatting 
options are unavailable. If you need to apply fancier formatting to your notes, edit 
them in a desktop version of PowerPoint.
TIP You can’t apply formatting to notes in Presenter view. To format note text, display 
the Notes pane in Normal view and then apply formatting from the ribbon.

Animate slide transitions
The action that occurs between the display of one slide and the display of the next 
slide is the slide transition. By default, when you are presenting a slide show by using 
PowerPoint for iPad, there is no visible transition; the content of one slide is simply 
replaced with the content of the next slide.
To help keep the audience's attention, you can add an interesting animation effect 
that occurs as the slide show transitions from one slide to the next. In PowerPoint 
for iPad, you can choose from the same 46 slide transitions that are available in the 
desktop versions of PowerPoint. 
319
Animate slide transitions

The slide transitions are divided into three categories:
 
■
Subtle transitions These transition effects provide a reasonably clean and 
simple movement between slides.
The Subtle category of transition effects
 
■
Exciting transitions These include many three-dimensional effects that are a 
lot of fun—but be cautious, because it's easy to overuse these effects.
The Exciting category of transition effects
320
Chapter 10: Prepare and deliver slide shows 

10
 
■
Dynamic Content transitions These effects animate the slide content only, 
and not the slide background. This creates a unique effect that can be both 
more dramatic and more subtle than the full-slide effects.
The Dynamic Content category of transition effects
The Exciting category includes the Random Transition option. It might be tempting 
to apply this to every slide in your presentation, but think carefully before doing so 
about whether random transitions will catch the attention of your audience or dis-
tract them from the slide show subject.
For almost every transition effect, you can choose from options to configure the spe-
cific behavior of the transition. Most frequently, you can choose the starting location 
or the direction in which the transition moves. Sometimes you can specify the shape 
of the effect as it occurs. Transition aspects that you can't specify in PowerPoint for 
iPad (but can in the desktop versions of PowerPoint) are the trigger of the transition, 
the duration of the transition effect (the length of time from the beginning to the 
end of the transition), and the sound that plays during the transition.
You apply slide transition effects to the incoming slide—in other words, to affect the 
transition from slide 2 to slide 3, you apply the effect to slide 3. If you apply a transi-
tion effect to slide 1, it plays when you start the slide show. 
In the Thumbnails pane and Presenter view, a shooting star adjacent to the slide 
number indicates that a slide transition is applied to the slide.
You can tell at a glance which slides have animated transitions
321
Animate slide transitions

For the most professional and least frazzling audience experience, choose one 
slide transition effect for all the slides in your presentation or, if the presentation 
includes specific types of slides (for example, slides that display the overview, objec-
tives, teaching points, or lab description for each section of the presentation), you 
can  provide consistent visual cues for the audience by assigning a specific transition 
effect to all slides of a specific type.
To animate the transition to a slide
1. Select the slide to which you want to apply the transition.
2. On the Transitions tab, tap the Transition Effect button.

Incorporate external media content
In PowerPoint for iPad, you can insert a video recording from your iPad directly onto 
a slide, and then play the video while presenting the slide show. If you're accustomed 
to switching between a presentation and video clips, this is a much smoother way of 
presenting information from multiple sources.
When you're selecting a video to embed, you can preview videos at their regular 
speed with the soundtrack or slide forward or backward through the video content. 
When you select the video you want to use, PowerPoint for iPad compresses it and 
embeds it on the slide. You can insert multiple videos on one slide. The video images 
stack in order of insertion.
Video preview controls
A video that is embedded on a slide is represented by an image of the first frame of 
the video. There is no special tool tab for working with embedded videos, but you 
can use the sizing handles to resize the video on the slide, and the commands on the 
shortcut bar to cut, copy, paste, or delete it.
TIP In PowerPoint for iPad, you can’t modify aspects of an embedded video, such as 
its length. If you want to modify a video, you can edit it in another program before you 
insert it, or insert it and then edit it by using the tools in a desktop version of PowerPoint.
323
Incorporate external media content

Format embedded video images
There are no formatting options for videos, but you can work around that 
by copying formatting from another object or positioning a shape behind 
a video image to give the appearance of a frame. An easy way to apply a 
professional style to the embedded video and its representative image is 
to copy the formatting from another object.
For example, you can insert any picture on any slide (it can even be a blank 
slide that you use specifically as a staging location for this sort of thing), 
apply a picture style to the picture, copy the picture, and then paste only 
the formatting onto the video image.
Paste the format of a reference image onto a video preview image
SEE ALSO For information about inserting and formatting pictures on 
slides, see “Add visual elements to slides” in Chapter 9, “Create compelling 
presentations.”

You can play audio and video content on a slide only while you're presenting the 
slide show. The easiest way to preview embedded audio and video recordings is to 
start the slide show from the current slide, either in regular presentation mode or 
in Presenter view. PowerPoint for iPad has a conveniently placed button at the right 
end of the ribbon that you can tap to start the slide show from the current slide.
When you're presenting a slide show, you can play (and pause) embedded audio or 
video, move around within the recording, and control the volume by using the con-
trols that appear when the audio icon or video placeholder image is active. When 
playing back a video, you can display it at the embedded size or full screen.
Playing an embedded video
TIP A method you can use to provide a framelike effect is to insert and format a shape 
that is slightly larger than the video image. Position the shape on top of the image, and 
then on the Shape tool tab, tap the Send Backward command on the Arrange menu.
325
Incorporate external media content

PowerPoint for iPad doesn't officially allow you to insert audio recordings on slides, 
although it does support the playback of audio recordings that have been inserted 
in presentations by using a desktop version of PowerPoint. By default, audio record-
ings are represented by a discreet speaker icon on the slide. With the exception of 
the Full Screen option, the playback controls that are available for audio recordings 
are the same as those for video recordings.
Playing back an embedded audio recording
However, because PowerPoint for iPad supports the insertion of video and video 
soundtracks, you can get around the limitations of the app in this regard by saving 
the audio as a video soundtrack (with a simple video image such as a speaker icon or 
a video that has some significance), and then embedding that video.
TIP From a desktop version of PowerPoint, you can insert audio clips onto slides and 
configure them to play for a specific period of time, while a specific slide is displayed, 
or through the end of the slide show.
To embed a video on a slide
1. On the Insert tab, tap the Videos button.
2. Flick through the Videos library menu to locate the library that contains the 
video you want to use, and then tap the library to display its contents.
3. Flick through the library to locate the video you want to insert. Preview the 
video in any of these ways:
 
●
To display the video thumbnail at menu width, tap the thumbnail.
 
●
To preview a video, tap its thumbnail and then tap the Play button.
 
●
To move through a video preview, drag the slider at the top of the 
Videos menu.

Manage and present slide shows
All the work you’ve done to create and finalize your presentation is about to pay 
off—you’ll deliver your presentation, the audience will go wild, and you’ll get a raise, 
a book contract, or international speaking engagements. Possibly. The important 
thing is that you will have effectively communicated information to your audience.
If you’re going to present the slide show from your iPad, you can choose from two 
presentation interfaces:
 
■
Standard view This method runs the slide show on your iPad and shows the 
same view of the slides on any other screen you’re connected to (such as a 
conference room or auditorium display screen).
 
■
Presenter view This method displays a multipanel view of the slide show on 
your iPad and the Standard view of the slide show on the other screen. So 
while the remote display shows only the current slide, your iPad shows the 
 current slide, its associated notes, and thumbnails of all the slides in the show.
Presenter view gives you access to all aspects of a slide show
330
Chapter 10: Prepare and deliver slide shows 

10
Presenter view is one of the greatest cures for stage fright that’s come along in years 
(a close second to picturing your audience in their underwear), because you can 
reference the current slide without turning your back on the audience, you can refer 
to the notes you’ve included to support the slide content, you know what slide is 
coming up next, and, if you need to, you can easily skip a slide or display a specific 
slide from elsewhere in the presentation.
You can run Presenter view on one monitor for the purpose of rehearsing the deliv-
ery of information and adding speaker notes. Actually delivering a presentation in 
Presenter view requires two monitors: one displays Presenter view for your use, and 
the other displays the Standard slide show view for the audience.
In either view, you have access to a set of presenter tools—displayed all the time in 
Presenter view and on request in Standard view.
You can mark up a slide and control the display of slides by using the presenter tools
The presenter tools include a pen with multiple settings to mark up slides as you 
present them, and commands you can use to display a black screen when you pause 
a presentation and to switch to the Standard view of the presentation.
Annotate slides with any of five pen colors and five highlighter colors

OneNote is a very useful program that you can use to 
store many types of information and then access that 
information from any device. OneNote is equally useful 
for home and business purposes and is available for 
a wide variety of computer, tablet, and smartphone 
systems.
After you spend a short time using OneNote for iPad, 
you'll undoubtedly find it a convenient way to store 
many types of information, such as task lists, itineraries, 
frequent flyer accounts, supplier contact information, 
meeting notes, research findings, technical data, and 
printouts of contracts, receipts, and other documents 
you want to archive for future reference.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
creating and opening notebooks, adding sections to 
notebooks, adding pages to sections, adding content 
to pages, managing notebook content, and closing 
notebooks.

The OneNote feature set

Create, open, and close notebooks
OneNote stores information in files that are referred to as notebooks. You can store 
all your information in one notebook or create multiple notebooks for different pur-
poses. For example, you could store general business information in one notebook, 
sensitive business information in a second notebook, and personal information in a 
third notebook.
In some versions of OneNote, you can create and work with notebooks that are 
stored locally on your computer or remotely in a connected storage location such 
as a OneDrive site or SharePoint site. In OneNote for iPad, you can work only with 
notebooks that are stored remotely.
Create notebooks
When creating a notebook in OneNote for iPad, you must create it on a OneDrive 
site or SharePoint site. A benefit of creating a notebook in one of these remote 
storage locations is that you can get to the information from any location or device. 
If you want to share some or all of the information in your notebook with other 
people, you can do that, too.
To create a notebook
1. Start OneNote and display the Backstage view.
2. On the File bar, tap Notebooks.
3. On the Notebooks page of the Backstage view, tap Create Notebook.
4. In the Create Notebook box, enter a name for the new notebook in the 
Name box.
5. If the Location box doesn’t display the storage location you want to use, tap 
the box. Then on the Location page that appears, tap the storage location 
you want.
6. In the Create Notebook box, tap the Create button to create and open a 
notebook that has the basic storage structure as a starting point.
SEE ALSO For information about creating and configuring structural elements of a 
notebook, see “Configure notebook storage structure” later in this chapter. 
342
Chapter 11: Store information in digital notebooks

11
OneNote gets you started
The first time you start OneNote for iPad, the app creates a notebook for you 
on the OneDrive site that is associated with your user account. This note-
book includes a built-in section named Quick Notes that contains a bit of 
information about how and why to use OneNote and some sample content.
You can retain the Quick Notes section for later reference
Some of the information in the Quick Notes section applies to versions of 
OneNote other than OneNote for iPad. You can add, remove, and update 
information in the Quick Notes section if you want to.
Open and switch among notebooks
The first time you open an existing notebook in OneNote for iPad, you must open 
it from its source location, which can be any storage location you’re connected to. 
When you open a notebook from a remote storage location, OneNote creates a 
copy on the device you're working on, and synchronizes the local copy with the 
server copy. Because of this feature, you can access information that is stored in a 
notebook even when you're offline, from any device on which you've previously 
opened the notebook.
343
Create, open, and close notebooks

If you store or reference information in multiple notebooks, OneNote can maintain 
active connections to all of them when it’s running. You can display the content of 
only one notebook in the main app window at a time, but all the connected note-
books are “open” and synchronizing content, and you can easily switch among them. 
The currently open notebooks are shown on the Notebooks page of the Backstage 
view and the Notebooks menu in the OneNote app window.
Open or create notebooks from the Notebooks page of the Backstage view
To open an existing notebook for the first time
1. Start OneNote and display the Backstage view.
2. On the File bar, tap Open to display the storage locations you’re connected to.
3. If the storage location the notebook is stored in doesn’t already appear in your 
Places list, connect to it.
SEE ALSO For information about connecting to storage locations, see “Connect 
to additional storage locations” in Chapter 2, “Get connected.”
4. Tap the storage location. If necessary, tap through the folder structure until 
you reach the notebook. Then tap the notebook.
5. If OneNote prompts you to enter user credentials, enter the account name and 
password for the account that has permission to access the notebook.
344

open notebooks.
You can manage currently open notebooks from the Notebooks menu
2. On the Notebooks menu, tap the notebook you want to display.
345
Create, open, and close notebooks

Close and reopen notebooks
It isn't necessary to close a notebook before exiting OneNote. It's simplest to leave 
all the notebooks that you use open all the time so that you can easily search their 
content. The notebooks will continue to synchronize in the background and you'll 
have access to current content when you need it. If you no longer need access to 
the information that is stored in a notebook—for example, if its content pertains 
only to a completed project—you can close it to keep the Notebooks menu and the 
Notebooks page of the Backstage view tidy.
After you close a notebook, it remains available to reopen from the Recent page of 
the Backstage view, or from its original storage location. If you want to ensure that 
you can quickly access a closed notebook at a later time, you can pin it to the Recent 
page and it will always be available from the Pinned section at the top of the page.
Pinned notebooks are convenient to access
To close a notebook
1. On the Notebooks page of the Backstage view, tap the File Actions button 
for the notebook you want to close.
2. On the Notebook Options menu, tap Close Notebook.
Or

content, see “Protect and share information” and “Synchronize notebook content” in 
Chapter 12, “Locate and share notebook content.” 
Configure notebook storage structure
The notebook storage structure in OneNote reflects that of a physical tabbed 
notebook such as those used by students. You can divide notebooks into one or 
more sections. Each section contains one or more pages. You store information 
on individual pages.
A new notebook contains one section and one page. You can add sections and 
pages to provide a structure for the content you intend to store in the notebook.
The OneNote user interface elements
347
Configure notebook storage structure

As you add sections, you can name them in a way that is appropriate for the content. 
Be sure to give each section a meaningful name so you can easily identify it when 
you’re sending content to OneNote from another program.
TIP In some versions of OneNote, you can optionally group sections into elements 
called section groups, which provide another layer of organizational structure. You can’t 
create section groups in OneNote for iPad, but you can navigate through section groups that 
already exist in notebooks created in other versions of OneNote. 
When you’re adding content to a notebook, you can create blank pages or pages 
that already contain content. If you have a clear idea of the kind of information you’re 
going to store in a notebook, you might find it simplest to build the notebook struc-
ture and then add content within that structure. But it isn’t necessary to build the 
structure first—if you prefer, you can send content to your notebook and then 
organize pages and sections by moving or copying them. Whatever works best for 
you will work with OneNote.
To create a section
1. In the notebook header, tap the New Section button.
To rename a section
1. In the notebook header, double-tap the tab of the section you want to 
rename.
Or
Tap the section tab, and then tap Rename to activate the title for editing.
The shortcut bar displays options for working with the selected title
2. Enter the new section name, and then tap the Done key on the on-screen 
keyboard.
TIP If you’re working with an external keyboard connected to your iPad, you can press 
the Enter key to perform the action of the Done key in any procedure.

Add information to notebooks
You can use OneNote for iPad to create and gather notes in a variety of ways.
Enter and format text
To enter text on a page, you can tap the on-screen keyboard or type on an external 
keyboard. You can use the dictation functionality of the iPad to dictate notes ver-
bally, which can be a great time-saver after you become accustomed to the process. 
These processes are the same as those that you use to enter content in a document 
when using Word for iPad, so you're probably already familiar with them from the

Add information to notebooks

If you want to keep track of the dates on which you enter specific notes, you can 
quickly insert the current date on your notebook page in mm/dd/yy format by tap-
ping the Date button on the Insert tab. You can reference information that exists 
on a website rather than recording separate notes about it by linking from a place-
holder on the notebook page to the webpage on the Internet.
SEE ALSO For information about inserting hyperlinks to a webpage, see “Reference 
additional information” in Chapter 6, “Enhance document content.”
Formatting options for notebook page content include only the basics:
 
■
You can apply a limited number of purpose-specific styles, including styles 
for a page title, six heading levels, normal paragraphs (the default), citations, 
quotes, and code. 
 
■
You can format characters by applying bold, italic, underline, and strike-
through font styles, changing the font color, and highlighting content.
 
■
You can format paragraphs in these ways:
 
●
Change the paragraph indent in half-inch increments.
 
●
Create bulleted lists that use the default bullet characters.
 
●
Create numbered lists that use the default numbering formats.
The style and formatting options are available from the Home tab of the ribbon. You 
use the same methods to apply the available styles and formatting to page content 
in OneNote for iPad that you use in Word for iPad.
SEE ALSO For more information, including step-by-step procedures for applying 
styles and formatting, see “Align, space, and indent paragraphs” and “Change the 
appearance of text” in Chapter 4, “Create professional documents,” and “Present content 
in lists” in Chapter 5, “Add visual elements to documents.”

Work with notebook containers
When you enter information onto a notebook page, the information is stored inside 
a note container rather than directly on the page. A page can contain multiple note 
containers; tapping an empty area of the page that is not in or near an existing 
note container creates a new one.
Two note containers on a page
In OneNote for iPad, it's generally simplest to keep all your page content in one 
note container because you can't manipulate the containers as you can in OneNote 
for Windows. Double-tapping the header of a note container selects it and displays 
a shortcut bar of commands for manipulating the content.
Options for working with a selected note container
IMPORTANT When you select a note container it might appear as though you 
actually selected the content. You can easily differentiate between the selection of a 
note container and its content: selecting only the content displays handles, whereas selecting 
the container does not.
In the Windows version of OneNote, you can move and merge note containers by 
dragging them on the page. This functionality is not currently available in OneNote 
for iPad; however, you can move a note container by moving its content.
351
Add information to notebooks

Like the other Office for iPad apps, OneNote automatically saves the changes you 
make to a notebook. You can undo all the changes you’ve made to a Word docu-
ment, Excel workbook, or PowerPoint presentation in the current app session by 
restoring the file to its most recently opened state. However, due to the way that 
OneNote stores information, you can’t restore OneNote notebooks. This can be 
both good and bad—you can enter notes and then exit the notebook without losing 
them, but you must take care when modifying content that you don't delete infor-
mation you might need later.
Organize notes in tables
Certain types of information that you store in a notebook will be easier to track if 
you organize it in tables. OneNote for iPad includes limited table functionality, but 
it does provide the option of inserting and then populating a table. The initial table 
created by OneNote for iPad when you insert a blank table is two columns wide by 
two columns high. You can insert additional rows or columns as necessary. OneNote 
for iPad doesn't include any special formatting options for tables.
To insert a blank 2-by-2 table
1. On the Insert tab, tap the Table button.
To add rows or columns to a table
1. To insert a single row or column, tap to position the cursor in a table cell 
adjacent to where you want to insert the row or column.
Or
To insert multiple rows or columns, select the number of existing rows or col-
umns you want to insert adjacent to where you want to insert the new rows or 
columns.
2. On the Table tool tab, tap the Insert button.
3. On the Insert menu, tap Rows Above, Rows Below, Columns Left, or Columns 
Right.
352
Chapter 11: Store information in digital notebooks

11
To remove rows or columns from a table
1. To remove a single row or column, tap to position the cursor anywhere in that 
row or column.
Or
To remove multiple rows or columns, select cells in the rows or columns you 
want to remove.
2. On the Table tool tab, tap the Delete button.
3. On the Delete menu, tap Rows or Columns.
To delete a table
1. Tap to position the cursor anywhere in the table.
2. On the Table tool tab, tap the Delete button.
3. On the Delete menu, tap Table.
TIP If you are working with an external keyboard connected to your iPad, you can 
create a table while inserting information. To do so, enter content and then press the 
Tab key to move to or create the next cell in the row, and the Return key in the last cell of the 
table to create a new row.
Insert images
One of the great things about OneNote is that you can store not only your own 
notes, but also many other types of information. Pictures, of course, are worth a 
million words—and when you're using OneNote for iPad, you have the advantage 
of working on a device that you can use to easily capture images at the same time 
you're taking notes.
You can insert photos that you’ve already taken with your iPad or another device 
and stored on your iPad or in your photo stream, or you can capture and insert 
photos from within OneNote. This simplifies the process of documenting something 
because you can intersperse pictures among your written notes as appropriate.
353
Add information to notebooks

Your iPad has its own camera app, but OneNote for iPad also comes with its own 
picture-management app, Office Lens. Office Lens has been specially engineered 
to enhance images of text, but you can use it to work with any photo.
A photo captured from within OneNote and displayed in Office Lens
When you capture images of whiteboards, printed documents, sticky notes, or other 
items that display text, Office Lens can enhance the image to make the text content 
easier to read. You can crop and straighten the image, and when you're happy with 
the result, Office Lens inserts the enhanced image into your notebook.
TIP If you prefer to use the standard iPad camera app rather than Office Lens, you can 
turn off Office Lens from the iPad settings for OneNote.

Office Lens crops, straightens, and sharpens text images
The Office Lens app is simple to use—it includes only four controls.
 
■
The Back button returns to the active notebook page without inserting the 
photo.
 
■
The Whiteboard, Photo, and Document modes analyze the photo and crop, 
straighten, and sharpen it to different standards.
 
■
The Crop button displays handles that you can drag to designate the area of 
the photo you want to keep.
 
■
The Finish button accepts the current settings and inserts the photo on the 
notebook page.

1. If you want Office Lens to automatically enhance the image content, tap the 
Whiteboard and Document buttons to preview the results, and then tap 
the mode that best fits your needs.
2. If you want to crop or straighten the photo, tap the Crop button to display 
the original image with crop handles positioned where Office Lens senses that 
the image corners should be.
3. Drag the handles to define the area of the final image and its bottom edge, 
from which Office Lens calculates the alignment of the image.
4. Tap the Finish button to insert the photo.

Insert files from cloud storage locations
In OneNote for iPad, you can insert files from a cloud storage location into your 
notes. Different types of files create different results. For example:
 
■
Inserting a Word document displays a labeled document icon on the page. 
You can display the file content and then open the file for editing.
 
■
Inserting a graphic file displays the graphic on the page.
 
■
Inserting a video file displays a labeled generic icon. You can play the video 
recording.
You can change the icon label from the file name to something more descriptive, 
but note that the labels wrap after approximately 13 characters.
IMPORTANT At the time of this writing, OneNote for iPad supports inserting files 
only from iCloud and Dropbox storage locations.
You can search your cloud storage location for files that contain specific terms. To 
simplify the process of locating a file in your iCloud storage, you can sort the search 
results by Date, Name, or Tags.

Send, print, and link content to notes
When you are using the Windows version of OneNote in conjunction with 
other programs in the Office suite, there are many additional ways you can 
store information in OneNote for safekeeping. For example, you can:
 
■
Send email messages directly from Outlook to a OneNote notebook.
 
■
Link tagged tasks in a notebook to your Outlook task list.
 
■
Take meeting notes in personal or shared notebooks.
 
■
Create notes that are linked directly to specific locations in a Word 
document or PowerPoint presentation.
 
■
Print any Office file to a OneNote notebook.
Although you can’t perform these same actions in OneNote for iPad, you 
can work with the content of notebooks that are stored in shared locations 
in the iPad and Windows versions of OneNote.

Add information to notebooks

Manage pages and sections
From time to time you might find it necessary to modify the storage structure of 
a notebook or move content around within the notebook. Fortunately, it's much 
easier to move information around in an electronic notebook than it is in a physical 
notebook.
You can rearrange notebook elements in the following ways:
 
■
Move pages within a section, to another section in the same notebook, or to a 
section in any open notebook.
 
■
Move sections within a notebook or to any other notebook that you have 
open. When you move a section to a different notebook, it is inserted as the 
last section in the notebook, and the section tab appears to the right of the 
other section tabs in the notebook header.
You can also assign background colors to notebook pages to provide a visual 
indicator of the purpose or status of a page—for example, a green background to 
indicate that the page content is final or an orange background to indicate that a 
page contains confidential information.
TIP Changing the page background color in OneNote for iPad doesn’t affect the color 
of the page tab in the page navigator.
You control the movement of pages by activating the edit functions in the page 
navigator.
Tap Edit at the top of the page navigator to activate the edit functions

■Display notes in different ways
 
■Find information in notebooks
 
■Protect and share information
 
■Synchronize notebook content
The primary point of recording information in a OneNote 
notebook (or recording it anywhere, for that matter) 
is so you can release it from your active memory (to 
make room for more information) but retain it for later 
reference. In other words, if you write it down, you can 
forget it—all you have to remember is where you wrote 
it down.
One of the great things about OneNote is that no matter 
how neatly or messily you store information, it’s still easy 
to find what you’re looking for when you need it. It's 
also easy to share that information with other people or 
invite them to contribute information to your notebook. 
You can provide different people with differing levels of 
access to notebook content.
This chapter guides you through procedures related to 
displaying different views of notebook content, search-
ing for information in notebooks, password-protecting 
notebook sections, sharing notebooks and notebook 
pages, and synchronizing local notebooks with server 
versions.
Practice files
For this chapter, use the practice 
files from the iPadOfficeSBS\Ch12 
folder. For practice file download 
instructions, see the Introduction.

Display notes in different ways
Sometimes it is more convenient to have the entire section and page structure of 
a notebook visible. At other times, you might prefer to display only the content of a 
specific page, or to display the note content in a larger format.
Switch notebook views
OneNote for iPad provides two preconfigured views of notebook content—Normal 
view and Full Page view—that make it easy to switch quickly between viewing all the 
notebook elements and viewing only the page content.
Normal view displays the active ribbon tab and the notebook section tabs above the 
page, and the page navigator to the right of the page. When you’re in Normal view, 
the button at the right end of the ribbon displays two outward pointing arrows, and 
tapping the button switches to Full Page view.
A notebook page in Normal view
Full Page view hides the ribbon, the section tabs, and the page navigator so you can 
focus on the content of the current page. When you’re in Full Page view, the button 
at the right end of the ribbon displays two inward-pointing arrows, and tapping the 
button switches to Normal view.
370
Chapter 12: Locate and share notebook content 

12
A notebook page in Full Page view
When working in Full Page view, you have direct access only to the menus and com-
mands that are available from the ribbon header. You can display individual menus 
and tabs in Full Page view without switching to Normal view.
TIP OneNote maintains the most recently selected view when you switch between 
notebooks.
To change the notebook view
1. To switch from Normal view to Full Page view, tap the Full Page View button 
at the right end of the ribbon.
2. To switch from Full Page view to Normal view, tap the Normal View button at 
the right end of the ribbon.
To work with content in Full Page view
1. Perform any of these actions as you would in Normal view:
 
●
Tap to position the cursor to enter content.
 
●
Double-tap to select content and display shortcut bars.
 
●
Tap the commands that are available on the shortcut bars.
371
Display notes in different ways

2. Use any of these features as you would in Normal view:
 
●
File menu commands
 
●
Search functionality
 
●
Share functionality
3. To access a command on the ribbon without displaying other hidden notebook 
elements:
a. Tap any tab title on the ribbon header to display the tab.
b. Tap the command and complete the associated operation.
c. Tap the title of the displayed tab to hide the tab.
Fit content to the page
In addition to changing the structure within which the content of a page is displayed, 
you can adjust the magnification level to display the content at its actual size or to 
fit the width of the page, whether the notebook is in Normal view or Full Page view.
Page content magnified to page width
372
Chapter 12: Locate and share notebook content 

12
Zoom by touch
In OneNote for iPad, you can manually change the magnification level of 
the page content by pinching or spreading your fingers on the iPad screen. 
When you use this method to zoom in on or out from the content, a marker 
appears between your fingers and displays the current magnification level 
(ranging from Minimum to Maximum with specific percentages in between).
The magnification level appears when you pinch or stretch the page
OneNote for iPad is programmed to change the magnification of only the 
page content, not the entire app window, when you use manual zoom 
techniques.
Find information in notebooks
The purpose of storing information in a OneNote notebook is not only so that you 
no longer have to remember it but also so that you can easily retrieve the informa-
tion later, from any computer or device that is running OneNote. You can easily 
search for keywords or specific information stored in any of your OneNote note-
books and narrow down the results by location. You can also attach tags (icons that 
have specific meanings) to content to help you locate information about the related 
topic on a page.
373
Find information in notebooks

Tag information for reference and retrieval
You can tag individual paragraphs to provide a visual indicator of some sort of infor-
mation about the content of the paragraph. For example, you might want to tag 
information that you need to follow up on, that is linked to a specific project, or that 
is a high priority. You can apply multiple tags to a paragraph; the tags appear within 
the note container to the left of the first line of the paragraph.
Tagging paragraphs provides visual feedback
In OneNote for iPad you can apply any of 27 standard tags. Three common tags are 
available directly from the Home tab of the ribbon, and all the tags are available on 
the menu that expands when you tap the adjacent Tag button.
IMPORTANT Tags provide only a visual cue in OneNote for iPad, but they are 
extremely useful in OneNote for Windows, because you can generate summaries of 
tagged content by storage location or time period. You can also link To Do tags to your 
Outlook task list and update the task status from either location.

Find information in notebooks

Search for text
In OneNote for iPad, you can search for text that was entered directly on a page or 
that appears in files that were printed to OneNote.
TIP In OneNote 2013, you can search for spoken words in audio and video recordings 
and for printed words in images.
The default search settings locate information stored in any open notebook. This is 
very convenient because you don’t have to remember where you stored the infor-
mation or navigate through a series of notebooks, sections, and pages to get to it.
As you enter text in the search box, OneNote highlights matches on all pages within 
the search scope, displays the total number of pages that contain the search term 
at the right end of the search box, and displays links to those pages in the Search 
Results pane. The Search Results pane displays the results in two groups: pages that 
have the search result in the title and pages that have the search result only on the 
page (but not in the title).
TIP A search result group header is shown only if the search returns pages in that 
group. A page will appear in only one group.
Search results appear alphabetically in groups
376
Chapter 12: Locate and share notebook content 

12
Search results are listed within each group in alphabetical order by page title. The 
specific location of the page (notebook and section) is shown below the page title. 
This can be helpful in determining the relevance of the search results on that page, 
so you can quickly find the page that contains the information you're looking for.
By default, OneNote locates all pages that contain the words entered in the search 
box in any order, in all open notebooks. You can get more-focused results by adding 
search terms, specifying that you want to match only exact phrases, or narrowing the 
scope of the search to only the current notebook, section, or section group.
TIP The current search scope appears in the search box until you enter the first 
character of the search term.
To search within the default or most recent scope

Protect and share information
OneNote can provide an excellent platform for the collaborative collection of infor-
mation. People can access the information in a OneNote notebook from many 
different computer systems and devices and can store or link to almost any type 
of information.
When you create a OneNote notebook in a remote storage location, that notebook 
is accessible only to people who have specific user credentials with permission to 
access that location. When you create a notebook by using OneNote for iPad, you 
might do so in a shared storage location that other people already have access to, 
such as a SharePoint document library, or you might create it in a more private 
location that is accessible only to you, such as your personal OneDrive site. If you 
want to share information that is stored in a notebook, you can grant permission 
for people to view or edit the notebook.
Protect notebook sections
Before you share a notebook with other people, consider whether any sections of 
the notebook contain information that you want to keep private or provide to only 
specific people. If so, it isn't necessary to move those sections out of the notebook; 
you can hide the content of any section by assigning a password to the section and 
then locking it. You can password-protect only sections, not individual pages.
You can assign the same password to multiple sections or assign unique passwords 
to different sections. You must lock all password-protected sections of a notebook 
at the same time. You can unlock sections individually.
378
Chapter 12: Locate and share notebook content 

12
The pages and page content of a locked section are hidden
If you want to allow other people to access a password-protected section, you can 
share the password with those people. The password protection becomes effective 
for all users (including you) after the notebook synchronizes with the server. The sec-
tion can be unlocked only by entering the correct password.
SEE ALSO For information about synchronization, see “Synchronize notebook 
content” later in this chapter.

1. Display the section you want to protect.
2. On the View tab, tap Password Protection. Then, on the Password Protection 
menu, tap Protect This Section.
Or
Tap the section tab, tap Password on the shortcut bar, and then tap Protect.
3. In the Password Protection box, enter and reenter a password for the section, 
and then tap Done.
IMPORTANT Take any necessary precautions to ensure that you can remember or 
locate the password, because you will not be able to unlock the section without it.

Chapter 12: Locate and share notebook content 

12
Share notebook content
There are several ways in which you can share the content of a notebook that is 
stored in a shared location:
 
■
You can send a link to the notebook in an email message, instant message,  
or other online communication. You have the option of sending a link that 
permits read-only access or a link that permits read/write access.
When you send a link, message recipients can open the notebook by clicking 
or tapping the link. Thereafter, it will appear in their lists of open notebooks.
 
■
You can attach a PDF version of a notebook page to an email message.
Sending a PDF file is a convenient way to share information with people who 
don't use OneNote or can't access your storage location.
Multiple people can work in a shared OneNote notebook at the same time.
TIP At the time of this writing, OneNote for iPad doesn’t support printing directly 
from a notebook. You can print a page, page group, or section of a notebook by 
opening it in a desktop version of OneNote.
To send a PDF file of a notebook page to other people
1. Display the notebook page you want to share.
2. At the right end of the ribbon, tap the Share button.
3. On the Share menu, tap Email Page.
OneNote creates a PDF file of the active page. The Mail app creates an email 
message with the PDF file attached and automatically sets the file name and 
message subject to the page title.
4. In the message window, enter the recipient information, modify the subject if 
you want to, and enter any additional message content.
5. In the upper-right corner of the message window, tap Send.
SEE ALSO For information about creating and sending links to notebooks, see 
“Distribute files” in Chapter 3, “Create and manage files.”

Protect and share information

Synchronize notebook content
OneNote periodically synchronizes all local copies of a shared notebook with the 
server copy to distribute content changes to all users. The most recent synchroniza-
tion date and time for each open notebook are shown on the Notebooks page of 
the Backstage view.
Synchronization data for all open notebooks
If you prefer, you can manually synchronize one or all open notebooks any time that 
your iPad is online. For example, if a colleague mentions that he or she just updated 
the content of a shared notebook and you want to review the updated content, you 
can synchronize the notebook and have immediate access to the changes.
To synchronize the current notebook
1. On the ribbon, tap the File button.
2. On the File menu, tap Sync This Notebook.

On-screen keyboard tips
The on-screen keyboard appears when you tap an area of a document, worksheet, 
slide, or notebook page in which you can enter text. This keyboard has several forms.
TIP If your iPad is connected to an external keyboard, the on-screen keyboard doesn’t 
appear.
 
■
The standard on-screen keyboard displays the alphabet in QWERTY keyboard 
format and the most common punctuation symbols.
As you tap letters on the keyboard, common words beginning with the letters 
you’ve entered are shown above the top row of letters; the most likely match 
is in the center. You can tap a word to enter it and display the next predicted 
words. This predictive technology is so good that it will frequently predict all 
or most of the sentence you’re entering.
Entering a lot of text from the standard on-screen keyboard can be an ardu-
ous task. To simplify the process and tap fewer times to achieve the result you 
want, you can use the shortcuts described in the following table.

the number keyboard.
 
■
The function keyboard (available only in Excel) displays symbols commonly  
used in formulas on the left, arrow keys in the center, and a calculator-style 
number pad on the right. You switch to the function keyboard by tapping the 
Function button (labeled 123) at the right end of the status bar, which appears 
above the keyboard in Excel.
389
On-screen keyboard tips

To display additional symbols on the function keyboard, tap and hold any key 
that has a green upper-right corner. Slide to the symbol you want to enter, 
and lift your finger from the screen to enter the selected symbol.
TIP Tap the Alphanumeric button (labeled Abc) at the right end of the status 
bar to switch from the function keyboard to the standard keyboard.
The on-screen keyboard takes up a significant percentage of the iPad screen. You 
can display more of the file content by splitting the keyboard into two halves. 
 
■

External keyboard shortcuts
The Bluetooth technology built into the iPad makes it easy to wirelessly connect 
an external keyboard to your iPad. A Bluetooth symbol appears next to the power 
meter in the upper-right corner of your iPad screen when Bluetooth is turned on. 
The symbol is gray when the iPad isn’t connected to a device, and black when it is.
To access Bluetooth settings, open the Settings app and then tap Bluetooth in the 
first group of settings. From the Bluetooth page, you can turn on the Bluetooth 
function, see Bluetooth devices that you’ve approved for connection, and manage 
the connections and settings for those devices.
When you turn on Bluetooth, your iPad becomes discoverable. When you subse-
quently turn on your external Bluetooth keyboard, the two devices should “discover” 
each other. The keyboard will appear in the device list on the Bluetooth page, and 
you can tap it to connect to it.
If you’re working with an external keyboard connected to your iPad, you might find 
it much easier to enter text into documents, workbooks, presentations, and note-
books by typing than by tapping. You can also use iPad versions of many of the  
classic Office keyboard shortcuts, including those described in the following table.

About the author
Joan Lambert has worked closely with Microsoft technologies since 
1986, and in the training and certification industry since 1997. As 
President and CEO of Online Training Solutions, Inc. (OTSI), Joan 
guides the translation of technical information and requirements 
into useful, relevant, and measurable resources for people who are 
seeking certification of their computer skills or who simply want to 
get things done efficiently.
Joan is the author or coauthor of more than three dozen books about Windows 
and Office (for Windows and for Mac) and three generations of Microsoft Office 
Specialist certification study guides. She enthusiastically shares her love of tech-
nology through her participation in the creation of books, learning materials, and 
certification exams, and greatly enjoys communicating the benefits of new tech-
nologies by delivering training and facilitating learning events. Joan is a Microsoft 
Certified Professional, Microsoft Office Specialist Master (for Office 2013, Office 
2010, and Office 2007), Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (for Windows and 
Windows Server), Microsoft Certified Technology Associate (for Windows), Microsoft 
Dynamics Specialist, and Microsoft Certified Trainer.
Joan currently lives in a small town in Texas with her simply divine daughter, Trinity, 
two slightly naughty dogs, a naturally superior cat, a vast assortment of fish, and 
the super-automatic espresso machine that runs the house.
Joan’s team at OTSI specializes in the design and creation of Office, SharePoint, 
and Windows training solutions and the production of online and printed training 
resources. 
For more information about OTSI, visit www.otsi.com or follow us on Facebook 
at www.facebook.com/Online.Training.Solutions.Inc for advance information 
about upcoming training resources and informative tidbits about technology 
and publishing.

Acknowledgments
I am extremely grateful for the support of the many people without whom this book 
would not exist, including these talented members of America’s finest publishing 
team at OTSI:
 
■
Barb Levy, for reviewing and laying out content, and for advocating for readers 
who primarily use Mac computers
 
■
Jaime Odell, for devising creative practice tasks and proofreading the final 
product
 
■
Jean Trenary, for perfecting the layout template and guiding our production 
processes
 
■
Jeanne Craver, for processing and pixelating graphics
 
■
Kathy Krause, for thoughtful copyediting and content support, and for 
 shepherding the project through to completion
 
■
Steve Lambert, for providing the automated solutions that helped us to work 
more efficiently on this book and will simplify processes for future books
 
■
Susie Carr and Krista Wall, for thoroughly indexing this book so readers can 
find the information they’re looking for
I deeply appreciate the time and efforts of my fellow redheaded trainer, Linda Larkan 
at Skylark Services, who helped to document and review procedures; and of Carol 
 Dillingham, Rosemary Caperton, and the team at Microsoft Press—past and  present—
who made this and so many other books possible.
Finally, this book would not have come into being without the advice of my resident 
iDevice expert, Trinity, and the life lessons taught to me by my father, Steve, who got 
me into this game in the first place by including my depiction of Robots in Love in one 
of his earliest books, Presentation Graphics on the Apple Macintosh. I am so fortunate 
to work with my amazing family members. Thank you both for your unfailing support, 
and for inspiring and reminding me to enjoy life every day.
