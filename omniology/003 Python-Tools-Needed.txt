This course is all about the Python language and the standard library
I do not make use of any 3rd party library
EXCEPT
Jupyter Notebooks
→I can provide you fully annotated code
→all notebooks are downloadable
→but you should really use github

To follow along you will therefore need:
CPython 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
You favorite Python editor:
VSCode, PyCharm, command line + VIM/Nano/…
I use Anaconda's Python installation:
https://conda.io/docs/index.html
