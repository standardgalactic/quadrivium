 Introduction 
 Welcome to the second edition of  Bloggers Boot Camp , where we keep all the coolness from 
the ﬁ rst edition, and add everything we’ve learned since the last edition hit the shelves 
three years ago. In Internet time, three years is like thirty years in less innovative ﬁ elds. 
So much has evolved and changed since we ﬁ rst penned the original  Bloggers Boot Camp 
in 2010 that we’re going to have lots to write about, and we’re glad you decided to join us. 
 First, we’ve added a new chapter that will interest many of you: how to get a job at a 
big blog or website that already exists, using the knowledge you’ve gained in this book 
to hit the ground running at a high-trafﬁ c, major-league website. We’ll show you how to 
build your brand, spread the word about your new adventures, and make that leap from 
one career into this new world of always-on communication and personal expression. 
 We’ll talk about how blogging has gotten even closer to the mainstream media, mak-
ing the divide between them almost imperceptible. We’ll show you new ways to get your 
blog online and ﬁ nd the best designs for your blog, introduce you to new ways to use 
photos and graphics, and show you how to integrate podcasting into your media empire. 
 One of the biggest growth areas has been social media, and we have decided to add 
a great deal more to this edition. We’re going to reveal techniques we’ve learned for pro-
moting your work on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and other platforms that can make a 
post explode. We’ll talk with experts to give you further insights into leveraging social 
media into your blogging strategy. And we’ll warn you of the dangers of social media, 
alerting you to the booby traps we’ve seen too many great writers fall victim to. We even 
have three key rules for spreading the word, and a new Golden Rule of Blogging that 
you’ll want to always remember. 
 At the same time, as we’ve always done in this book, we’re going to teach you the 
most important skill of all: how to write for blogs and online publications. More speciﬁ -
cally, you’ll learn how to write content geared toward today’s readers, and we’ve learned 
boatloads of new tips and techniques for that, discovering to an even more reﬁ ned degree 
what works and what doesn’t. 
 Blogs are a new medium. They’re powerful and deserve to be taken seriously. Your 
own blog and your own writing can change the world or ﬂ ounder in obscurity. It’s up to 
you, but we’re here to help.

Introduction
xiv
 Bloggers can make money doing what they love, but it is hard work. It usually takes 
a lot of time to develop an audience. It requires the serious initiative of a self-starter. Not 
everyone can be a successful blogger, although we hope to give you the tools necessary 
to get a running start. 
 If you’re already blogging now, we’ll show you techniques that will help you become 
a better blogger and a better writer in general. 
 Blogging requires regular and daily effort. A blog is like a shark—it stays alive only if 
it keeps moving. You can’t write just one blog post per week and expect people to keep 
returning. We’ll teach you some tricks to keep the content fresh and constantly ﬂ owing 
from your keyboard. More importantly, we’ll teach you how to monetize your hard work. 
 There is no magic bullet for creating a successful blog, especially if your goal is not 
overtly commercial and is instead a desire to share your viewpoint with the world. 
 We’re not here to help you make a million dollars a year blogging, but we want to give 
you the tools necessary to give you an exponentially better chance of success. 
 Why us? We know why blogs fail and we know why they succeed—we have extensive 
experience in many forms of online media and feel it’s time to start sharing some of our 
expertise with other prospective bloggers. 
 The good news is that your barrier to entry is easy to break through. What will you 
need? At the very least you will need a computer with an Internet connection, ideally a 
fast one. Even that is not set in stone anymore, because now users of mobile devices may 
ﬁ nd that they will be able to blog from the streets of their cities as easily as they do from 
their desktops, snapping pictures to illustrate their stories directly from those mobile 
devices. There are almost as many blogging tools as there are bloggers. 
 Here’s the best news: You won’t have to start from scratch, because we’ve already 
made the mistakes, found the successes, and learned what works and what doesn’t in 
the blogosphere. 
 We’ll show you the ropes. We’ll show you how hot sites like  Mashable ,  Gizmodo , and 
 TechCrunch work their magic to attract millions of readers every day. We’ll show you how 
we create our own microblogs and gain hundreds of readers overnight. We’ll show you 
how to think about the strange calculus of audience, content, and reach. 
 But ﬁ rst, who are we? We’ll be writing this book as “we,” but for the introductions, 
allow us to write individually. 
 John Biggs is the East Coast editor of  TechCrunch , a tech website owned by AOL, and 
Charlie White just ﬁ nished a two-and-a-half year stint at  Mashable , a social media news 
site. We have worked with teams of up to thirty writers, and we both bring in millions of 
pageviews a month—about 100 million at last count. In the world of modern pro-blogging 
we’re about as big as you can get without being CNN. We’ve written—and still write—
more than forty posts per month on topics ranging from politics to the latest smartphone. 
 How did we get here? That’s a funny story. 
 John’s Fall and Rise 
 The late 1990s and early 2000s brought a new world where the business section of the 
newspaper turned from a one-page add-on at the back of the sports page into a full-
ﬂ edged section detailing the deals, IPOs, and ﬂ ame-outs of the “dot-com” era. Tech news 
was now a big part of the landscape, and the old magazines— PC Magazine ,  PC World , 
 Newsweek ,  Fast Company —were shrinking in size and revenue. Business meant technology

now, not just stuffed shirts making decisions over pensions. More importantly, news was 
appearing online faster than ever before. Websites were eviscerating newspapers at a clip 
that no one could have expected a decade before, but no one trusted blogs. 
 It was the summer of 2004, mid-August. I was working at  Laptop magazine, a print 
title that reviewed the latest laptops, cellphones, and tablets. There were hundreds of 
new devices rolling out every year, and each needed a few thousand words written about 
it. Everything got a long, 5,000-word feature article, or, barring that, a shorter 1,000-word 
review. Brevity was not the soul of wit at  Laptop . It was, in fact, the enemy. For all this 
work, the auditors were able to assess that  Laptop  was the top-selling magazine in the 
Honolulu airport. That’s right: we were primarily popular in touristy island newsstands 
in the Paciﬁ c. It wasn’t a very heartening situation. 
 I had been blogging—a fancy term for putting things on the Internet—for most of four 
years, starting with a site I ran called  BigWideLogic . It was my personal site, a goofy collec-
tion of links that I rarely updated. I also started a watch website called  WristwatchReview 
in 2003, making me one of the ﬁ rst watch bloggers in the world. That is not to say that 
either of those ventures was particularly good, serious, or lucrative. I made little money 
from advertising—perhaps $10 a month—but I had free Internet hosting from a friend, so 
at least the only thing I spent was time and attention. 
 However, the process of preparing stories for the sites—posts—taught me a great deal 
about what to look for in a good, short piece. I was just giving things a try, and back in 
those heady days, there was no guarantee of success. A tech site,  Gizmodo,  was about a 
year old, written by a snarky kid named Joel Johnson who took over after its founder, 
Peter Rojas, bolted for another site,  Engadget . Meanwhile, there were ideas sprouting on 
the blogging landscape. The Julie/Julia Project, the precursor to  Julie & Julia , begun in early 
2002, was beginning to gain a small following that led—years later—to fortune and fame 
for its heretofore-unknown author. The only “cool” online news source of note was  Salon , 
and in 2003, shares of the company were selling for 5 cents in over-the-counter markets. 
There was, in a way, no reason to think anyone on the Internet could go pro. 
 One August morning my editor walked into my secluded back ofﬁ ce and asked me 
to clear out my desk. I was being laid off. The technical magazine I worked for no longer 
needed a technical editor to read over the pages to ensure technical accuracy. It was fac-
ing a downturn in readership and value that almost led to the title’s demise. 
 I left for home, dumbfounded. I was a tech guy at heart. I studied IT in college, and 
I had quit a semi-lucrative but soul-sucking job as a computer consultant in 2000 to get 
a master’s in journalism from New York University. Now, in my ﬁ rst real journalism job, 
they made me redundant. Luckily, that week I emailed Joel at  Gizmodo , who invited me 
to interview for a “reporter” position for the site. I drove to meet Joel in Brooklyn’s hip 
Greenpoint district, and we ate Polish food. There he laid it out for me: His day consisted 
of long hours spent in a chair, poring over the Internet for stories to write. Some days he 
did nothing but rewrite press releases. He was tired and he looked burned out, nervous, 
and edgy. In fact, lunch was taking too long. He needed to get back to his computer, so 
we cut the interview short and he told me that he had ten more posts to write before he 
went to bed. 
 This didn’t sound like any journalism job I’d ever heard of. In fact, it sounded, at ﬁ rst, 
like heaven: no editors, no deadlines, no workﬂ ow. It was, at its core, the purest form of a 
“beat” I had seen. It was ﬁ rst-thought-best-thought, writ large. The job, in short, consisted 
of writing about cool things all day, as quickly as possible, and being funny about it.

 I got the job mostly because I was free. I got lucky. I was up against writers from the 
 New York Times  and tech gurus from the rapidly shrinking tech magazines. In fact, blog-
ging for  Gizmodo  wasn’t like writing for a magazine. I was up in the morning at 7 a.m. 
and writing until 10 p.m. There was no real work/life balance—a trap I fell into early—
and there was no sense that the job ever stopped. I started working with Joel, producing 
twenty-eight stories a day, and then when Joel left I hired a few other writers, includ-
ing Charlie White. By the time I left, the site was bumping up against the 18 million 
pageview-per-month mark. Now it is topping out at more than 100 million. 
 I never went back to print. Today, ironically,  Laptop  now makes its money from the 
web. The paper version is no more. A few years later Joel got rid of me at  Gizmodo —they 
wanted to hire a writer from hoary old  Wired magazine to replace me—and I wrote a 
good-bye post that still exists on the site. A few days later I got a call from a brusque man 
who lived in San Francisco. “I want you to start a gadget site for me,” he said. His name 
was Michael Arrington, and he owned a start-up business blog called  TechCrunch . 
 He invited me to visit him at his ranch-style rental in Atherton, California. I arrived 
late—around 2 p.m.—and he was just waking up, having spent all night blogging. He took 
me to Costco to buy wine for a party he was having that night, and he asked me a few 
questions. A few days later I was running  CrunchGear , my own site. I hired a kid who IMed 
me out of the blue one day—Blake Robinson—and grew the team with ex- Gizmodo writers 
and a few hotshot freelancers. It felt like the best time of my life. 
 A few years passed and AOL bought  TechCrunch .  CrunchGear  folded into the main site, 
and I got a great team of gifted writers who have made my job even better. 
 I got lucky . . . again. 
 Why did I tell that story? Well, we have been blogging since the beginning of the blog-
ging revolution. Combine our years spent behind the keyboard and you’ll ﬁ nd that we’ve 
been blogging longer than almost anyone in the world. 
 Charlie and I grab more than 100 million pageviews per month on multiple sites. 
We’ve written more than 20,000 blog posts between us, launched wildly successful blogs, 
dealt with all of the intricacies of the new medium, and reveled in our success. Now it’s 
time for us to pass this hard-won knowledge along to you, letting you learn from our tri-
umphs, while helping you avoid our mistakes. 
 Charlie’s Tale 
 I’m Charlie White, and in the midst of a thirty-year career producing and directing televi-
sion broadcasts, I started writing about technology on the web in 1994. The web wasn’t 
much to look at back then. If you’ve been around that long, you’ll remember those ancient 
days when Mosaic was the most popular browser, Bill Clinton was president, and Windows 
95 was considered futuristic technology. Five years later, I was spending most of my time 
(while working two full-time jobs) writing about technology for a group of websites called 
 Digital Media Net . One day at a trade show in 2000, several of my journalist cohorts and 
I decided to write short two-paragraph news stories about what we’d just seen and expe-
rienced on the show ﬂ oor. The immediacy of these punchy paragraphs caught on quickly 
with readers, and suddenly we realized that this could turn into an entirely new medium. 
 Unfortunately, my short-sighted managers disagreed, so the concept lay dormant, 
and I continued working in the web journalism environment of the time. That revolved 
around webzines and portals—megasites that linked to numerous afﬁ liated sites, all

under the same umbrella. And all their content consisted of longish, magazine-like arti-
cles, product reviews, editorials, and features. They weren’t blogs yet. 
 After toiling away at that business model for a few years longer, by 2005, a technol-
ogy and gadget blog  Gizmodo  caught my attention. Its trafﬁ c was starting to eclipse the 
numbers of the large portal for which I was working. What kind of site could garner such 
impressive numbers, I wondered. Surely it must have involved a staff bigger than that 
of  Digital Media Net —a dozen writers or more? Hardly. All that content, some thirty posts 
daily, was cranked out by a quick-writing, wisecracking crew the size of a pickup bas-
ketball team. These four hungry journalists had a nose for news and a love of gadgetry 
and high tech. They wrote as a group, using a unique and cohesive style, where all were 
able to express a similar and astute brand of humor. It was working—they had amassed 
a rabid following. I wanted to get myself mixed up with such excitement, so I contacted 
the site’s editor, my future writing partner and the other author of this book, John Biggs, 
who invited me to join the blogging revolution. “I’ll hook you up,” he typed into an instant 
message. “Start tomorrow.” It was that easy. I got lucky, too. 
 Two years later, I had banged out 4,442 articles on that eclectic gadget site. Over those 
years, the site’s trafﬁ c grew from 7 million pageviews per month when I started to 83 
million when I left in 2008. But the money was decidedly unsatisfying, so my next stop 
was NBC Universal, where the mainstream media giant lured me into writing more than 
2,500 blog posts, reviews, and features for the SyFy-powered blog  DVICE over the next 
three years. 
 My next stop was  Mashable , one of the ﬁ ve most inﬂ uential blogs in the world with 
more than 25 million unique visitors each month. John recommended me for the job one 
weekend after a headhunter had called him to poach him from  TechCrunch . In short order, 
the headhunter was calling me. 
 As senior editor there, I wrote 1,433 posts, reviews, and features, resulting in the high-
est trafﬁ c numbers anyone has ever achieved at that site. I edited every word published 
on the site each weekend, and learned even more about blogging, journalism, what read-
ers want, and how to identify and measure success, and perhaps most importantly, how 
to create compelling social media. I ﬁ gured out what has made  Mashable such a roaring 
success. 
 Look: we got lucky. There are no two ways about it. But we got lucky because we were 
ready when the call came. You can get lucky, too. Online personalities are becoming a 
more important part of the media landscape.  You can take part in the conversation, and 
you can lead the conversation , whether through the written word, photography, or video. 
 One blogger, our buddy Scott McKenzie, parlayed his love of books into a success-
ful site about the publishing industry and used his contacts there to score a contract 
with two major publishers. Blogger Cali Lewis became famous for her no-nonsense video 
reviews of new technology. Political blogger Ana Marie Cox turned into a well-known 
Beltway pundit after scribbling for  Wonkette . One thing made these bloggers stand out 
and gave them success:  perseverance and a strong impulse to produce—whether it’s a 
post, a video, or a rant—daily and well . 
 We are not social media snake oil salesmen. We are not afﬁ liate marketers. We don’t 
want to offer you a four-hour workweek. We are real journalists breaking real news. If you 
want a get-rich-quick scheme, the Internet is rife with them. Hit Google. If you think blog-
ging is a sure-ﬁ re way to get free stuff from companies for being an inﬂ uencer, then you’d 
best pack up now. However, if you want to learn how to run a successful news business

and maybe make some money in the process, we’re here for you. But that’s not all. We 
can also teach you how to become a giant in your ﬁ eld. We can teach you how to become 
a more valuable employee, how to use blogging to get a better job, and how to become 
important online. 
 When we say we’re here for you, we mean that. Check the end of this book for ways 
to contact us to ask questions, make recommendations, and to just keep us abreast of 
your doings. Just because this is a paper book (or ebook) doesn’t mean the learning has 
to stop at the last page. 
 Enough about us. Who are you? 
 If our assumptions are correct, you have something to say and you want everyone 
else to know what it is. But there’s a big problem right now: There are billions of other 
blogs competing for the attention of your prospective readers. We’ll show you how to grab 
their attention. We’ll show you how to ﬁ nd the best stories, and what to do with them 
after you ﬁ nd them. We’ll show you how to make your blog stand out from all the rest. 
 If you can write and you have passion about your topic, blogging is easy. It should 
be noted that the difference between being a journal writer and a journalist is stark and 
important. Bloggers might write about themselves, but they are always seeing the bigger 
picture. Bloggers might wax euphoric, hold grudges, and display bias, but at their heart 
they are attempting to bring truth to light in the best ways they know how. 
 Many high-trafﬁ c blogs seem like massive journalistic entities, but, as Joel Johnson 
once wrote, “most of the time—we’re just talking.” We’re talking about what we like, what 
we don’t like, what we learned today about something you might know little about, or 
what we stupidly think we understand about something in which you’re an expert. Blog-
ging is a form of journalism just as ballet is a form of dance. Journalism is a “process” 
whereas blogging—electronic writing—is a speciﬁ c subtype of that process. 
 Being a  successful  blogger is hard. Not only will we show you how to pick the best blog-
ging platform for your needs and how to drive users to your blog, but also we’ll show you 
all the tips and tricks we’ve learned along the way, emphasizing quality, ﬁ nding the best 
stories, and gathering millions of readers to a blog whose ﬁ rst day had none. Okay, maybe 
it had one reader—Charlie’s dad. 
 Blogging goes way beyond mere content. It’s a conversation between you and your 
audience. We’ll show you the best way to interact with your audience, how to encour-
age their input, how to deal with unruly commenters, and how to attract the best 
 commenters—which many readers think is the most entertaining part of a blog. 
 No longer will journalists sit in their ivory towers, comfortable with writing two col-
umns a month. Creating a blog is like riding on a fast-moving train, and to navigate these 
newfound, gleaming rails of virtual steel, you’ll need additional skills that go far beyond 
writing. We’ll show you how to ﬁ nd or create compelling graphics, make a viral video that 
could spread to millions of viewers, promote your posts with social media, and how to 
reach a world full of readers with your ideas. 
 If you are an old-guard journalist, don’t forget what you know. However, don’t expect 
the safety net of process journalism to protect you anymore. You are now on your own, 
and you make or break your story. There’s no one else to blame when the support system 
you had grown accustomed to is gone. There are new ways to ﬁ nd news, and we’ll show 
you how to ﬁ nd out what’s happening in the world you choose to cover. With all the elec-
tronic tools available, you no longer have to camp out at the police station to get fresh 
news. This is not your father’s journalism. The barriers to entry are lower, the information

is a whole lot easier to ﬁ nd, and you’ll be able to put together stories and publish them 
immediately, promote them instantly via social media, and receive feedback from your 
readers minutes, or even seconds, later. This is ultimately freeing and frightening at the 
same time. 
 Maybe you’re not trying to become a capital W Writer. That’s ﬁ ne, too. We can show 
you how to use these techniques to improve your marketing efforts and head to the front 
of the pack when it comes to your career, your interests, and your industry. Blogging has 
helped plenty of people get big, and it’s still a great way to get noticed in a crowded world. 
 If you are reading this, you see the writing on the wall: Formal news and publishing 
organizations, as they exist today, are disappearing. Aside from the dinosaurs that still 
roam the earth, limping along and wondering what hit them, the daily local newspaper is 
on life support. Magazines are hitting the iPad, and some titles exist in the ether entirely. 
The closest analog to what you will be doing while blogging is the old-fashioned wire 
service that required a unique combination of talent, skill, and precision. But it’s not 
all about writing. It’s about video, it’s about audio, it’s about being a one-man-band at a 
trade show while the rest of the “mainstream” journalistic community has the force and 
resources of a large news-gathering organization at their backs. 
 We are also not saying that the so-called mainstream media is in any way our enemy 
or beyond our reach. Blogs are the mainstream media for a vast group of Internet-savvy 
news readers. You might have heard that 60 percent of teenagers pay no attention to 
mainstream news, but most will be more than happy to watch Jon Stewart on  The Daily 
Show . Attention spans are shorter, and they’re looking for new points of view aside from 
the old guard. The good news? There are millions of readers hungry for fresh, punchy 
info, and willing to ﬁ nd it from almost any form of niche blogger imaginable. 
 This is where you come in. We are offering the beginning and intermediate blogger 
our secret formula that we’ve learned through years of experience at the most powerful 
blogs in the world: the key to building a more active, interesting, and widely read blog, 
as well as expanding your reach and voice to create a unique online identity. We’ll show 
you why this new medium is different from magazines, newspapers, and video, and we’ll 
show you how to successfully attract an audience. Advanced bloggers will be able to use 
this book to learn a few best practices from guys who have been doing this longer than 
anyone else. No one has codiﬁ ed the rules of blogging, and so that’s what we set out to do. 
 To be a successful blogger, you need to concentrate on content production and audi-
ence gathering. There are many tools in a blogger’s arsenal, but the most important is 
perseverance and understanding of your topic. You can blog about anything you want, 
and obviously you’re approaching this effort from a professional standpoint. Lots of peo-
ple say that bloggers write about what they’re having for lunch and their cats. But, if you 
create a successful food blog—see  Julie & Julia —or a site dedicated to lists of funny pic-
tures covering everything from cupcakes to cats—BuzzFeed.com—you can create a suc-
cessful niche, turning what used to be considered one step below journal-keeping into a 
lucrative and exciting business.

 The Niche 
 Laying the Foundation 
 What’s Your Name, Private? 
 If you’re reading this you want to be a blogger. Maybe you’re working a full-time job 
that is ultimately unfulﬁ lling to you, and during your free moments you’re musing about 
something entirely different. Or you’re a journalist who wants to get in on the blog-
ging revolution, and you’ve discovered a niche with little or no competition thus far. Or 
maybe you read a lot of blogs, consistently convinced you could do a better job yourself. 
Or you’re working on becoming an expert in a speciﬁ c ﬁ eld and you need a body of work 
that you can point to in meetings. Bam! You’re on the road to conceiving a blog. 
 Many blogs exist because a fan or expert is tired of reading wrong things written 
about his or her topics of interest. While in the old days you would call these people 
“crackpots,” now they are called bloggers. However, you’re going to perform this service 
considerably more intelligently and intelligibly than some old-timer railing against the 
government in the editorial pages. You’re going to cover the story using your unique 
point of view and skill set. 
 So what are you up against? What is blogging? What is a blogger? And, most impor-
tant, how can you become one? 
 Blogging is journalism on a thirty-minute deadline. That’s the easiest way to explain 
it. While there are all sorts of blogs online, the best ones cover news and cover it quickly, 
adding a bit of fun, quirk, or extra information.  Blog posts can also be reviews, essays, 
infographics, and the like, but if you’re covering a niche you need to be fast, right, and 
readable. 
 A blogger is a journalist.  To say otherwise is to demean a medium that has fought 
long and hard for a place at the media table. The best bloggers run circles around “profes-
sional” journalists. 
 Blogging is still the domain of the dedicated amateur.  Let no one tell you differently—
blogging is run by the little guy. Sure there are big blogs, but they are most often written 
by folks who are just starting out in the writing business. There’s a difference between 
an amateur and  amateurish  work, however. Amateurs grow and change and improve, and 
that’s what we’re here to do: to help you move from beginner to expert in a few steps, 
and to make sure you understand that dedication, hard work, and drive are all you need 
to become a successful blogger.

 If you’re currently blogging, describe what you’re blogging about in one complete 
sentence. It should be unerringly simple. If you’re blogging about technology, you’d write, 
“I cover mobile phones with an emphasis on devices for older Americans.” If you’re writ-
ing about romance novels, you’d write, “I blog about romance novels set in historical 
time periods and with a strong heroine.” You’ll notice the level of focus you should have 
in your blogging experience. You are an individual writing about a certain topic with a 
certain expertise. If you’re an older technology blogger, write for your age group. If you’re 
a mother, write about bicycling for moms. The key here is  niche or, if you’re thinking in 
terms of old media, a premise. 
 You don’t have to stick to the premise throughout your career, but, on your ﬁ rst day 
at the keyboard, this premise should be the ﬁ rst thing on your mind. Think “I’m a blogger 
who writes for left-handed philatelists who collect Mauritanian air mail stamps” rather 
than “I write about cool stamps.” 
 These niches don’t have to be ephemeral, either. You can cover the war in Syria. You 
can cover terror plots in the news. You can cover bioscience. You can cover diseases. Any-
thing is fair game. 
 We’ll discuss this in depth further on, but our goal now is to ﬁ nd your focus. What 
do you write about? What are you passionate about? What topic will carry you along 
through the trials and tribulations that come with blogging? 
 If you haven’t started blogging yet, you’re actually lucky. So far, your blog is only the 
germ of an idea, and what you’re doing right now might not feel important. That is not 
true. Whether you realize it or not, right now, you’re doing the most vital work that will 
ever be done for your blog: that is, you’re choosing the direction the site will take from 
now on. You’re carving out the niche for your blog, and what you decide now will ulti-
mately determine whether your work will be successful. 
 What do you need to be a good blogger?  Besides the technical equipment, you’ll need 
to possess a way with words and, more important, perseverance. The Internet is littered 
with dead blogs that had little of those two characteristics. Of the millions of blogs cur-
rently in existence, many are dormant, many are unread, and many are just plain bad. 
Our goal, in short, is to help you avoid the pitfalls many bloggers fall into, and in the pro-
cess, make a little—or a lot—of money doing what you love. 
 You must deﬁ ne your goals before beginning a career in blogging.  Do you want to 
make money? Do you want recognition? Do you want to research a topic? Do you want to 
become an expert? Your answer should be a permutation of any of the aforementioned 
questions. Perhaps you are a researcher who wants to ﬁ nd a new job by becoming an 
expert in a new ﬁ eld. Perhaps you are tired of the grind and want to expand out of your 
cubicle. Maybe you’re looking to improve your private consulting operation by becoming 
well-known in your profession. Perhaps you just graduated with a journalism degree and 
you don’t want to live at home. Before we go any further, write down your goal. This is of 
utmost importance, young blogger, and will guide your career. 
 What the Heck Is Blogging? 
 Blogging at its most basic level is the keeping of an online journal. At its most transcen-
dent, however, a blog encompasses the journalism every nonﬁ ction writer aspires to, an 
achievement this book will help you embrace.

 A  blog  is a website that’s organized in usually short articles called  posts . Don’t call 
the articles themselves “blogs”—if you must put the word “blog” in there, call them blog 
posts. The newer entries are always placed at the top, while older entries scroll down as 
each new one is added. As time passes, your readers encounter each story laid out in this 
reverse chronological log format. 
 Why is it called a blog? A writer and programmer named Dave Winer created the ﬁ rst 
“web log” when he built a site called Scripting.com. The site featured the reverse chrono-
logical (newest stories ﬁ rst) arrangement. A web log, then, would be similar to a captain’s 
log—a place to store snippets of information. Winer’s idea quickly became known as a 
 weblog , a term that has since evolved into its shortened and most familiar form, blog. 
 Winer created a basic system for distributing his ideas about programming and hard-
ware, and incorporated something called Really Simple Syndication or RSS, allowing 
readers to access his posts from programs called  newsreaders  (we’ll talk about those in 
 Chapter 5 ). This, in a sense, divorced the blog from the website on which it was hosted. 
Blogs themselves have become part of many static websites and are now a way for devel-
opers and CEOs to send little missives from inside a company or organization. In fact, 
organizational blogs by Google and Apple have replaced many ofﬁ cial news repositories. 
Blog posts have quickly replaced staid, boring press releases on corporate sites—a wel-
come change. 
 True blogging did not take off until a Silicon Alley (New York City’s answer to Califor-
nia’s Silicon Valley) rivalry began between Nick Denton, a former  Financial Times  journalist, 
and Jason Calacanis, the publisher of  The Silicon Alley Reporter . Denton began a site called 
 Gawker and focused on New York gossip. When that site grew popular, he expanded his 
empire, starting a technology and gadget site called  Gizmodo , where both your humble 
narrators began their blogging careers in the mid-2000s. 
 At the same time, Calacanis was creating a rival blog network called Weblogs, Inc. 
His goal was to saturate the market with niche blogs written by low-paid but dedicated 
editors. Both companies grew out of the ashes of the dot-com bust, and both publishers 
found themselves with a surfeit of talent. Calacanis, however, poached one of Denton’s 
writers to start  Engadget , and when Weblogs, Inc. was sold to America Online, the ﬁ rst 
blogging millionaires—and the ﬁ rst blog rivalry—was born. 
 Weblogs, Inc. and Gawker Media were the ﬁ rst to meld content management, adver-
tising, and cheap labor to create a blog network designed, through synergistic linking, to 
build trafﬁ c. In fact, it can be argued that Weblogs, Inc. and Gawker Media were the ﬁ rst 
sites where “trafﬁ c” was a main concern, in contrast with the years preceding the found-
ing of these organizations, when media operations saw the web as, at best, a distraction. 
 Gawker Media, and to an extent, Weblogs, Inc., deﬁ ned a methodology and style that 
critics excoriated and eventually adopted. The goal of the blog was a stream of content 
so overwhelming that it required frequent updates. This was coupled with a conversa-
tional style that spoke of “outsider” journalism, a suggestion that the writer was in a 
beleaguered underclass, not beholden to the vagaries of the entrenched media. This plan 
worked well for years until, of course, blogs became entrenched media. 
 The entrenchment reached a fever pitch in September 2010, when America Online 
went on a buying spree. It ﬁ rst extended its reach by spending about $40 million to buy 
Michael Arrington’s  TechCrunch (including  CrunchGear , the site John Biggs was editing at 
the time). A mere ﬁ ve months later, it acquired the jewel in its New Media crown, the #1 
blog in the world,  Hufﬁ ngton Post , for $315 million in cash. In a matter of less than a half a

year, AOL, a former laughingstock of the tech world that became known for mailing mil-
lions (billions?) of useless CDs to countless mailboxes throughout the world, was back on 
top as the world’s blogging juggernaut. 
 If this is all too “inside-baseball” esoteric, rest assured that it’s important to under-
stand who the major players are in this space and how they operate. You can learn a 
great deal, for example, about how  The Verge  covers a technology press conference or how 
 Politico  handles an election. If there is one rule to live by, however, it’s this:  Everything 
about blogging is being made up on the ﬂ y . As successful as these sites are, there are few 
“best practices” to follow, and the ones that exist we will outline in this book. Blogging 
has moved far too fast to codify any sort of “style guide” or list of do’s and don’t’s, which 
is why we decided to write these chapters. 
 Although there are plenty of more popular blogs these days, sites like  Gawker and 
 Gizmodo  deﬁ ned an entire genre of writing—a snarky, New York–centric voice that speaks 
to both the experts in technology, media, and sports and the dilettantes. Great bloggers 
are good at making readers feel like they are part of a privy conversation full of gossip, 
lore, and insider knowledge. Anything less and you’re basically reading a newspaper clip-
ping. Many of the same bloggers who began at  Gizmodo are now heading up major blogs 
elsewhere. The talent pool that came out of these early years is still controlling the web. 
 Calacanis and Denton got rich with their blogging empires, but this is not to say 
everyone involved in those early years of blogging got rich quick. There were plenty of 
bloggers—millions—who made absolutely no money and accomplished nothing. This 
book will give you the tools to avoid that frustrating fate. 
 However, by taking the Denton/Calacanis model and expanding it, many blogs have 
found their niche and discovered a potent advertising model. The result?  In less than a 
decade, a new medium was created.  The most exciting part of this revolution is the way 
it’s harnessed the immediacy of the web, and given a voice to those who might not have 
had such an opportunity a mere ten years ago. 
 Think about it: At the turn of the century, the majority of people had no far-reaching 
voice to reach the masses. They could try to be published in journals or magazines. Their 
quests for stardom were often driven through attempts at being in the “it scene” or send-
ing out demo tapes to bored A&R men. Now, however, the average Joe or Jane (or Justin or 
Jenna) can become an Internet sensation overnight. Bloggers are brought on as experts 
in mainstream news programs, and blogs often force mainstream journalists to get off 
their duffs and actually research a story. For instance, a blogger broke the Bush-Gore 
recount, and blogs helped aggregate the Afghan War documents released by Wikileaks. 
Now, even more stories are broken on Twitter, which is tightly intertwined with blogs, as 
well as Facebook, big media websites, and newscasts. Blogging is still a new medium, and 
it’s competing with the big guns of media. All media are using Twitter and Facebook to 
drive trafﬁ c to sites and blogs, breaking big stories. And it’s all happening in fast motion 
compared to a few short years ago. 
 The blog is a powerful medium when used correctly. Blog formats give writers tre-
mendous ﬂ exibility. That means you can be your own boss and write about anything 
you want. It’s all in your hands, but you can’t just write at random. Your goal is to intro-
duce your readers to the most compelling topics in your world at that moment, and then 
bring your own unique insights to those topics. Add more facts you’ve found elsewhere 
in your world, or blurt out those nagging notions you have rattling inside your head. Mix 
in some of your own perspectives that readers might not have ever thought of on their

own. Entertain and surprise them with your wit, your personal experience, and your well-
supported opinions. 
 Researchers take note:  Becoming a blogger is the fastest way to become an expert on 
a particular topic or niche . You are immediately seen as someone in-the-know, and with 
a big enough audience, you can turn that experience into ad dollars, a book contract, or 
simply a completed thesis.  Most popular blogs were created by writers who wanted to 
share what they knew . Just ask Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, founders of Reddit. 
They thought there were so many sources of information on the web that somehow it all 
needed to be aggregated into one place. “It seemed like the Internet was going to need a 
new front page,” said Alexis Ohanian. “Because content was being created, even back in 
2005, by such a broad array of sources.” 
 Steve Huffman said the two college seniors decided to combine the mechanisms of 
Delicious, which had the most popular content on the web, and Slashdot, which had a 
knack for ﬁ nding high-quality content. The combination of quality and popularity would 
prove itself to be worthy of being called the new front page of the web. Huffman and 
Ohanian created something that didn’t exist before, a site that the web needed in the 
worst possible way. That’s what you need to do with your blog. Identify a niche—an idea 
 Old News vs. New Media 
 News organizations are still floundering in the shoals of misunderstanding 
and assessing new ways of selling content in a world where content is free. Blogging is changing 
the way we think about news and opinion, and it’s moving eyeballs away from established news 
sites and toward upstarts. This, then, is the opportunity for you to capture—and it’s also the 
juggernaut you’re up against. Even as they deride the blog revolution as the work of amateurs 
piggy-backing on their expensive content, media organizations are trying desperately to copy 
the magic that defines many of the biggest and best blogs in the world. They will, in short, fail, 
for a few simple reasons. 
 First, most news organizations are “too big” or at least entrenched in an older newsroom 
mentality. We will discuss this mentality—and its usefulness—in later chapters, but as it stands 
large news organizations don’t have the flexibility to mix fact, opinion, and original reporting in 
a way that tracks with their original mission. This could obviously change—and it will over time—
but until it does, there are many blind spots to take advantage of in the blogosphere. 
 One prominent example of a news organization’s attempt to embrace new media was  The 
Daily , produced by News Corp. and created as the world’s first well-funded online-only news 
magazine/newspaper (think of it as  Newsweek  meets a tabloid newspaper). Rupert Murdoch 
invested $30 million in  The Daily’s  creation and maintenance. Configured like a walled garden 
behind a paywall, it wasn’t accessible from the web. Murdoch is an old-school thinker, determined 
to collect a fee for any content he creates. 
 It was a failure. Why? Because the market it tried to grab—bored bankers on Wall Street who 
wanted a little news with their sports coverage—was saturated. The readership usually took 
their phones to the bathroom at work, not their iPads. Thus a tablet-only tabloid was doomed 
to failure. 
 In short, blogs and bite-sized content spelled the end of a news organization that had millions 
to spend and some great writers at the helm. If that isn’t scary then we’re not sure what scary is.

or topic or service that people need, but they don’t even realize it yet. Fill that niche, and 
you will be a success. 
 What Is a Blogger? 
 Let’s get a handle on what bloggers really are, and what they actually do. Are they stars, 
journalists, dilettantes, rabble-rousers, hacks? Yes, but not all at the same time. They’re 
mavens, critics, opinion leaders, and inciters of riots. Some are whiners and complain-
ers, naysayers and contrarians. Some are lovers, others are ﬁ ghters; many are both. But 
before they can earn any of those labels, ﬁ rst of all, they must be  ﬁ lters . The best bloggers 
are able to sift through enormous volumes of information every day, and pick out the 
few shiny nuggets that will fascinate their readers. Bloggers know where to ﬁ nd the best 
stories, and who to ask that all-important question, “What’s up?” They know how to ﬁ lter 
out topics that are of no consequence, and zero in on those that will grab attention. Even 
if you are the greatest writer in the world, if you choose topics no one cares about, you 
will have few readers. The bottom of trafﬁ c lists of the world’s most popular websites are 
populated by many great writers who have no idea what their readers want. 
 The closest analogy we’ve been able to ﬁ nd for a blogger to a real-world professional—
and this is not to say that blogging cannot be a job—is that of a wire reporter. In the old 
days, the news wires supplied a steady feed of information to readers around the world 
and almost everything of import was reported over them. Ironically, with the rise of blog-
ging, wire reporting actually makes up most of the content that appears in daily newspa-
pers, and thanks to reduced staff sizes and budgets, many papers are going online-only. 
It is online, where the price of paper and ink is immaterial, that a news organization can 
really shine—or ﬂ op. 
 Bloggers are also editors or, if you want to stray from journalistic terms, curators. Just 
as a magazine needs someone to pick out the stories that appear in its pages, bloggers 
select the stories that will appear in their feed. Much has been said about bloggers “copy-
ing” other news stories. This is not true. At worst a blogger will cut out a paragraph from 
another story and add a bit of commentary. At best, a blogger will make a story his or her 
own. Better yet, a blogger will write his or her own story that will guide the conversation. 
This is done by news organizations all the time: One magazine or newspaper will release 
an exclusive, and hundreds of other organizations will “report around” the original story, 
publishing their own angles. Read any of the best news sources—the news is usually old. 
It has been reported elsewhere and expanded by a reporter. 
 Then we have the second statement: that bloggers are not journalists. To suggest 
that bloggers steal and newspapers “report” is disingenuous, especially considering the 
budgets and manpower available to both organizations (read “none” and “decades of tal-
ent and hundreds of individuals dedicated to the newsgathering profession”). This isn’t 
to say that bloggers have license to be sloppy. On the contrary, bloggers have the time 
and energy to get things right, interesting, and well-phrased—and they have an endless 
amount of space in which to tell their story. 
 Blogging gives you a chance to show your readers everything you know (and expose 
everything you have yet to learn) about your topic of choice, but that’s just the beginning. 
Immediately after you’ve published your blog post, the conversation continues when 
your crowd of readers responds with everything they know about your post’s chosen 
topic. The result is a body of knowledge—sometimes brand-new—that’s a combination 
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
The Niche
7
of the topic you’ve introduced and the collective knowledge of your readers. When you’re 
talking about thousands of readers, their collective knowledge far surpasses that of any 
one person. It’s called crowdsourcing, and it encompasses so many facts, ﬁ gures, and 
details that it can be daunting. 
 Our ofﬁ cial deﬁ nition of blogging:  It is journalism written on a short deadline . If you 
are a blogger, you are a journalist. Soon, the reverse will be true. Just like journalism, blog-
ging requires dedication and accuracy, but unlike journalism, bloggers in most cases do 
not have the old-fashioned safety net of the editorial process to fall back on. In the old 
days, a newsroom featured “writers,” “editors,” and “photographers”—we put all of those 
in scare quotes because most of those positions were staffed by people with no business 
being in those positions—and “layout” people. The writers sent text to copy editors, who 
ﬁ xed the text. Photographers took assigned photos, and everything went to the layout 
team, who then sent things to the printer. As you can imagine, the business of producing 
anything was fraught with difﬁ culty, and major news organizations were large because 
of this long chain of command required to produce one issue. 
 Now, however, the blogger does all of those things and more. The blogger is a one-
man band—a lone news organization. If your goal is to write about your kittens or your 
life, you are not a blogger. You are a diarist. However, if your goal is to cover news that 
no one else is covering within your niche, you are a journalist and you are expected to 
run like a journalistic organization. While your readership will not mention it at ﬁ rst, the 
assumption is always there: “ This person is someone whose work I’m reading because of his 
skills and expertise.  I expect the writing to be strong and clear, the pictures to be sharp, and 
the layout to be conducive to long reading.” At the very least, this is what is expected of 
a beginning blogger. 
 The Four Questions 
 Before you start blogging, you need to ask yourself four simple questions. Answer them 
as truthfully and as speciﬁ cally as possible. Remember: what you decide to write about 
is what you will be thinking and dreaming about 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are 
no vacations for bloggers. 
 •  Who are you? 
 •  What do you know about? 
 •  What are you passionate about? 
 •  What are you going to write about? 
 These are the four questions you must spend lots of time contemplating. Let’s start 
dealing with those questions in reverse order, ultimately arriving at the answer to the 
ﬁ rst one. 
 Question 1: Who are you?  Yes, older readers are now humming that song by The 
Who, perhaps helping them focus on this crucial point.  Who, who, who, who? I really wanna 
know.  To be a successful blogger, you must be a self-starter. You need to be a quick thinker, 
organizing your thoughts and expressing them immediately. And you need a thick skin, 
because invariably, visitors to your blog will disagree with you, and express their dis-
senting opinions in the cruelest possible way in your comments section. In short, they 
will tear you apart. If you’ve lived a life where everyone constantly expresses approval of 
everything you do, you might be in for a rude awakening when you start writing your new

blog. Are you tough enough to take it? Do you have the consistency to regularly update 
your blog, giving readers a good reason to return day after day? Figure out who you are, 
and decide if you are really a blogger. Do you have the time? Do you have the energy? 
Blogging is a daily endeavor and is often unrewarding—until it’s surprisingly rewarding. 
 Question 2: What do you know about?  Expertise gives you an enormous head start 
over any competitors. For example, if you can identify any phone on sight, and you know 
the model numbers of each of the 3,997 Android phones available when we wrote this 
(no kidding, according to David Pogue of  Yahoo (and formerly The New York Times);  www.
nytimes.com/2013/08/07/technology/personaltech/the-moto-x-from-google-iphones-
latest-challenger.html ),   you’re going to be way ahead of hapless competitors who’ve 
decided to write about smartphones and are knowledgeable only about the one they 
happen to possess. You’re the one who should be writing about smartphones. If you don’t 
know more about a topic than almost all your readers, what exactly do you plan to bring 
to the conversation? In an ideal situation, your own wealth of knowledge and personal 
experience will be enlightening for your readers. If you have neither, you might want to 
either learn everything there is to know about your topic, or choose another. 
 Your expertise can be wildly obscure. There is room for everything on the Internet. 
If you are a radio technician, don’t be afraid to write about your career. If you’re a horse 
breeder, share with your readers your experiences with the stallions on your ranch. If 
you’ve discovered parenting tips that no one’s ever attempted but you’ve seen working 
wonders, you might strike gold with your own mommy blog. If you love to cook ancient 
Hungarian recipes, perhaps you can ﬁ nd a niche writing about your paprika experiments. 
Do you love raising huge goldﬁ sh? I assure you there is someone out there who wants 
your input. Someone somewhere will want to know something about what you do. 
 This is especially true if you run a business—by adding a blog to your business home 
page you can quickly and easily create a captive audience of people who want to hear 
what you have to say. For example, Northern Brewer (NorthernBrewer.com), a brewing 
supply company in St. Paul, Minnesota, created a blog and video podcast based on brew-
ing. With a camera and a little free time, the company’s bloggers built “Brewing TV,” giving 
them a way to share their point of view and expertise with their customers. In fact, it’s 
smaller organizations that beneﬁ t most from the existence of a personal blog. While we 
have decided not to focus on “corporate blogging” in this book, understand that the tech-
niques and attitudes we espouse here are applicable to almost any situation in which an 
expert wants to get his or her point across. 
 If we want to stress anything in this section, it’s that “general” blogs rarely work. If 
you have incendiary political opinions, for example, focus on one aspect of policy that 
interests you most. Do you love to travel? Focus on one area of the world or one state. Do 
you like to collect stamps? Focus on rare and odd stamps that may keep a reader coming 
back for more. The goal here is to reduce and focus your target and ensure that all of your 
content will be readable and understandable, and contain enough context to hook new 
readers and satisfy the whims of fans. 
 “Topic” blogs—like a general blog on watch collecting or amateur ﬂ ying—can succeed 
simply because you may need to expand your news gathering to ﬁ nd enough content 
for daily posts. However, the more focused the better. Instead of a “watch” blog, why not 
outline your own collection of quartz watches from the 1980s while bringing in interest-
ing news about other 1980s watch brands? Until you’re comfortable, think small, not big. 
 Think niche.

 Question 3: What are you passionate about?  No matter how good your writing is, it 
will lack that fascinating spark if there’s no passion underneath. Write about what you 
love, and about what you know. If you’ve decided to write about politics, for example, 
make sure you’re someone who lives, eats, sleeps, and breathes politics. When there’s a 
big political story breaking, do you immediately have a strong opinion about it? Do you 
start gritting your teeth with anger before you’ve ﬁ nished reading the ﬁ rst story you’ve 
seen about it? Do you talk to everyone you know about the story, ﬁ nding out everything 
there is to know about the topic, and then fume over each development with which 
you disagree? Does it make you angry to think about certain aspects of politics? Does it 
dominate your thoughts? That’s passion. That’s the engine that can drive day after day of 
writing, asserting your opinions, and ultimately setting yourself apart from all the others. 
 You’d better be in love with your topic of choice. There is no other way to succeed. If 
you’re bored or distracted by other hobbies and you allow your blog to languish, you’re 
essentially throwing away sweat equity. The longer you run a blog and the more you 
update it, the better the chance you’ll succeed. For instance, if you’re only mildly inter-
ested in birdwatching, don’t start a birding blog. However, if you live for birdwatching, 
treat the blog as an extension of your hobby. Grow your blog along with your hobby and 
become an expert in your ﬁ eld. Your readers will be able to sense that you’re growing 
with your passion and you’re expanding into new territory as you become more comfort-
able with the topic. 
 If you’re not writing about something you’re passionate about, you’re going to run 
out of steam.  In our experience, the best blogs are about one speciﬁ c topic. Niche blogs 
are far more valuable and will gather more readers than general interest sites. Instead of 
creating a tech blog, focus on an aspect that interests you and that you have experience 
with. Are you a frequent business traveler? Why not write about the indignities and plea-
sures of various aspects of your travels? Do you like cellphones? Focus on one manufac-
turer or carrier. Covering too much too soon ends up in frustration and will overwhelm a 
beginning blogger. 
 Focus on a niche that you can write about daily and with great intensity. There are 
plenty of blogs already, and making yourself stand out is of utmost importance. You are 
creating a place for yourself on the Internet, and by updating this place regularly you will 
encourage an audience and a potential source of income. 
 Don’t think of yourself as a news source. You are not  Reuters or  The New York Times . 
You’re a single person with an obsession, and we’re going to tell you the best way to have 
fun and get noticed with that obsession. 
 The best blogs are explorations.  Most major bloggers began their sites in an effort to 
learn more about a topic. Michael Arrington of  TechCrunch  started his site to gather infor-
mation about potential investments. Many political blogs began as personal blogs that 
morphed into public commentary. Watch bloggers like Ariel Adams of  ABlogToWatch .com 
started their sites to educate a potential audience on the vagaries of the watch world and 
to learn quite a bit in the process. Through dedication, all of these bloggers turned a labor 
of love into a source of income. 
 Question 4: What are you going to write about?  Now that we’ve gotten the metaphys-
ical out of the way, let’s focus on the concrete. Answering the three previous questions 
will help you get close to answering this last and most crucial of our quartet of questions. 
 Being passionate about sports does not make you a good candidate to write a general 
sports blog. Instead, focus on the sport or team that most excites you. Focus your energy

instead of dispersing it willy-nilly. The question is what  speciﬁ cally do you want to write 
about? 
 Spend a few days poking around the web, and if you ﬁ nd a blog that covers exactly 
the same topic you’ve chosen for yourself, that doesn’t mean you should give up and con-
sider another. Study those blogs that are similar to what yours will be, and learn. What 
are they doing wrong? Why are they successful? Another important point to consider: Is 
there a glut of blogs covering your chosen topic? If the market is already saturated, it will 
be that much more difﬁ cult for you to stand out above the rabble. Once you’ve extensively 
researched the competition in the area you’re considering, think of a unique angle your 
blog could take on the topic. Will you be able to bring a fresh perspective to the conversa-
tion? Choose your topic carefully, and half your battle will already be won. 
 Does this mean you always have to blog on the same topic forever? Absolutely not. 
Your site can expand and grow as you grow as a writer. Our goal here is to give you a 
chance to succeed on a smaller scale while expecting big things in the future. 
 Once you’ve answered these questions, you need to understand some fundamental 
rules about blogging. 
 The Two Rules 
 Ignore these two rules at your peril. Understand that blogs take on a life of their own, and 
if your goal is to blog to make money, or you are blogging as an extension of your inter-
ests or job, these two rules—part of what we would call a “blogging plan”—are absolutely 
paramount. Blogging is a job. It may be your second job, but it is a process that takes hard 
work and discipline. We have been blogging for a decade, and it’s a constant struggle as 
well as a source of constant reward. Our days begin at 8 a.m. and end whenever the last 
news item ﬂ ickers across our screens. 
 Rule 1. Always Be Blogging 
 The best blogs are updated daily, if not hourly. There is nothing worse than a ghost blog, a 
site that seems to be updated sporadically at best. Readers are becoming experts at sens-
ing the freshness of content. If you leave your blog sitting for weeks at a time with no new 
posts, they’ll catch on quickly and your audience will migrate elsewhere. 
 Keep posting! What do you mean, there’s nothing to write about today? Of course 
there is! Some ﬁ nely targeted niches won’t have something to write about every hour, but 
there’s always something going on that would interest your readers each day. Your goal 
is to be the person “in the know” about all things involved in your topic. If you truly love 
what you’re writing about, you won’t have any problem writing something at least daily. 
If you ﬁ nd you’re having trouble, you may be facing a serious problem in your choice of 
topic. There is no topic too mundane that you can’t pull a post out of it. Can’t ﬁ nd news? 
Post some pictures from a recent activity related to your topic. Talk about what other 
bloggers in your niche are doing. Prepare a round-up of news from other sources. 
 Your posts don’t always have to be news. They can be a personal story, a reaction to 
the news of the day, or a simple link to another site with information you enjoyed. How-
ever, if you ﬁ nd yourself getting lazy and failing to post, you’ve broken the ﬁ rst cardinal 
rule of your blogging plan.

 However, don’t fall into the “personal blog post” trap. Don’t tell the story of your prob-
lems at the DMV or your relationship issues. Don’t tell us what you had for dinner last 
night (unless you’re a food critic), or ﬁ ll us in on every detail of that dream you had last 
night. Don’t spring your heartfelt musings on your unsuspecting audience. But if you can 
somehow creatively weave some personal experience into your posts, that could be the 
very thing that makes the story yours. 
 Lacking inspiration? Create a calendar for yourself and a to-do list. Add items to the 
to-do list as you think of them and then add them to the calendar. These “evergreen” post 
ideas can be published at any time. If you ﬁ nd yourself frustrated or facing the dreaded 
writer’s block, simply go to this list of items you haven’t gotten around to yet and do one. 
 That doesn’t mean you’ll have to sit in front of your computer 24 hours a day. A lot 
of blogging is thinking, observing, and discovering a fresh angle on a topic that’s already 
been covered elsewhere. If you keep your blog top-of-mind, you’ll ﬁ nd yourself coming up 
with ideas wherever you go. Who knows where you’ll ﬁ nd inspiration? Beethoven went 
for daily walks, and heard a bird singing the ﬁ rst four notes of his  Fifth Symphony . Occur-
rences, people, objects, and new experiences that have great potential to be turned into 
blog posts are everywhere, and it’s up to you to tease them out, write about them, make 
them interesting, and grab your readers with them. 
 Rule 2. Find Your Voice but Don’t Forget 
the Rules of Language 
 What sort of voice will your blog have? You want readers to become familiar with the way 
you do things, the way you express yourself, and the way your blog is laid out. Do you 
want to do long posts, daily? Many short posts each day? Digests of news with simple 
links? Videos? Lots of pictures? Podcasts? There’s a variety of ways to build a blog, and 
most of us would choose a scattershot approach to posting daily. However, if you ﬁ nd 
you enjoy writing longer posts, you may want to stick with that style. It gives your read-
ers plenty to chew on on a regular basis, and you can still add shorter posts in between. 
Establish your style at the beginning, and keep it consistent. 
 Having a style doesn’t mean you have to be snarky, mean, or silly. It means you need 
to be clear and concise, and you need to stand out in a vast sea of “me-too” content. Be 
the person people link to when they want to prove a point. Be the expert other experts 
trust when it comes to matters of technical accuracy. Pride yourself on a consistent and 
readable style. And make it sound like you. 
 However long your posts will be, it’s most important to decide on a writing style. Will 
you embrace vulgarity with your site, cussing like a sailor in every sentence, or will you 
be prim and proper? Will you attack your topics with sarcasm and aggressive humor, or 
will you play it straight? Will you have a happy, carefree, and uplifting approach, or will 
you incite your readers to share your anger? Will you ﬁ nd a way to be different, standing 
out from the crowd of blogs blanketing the earth with your dazzling insights? 
 Maybe you’re funny. However, comedy, as they say, is hard. One of the pitfalls we’ve 
seen in new bloggers attempting a snarky style is the descent into meanness for mean-
ness’s sake. When you focus on a topic with any intensity, you “go native” and allow 
things to affect you more than they should. The antidote to this is to write everything in 
a hard news style or a more conversational style. Also avoid lashing out at ﬁ gures and

major players in your niche. And remember, a bit of self-deprecating humor and person-
ality goes a long way. 
 Don’t forget to make it personal. The one thing the “big newsrooms” can’t do is inject 
personality into their work. Sure, there are some exceptions, but on the aggregate many 
news sites are stale and boring by dint of their mission. Will this be a log of your experi-
ences and opinions? Unless you’re going to be simply rewriting news stories, or doing 
straight reporting, you’ll probably insert many of your experiences and opinions into your 
writing. In the early days of blogging, much of the writing was a lot like the early days of 
Twitter, where writers would talk about everyday trivialities such as what they just ate 
for breakfast. Now, writers have taken it way beyond that level, by orders of magnitude. If 
you’re a solo act, let the readers inside and bare your soul. That’s entertainment! 
 If you’re writing a blog with a group of colleagues, your blog style will need to reﬂ ect 
the fact that there is a group of people working together. Referring to yourself as “we” is 
probably the best idea here, but that’s not to say you can’t use the proverbial “we” when 
you’re writing a solo blog, either. This is an important element of your blog style: Will you 
write as a group or as a collection of individuals? You can choose whether each post will 
reﬂ ect the separate opinions and attitudes of individual writers, where all the writers in 
your group strive to set themselves apart. Or you can work as an editorial team, akin to 
how newspaper editorial boards write, and speak as a group. 
 We’ve asked you a lot of questions in this ﬁ rst chapter, and we would suggest you 
carefully contemplate each one and come up with solid answers for yourself. Be honest. 
If you do this, you’ll be on a sturdy foundation for starting up a successful enterprise.

 Go ahead, break all our rules. Write a blog about yourself and fail to find a 
niche. Focus on how cute your hamsters are—we’re sure the hamster-fan blogosphere is booming. 
However, in our experience the best bloggers have a niche, write as if they were writing for a 
paying audience, and offer more than just a link and a smiley face emoticon. 
 To treat blogging as anything other than journalism—to say it’s a hobby or a self-
indulgence–is to completely miss the point, and in the end, it is an insult to the hard 
work of pioneer bloggers who fought long and hard to gain access and respect in an 
entrenched industry. Bloggers are members of the mass media. 
 The news cycle is so fast that the only way to get a message across will be through 
short-form posts and the occasional longer piece.  This does not mean journalism is dying—it 
is just evolving. We’re here to hasten the change. 
 Being a blogger isn’t all fun.  Be prepared to bask in the iridescent glow of your readers’ 
adoration one day, and wallow in the snake pit of their hatred the next when they all disagree 
with you. Posts you thought might be blockbusters fall flat, with no one commenting at all. 
Another you thought might just be a throwaway turns out to be a tremendous hit. Most days 
fall somewhere in between those extremes. Either way, while you’re probably not an expert on 
everything you’ll be writing about, chances are one of your readers is an expert. Take special 
care to get your facts straight with everything you write, because there are always multitudes 
of readers who are more than eager to set you straight.

The Niche
13
After you’ve gone through that period of self-examination, you might be thinking that 
this sounds like a lot of work. You would be right. In fact, writing might seem easy to 
you, but the daily dedication needed for a successful blog is hard. You must summon all 
your energy and enthusiasm, applying a steady and dedicated work ethic to this venture. 
Set yourself realistic goals, and meet them every day, and you’d be surprised how even 
a small amount of work—applied consistently—will turn a series of seemingly small 
efforts into a monumental achievement.

 The Field Guide to Blog Warfare 
 Before we dive into writing for your blog, ﬁ rst we must gather the tools to build your blog 
into a galactic force of epic proportions, raining down wisdom and enlightenment on all 
who encounter it. In other words, let’s get some hardware, software, and a place on the 
web where you can park all that scintillating prose you’re about to inﬂ ict on the world. 
 Blogging today is easier than ever. New software and services make it possible for 
anyone to create a new blog in seconds—and we mean this quite literally. If you’re just 
starting out and you’re not entirely sure you want to stick with this blogging dodge for-
ever, you can choose to begin developing your blogging chops with one of the free services 
such as Blogger, LiveJournal, Tumblr, TypePad, or WordPress. Some services, like Square-
Space, cost a bit but allow you to add tools like image viewers and shopping carts to your 
blog posts. Signing up with all of these services is free, and you won’t believe how easy it 
is. It’s a simple matter of opening up an account and picking a username and password, 
and after a quick email conﬁ rmation you’re ready to start blogging right away. 
 These free blogging sites also host your ﬁ les—all your text, graphics, videos, and any 
other elements reside on that service’s servers. They all offer a blogging platform, mak-
ing it easy for you to write your posts, insert graphics and video, and receive comments 
from your readers. Most offer basic “themes” that let you personalize your site, and after 
you’ve added your own graphics, you can end up with a site with basic structure that’s 
similar to many others, but with your own unique graphics on board. 
 We will explain basic HTML and CSS for bloggers, and point out two blogging plat-
forms that we particularly like in the next section. If you are already familiar with HTML 
coding, know about CSS, and are comfortable with setting up a blog, feel free to skip 
ahead. However, we don’t want anyone to feel left out, so here’s a quick run-through. 
 Basic HTML for Bloggers 
 Although most blogging platforms bend over backward to help you avoid writing HTML 
( H yper T ext  M ark-up  L anguage) code, it’s not completely avoidable, nor is it particularly 
difﬁ cult. Here are a few simple HTML tags you  must know in order to blog. HTML allows 
you to change text formatting using codes that are readable by your browser. Each “open”

tag has to have a “close” tag. For example, to make something  bold  you must have an 
open bold tag <strong> and a close bold tag </strong>. So it would look like this. 
 <strong>Good morning!</strong> How are you?  
 Which would look like this on the page: 
 Good morning! How are you? 
 By the way, HTML tags can be in either upper- or lowercase. It makes no difference. 
 In addition to bold, above, you can use: 
 <I></I>—Italics 
 <U></U>—Underline 
 <IMG SRC="[URL where image ﬁ le is located, without these brackets]">—
This inserts an image into your post. Be careful not to use smart 
(curly) quotes inside HTML tags, or they won’t work properly. This is 
a problem we would run into at  Mashable , where the code was broken 
and it was difﬁ cult to ﬁ gure out why. If you’re creating HTML in a 
word processor like Microsoft Word that automatically turns straight 
quotes—otherwise known as inch marks (")—into smart quotes, you’ll 
need to either turn off that autoformatting in Word or type your HTML 
in a text editor or inside your blogging platform itself. 
 <A HREF="[link]">Link Text</A>—This adds a link inside a post. 
 Will you ever use actual HTML code in your everyday writing? Probably not. However, 
you should get in the habit of working with it, because sometimes things go wrong, and 
you’ll need to get into the code and try to determine what happened. Or you often need 
to make quick modiﬁ cations that are easier to execute by adding a few snippets of simple 
HTML. We don’t often dive into the raw HTML anymore, but when we must, it’s always 
quick and easy to search for any HTML tags we can’t remember. For example, to ﬁ nd out 
the HTML for a bulleted list, search for the terms “HTML” and “list,” and you’ll quickly ﬁ nd 
the code you’re looking for: 
 <ul> 
 <li>text</li> 
 <li>text</li> 
 <li>text</li> 
 </ul> 
 Many blogging platforms offer built-in word processor–like editors that include spell 
check and any number of easy-to-use processing tools. However, when you’re expected 
to turn in web-ready copy, always submit a ﬂ at text ﬁ le with HTML tags included, and 
if possible, prepare and upload your own images to your own private server. If you’re 
unsure how to deliver your ﬁ nished ﬁ les, ask. This will save your editor a great deal of 
time and heartache. 
 Why should you learn HTML? For the simple reason that it is the backbone of the Inter-
net and it is of utmost importance that you at least understand the concepts involved. It’s

not difﬁ cult to pick up a few tags, and it will make your editor quite happy if you come 
with a grasp of simple HTML code. 
 For example, online editors are usually uncomfortable receiving Microsoft Word ﬁ les. 
They rarely, if ever, ﬂ ow correctly into their own content management systems unless all 
formatting is removed. The best thing you can do is send a ﬂ at text ﬁ le, completely spell-
checked, and with embedded HTML tags for links, formatting, and images. A ﬁ le can look 
like this: 
 I wrote a book in 2004 about hackers, spammers, and other nerds and 
I thought I’d like to share it with the world. It’s currently avail-
able on <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Criminals-Scammers-  
 ebook/  dp/B001KU71X8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&s=digital-

hn+biggs">B&N</a> and is $9.99 for the print edition and an inexplicable 
$9.49 in the Kindle edition. It is apparently not available for the Nook. 
 The book is nine years old and is nearly out of print. It is about 
spammers, hackers, and viruses, and I wrote it for a general audience 
like my dad who may or may not be all that technically savvy. It’s not 
a How-To as much as an exploration of the personalities in hacking. 
 According to Bookscan I sold 0 copies in the past few months and 
rather than allow it to molder, I’ve decided to give it away, with 
some caveats. 
 MANDATORY STEP: Let me know you downloaded it. Email me at john @ big-
widelogic.com or tweet me at  <a HREF="http://twitter.com/johnbiggs">@
johnbiggs</a>  
 You’ll notice the most complex HTML we used in that example was a few simple links 
to book sites on the web. If you can read this code then you can read 99 percent of the 
HTML on the Internet. It’s easy and worth learning. 
 CSS and the Single Blogger 
 Cascading Style Sheets, also known as CSS, is a way to deﬁ ne various parts of a web page 
using straightforward and very easy-to-understand tags. These tags supersede the com-
mon styling used by HTML—they allow you to set various fonts, colors, and text styles. 
Think of them as a sort of instruction manual for an entire site. They allow designers 
highly granular control over most aspects of a site’s design. 
 Most blogging platforms use a ﬁ le called style.css that contains all of the style set-
tings for a certain site and, rather than modifying each ﬁ le, you can simply change a CSS 
setting and see the style change immediately. 
 For example, take a look at this simple CSS from W3Schools.com, a tutorial site. 
 <!DOCTYPE html> 
 <html> 
 <head> 
 <style>

 body 
 { 
 background-color:#d0e4fe; 
 } 
 h1 
 { 
 color:green; 
 text-align:center; 
 } 
 p 
 { 
 font-family"Times New Roman"; 
 font-size:20px; 
 } 
 </style> 
 </head> 
 <body> 
 <h1>CSS example!</h1> 
 <p>This is a paragraph.</p> 
 </body> 
 </html>  
 This is actually an embedded style sheet that changes some very basic properties 
of the page. For example, it changes the <p> or paragraph tag, setting the font family to 
Times New Roman and the font size to 20 pixels (px). 
 p 
 { 
 font-family: "Times New Roman"; 
 font-size:20px; 
 } 
 You could also add a line like “color:green;” to set the text color to green. Note each line 
should end in a semicolon. If you can’t ﬁ nd the CSS, look for a line similar to the following 
one in the HTML code for your site. It points to an external CSS ﬁ le (usually “style.css”). 
 <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "mystyle.css"> 
 Will you ever need to edit CSS? Probably. You’ll ﬁ nd that a WordPress theme is acting 
up or that you’d like to change the headlines on your site to orange or pink for a special 
occasion. This is very easily done in CSS but far beyond the scope of this chapter. We’d 
recommend picking up a good book on web design to help familiarize yourself with these 
concepts.

 Pick a Domain 
 Even if you’re not planning to start up your own self-hosted website right away, you 
might as well ﬁ nd an available domain name and snap it up now. And don’t worry, most 
available domain names aren’t super expensive, with some .com names going for as little 
as $11 per year at sites such as namecheap.com. Other services will give you a domain 
name free if you host your site with them. Go ahead, stake your claim! 
 But wait a second. This is going to be your place on the Internet from now on, so 
choose carefully. Your goal is to make it memorable and topical. We have seen too many 
blogs saddled with accidental and unfortunate names—Mashable.com is one notable 
example—to tell you not to think long and hard about what you want your place on the 
Internet to be called. 
 The best blogs have their own domain names. Obviously it won’t be a picnic ﬁ nding 
a good domain name; millions are already taken and almost every word you can think of 
already exists as some sort of site, be it a legitimate source of news or information or a 
spam blog (splog) spewing out garbage. 
 The best domain names are memorable and to the point. It’s harder to gain traction 
with a site that has a made-up word for a title, and we’ve seen plenty. However, this is not 
a hard and fast rule. After all, sites like  Gizmodo and  Engadget  took off, but if you’ll notice, 
their missions are embedded in their names. 
 Think clever. Try translating the topic into a different language or try a  portmanteau 
word—a blend of two words into a new one, for example, GadgetCodger.com—or a name 
that someone might have overlooked—FoodReviewer.com instead of FoodReviews.com. 
Feel free to be creative, but remember that clarity is key here. 
 Pick a name that makes sense to you and your readers. Remember you can add words 
like “review,” “daily,” and “digest” to implement keywords in your niche to work around 
the plethora of domain names already sold and in use. For example, if you like running 
shoes you can try to grab “runningshoereview.com” or “runnersdaily.com.” Ceramicists 
can grab “kilndigest.com” or “ceramicartdaily.com.” 
 Need help ﬁ guring out a name? Try this: 
 1. 
 Create a list of nouns and synonyms associated with your topic. 
 2. 
 Create a list of adjectives that can describe your topic. 
 3. 
 Create a list of verbs that your topic is associated with. 
 4. 
 Find a list of foreign words that may be familiar to fans of your topic. For example: 
 Nouns 
 Needles 
 Knitting 
 Yarn 
 Adjectives 
 Jolly 
 Contented 
 Happy 
 Quick 
 Verbs 
 Purl 
 Knit 
 Crochet

 5. 
 Put these terms together. For example: 
 Jollypurler.com 
 ContentedKnitter.com 
 KnittingNeedleLover.com 
 Also, try to have fun: 
 Yarnbirds.com 
 Purldivers.com 
 Be careful when putting together two words for a domain name. For instance, if you 
want your “Pen Island” site to be called PenIsland.net, you might want to pick a different 
domain name. It won’t always be seen with those nifty drop-caps. Look at it this way: 
penisland.net. Oops. 
 Also avoid dashes in names. Popular-Birdwatching.com may be available but I assure 
you someone already owns PopularBirdwatching.com and you’d just be sending trafﬁ c 
their way. Could you also use .tv, .net, or .org names? Check for the .com ﬁ rst. It may be 
owned by a similar type of site or blog, and you don’t want to risk the ire of KittenPhoto
graphy.com if you register KittenPhotography.net. 
 After all that ruminating, did you ﬁ nd the one domain name that’s absolutely perfect 
for your plan, but it’s already taken? Is there no variant that will possibly do? Get out your 
checkbook, because you’ll have to buy your fave domain name from whoever owns it, and 
depending on the name, that can get expensive. For example, the domain name Insure.
com 1 sold for $16 million in 2009. 
 Once you’ve decided on a domain, now all you have to do is register it. You’ll be asked to 
pay for that registration by the year, and there’s a discount for signing up for multiple years. 
 Even though it’s received negative publicity for the odd behavior of its CEO, we’ve had 
good luck with using the service called NameCheap.com to register our domain names, 
as well as hosting our sites. If you still haven’t ﬁ gured out the perfect domain name for 
your budding site, NameCheap offers a handy tool that lets you check to see if your cho-
sen domain name is available. If not, it’ll offer you alternatives using the same terms, as 
well as .net, .us, and others. 
 Beyond the domain choosing help, NameCheap offers a simple interface and pay-
ment system that reminds you when it’s time to renew your domain name. Note that 
domain names expire when you stop paying for them, and can be recycled or co-opted 
by another organization if you’re not careful. Many sites have suffered after not paying 
attention to the expiration date on their domain. We like NameCheap because it sends 
emails when your domain is up for renewal. 
 Ready-Made Platforms 
 There are far too many services with similar offerings to describe them all, but here are a 
few of the most popular “ready-made” blogging services. The unfortunate problem with 
these services is that you barely own your own content. If the service goes belly-up or 
crashes, you could lose your work. While this is true of any service, hosting your own 
account is probably the best way to go for professionals. 
 Tumblr.com 
 Tumblr.com is a free microblogging service owned by Yahoo that allows you to create 
a basic but attractive blog in a few minutes. Most importantly, allows you to forward 
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com

21
your own domain to your Tumblr account. The service reports that it contains more than 
130.6 million blogs ( www.tumblr.com/about  Tumblr), allows you to post images, text, vid-
eos, and audio, and you can post updates via email, SMS, or instant message. You can 
even create an audio post by calling an 800 number and leaving a message. There are also 
Tumblr apps for most smartphone platforms. 
 Tumbler has compelling social features, where users can follow each others’ blogs, 
much like you do with Facebook and Twitter. There’s the ability to tag photos to make 
them easier for others to ﬁ nd them. However, if you have an adult site in mind, Tumblr 
recently made it impossible to search such content, effectively rendering its porn sites 
unintentionally private unless that blog’s readers already possess the blog’s URL. 
 Each post gives you a choice of video, audio, chat, or text, and gives you an authoring 
format and resulting page especially suited for that media type. Click the type of content 
you want to add, and the editing interface appears, presenting the necessary options for 
the content type you’ve chosen. 
 Blogger (Blogspot.com) 
 Google’s blogging platform is easy to set up and has the advantage of hundreds of sites all 
over the web packed with tips and tricks to help you enhance your blog. Some say using 
Blogger gives you an “in” with Google, where your posts show up in higher and more 
prominent positions in Google searches, but we couldn’t ﬁ nd any proof of that. 
 WordPress.com 
 This service is based on the popular WordPress blogging system. It can import con-
tent from most other platforms, and there are lots of cool plug-ins you can use to add 
sophisticated features to your blog. Standard accounts include yourdomain.wordpress.
com access, but you can host your own domains  on WordPress.com for a few dollars per 
month. If you’re serious about blogging and are seeing some trafﬁ c already, WordPress.
com hosting may be a good way to go. 
 Which Blogging Platform Do I Choose? 
 Pro Tip 
 Let’s focus on the two most popular: WordPress and Blogger. Despite many 
similarities, the two platforms have their applicable uses. 
 While both services are free, the hosted version of WordPress has a modular pricing scheme if 
you want to add on additional services. Meanwhile, Blogger (owned by Google) is completely free. 
 Blogger has a deeper level of customization when it comes to CSS and HTML, while 
WordPress’s CSS editor costs an additional fee. And unlike WordPress, Blogger doesn’t have any 
plug-in support to speak of. The platform does make up for it with a great library of widgets, 
something WordPress also has. 
 The bottom line is that if you’re looking for a great hosted service, you’re probably better off 
with Blogger. However, if you want to host the site yourself, WordPress’s open-source software, 
with its myriad plug-ins and variety of theme templates, is tough to beat. 
 LiveJournal 
 This service features strong privacy, letting you designate who has access to your posts 
all the way down to the individual post level. It is useful if you want to hide posts from

some readers, a feature that can come in handy in countries where political expression 
could put a writer’s life in danger. Sadly, posts on this service don’t appear in search 
engines and most journals are covered in ads unless you create a paid account. 
 SquareSpace.com 
 SquareSpace offers a blogging platform for almost everyone and includes multiple fea-
tures like templates, analytics, and high-end publishing features. You can host your own 
domain at SquareSpace if you pay monthly. In July 2012, the site was overhauled, giving 
users the ability to modify their sites’ layouts, and create so-called “responsive” designs 
that work equally well on mobile devices. 
 How Do I Pick a Platform? 
 Once you have a domain chosen you need a place to put your content. For most users, a 
ready-made domain is more than sufﬁ cient. However, you may want to host your own site 
on your own server, giving you considerably more control over the monetization possi-
bilities for your site. For those starting out, sometimes creating a Tumblr site is sufﬁ cient. 
 Which one is best? It depends on how comfortable you feel with the features, cost, 
and interface. We suggest trying a few of them—most have a short trial period and Tum-
blr is free—and then choosing one and sticking with it. While it’s not absolutely neces-
sary, you should also keep backups of all your work in a text ﬁ le and a graphics folder in 
case you need to switch services. While the process of re-uploading all of that content 
won’t be pretty, at least you’ll have a record of your posts for later perusal. 
 Hosting Traps 
 Because many of the services we have mentioned allow you to assign your own domain 
name to your ready-made blog, explaining why you would want to host your own blog 
on your own server is a bit difﬁ cult. Generally, if you’re fairly computer savvy, hosting 
your own blog and controlling your own server makes more sense in the long run, and 
with the right server provider, can be cheaper. However, if you expect to see lots of trafﬁ c, 
hosting charges could go through the roof, thereby making it more valuable to host on 
another provider’s server. In short, there are three major blogging platforms worth look-
ing at: WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. All are free to download and run and have armies 
of fully ﬂ edged volunteer support staff who maintain the code and improve the services 
over time. We recommend WordPress because it’s the  de facto  standard for most blogs. We 
like its huge plug-in and theme collections and extensive user base, encompassing 51.13 
percent of self-hosted platform usage among the top million websites. Joomla is in a 
distant second place with 8.28 percent, with Drupal in third with 6.59 percent (BuiltWith 
trends, September 2013,  http://trends.builtwith.com/cms ). 
 Maintaining your own server is far out of scope for this book, but there are plenty of 
introductory books on the subject. While WordPress and Tumblr are free, nothing is  really 
free, and blog space is no exception. While these services are great sandboxes for you to 
hone your blogging style and start writing immediately, you’ll be doing that on a domain 
that’s not entirely yours—these free hosting services give you a URL where you get to 
choose only part of its nomenclature—for example, myincredibleblog.blogspot.com. That 
means whatever your blog is named, it will remain a “subdomain” of Blogspot.com in this 
www.ebook777.com

23
example. Oops. That will probably mean a lower search engine ranking for your posts. 
That’s because search engines prefer sites that match keywords 100 percent over those 
that contain additional terms. For instance, a site with the URL gardening.com would 
do better in search rankings than gardening.blogspot.com. That’s why those single-word 
URLs are so valuable. 
 Whichever blogging service you choose, many will place ads on your site that you 
don’t control. Most of the time, that might not matter, but it could get awkward. For 
instance, what if you’re writing about how the pharmaceutical industry is gouging every-
one with its overpriced drugs, but the friendly blog host robot detects the word “medica-
tions” in your post and cluelessly strings ads for big pharmaceutical companies all along 
the right side of the page? Yikes. 
 Another key point to keep in mind with these free services: if your blog becomes sud-
denly and explosively popular—which we’re hoping it will, thanks to the lessons you’ll 
learn in this book—you’ll have to start paying a monthly fee for that space on a gradu-
ated scale, starting at about $10, and skyrocketing up to hundreds of dollars per month 
as you build trafﬁ c. You didn’t think they were going to just dole out gigabytes of storage 
space and bandwidth free, did you? That’s right, they’ll charge you not only for the ﬁ les 
you place on the server but also for the amount of bandwidth your users suck up when 
they’re reading and viewing your stuff. 
 Another downside to “free” blogging services is the difﬁ culty of transferring your ﬁ les 
to your own domain name when the time comes for you to graduate to the next blogging 
level. With some authoring packages such as WordPress, it’s easy to transfer your ﬁ les 
over to your own domain. Others, not so much. On top of that, if you’ve built a signiﬁ cant 
readership on one of these free sites, you’re bound to lose readership when they can’t 
ﬁ nd your new site. 
 Another troubling factor to consider: If your blog does gain sudden popularity, that 
means lots of other sites are linking to various “permanent” pages within your blog. Move 
that blog to your own shiny new domain and poof! All those links you so painstakingly 
lured toward your site are broken. Sure, your most loyal readers will follow you, but all 
those links surely won’t. You’ll spend months building that popularity all over again. On 
the other hand, your own domain name is portable, and under your control. All those 
links on board will still be the same no matter where you park your ﬁ les. 
 Finally, if your free blogging service goes belly-up for some reason, your blog might 
suddenly cease to exist, especially if you can’t transfer your ﬁ les to another host. Sure, 
they’ll probably let you know well in advance if they’re going to leave you high and dry, 
but there’s something disconcerting about knowing that you don’t have the ultimate 
control over your site. 
 Whether you choose to start out on a free blogging service or venture out on your own 
domain from the beginning is a tough choice that has a lot to do with your seriousness 
about blogging, your ﬁ nancial resources, your conﬁ dence level, and your blogging goals. 
 If you intend to develop your blog beyond just a hobby, we’d recommend register-
ing your own domain and self-hosting it. That doesn’t mean you’ll need to buy a server, 
install it in your home, and hook it up to the web. Rather, it means you’ll reserve a domain 
name, sign up with a hosting service such as Rackspace, Bluehost, or Justhost, and then 
you’ll choose and install a blogging platform such as WordPress, Tumblr, or many others. 
But if you have any doubts about whether this blogging bug will continue to pique your 
interest, it might be a good idea to start out with a free blogging service and see how you

do. While you’re making your decision, it’s important to remember that the ultimate suc-
cess of a blog has more to do with its content than its address. 
 Using WordPress 
 WordPress is a well-known blogging 
platform (also known as a content 
management system, or CMS) that of -
fers a great deal of specialized control 
over content and posts. 
 If your mind is set on blogging 
within WordPress, you’ll ﬁ rst need to 
open an account. Once you ﬁ ll in your 
email address and password, create a 
username. This will be separate from 
the URL of your blog, which you’ll ﬁ ll 
out next. You’ll want to name your 
blog something catchy, SEO-friendly, 
and easy to type. In this case, “piz-
zacorndogs” is what we’ve chosen. 
 Now, here’s where WordPress’s 
modular paid services come into 
play. Through the site, you can reg-
ister your chosen blog address as an 
honest-to-goodness hosted website 
(ex: pizzacorndogs.com), in addition to 
upgraded storage space, ad-free design, 
hosted video, and custom HTML and 
CSS options. 
 We’re not done setting up just yet. 
After you receive the conﬁ rmation 
email, you’ll be asked to title your blog, 
give it a tagline, and select the lan-
guage you’ll primarily be blogging in. 
 From there, you’ll be asked to 
choose a theme. WordPress has an 
extensive library of free and paid blog 
themes, and what you choose should 
be dependent upon the blog’s focus 
and your personal taste. 
 Once a theme is selected, you’ll 
be asked if you’d like to further cus-
tomize the theme with background 
images and the like. 
 You can also do this customiza-
tion at any time through the Word-
Press Dashboard.

 Assuming you don’t want to com-
pose a blog post right away, you can 
press “Finish” at any time to go right 
to your Reader page. 
 This is WordPress’s social media 
function, in that it will allow you to 
follow and interact with other blogs. 
 But let’s not worry about that right 
now. What you should be interested 
in is the Dashboard. This is where all 
the blogging magic happens within 
WordPress. From here, you can look 
at your statistics, compose posts, cus-
tomize settings, and add paid content 
to your blog. 
 By selecting “Add New” from the 
“Posts” menu, you can start com-
posing your magniﬁ cent posts. Once 
everything is typed up, there are some 
cool toys to play with that WordPress 
gives you by default. “Related Con-
tent” searches the posts you’ve writ-
ten in the past and displays them 
at the bottom of the current post to 
recommend to other readers. “Copy a 
Post” is handy when you have a for-
mat you need to adhere to (reviews 
and list-based posts spring to mind). 
“Request Feedback” does just that; it 
sends a copy of the post to anyone 
of your choosing via email to ask for 
feedback. 
 After you’re ﬁ nished composing 
your post, you can either publish it 
right away, or choose a time for the 
post to go live. And don’t forget to tag 
your post. Tags make it easy to orga-
nize your post by subject. 
 Using Blogger 
 Setting up an account with Blogger 
is about as easy as ordering a slice of 
pizza, especially if you already have a 
Google account. If you don’t already 
have a Google account, you’ll need to 
register with the search giant before 
blogging to your heart’s content.

 Now that the hard part is over, 
you’re about ﬁ ve clicks away from get-
ting started with your ﬁ rst blog. After 
visiting the Blogger site and associ-
ating the service with your Google 
account, you’re all set. 
 First and foremost, you’ll need to 
create a blog. It’s as easy as ﬁ nding 
the “New Blog” button, and clicking it. 
You’ll want to name your blog some-
thing unique and interesting that 
sums up the focus of your blog. 
 After you have your blog named 
and a valid URL in place, pick out a 
theme. You can further customize 
the look and feel of your blog later, so 
don’t fret if you can’t ﬁ nd the perfect 
theme. 
 Once your blog has been created, 
click on that orange pencil button to 
get writing. 
 Here comes the fun part: actually 
writing. Once you’re in the Compose 
view, you’ll see that the now-standard 
text editing functions are all here. If 
you’re familiar with Google Docs, this 
view should look similar. From here, 
you can also look at what you’re writ-
ing in an HTML viewer, which can be 
handy. 
 Once you’re ﬁ nished with your 
post, you can publish immediately, or 
schedule a speciﬁ c time for the post

to go live. That’s all there is to it—we 
told you it would be easy. 
 Using Tumblr 
 Fill in your email address, choose 
a password and URL for your blog 
(.tumblr.com 
extension 
is 
added 
automatically; as in our example the 
blog’s URL will be stripedelephants.
tumblr.com). 
 Registration takes you to the typi-
cal veriﬁ cation page. 
 As your new blog appears, you 
are prompted to create your ﬁ rst post 
and upload your portrait photo. 
 Tumblr guides you through the 
initial setup process with a stream of 
pop-ups (closing the ﬁ rst makes the 
next pop up). You get to title your blog 
and customize your page by clicking 
the “Show all appearance options” 
button. 
 Here you can customize your blog 
by providing a description, and adding 
a custom domain name for your blog. 
 Choose from hundreds of themes—
scroll down for the free ones. If you 
don’t see anything interesting, you can 
access more by clicking the “Browse 
more themes” button on the bottom. 
 You can preview any of the 
themes, and once you choose one, 
install it to your blog. 
 Your new theme comes with spe-
ciﬁ c colors, but if you would like 
to tweak some background or font 
colors, you can do that under the Appearance tab. 
 You may want to add additional static pages to add depth to your blog, using the 
Pages tab. 
 The following pop-up facilitates the creation of the new page. 
 Create the URL by adding the name of your blog—for example, “stripedelephants.
tumblr.com/”. Provide a Page Title and type the text to appear on this page. You may also 
add an image using the picture icon on the edit toolbar. Check the box on the bottom to 
make the link visible on your main page. 
 The links to your custom pages appear on the top, under the blog name. 
 You can edit the hierarchy/order of your links by dragging the pages up and down.

 You can add links to additional 
social media services to appear on 
your page. 
 When done customizing your 
blog, proceed to the Dashboard to 
share with the world your ﬁ rst post, 
photo, link, or whatever else is on 
your mind. 
 You’re blogging! 
 And we’re in business. 
 One clever feature in Tumblr 
allows you to either upload an image 
from your computer . . . 
 . . . or take a photo with your web-
cam and use it instantly. 
 All of your posts show up in the 
Dashboard together with a thumb-
nail of your image, where you have an 
option to edit or delete them. 
 To preview your posts on the blog 
page, click the link to your page in the 
right column. 
 Why Themes Are Important 
 The world of websites is rife with 
noise and duplication. That’s why 
you want to carefully consider the 
appearance and usability of your blog, 
and the way your readers will be able 
to interact with it. Most hosting plat-
forms offer unique “themes” that give 
a site its own look and feel. If you look 
at enough blogs, you become famil-
iar with certain types of themes that 
appear again and again. 
 Now, there’s a plethora of choices, 
and many themes are free. Over the 
past several years, there’s been an 
explosion of design for blogs, offer-
ing literally thousands of designs with 
which to dress your blog. Blogging 
software such as WordPress allows 
you to change these themes with a few clicks, transforming the entire site to a completely 
different look in just a minute or two. 
 Both free and paid themes are widely available. Not only does changing the theme 
alter the layout and style of your blog, but also themes can give you a ﬂ exible format

that allows your users to enjoy your 
blog on mobile devices, tablets, and 
desktops alike. If you don’t pay close 
attention to the structure of your 
blog, its design and usability, you’ll be 
leaving money on the table. 
 The fastest-growing segment of 
your audience is smartphone users, 
and according to the latest data from 
2012, Pew Internet found that 17 per-
cent of smartphone users prefer to 
access the web on their mobile devices 
( www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/
Cell-Internet-Use-2012.aspx ). It’s gro -
 wing quickly, with 55 percent of all 
Internet users now able to go online 
with their phones, up from 31 percent 
in April 2009. 
 Pew found that many of those 
users are accessing websites on their 
phones because the smartphone is 
their sole device for accessing the 
Internet. One reason accessing web-
sites on smartphones is becoming 
more appealing is because of the pro-
liferation of much faster cellular data 
networks, such as LTE, giving mobile 
users speeds that are as fast as the 
broadband they became accustomed 
to at home. 
 That’s where choosing a theme 
that’s equally good on mobile plat-
forms and desktops is essential.

They’re called “responsive” themes, 
where graphics are automatically 
sized for a mobile screen, and graph-
ics, text, and links all work together 
harmoniously, as if they were  custom-
designed for mobile. We advise you 
not to choose a theme for your blog 
unless it’s responsive. That way, you’ll 
be certain that you’ll be able to reach 
this burgeoning group of readers who 
want to access your site only with 
mobile devices. 
 Beyond mobile devices, your cho -
 i ce of theme is crucial to the type of 
content you plan to display on your 
blog. There are themes speciﬁ cally 
created to display portfolios of artists 
and photographers. Other themes are 
targeted toward news sites that dis-
play multiple top stories at the same 
time. There are purist themes that 
use minimal design and put the focus 
entirely on text and graphics. And 
then there are moving, sliding car-
ousel themes that display as much 
content as possible, trying to attract 
the most attention possible before 
the reader decides to click away to 
another site. 
 Perhaps you’re not interested in 
design, and would like to go with a 
basic theme. It depends on your per-
sonal preference, but it’s important to 
express yourself with not only your 
content but also the way it’s pre-
sented. Not choosing a fancy theme 
is also a design choice, and can still 
be credible and successful. A notable 
example of that is John Gruber’s  Dar-
ing Fireball ( http://daringﬁ reball.net/ ), 
a site where opinions, concepts, and 
information rule, all playing out in off-white text over a drab gray background. 
 Buying Themes 
 When you ﬁ rst start with your blog, try the free, default themes that are available for 
your platform. For instance, WordPress has a workable group of themes you can install 
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Getting Started
31
right away that might be appropriate 
for your purposes. In addition, there 
are countless designs available online 
that are completely free for you to use. 
Best of all, almost all designs allow 
you to try them on for size before you 
commit to them, giving you a live pre-
view of what your blog will look like 
before you install a different theme. 
 When we were searching for the 
ideal themes for our various Word-
Press blogs, we were happy with 
some of the free WordPress-designed 
themes. They carry the additional 
advantage of almost-certain compat-
ibility when WordPress updates its 
software. However, we’re constantly 
tempted by some of the beautiful 
designs of some of the new themes, 
available for a fee, usually between 
$25 and $75, if you’re using the theme 
for your own site and not selling it to 
a client. 
 As you browse around the Internet 
for various themes, note how some of 
them are so sophisticated that they 
rival the old overcomplicated Flash-
based sites from days of yore. Many 
of them are truly unique. And that 
brings up another plus for buying a 
theme rather than using one that’s 
free: relatively few other bloggers 
are willing to pay for that particular 
design, giving you near-exclusivity of 
the design. It’s like buying a designer 
evening gown or tuxedo when you go 
to accept your statuette at the Webby 
Awards ceremony, where you’ll be 
assured that no one else will be wear-
ing the same thing. 
 Sometimes you can go overboard 
with a store-bought theme, where 
plug-ins are bundled with the theme, 
and the theme can’t work without 
those plug-ins. The danger there is 
sometimes the plug-ins are devel-
oped by different people from those

2
who created the theme, and if you 
encounter a problem with a plug-in 
when you’re using a new theme, the 
theme developer might point to the 
plug-in designer, and vice versa, leav-
ing you in the lurch. Another thing 
to watch out for is adding too many 
plug-ins to an already complicated 
theme, which could slow down your 
site, even if you’re using a dedicated 
server.  
 Should You Hire 
a Web Designer? 
 Once you’ve decided on a theme, 
next it’s time to slightly tweak it so it 
doesn’t look like a cookie-cutter site. 
The ﬁ rst step is creating a new logo. 
This is where a designer is useful but 
not absolutely necessary. While dis-
cussion of logo design is beyond the 
scope of this book, remember: the 
simpler the better. A logo should look 
good on paper, on the screen, and on 
a business card. 
 If you decide to go the DIY (do-it-
yourself) route, congratulations. Learn-
ing by doing is rewarding, and there 
are plenty of resources to help you 
edit HTML and CSS style sheets to 
tweak your site to perfection. If you 
do need a web designer, look for one locally and try to meet face-to-face ﬁ rst. Many web 
designers will appear out of the woodwork when you start looking, and the cheapest ser-
vice is almost never the best. 
 Running Your Own Server 
 Running your own web server is outside the scope of this book, but let’s comment a bit 
on a few best practices when it comes to serious blogging. 
 Your dedicated host will show you how to point your site’s name to your server. Think 
of this service, called a domain name server, as sort of a road sign for visitors. When a 
user types in “knittingfun.com,” for example, a DNS points that user to your server. With-
out a domain name, the only way for users to ﬁ nd your site would be to type in an IP 
address, a set of four numbers with periods in between (such as 192.168.1.1) that identify 
your computer on the web.

 In general, once your blog has started to gain traction we would recommend running 
your own copy of WordPress on a dedicated server. If you’re unsure as to how to proceed, 
visit WordPress.org, the download site for the actual WordPress program, or visit Square-
Space.com where you can build a fairly robust website with multiple features without 
knowing much about running your own server.

 Tools of the Trade 
 By now you have the basic concept of your blog put together. You’ve planned exactly 
what you’re going to do, and ﬁ lled yourself with ambition and hope. It’s time to get 
together the tools and skills you’ll need to make this a successful venture. It’s not nec-
essary for you to be a master of every one of the tools and techniques involved in blog-
ging, but you do need to put together enough skills and equipment to get the job done 
well enough. Working with your new bloggers toolkit might feel awkward at ﬁ rst, but 
after you’ve worked with the various hardware and software for a while, your skill level 
improves. Since you’ll be using these tools every day, you’ll steadily increase your knowl-
edge and familiarity with each, until ﬁ nally you’ve reached a level of proﬁ ciency.  
 A Computer and an Internet Connection 
 Certainly, you already have some way to get onto the Internet. As with any computerized 
pursuit, the faster your computer, the more work you’ll be able to get done in a given 
time. However, you’d be surprised how little computing power is actually necessary for 
writing blog posts. While you can blog on a smartphone, you’ll probably be a lot more 
comfortable using a relatively fast PC or Mac. 
 Think about what kind of coverage you’ll be doing with your blog. If you plan to attend 
lots of trade shows, live-blog at Apple keynotes, or write posts on the run, you’ll need a 
fast laptop to handle photos, and wireless Internet access (which is getting faster and 
cheaper by the day) to get your posts online from the ﬁ eld. You might be able to get your 
connectivity on by using your cellphone as a modem, otherwise known as “tethering.” By 
the time you read this, tethering might be the best, cheapest way to connect your laptop 
to the Internet. Or you might opt for blogging directly from your smartphone, which is 
made easy by apps from WordPress and Tumblr that give you the same text creation and 
graphics-insertion functions on a mobile platform that you’d have on a laptop. 
 You’ll need extra batteries to power all your stuff, or if you’re using a MacBook, you’ll 
need an external battery or two to keep things humming. 
 If you have an iPad or one of the other tablets ﬂ ooding the market these days, they’re 
getting to be popular tools for ﬁ eld blogging, too. There’s also Automattic’s WordPress 
app for the iPad ( http://bit.ly/1cROkWp ) that’s so sophisticated you might prefer using it 
over the desktop version. You’re better off with one of the models equipped for cellular 
broadband data, though, since Wi-Fi coverage is not always around when you need it, 
especially in crowded trade show conditions. Bandwidth is scarce at well-attended trade 
shows such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where all networks—cellular and 
Wi-Fi—are often so overused, you won’t be able to connect to anything. 
 If your proposed blog won’t be covering gadgetry or breaking news, consider set-
tling for the PC or Mac you’re using now. Unless you’re planning to do some heavy HD

video editing, you’re probably okay with your current computer (within reason, and you 
know who you are). If you’re thinking of doing lots of image editing or photo manipula-
tion, think about getting a larger monitor before buying a new PC—a big screen has been 
proven to enhance productivity, and we’ve found a pair of 30-inch monitors to be a sig-
niﬁ cant advantage when using Photoshop, writing blog posts, watching news feeds, and 
communicating with colleagues at the same time. 
 Minimum: That old laptop you’re still using will probably work. 
 Mid-Range: A dedicated laptop like a MacBook Pro with enough chops for graphic and 
video work. 
 Ideal: Desktop workstation with lots of RAM and disk space for graphics and video 
production, two 30-inch displays, complemented by a thin, light laptop with long battery 
life and cellular broadband connectivity for the road. 
 An RSS Reader 
 If you read blogs, you’ll probably need a newsreader. A newsreader pulls in data from an 
RSS feed and displays it separate from the original site. Newsreaders, for example, do 
not show the original layout of the site from which the information is sourced. This is 
an important distinction: people who use RSS readers may never visit a site they read in 
their newsreader. 
 This movement of blogs to newsreaders changed blogging considerably. For the ﬁ rst 
time, the content on a page could exist as a standalone entity, devoid of advertising, 
images, and other clutter. Blog posts had to drag the reader from a newsreader to the 
website and create a fan where there was once a passive consumer. Many bloggers see 
the divorce of content from website to be a bad thing. After all, it reduces pageviews and 
potential ad revenue. However, with the right content, you can force the reader to put the 
two back together again, creating a unique opportunity to turn a mass of “grazers” into 
an audience. Now applications like Flipboard are replacing newsreaders by turning blog 
posts into magazine articles with high production values and high-resolution images. 
But, in the end, we’re still using Winer’s original technology. 
 Sadly, Google just closed its reader and new services like Flipboard and Digg Reader 
have come to ﬁ ll the vacuum. See a more-detailed discussion about RSS readers in  Chap-
ter 5 , where we offer tips about picking an RSS reader and building your own feed of sites. 
 As it stands, anywhere you can see your favorite blog content quickly and easily 
works just ﬁ ne for story discovery. For example, I have a list of bookmarks called Morning 
that opens all of my favorite sites in one window. A quick perusal of these usually sets 
me off on the right track. 
 Connectivity 
 In this game, the speed of your computer is less important than the speed and reliabil-
ity of your Internet connection. Sending your text and small graphics to your web host 
probably won’t require much bandwidth, but when you’re looking for stories all over the 
Internet, reading RSS feeds, and quickly bouncing back and forth between different web-
sites, a fast Internet connection will be a vital component of your success. Don’t skimp 
on your Internet speed, or else your research efforts will feel like they’re being impeded 
by a ball and chain.

 Minimum/Mid-range: At least a DSL or cable broadband connection. 
 Ideal: Verizon FiOS ﬁ ber optic connection, or a faster cable broadband connection 
such as Roadrunner Ultimate at 100 Mb per second or Google’s gigabit broadband if you’re 
lucky enough to live in a city that provides it. 
 Image Editing Software 
 You might be able to get away with using other bloggers’ or websites’ graphics, or bet-
ter yet, ﬁ nd appropriate graphics that you can legally use via Creative Commons, which 
we’ll explain later in this book, but it’s inevitable that you’ll need to modify some of those 
for your own site. But beware of copyright violations (we’ll talk more about this in the 
Ethics chapter)—many times you can get permission to use a unique pic with a quick 
email. Short of that, you can grab pictures from other websites and blogs and turn them 
into your own with your own speciﬁ c style, and if it’s different enough from the original, 
you’re probably safe from copyright concerns. How do you do this? If you’re short of 
funds, there are a variety of free online image editors such as the Photoshop-like and free 
Pixlr (get it at  http://pixlr.com/ ), the excellent and free cross-platform image editor Gimp, 
and dozens of others that are fully capable of image resizing, sharpening, color correc-
tion, and a lot more. 
 If you can somehow get your hands on a copy of Adobe Photoshop, that’s the gold 
standard of image editors, which many think is the best software package ever written. 
We agree. Available for both Mac and PC, it’s now available by subscription for $19.99 per 
month, but student discounts can bring that price down signiﬁ cantly. You can try it out 
for a month by downloading it from the Adobe website, giving you a good idea of whether 
it’s something you’d be interested in using. 
 There is a learning curve to Photoshop, but to learn its most powerful features 
doesn’t take long at all. There are scores of Photoshop tutorials available online that 
can show you every tip and trick imaginable. What can it do for you that other image 
editors—such as Adobe’s dumbed-down Photoshop Elements—can’t? One of our 
favorites is its “Smart Sharpen” capability, turning fuzzy-looking pictures into pro-
fessional graphics. More recent versions of Photoshop (starting with Photoshop CS5) 
have a nearly miraculous capability called Content-Aware Fill, where you can select 
an area, hit the Delete button, and make that area magically disappear. The newest 
version of the software, Photoshop CC, can also magically eliminate many types of 
lens blur. Features such as these might make it worth it for you to consider investing 
in Adobe Photoshop, particularly if your chosen blog will be one that deals with lots 
of products, graphically enhanced stories, or anything else that might beneﬁ t from 
pictures. 
 Minimum: Online image editor; there are plenty of good ones. 
 Mid-range : Paint.net, a free image editor for Windows, or Pixelmator, an inexpensive 
editor for Mac. 
 Ideal: Adobe Photoshop CS5 or newer. 
 Digital Camera 
 Speaking of pictures, you’ll often need to create some of your own for your blog. If your 
chosen topic has to do with any products or devices, a decent camera is a necessity.

Your photos of your hands holding those products will serve as proof that you actually 
tested them. 
 When we ﬁ rst started blogging, we tried to make do with low-cost point-and-shoot 
cameras. It took a lot of extra work to get professional-looking pictures with these cam-
eras. While they’re steadily improving, their low-light performance is still no match for 
even a low-end digital single lens reﬂ ex (DSLR) camera, which has a much larger sensor 
and can give you noticeably better pictures without needing to use a ﬂ ash. Invest in a 
good DSLR, and the photography and product shots on your blog will give you a distinct 
advantage. 
 When shopping for a suitable camera for your blogging adventures, pay more atten-
tion to low-light performance than pixel size. Image stabilization is also an advantage, 
allowing you to take pictures in lower light and still hold the camera still enough to pre-
vent image blur. For blogging, it’s convenient to have video capability and still-picture 
capability on the same camera. That’ll lighten your load, accomplishing two functions 
with one device, and most cameras are now equipped with both video and still capability. 
 Smartphones are improving so much that you can get away with using one for your 
images, but don’t expect miracles. You might be tempted to use a smartphone for photos 
or video, and some of the more advanced smartphone cameras will work for a few simple 
shots. In a few years, smartphones will probably be perfectly ﬁ ne for blogging use under 
almost any circumstance. But compared with a DSLR, an iPhone’s or high-end Android 
phone’s pictures aren’t nearly as good, but then, you might not have your bulky DSLR 
with you all the time. 
 Look at the difference between a product shot with DSLR compared with an iPhone 
camera. Notice the “bokeh” (blurred background, pronounced boh-KAY) of the DSLR’s 
shot, adding extra dimension. With its aperture fully open, a DSLR’s 50 mm lens results 
in a shallow depth of ﬁ eld, throwing the background out of focus while keeping the fore-
ground sharp. It has an almost 3D look compared with the iPhone’s results. 
 DSLR 
 iPhone 
 Minimum: Point-and-shoot camera you are familiar with and enjoy using, or a smart-
phone camera/camcorder. 
 Mid-range : An entry-level DSLR such as the Canon Rebel series or Nikon D5200. 
 Ideal: Nikon D800, Canon EOS 5D Mark III, or one of the micro four-thirds cameras 
from Olympus, Panasonic, or others.

 Camcorder 
 If you have a relatively modern point-and-shoot camera, you already have the minimum 
video capability for grabbing quick video clips on the run. The latest cameras often have 
high-deﬁ nition video capability, and some even allow you to immediately place that 
video onto YouTube. Then you can go to your computer and quickly create a blog post, 
embedding the video within it for easy one-click playback. 
 In a pinch, video from a smartphone will sufﬁ ce, and as this technology improves, 
that will probably be your main means of video capture and upload. If your video activi-
ties consist mostly of you talking to the camera, a webcam might do the trick, and if 
you’re looking for faithful reproduction of every zit and ingrown hair on your face, there 
are now high-deﬁ nition webcams available for recording your rants of wisdom. For this 
purpose, we’ve had great success with the Microsoft LifeCam Cinema webcam, and the 
webcam built into the MacBook Pro or just about any laptop. 
 You want to concentrate on quality with everything you do, but with video, concern 
yourself mostly with the content you’ll be showing. In many cases, timeliness of your 
video upload is more important than its technical quality (within reason—make sure the 
video is at least watchable). In fact, a study from Rice University concluded that if you’re 
interested in whatever it is you’re watching, you’re less likely to notice the difference in 
video quality. 2 
 We’ll have more tips for effectively shooting and editing video in the next chapter, 
but before you concern yourself with that, assess the value of shooting video when you 
need to and uploading that video from anywhere. The best candidate for that might be 
a smartphone with video capability, as long as there’s enough bandwidth available to 
upload its video. 
 If you want to go to great lengths to create professional-quality video, you’d be sur-
prised what a great job cameras that cost as little as $500 can do when shooting video. 
Key features to look for in high-quality shooting include image stabilization, the widest-
angle lens you can ﬁ nd, and enhanced low-light shooting capability. Whatever camera 
you choose, make sure it uses ﬂ ash memory cards to store the footage. That will make it 
easier for you to transfer your footage to your computer and ultimately upload it to You-
Tube or Vimeo for use on your website. 
 Making matters even easier would be a laptop with a slot for the same type of ﬂ ash 
memory cards used by your camera and camcorder, allowing you to take the card out of 
your camera, place it in your laptop, and immediately begin editing or uploading that 
video. Or consider using a point-and-shoot camera with video capability that can also 
upload stills and video to YouTube. 
 An often-overlooked way to enhance the quality of your video is to accompany it 
with high-quality audio. If you’re planning to feature lots of video on your site, consider 
getting a wireless mic to capture audio, and immediately you’ll separate yourself from 
most of the amateurs. Another way to set yourself apart from novices is to use a tripod 
as often as possible. 
 If video will be a serious focus for your blog, consider procuring lights speciﬁ cally 
suited for video, and video editing software. You can use iMovie, the excellent video soft-
ware included with every Mac, or the less capable Windows Live Movie Maker that’s free 
to download for any PC. You can even use the built-in video editing capabilities of You-
Tube, which can give you simple cuts, dissolves, text overlays, and more. But if you’re

serious about your video, look into using Final Cut Pro for the Mac or Adobe Premiere Pro 
for the PC. 
 Minimum: Cellphone with video capture capability, or a point-and-shoot camera 
with video; some even include video editing software. 
 Mid-range: A pocket cam with, ideally, an external microphone jack. 
 Ideal: Dedicated HD camcorder with effective image stabilization, a tripod, lighting, 
and good microphones. 
 Collaboration Tools 
 If you’re working with other writers, efﬁ cient communication is crucial. All the blogs we’ve 
worked with have used two methods of instant messaging—one for a group and another 
for individuals to communicate with each other one-on-one. In the blog world, instant 
messaging software such as AIM and Google Talk (now transitioning into the all-purpose 
Google Hangouts) is the most prevalent way of communicating one-on-one. It’s efﬁ cient 
because you and all of your co-writers can instantly chat with each other, but can wait to 
respond to each other when it’s convenient for you. For the group to communicate, we’ve 
had great success with an application called Campﬁ re by 37 Signals, a chat room where 
everyone working on your blog can communicate and collaborate with each other at the 
same time. You could also use a secret Facebook group, which functions as a powerful 
message board and communications system that lets you upload ﬁ les and pin posts. 
 Another excellent new way to work together on documents and ﬁ les is by using Drop-
box or Google Drive, cloud-based ﬁ le hosting services that work on Windows, Mac, and 
Linux. They make collaboration easy. Both Google Drive and Dropbox show up as an icon on 
your desktop, and when you click the icon, you see the local version of your documents that 
are also stored online in the cloud. Open one of those documents, and you automatically 
check it out as soon as you change anything in it and save those changes. Its checked-out 
status is then designated by a red “X” on the online document icon. As soon as you close the 
document, Dropbox or Google Drive synchronizes the changes you’ve made with the online 
version. That’s cool, because it keeps you and your collaborators from overwriting each 
other’s changes. We used Dropbox for our collaboration in writing this book, and it works 
beautifully. Best of all, you can use the service free as long as you don’t have more than 2 GB 
of ﬁ les online (and you can get more free storage if you get others to sign up for the service). 
 An older yet still common method of collaboration is using Microsoft Word’s “Track 
Changes” feature. This doesn’t happen in real time like the other methods we’ve men-
tioned, but it’s well-suited for feature writing, where an author is working with an editor. 
The editor can make changes in the document, and all of those edits are visible later, 
letting the author either accept or reject each change. It also lets you highlight words or 
phrases, and then add your notes and suggestions, which appear in a bubble next to the 
text. Track Changes has been a common collaboration tool for journalists for many years, 
and still has relevance today. 
 Minimum: Instant messaging such as AIM, MSN Messenger, Google Hangouts, or the 
text chat feature in Skype. 
 Ideal: A chat room such as Campﬁ re with all participants online. Additionally, every-
one is linked with instant messaging, and all have each other’s phone numbers handy for 
those times when only texting or talking with each other will do.

 Audio Recording 
 Consider telling your stories with your voice. Podcasting is less complicated than shoot-
ing video, and it’s a way to reach your readers when they’re driving in their cars or exer-
cising. Audio recording gear is surprisingly affordable, and software is easily installed on 
smartphones, or even included on many. For $100 or less, you can get a tremendously 
sophisticated audio recording device, to which you can attach good microphones for 
professional-quality recordings. Open-source audio editing packages such as the free 
Audacity for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux are readily available, or you can get more 
sophisticated with sound effects and your own original music. And you could use the   free 
Skype software for online interviews that are easily recorded with apps such as the free 
Skype Recorder ( www.extralabs.net/skype-recorder.htm ). 
 Minimum: Dictation recorders can get the job done on the cheap, or you could use 
an audio recording app on your smartphone. Don’t forget Skype for easily recorded 
interviews. 
 Mid-range:  A recording device such as stereo or surround recorders from Roland or 
Samson. 
 Ideal: High-end recording devices might be overkill. For instance, Samson’s Zoom 
H4N4 with its XLR inputs for professional microphones might not result in noticeably 
better sound in your ﬁ nal output than one of the mid-range recorders that give you “good 
enough” quality. If your material will be broadcast or podcast and you have the cash, look 
for a dedicated uncompressed audio recorder such as the Samson Zoom H2 with high-
quality built-in mics and external mic inputs. 
 Typing and Voice Recognition Tools 
 The best way to instantly speed up your work, especially if you’re not a good typist, is to 
use the PC-based Nuance Dragon NaturallySpeaking (or the similar Dragon Dictate for 
Mac OS X, also from Nuance) speech recognition software. Even if you type as quickly as 
100 words per minute, you can probably talk a lot faster than that. The latest version 12.5 
of NaturallySpeaking is so accurate that it’s uncanny. Be sure to get a good USB headset 
mic to use with NaturallySpeaking, and you can write, edit, and then post your articles 
twice as fast as your slow-typing competitors. 
 Further speeding up typing are macro applications. Using your choice of hot keys, 
you can quickly type often-used words or phrases with just a few keystrokes. You’d 
be surprised how many phrases you repeatedly use every day, and these can be typed 
instantly with a macro program. Our favorite for PC is called KeyText, a $29.95 software 
utility that types any words or phrases when you strike your favorite hotkey combina-
tion, and can run programs daily at a designated time. This one’s saved us hours of 
typing. For Mac, similar time-savers are QuicKeys ($59.95) or TextExpander ($34.95), 
letting you type a few keystrokes and then quickly pouring out boilerplate text onto 
your page. 
 Minimum: A macro program to automatically type frequently written words and 
phrases. Try TextExpander for OS X or KeyText for Windows. 
 Ideal: A text macro program, used along with the $99 Nuance NaturallySpeaking soft-
ware (or Dragon Dictate for Mac OS X), which we’ve found to be faster than typing, and 
makes our writing more conversational.

 Bloggers “Go Bag” 
 If you’re planning to cover events, get yourself a comfortable backpack or briefcase into 
which you can stuff all your essential blogging tools. In addition to your laptop, cam-
era, note-taking device, and audio recorder, you’ll carry all of your common-sense items, 
including extra batteries for everything with replaceable batteries, chargers for all of your 
gadgets, and battery-based ﬁ eld chargers for those times when there aren’t electrical 
outlets available. In case PR people aren’t handing out press kits on thumb drives or 
discs, carry your own USB thumb drive with at least 4 GB of capacity so you can exchange 
photos or info with PR or your blogging comrades, or grab screenshots from demo com-
puters when you need them. Always carry an extra USB cable. And one other item we 
wish everyone would carry and use copiously: Altoids, or some other “curiously strong” 
breath-freshening accoutrements. 
 Minimum: A notepad and pen, or borrow one from someone. Short of that, you’ll need 
a good memory. 
 Ideal: Pack everything into your “go bag” you could ever possibly need for any blog 
post you might dream up in the ﬁ eld, balanced by the inescapable fact that you will be 
the one carrying all that stuff. Don’t forget to wear comfortable shoes. 
 Forgetful? Create a go-bag checklist to refer to when you’re packing. Charlie likes to 
use iOS to-do app Clear for his go-bag checklist.

 Essential Blogging Skills 
 Now that you’ve gathered all the tools you need and established a place where you can 
start out your world-changing website, you might be wondering, “Hey, that’s just a lot of 
equipment, code, and hardware. What soft skills do I need?” Writing talent, ﬁ nesse, and 
the quirkiness of just being human are all-important factors that will determine whether 
a blog will be successful, and you need them all to succeed. 
 First, realize that you’re taking on a large commitment. Who’s going to do all this 
stuff? Unless you can hire a staff of dozens of people, each specializing in a particular 
area of expertise, you’ll need to be versatile. Each of the subtopics of this chapter are 
the bedrock of entire careers, encompassing tremendous craftsmanship and decades of 
practice to fully master. However, if you can become conversant in this core group of 
skills, you’ll be off to a great start. 
 Web marketers say this all the time, but you are your own brand. You are aiming to be 
a trusted source on ﬁ shing or dancing or onion rings. Think of this as writing a nonﬁ ction 
book—for years you will be consumed by one topic. It will deﬁ ne you. When you are done, 
you will be the guy or girl who wrote the deﬁ nitive book on your topic. It will deﬁ ne you 
as a brand. Just as Mentos is the freshmaker, you will be the onion ring expert. 
 Enhance Your Writing by Reading 
 The ﬁ rst step toward becoming a good writer is reading. William Faulkner, one of our 
favorite writers, said, “Read everything—trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they 
do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! 
You’ll absorb it. Then write. If it is good, you’ll ﬁ nd out.” 
 Begin your day by scanning your news sources (we’ll show you how to gather those 
later in the book) and assessing the “big” stories of the day you’d like to write about. We’d 
also recommend keeping a list of writing topics for slow days. Read everything you can 
ﬁ nd on your chosen topic. Read forums, read news stories, read Google News alerts. Read. 
Your goal is to gather the ingredients for your posts. Do not spend more than an hour on 
this process. Don’t waste time. Blogging requires an economy of movement akin to ath-
letics. You’ll ﬁ nd yourself sucked into multiple sources, stories, and other minutiae. Your 
goal is to produce, not consume.

 Unless your topic is fast-moving like technology or politics, you will be able to ﬁ nd 
just enough to write about in the hour you dedicate to research daily.  Bloggers take small 
stories and magnify them with research, opinion, and humor.  Take this mission to heart. 
No matter what your topic you will ﬁ nd something to write about. 
 Our best advice is to open a list of stories you will later address, or create a to-do 
list using a separate program. We use RememberTheMilk.com, but feel free to create a 
method that works for you. Perhaps you just want to open a text ﬁ le that you constantly 
update or you open all of your chosen ﬁ les in tabs on your desktop. Or you could place 
your post ideas on a calendar. 
 Current news stories can also be jumping-off points for your own commentary and 
reporting. Just because blogging seems like a reactive medium doesn’t mean it has to 
be. Create your own topics of conversation. Some of the best bloggers “riff” on current 
events, adding humor and their own slant to the story. Take  BikeSnob  (aka Eben Weiss), 
at bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com. Rather than write about the potentially esoteric world of 
bikes and bike racing, he turns that world on its head. By adding humor and hyperbole to 
a self-serious topic, he makes it approachable. 
 Writing 
 To blog, you need to know how to write. You’re going to be writing a blog. People tell us 
writing is hard. But don’t let what happened to you in English class affect you at all. If 
you’ve excelled in the literary arts, lucky you. But blog writing is a lot different from 
 Pro Tip 
 WordPress has a plug-in that is a handy editorial calendar. Try it here:  http://

you’re planning to write about that day.

writing term papers. You might have choked in creative writing class, but never mind 
that. You might be able to pump out AP-style copy on a deadline for a daily paper. But 
that won’t make you a great blogger. Now that you’re on your own, with the wonderful 
freedom that blogging brings, let your voice emerge. 
 The blogger motto is primarily “First Thought, Best Thought.”  Like Kerouac before 
you, allow the words to ﬂ ow. There is no writer’s block in blogging. If anything, the pro-
cess of daily writing will assuage any writer’s block you already have. Writing begets 
 writing—and the more you write, well, the better you write. 
 To be fair, we’re probably oversimplifying this, but there’s a reason: Blogging is about 
writing  a lot . It’s also about producing videos, podcasts, and images.  It’s about making 
things quickly and making them great. 
 You’ll need mastery of the rules of grammar (either by ear or rote), a knack for scintil-
lating prose, a good-sized vocabulary, powers of observation, insight no one has thought 
of yet, work ethic, and a dash of friendly humor here and there. Do you have anything to 
say? Make it coherent, clear, concise, and accessible, and readers will come back for more. 
 Bloggers are journalists, but writing a blog post is not the same as conventional jour-
nalism. The best bloggers craft their text to be tight and scannable. Bullet points, pithy 
headings, punchy paragraphs, and short summaries rule. Readers might skip your post 
if confronted by a wall of text, so keep those paragraphs short, add headings, pull quotes 
(there are plug-ins for those, too), boldface ﬁ rst-words in paragraphs, in-line pictures or 
icons—anything to break it up and facilitate browsing and grazing. 
 Don’t get in a rut, though, always writing lists or using the same phrases. Switch it 
up. Do a Q & A, poll your readers, write info-packed captions on a slideshow of pictures. 
Write a haiku. Surprise them! Maybe even write something crazy or weird, if your blog 
style permits. Predictability is death for you. The only thing predictable about your posts 
will be their unpredictability. 
 When you write, “listen” to the words as they ﬂ ow onto the page. Does this sound 
right? Is there a rhythm to it? Listen to your prose in your head, and you’ll soon get a 
sense of what sounds right and what just ties the reader into a Gordian knot. Or even read 
it aloud, which will also help you proofread. Think accessibility, entertainment value, and 
understandability. These are the factors that will make your writing fun. Unlike the stuffy 
world of academia, with blog writing there’s no premium placed on making your writing 
 less understandable. 
 “Perfection is the enemy of greatness,” said R&B musician Janelle Monáe, and we 
agree. As a blogger with limited resources, there is no way all of your work will be perfect. 
You will be the source of typos, grammar mistakes, factual errors, and other annoyances 
 Will the readers notice if you’re repetitive? Yes, some will. You’d be 
surprised. One day when Charlie was writing for  Gizmodo , he decided to reuse a catchy phrase 
he had included in a post two years earlier, concerning a gadget whose chief function was 
deodorizing the air. Away he went with “Does your abode smell like the shithouse door on a tuna 
boat?” Who would remember that from two years earlier? Much to his chagrin, not ten minutes 
after he had published the post, a reader complained that he’d already experienced that putrid 
imagery written by Charlie, proving it with a link to a post from two years before.

that, in the end, will train you to be a better writer. After a few critical comments ques-
tioning the value of your content and your plethora of boo-boos, you’ll quickly learn to 
proofread your own work. 
 Great writing goes beyond just the possession of a sharply honed skill set. The best 
writers pour personality onto the page, making you feel the way they feel. Tell a good 
story, make them laugh with you, become angry with you, cry with you. Attack their 
senses with descriptions of sounds, smells, tastes, sights, and true feelings. Fill your para-
graphs with emotion, and touch a part of your readers that makes them feel that way, too. 
 Now, let’s start writing. 
 The 1,000 Words Rule 
 When you begin you must write a minimum of 1,000 words a day. 
 Every new endeavor requires a period of ascetic dedication. Some bloggers make this 
their ceiling, but many make it their ﬂ oor. Either way, you must produce on a daily basis. 
How do you do this? You can crank out, perhaps, three posts of a few hundred words each 
in the morning and three in the evening. Or you can write one big post. Either way, do the 
word count. Why is this important? Because if you have a goal, you can meet it. After his 
heart attack, blogging great Om Malik set this number for himself to ensure he produced 
quality content in a timely manner and did not kill himself in the process. Sadly, Om’s 
heart attack was brought on by the blogging lifestyle, as well as too much booze, cigars, 
family history, and bad luck. It took a massive change in his everyday life to reorient him 
toward a saner blogging schedule, and he found this 1,000-word limit invaluable. 
 This word count is not impossible. It’s about two pages of standard paper a day. At 
ﬁ rst, do not surpass this word count. This is an endurance race, not a sprint. The recom-
mended dosage of 1,000 words a day is doable by the average writer, is a concrete number 
for you to strive toward, and is about as much as your audience can read in a day. Do not 
do less, either. This is a regimen. You need to get used to producing this much content 
quickly and without complaint. If you use one of our favorite speech recognition tools we 
told you about in the previous chapter, you’ll be pounding out words without pounding 
on the keyboard. In fact, you’ll ﬁ nd that by speaking your posts you often write  more  than 
you originally intended. 
 This also brings up an important point: Writing for blogs is conversational. Some 
of the best bloggers write like they’re telling a story. For example, Eben Oliver Weiss, 
author of  BikeSnobNYC , does two pertinent things when he creates a blog post: He ﬁ rst 
offers a bit of information about an important aspect of biking lore or current bike news, 
and then blends that news into a tightly spun yarn connecting the news to his unstated 
 When John started working at  Gizmodo  he had to write twenty-eight 
posts a day. If that sounds like Grandpa complaining he had to walk uphill both ways in the snow 
to school, so be it. But it was awful. He wrote ten posts in the morning, hit a few more by 3 p.m., 
and then wrote from 6 p.m. until midnight. This kind of regimen—as far from the 1,000 piffle 
we’re proposing—was damaging and insane. Try it at your peril.

mission: to poke holes in the smug superiority of biking experts. It’s a noble goal, and he’s 
been rewarded with a book deal and great popularity. 
 The hardest part of this 1,000-word regimen is accepting that your audience may not 
appear magically out of thin air as you write. Luring readers to your writer’s online lair 
will be addressed later in the book, but rest assured the 1,000-word regimen will give 
vibrancy and life to your blog. A blog that has not been updated for days is a sick blog. 
A blog that has not been updated for a month is a dead blog. If you do not produce 1,000 
words a day, no matter what, you’re risking running out of momentum far too early. 
 Some bloggers do considerably less than 1,000 words a day and some do more. For 
example, John Gruber at  DaringFireball  posts small “nugget” posts and then creates long, 
well-written essays on technology every week or so. Like the prize in a box of Cracker 
Jacks, Gruber’s long posts are a reward to his readers and a joy to read. Why not do the 
same? Post lots of nuggets—100 words each—and one or two huge posts every few days. 
Or you can publish one large post every day. Either way, you’re going to gain an audience if 
you give them something they want.  Just remember our motto: ABP—Always Be Posting. 
 Now for the bad news: You will burn out.  When this happens, take a break. Always 
take weekends off (or a couple of days side-by-side during the week if you’re writing 
weekend-centric stuff). But take time for yourself. 
 To recap, keep writing. Write 1,000 words a day. Do this every weekday and leave the 
blog alone on weekends. Or, if there is no one in your niche writing on the weekends, that 
might be an opportunity for you. Either way, give yourself a regular weekly break. 
 The Bloggers Survival Kit: Essential Skills 
for Getting through the Day 
 Interviewing 
 If you can’t make the 1,000-word minimum, why not have your subjects write the words 
for you? Interviews are a convenient way to meet high-ranking ofﬁ cials in your blogging 
world. Interview great thinkers in your niche. Introduce yourself, ask them if you can 
send them a few questions, and then prepare a list of ﬁ ve simple things you’d like them 
to tell you, and by extension, your readers. 
 Interviewing is different from a conversation, where instead of a 50/50 effort, it’s sup-
posed to be the person you’re interviewing doing most of the talking. However, the two 
forms of social discourse have one key skill: listening. Even if you’re nervous, don’t obsess 
about your next question. Listen,  really listen  to what your interviewee is saying. Then ask 
about something your interview subject just said. This seems like an obvious and stupid 
suggestion, but it’s astonishing how many people forget this easy rule. 
 Be curious about everything. Think about what your readers would want to know. It 
doesn’t hurt to have a list of questions written down that you want to be sure to address 
during your interview, but you don’t want to just read those questions off like a list to 
your interviewee. 
 When possible, an interview should be a conversation. Go down strange corridors 
with your subject and be prepared for silence. In a lull, do not speak. Let your interviewee 
speak. There is no reason to step on a thought—don’t try to imitate the combative pun-
dits ﬁ ghting on a cable-TV gabfest, interrupting each other before any complete thoughts 
can be expressed.

 Always have two methods of recording going at once. You may not use your backup 
recording, but it’s important to have it if something goes south. 
 Note-Taking 
 You learned how to take notes in school, didn’t you? Well, if you didn’t, get good at taking 
notes now and you won’t have to record audio and video of everything you see and hear. 
The advantage of notes over recordings: speed. You won’t have to listen to that record-
ing, playing everything you already heard once. Learn to write down the key points, and 
you’re golden, saving time and writing your post like a ninja. 
 Quickly note the salient facts, pithy quotes, and your impressions of the demonstra-
tion you’re attending or the person you’re interviewing, and be sure to develop the skill of 
listening while you write. It’s not as easy as it looks. If you’re attending a press event, be 
sure to grab a press kit as soon as you can, and peek inside to see (or ask) if all the specs 
and facts you’ll need are listed. That saves you a serious amount of note-taking. 
 Unless you know shorthand—which is extremely handy when you want to take accu-
rate notes—we’ve found the most time-saving note-taking technique is a hybrid method 
using a recording and your note-taking skills. Have your audio recorder running within 
glancing distance throughout any interviews and info exchanges, and note the recorder’s 
exact counter time when you hear key pieces of information. Next to where you’ve writ-
ten the counter number, note the topic, and you can always go back later and get exact 
quotes and info as needed. Then you’re free to write down your impressions, observa-
tions, and feelings about what’s happening. 
 Text Editing 
 As a writer, you must also be an editor. As you’ve probably already noticed, spell check 
isn’t going to cut it. For instance, we’re reminded of a cover letter written by a hapless 
job applicant, starting off with the astonishing mistake, “Dear Sir or Madman.” The word 
“madman” was spelled perfectly. Thanks, spell check! 
 Editing your own writing is the most difﬁ cult proofreading you’ll ever do, though. You 
still remember most of what you wrote, and will have a tendency to overlook incorrect 
words and grammar. That’s because there’s a weird tendency to skip over certain words 
you’ve just written, not really reading the whole thing. It’s the mental shorthand that 
makes us more efﬁ cient readers, but this time, switch into another gear—the one where 
you’re an anal-retentive and persnickety grammar Nazi. Better for you to perform that 
 For the Record 
 Pro Tip 
 You might want to record your most important interviews on an audio recorder 
or an app on your smartphone. Even though it adds extra work to your production workflow 
because of the need to listen and transcribe the recordings, you’re better off recording your 
most important interviews. It gives you confidence that your quotes are accurate. If you get 
into legal trouble with an interview subject, a recording can serve as proof the person actually 
said the quotes you included in your article. Transcribing does take time, but it’s much easier 
when you use a speech recognition program to repeat the conversation as you listen to it—it’s an 
efficient way to transcribe quotes in near-real time.

role now, because certain readers will be eager to humiliate you later, making themselves 
feel superior. 
 As the wise Japanese saying goes, you’re “too close to the lighthouse.” So ﬁ guratively 
stand back and get some perspective. Wait an hour or so (if you have that kind of time), 
and you can approach your work with a more critical eye. Don’t have that much time? 
Reading your writing aloud often reveals errors. Some writers read their work backwards, 
and that helps them see errors they didn’t notice before. Read it from bottom to top, go 
to another computer, and if you must, print it to give you another angle. Cleanse your 
writer’s palate by reading something else for a while, and then revisit. Edit! Those mis-
takes you catch will keep you from sabotaging your credibility. 
 If you’re working with other bloggers or have a literate friend nearby, get another pair 
of eyes to read your work. They’ll see things you took for granted. They’ll be unfamiliar 
with whatever it is you just wrote. They’ll make you slap your forehead, wondering, “Why 
didn’t I see that?” If your helpful proofreader doesn’t understand something you’ve writ-
ten, assume a large percentage of your readers won’t understand it, either. Fix it! 
 Proofread everything you write, fact-check everything, edit for clarity, add new facts, 
and continue to polish until time’s up. If you’re like us and most writers, you’ll feel like 
the editing is never done, always ﬁ nding ways to improve your writing. In fact, it feels like 
articles that we’ve written are never quite done—like many a lost football game, it’s just 
that time ran out. So, edit your article to the point where it’s good enough, and then let go.  
 Layout 
 As we mentioned before, you should know at least the rudiments of HTML. Being able 
to <b>old (or bold’s muscular cousin, <strong>), <i>talicize, and <u>nderscore is the very 
least you should know how to do. Many content management systems (CMSes) also have 
special layout features. For example, some systems allow you to upload an image and set 
its position, left, right, or center. If it’s set to left or right it will ﬂ ow text around an image 
ﬂ oating to the left or right. 
 The  class attribute in HTML is how most WordPress themes handle image position 
(<img src="x.jpg" class="right">). You absolutely must become familiar with your own 
CMS’s layout functions. 
 We also recommend using the “more” tag often. The “more” tag, usually represented 
by <!-more-> in WordPress, adds a pagebreak. This moves the rest of the content after a 
 Read More link, allowing you to move most of your content off the front page. Why? 
 The obvious reason is to gain pageviews. But there are other, less mercenary reasons 
to clean up your front page. By placing a single paragraph on the front page, you train 
yourself in pyramidal writing and you force each of your introductory sentences to be a 
little bit of literary gold. By pushing only a bit of the story to the top, you are forced to 
think about which stories will please your readers the most and which parts of the story 
are most important. This also prevents huge blocks of text from cluttering up the front 
page. It allows your readers to browse effortlessly and ﬁ nd what they want, instead of 
clicking away from your site. 
 There are a few bloggers who leave their entire posts on the front page, but in many 
instances, these writers post so rarely that it oftentimes looks better if there is more fresh 
text on the front page. Generally, however, if you stick to our 1,000-word-per-day chal-
lenge, you’ll have plenty of new stories to ﬁ ll up your front page.

 Blog Photography Tips 
 Photography 
 If you’re just starting out, the important thing is to take lots of pictures—more than you 
think you’ll need to be sure there’s a good one in there somewhere—and then transfer 
those digital photos to your computer. Then study your results. Learn by trial and error, 
visit websites that specialize in photo tips, and talk with others who have learned about 
photography. 
 You’ve probably already at least dabbled in photography, but taking photos of prod-
ucts and using them in a blog will prove to be a different undertaking from snap-
ping photos of your pals with your point-and-shoot or smartphone camera. The key 
to great photography is practice. Look for opportunities to take pictures, and think of 
photography as an art form. Constantly strive to improve your photographic knowl-
edge and skill, and that extra work will pay off big in making your blog look a lot more 
professional. 
 You don’t have to be a magazine-level photographer, but a few basic camera skills 
would be helpful. For starters, learn to properly focus and expose a picture, import it 
into your computer, and modify it for use on your website (see the section on Photoshop 
ahead). If you’re writing about products, it would help to learn basic product photog-
raphy, proving to your readers that you actually got your hands on the products about 
which you’re writing. Get the best camera you can possibly afford, and learn how to use 
it, and you’ll be glad you did. 
 Whenever you can, use natural light. Even the best-quality ﬂ ash units usually cast an 
unnatural glare on your subject. If you must use a ﬂ ash, you’ll get the best results with 
a separate ﬂ ash head with a diffuser on board, giving you more natural-looking lighting. 
Whatever you’re using, learn to get the most out of your equipment. Before going out 
on an important story, test and practice with any new equipment you’ve added to your 
photography kit, and make sure you can use these new devices quickly and efﬁ ciently. 
Practice by taking dozens of pictures, and then scrutinizing your results. Any deﬁ ciencies 
will be immediately evident. 
 Adobe Photoshop 
 We mention Adobe Photoshop again here because it’s the preferred image editing soft-
ware, and perhaps the best piece of software ever written. See if you can get your 
hands on a copy of Photoshop, and we’re talking about the main Photoshop CC appli-
cation. We’re not talking about Photoshop Elements, which is not even in the same 
league. 
 You don’t need to learn every one of Photoshop’s thousands of magic tricks if you 
want to be a good photo editor for your blog. However, you should be able to properly 
crop and resize a picture, adjust its exposure, contrast, and colors, sharpen it using Pho-
toshop’s unparalleled “smart sharpen” capability, and cut out objects and people, com-
bining them with others. For instance, it’s often helpful to be able to combine a logo with 
a person, or two products together. 
 If you can’t afford (or somehow ﬁ nd) a copy of Photoshop or don’t want to spend 
the time learning it, lesser applications, some of which are browser-based and readily

available online, can perform many 
of these same functions. Whichever 
software you use, a few skills will go 
a long way toward enhancing any 
online endeavor. Any further sophis-
tication can give you an extra edge, 
and you’ll know how to rescue some 
of your personal photos, too. 
 As we mentioned before, we 
also recommend a program called 
Pixelmator for OS X. Pixelmator is a 
simple, complete image editor that 
runs on Macs and costs about $60. 
It has most of the features included 
in Photoshop except a few specialty 
commands used by professional pho-
tographers and graphic designers. An 
app like Pixelmator (or the free Paint.
net on Windows) is excellent for blog-
gers performing daily graphics tasks. 
 Generally, your images should be 
exactly as wide as your blog  column—
usually between 520 and 640 pixels—
and smaller images should be 250 to 
350 pixels on the top side if they are 
“ﬂ owed” into the text. For example, 
you would have something like this if 
you have a big, bold picture: 
 Large images that span from one 
side of the column to another have 
tremendous appeal. If the product is 
the star, and you have gorgeous pics 
available, ﬂ aunt it! Splay one of them 
across the top of your post. Many 
readers are interested in the pics 
more than your text, especially when 
your subject is something they’ve 
never seen before, such as this laptop, 
whose maker claims that it is the world’s thinnest. 
 Smaller pics have their place, too. You can arrange them like this, with text ﬂ owing 
around the image: 
 Smaller images often encourage “clicks”—folks want to see what they’re looking at 
in a bit more detail. So if your CMS supports two views—an excerpt and a full view that 
appears when you click Read More—you should upload two versions of an image. The 
ﬁ rst version should be about 640 pixels wide and appear  after they click through, and the 
second, smaller image should appear on the front page.

 Videography 
 You might’ve noticed video taking over the world lately. That’s no exception with blogs, 
and you can give yourself a competitive edge by getting good at video shooting and edit-
ing. Mastering the medium of Internet video is not the same as becoming a polished 
broadcast TV producer, director, or editor. Rather than cinema-style visual effects and 
smooth voice-overs and sound effects, Internet video needs to feel real and immediate. 
On top of that, it needs to stand out from the crowd, and if you’re lucky, your concept 
could be original enough that the video could become viral, spreading across the world 
like wildﬁ re. 
 Aiding and abetting the twenty-ﬁ rst-century guerrilla video producer are smart-
phones and tiny cams, both so portable they can easily ﬁ t in a pocket, ready for you to 
whip them out at a second’s notice to shoot HD video, which you can then quickly place 
on YouTube for worldwide viewing. 
 Blogging Video Tips 
 When to Use Video 
 Some stories are tailor-made for video, while others don’t require it at all. It’s up to you 
to determine when video is the only way to cover a story. When movement is central 
to your story, that’s when it’s time to whip out the camcorder. For example, remote-
controlled helicopters, a new puppy, a dance technique, or a fashion show all cry out for 
video coverage.  Do not be afraid to shoot video . You can always edit it later, and even if it 
seems boring at ﬁ rst, a little background music and some clever cutting can create com-
pelling content. 
 When should you shoot video? 
 •  If you have the time.  Blogging is time-consuming, but video editing is  even more  time-
consuming. If you’re simply embedding video as you shot it, it won’t take long to 
produce, but if you’re getting into clever editing and quick cuts, it could take hours (or 
even days) to create a minute of ﬁ nished footage. 
 •  If you’re showing how to do something.  Demonstrations require video. You can show 
off a new device or piece of fashion, as well, using video. It’s much better than describ-
ing it. Run a cooking blog? Take a video of yourself cooking and show the ﬁ nished 
product. A bike blog? Show a few repair techniques. 
 Don’t Forget the Retina Displays 
 Pro Tip 
 Now that most new smartphones have higher-resolution displays, you’ll want 
to create graphics that take advantage of all that resolution. Graphics expert Aaron Chu, a 
web engineer at Huge in Brooklyn, says those high-resolution smartphones and iPhone Retina 
displays have at least twice the resolution of their predecessors. “WordPress users can certainly 
develop their own Javascript-based solution to implement responsive images, but there are also 
many WordPress plug-ins that allow users to optimize their images,” he said. Which plug-in would 
he recommend? “Out of the many plug-ins, I would recommend Picturefill. WordPress has it as a 
direct port from Scott Jehl’s original Picturefill.”

 •  If your topic is so complicated  that only a moving demo will do. This is similar to the 
previous reason but a bit more important. Perhaps you can’t  write what you want to 
show. You’ll  need to shoot video. 
 •  If you’re talking with a charismatic person.  If you have the opportunity to meet amaz-
ing people, take advantage of that fact. If they’re beautiful (on the inside or outside), 
video will bring out their humanity. 
 •  If you’re writing about an unusual experience.  Say you somehow ﬁ nagle a ride with 
the Blue Angels aboard an F/A-18 Hornet ﬁ ghter jet. Words won’t describe what that’s 
like, nor will still photos.  
 •  If your topic is sexy. Literally and ﬁ guratively, sex sells. 
 •  If there are animals involved. People love animals. Enough said. 
 •  If you’re attending a historic event. Enough said. 
 Ten Tips: How to Shoot Video 
 Shooting video is not as easy as it looks, and even though most people have tried their 
hand at being a videographer, few are proﬁ cient at it. If you can keep in mind a few basic 
concepts, your shooting will instantly improve. Follow these ten tips, and you’ll set your 
videos apart from the crowd: 
 Tip 1: Get in close.  The classic beginner mistake is to shoot a wide shot of a scene, 
forgetting that video is an inherently close-up medium. For instance, the beginner 
videographer will shoot a head-to-toe shot of a mom pushing a stroller. The profes-
sional gets in close on the baby’s face, framing the mother’s adoring face looking on 
in the background. Get in close, where the emotions happen. 
 Tip 2: Notice the background.  In the heat of shooting, you’re concentrating on your 
subjects, which happen to be in the foreground. You’re listening to what they’re 
saying, and watching what they’re doing. Only when you bring the footage back for 
editing do you notice that distracting or unattractive background you overlooked. 
We’ve worked with pro TV directors who seem to pay more attention to the back-
ground than the foreground, but strike a happy medium here. Find (or add) pleas-
ing colors for a background. Don’t place your subjects close to a brick wall, looking 
like they’re ready for the ﬁ ring squad. Watch out for trees or potted plants posi-
tioned behind your subject, which might look like they’re growing out of your video 
star’s head. 
 Making A Viral Video 
 Charlie once had four GPS units on hand, and wanted to do something 
goofy with them. First, he set up his camcorder on a tripod on the backseat floorboard of his car. 
Then, he stuck all the GPS units to the car’s windshield, flipped them on, entered a destination 
into all of them, and then started disobeying every command. They all erupted in a maelstrom 
of commands, bleating out “recalculating!” “Make a U-turn, if possible!” and so forth, all talking 
at once. He named the video “GPS Gang Bang” 1  placed it on YouTube, and 2.8 million views 
later, figured that counted as a viral video. By the way, we think the title helped, too. Think up 
something like that, and people will notice.

 Tip 3: Steady as she goes.  Whether you’re using a cellphone or a sophisticated video 
camera, ﬁ nd a way to mount it on a tripod, and short of that, hold your breath and 
lean against a wall to stabilize your shot. 
 Tip 4: Let there be light.  Get as much light on the subject as possible. The more light, 
the better your scenes will look, so carry a battery-operated light, set up lights 
whenever possible, or shoot in brightly lit areas. 
 Tip 5: Don’t forget the sound.  If you can afford it, clip a wireless mic onto whoever is 
speaking, and at the same time, capture the sounds of everything that’s happening 
in the scene with the mic that’s on your camera. You can mix the sounds together 
later, and it makes a huge difference. 
 Tip 6: Don’t move too much.  Before you reach for that zoom control, think about 
why you’re doing it. Do you really need to get a closer look at your subject? Or are 
you just playing around with that zoom because you can? Careful—your constant 
zooming in and out could get you accused of “tromboning.” If you can’t think of a 
really good reason to zoom or pan, don’t. Keep in mind that directors such as Spiel-
berg and Hitchcock have shot entire feature ﬁ lms without zooming one single time. 
If you must pan (moving from side-to-side; moving up or down is called a “tilt”), 
move slower than your instincts tell you to. Almost every beginner video has a pan 
that is so fast that it elicits laughter among the initiated. 
 Tip 7: Give them some headroom.  Don’t cut off your subjects’ heads when framing 
them in your viewﬁ nder. But don’t give them too much headroom, either, or you’ll 
end up with your subject appearing to be sitting in a hole with tons of space over 
his or her head. A telltale sign of a pro shooter’s work is the amount of headroom 
allowed. 
 Tip 8: Don’t shoot a puppet show.  If you’re shooting an interview, use a two-shot from 
the front sparingly. Concentrate on people’s faces, shot from as close to head-on 
as you can get. A shot of two people talking to each other, shot in proﬁ le, doesn’t 
resonate emotionally. We want faces. If it’s an interview situation, tell the interview 
subject not to look at the camera, but to look at the interviewer. Then position your 
camera almost behind the interviewer so you can see as much of the interviewee’s 
face as possible. After the interview’s over, you can get the interviewer to re-ask the 
questions, and then you can fake it later, joining questions and answers together 
when you edit. 
 Tip 9: Shoot more than you think you’ll need.  The pros call this “coverage,” where 
you’re providing a variety of angles that can be used when you edit. For some rea-
son, most people don’t feel like they need as much footage when they’re shoot-
ing as they actually end up needing when they’re editing. When you’re shooting 
a ﬂ ower, for instance, stay on that shot about ﬁ ve seconds longer than you think 
you’ll need. That way, you’ll have more options in the edit session. Allow yourself as 
many options as you have time to shoot. As my wise grandma used to say, “Better 
to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.” 
 Tip 10: Shoot for the edit.  If you’re creating a video that’s more than just one shot, 
think about how you’ll edit while you’re shooting. For instance, if your subject is 
talking about swimming, make the effort to get some shots (called “b-roll”) of peo-
ple swimming, or better yet, the subject swimming. And keep Tip 9 in mind for 
this one, too: Shoot a lot. Every edit session we’ve ever done over thirty years of 
broadcast experience has moments of serendipity, where we think of something

we hadn’t planned. And that’s usually the best part of the ﬁ nal product. Allow for 
these insights. Give yourself options. 
 Video Formats and Video Editing 
 Your choices of video formats are easier now than they were a few years ago. Your chosen 
camera will probably have a lot to do with whatever it is you have on hand, and chances 
are if you have a point-and-shoot still camera, you have video capability right there. The 
best news is that almost all video shooting equipment created in the past couple of years 
is digital and tapeless, and will be relatively simple to transfer from camera to computer 
for editing and ultimately upload to the web. 
 When you’re done with the shooting, you’ll need to learn how to narrow down all that 
footage into a consumable package of around a minute or two. Editing is relatively easy, 
too, where basic editing software is included with Macs and PCs. There are now excellent 
video editing packages available as apps for smartphones. You can even do video editing 
online, and quickly place those clips on YouTube. Just remember to keep it short and real. 
 Sometimes your situation will allow you only to shoot a quick video on a smartphone 
camcorder, and then immediately send it up to the web. But when you have more time, 
you could use a higher-quality camcorder that’s inside your point-and-shoot camera, or 
even use a dedicated video camcorder for your shooting. An advantage of that camcorder 
capability of your smartphone or point-and-shoot camera is that you’re more likely to 
have that device with you in any given situation. As the old adage goes, the best camera 
in the world is the one you have with you. 
 Once you get your video back to your computer, you can massage even mediocre 
footage into something that’s a lot better. You’d be surprised how complicated even the 
simplest video productions can get when you’re editing. After a while, you’ll be using 
advanced editing techniques, such as splitting the audio and the video, allowing you to 
show someone talking, then while that person’s still talking, cutting away to video of 
whatever it is that person’s talking about. Soon you’ll be correcting colors, adding way too 
many tacky transitions (don’t do that), and inserting infographics into your video footage 
(yes, do that). 
 That sounds like a lot to learn, but don’t worry. Even though the degree of sophistica-
tion you can bring to your video editing is nearly unlimited, we’ve found that video to be 
posted on YouTube, Vimeo, and other video-hosting websites works best if it’s simple. In 
our experience, we’ve tried bringing in sophisticated video editing, chromakeys (where 
a green or blue background screen is replaced by other video or images, like on weather 
broadcasts), lots of graphics, and multiscreen effects, and those videos didn’t do as well 
with the blog audience as a simple one- or two-shot video based on a kooky concept. 
Remember, ideas are more important than technique when it comes to shooting video 
for the web. 
 Quick Looks vs. Video Reviews 
 When you get a new product to review, or if you’ve heard someone say something news-
worthy and you’ve captured it on video, a quick look might be your best bet. When time 
is critical and you don’t want to be scooped by your competitors, simply put together a 
few video shots that cover the essence of the story, and send them up to the web so you 
can post them on your blog as soon as possible. However, if you’re covering a complicated

3
topic, or if you’re reviewing a more complex product where you’d like to explain most of 
its features and give the readers an in-depth look at its capabilities, edit together a video 
review that tells the whole story. 
 Video Interviews 
 For quick interviews, an informal style where you’re holding the camera pointed at 
your interview subject is probably the easiest and quickest way to go. For more impor-
tant interviews, shoot with two camcorders, one framed on your face and the other 
on your interviewee’s face, with you and your subject shot with a minimum of pro-
ﬁ le. That means, head-on, full face, from the front. This is a little more complicated, 
because you probably need to have two people running those cameras while you do 
the interview. 
 Because of video conferencing software such as Google Hangouts and Skype, online 
videos are getting easier to shoot. Now you can invite multiple interview subjects to join 
you on a Google Hangout On Air ( www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html ), 
each of you using a webcam, and everything’s broadcast publically and automatically 
recorded on your Google account. If you want to get even more sophisticated, you can use 
a technique called the “double-ender.” That’s where you and your interview subject can 
separately record your individual webcam videos, and you can combine the two shots 
later when you edit your video together. 
 Of course, these brief instructions are oversimpliﬁ ed, but you’d be surprised how 
much better your videos will look if you follow each instruction carefully. There are entire 
books and gigantic websites dedicated to effectively shooting and editing video, so be 
sure to frequent those; follow our basic suggestions here, add your own original ideas, 
and you’ll learn as you go. 
 Podcasting 
 Podcasting—namely, recording an audio-only program for distribution alongside (or in 
place of) your written content—is an effective way to gain readers. Most bloggers simply 
need a laptop with a built-in microphone and an audio editing program like GarageBand 
or Audacity to build a podcast. You can then upload the ﬁ nished product to SoundCloud 
or Libsyn, two podcast distribution services, and embed it in a post on your site. Heck, if 
you do a podcast we’ll even waive the 1,000-word rule for that day. 
 Here are a few tips for creating a cool podcast. 
 Use an External Microphone —We like Blue Microphones’ Yeti or Spark Digital because 
it offers excellent sound quality at an affordable price. You should also invest in a micro-
phone wind screen to keep you from “popping your Ps” when you talk into the micro-
phone. Look online for inexpensive screens. You can use your laptop’s internal mic but 
you’ll be surprised how great your projects can sound with a good external mic. 
 Add a Little Theme Music —Go to FreeMusicArchive.org to ﬁ nd a theme song. These 
songs are free to use for non-commercial purposes, but you should always credit the 
creator of the music. Use about twenty seconds of the music as you intro your show and 
close with the same snippet. This adds a bit of personality to your work. 
 Get Some Guests —The best way to record guests on your podcast is to record a Skype 
call using Call Recorder for OS X or the Evaer Skype Recorder program for Windows. Call 
your subject, set up a few guidelines, and just chat.

 Get on iTunes —Every podcast distribution system offers an RSS feed of your pod-
casts. Visit  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1819  on the Apple website to learn how to add 
your podcast to the iTunes mix. This allows people to search and ﬁ nd your podcast. 
 Make It Short —As exciting as we all think we are, no one has time for long podcasts. 
There are some exceptions, but we like to end our podcasts at between ﬁ fteen and thirty 
minutes. There is no reason to stretch things out unless you have an amazing topic or 
guest. Ignore this advice if you want, but remember that people are rarely patient when 
it comes to boring podcasts. 
 Publish at the Same Time Every Week —The best podcasts are published at the same 
time and same day every week. Why? People love the comfort of knowing that your pod-
cast will pop up on a certain day. They will begin to tune in and hunger for new episodes. 
There’s a reason, after all, that AMC doesn’t show  Mad Men  at odd times during the week. 
By broadcasting on a certain day, you create a habit and a buzz.

 Hello, World 
 This chapter is about launching your blog. Why are we putting this here instead of after 
all of the other skills necessary to run a blog? Because your launch is something you’ll 
need to think about long before you’re ready to put up your ﬁ rst post.  Like a restaurant 
holding a splashy debut, how you present yourself to the world is sometimes more 
important than your ﬁ rst few blog posts. 
 In this chapter we discuss creating a biography, creating a set of introductory posts, 
and understanding blog marketing. These are the ﬁ rst steps on a long journey and prob-
ably the most important. 
 Introducing Yourself 
 First, deﬁ ne yourself. If you’ve decided on a niche topic, you need to deﬁ ne the character-
istics that make you the best person for that job. Why are you the best yarn blogger out 
there? What makes you special enough to write about Hello Kitty all day? Is it ten years 
of fandom? The ability to knit a skullcap in three minutes? If someone wanted to contact 
you for a short biography, what would it contain? 
 Remember: Once you become a blogger on a certain topic, you become a  de facto 
expert. You need to back this up in your bio. Your readers will initially come to you for 
a few simple reasons. These include, but are not limited to, your experience in the ﬁ eld, 
your skill at describing the vagaries of that ﬁ eld, and your readability. 
 Face it: most “enthusiast” websites, while thorough, are bafﬂ ing. Tech websites, until 
the rise of sites such as  Gizmodo  and  CrunchGear , were almost unreadable. They were 
usually forums full of technophiles yelling at each other over minutiae and scaring away 
“n00bs” in an effort to look plugged-in and cool. However, blogging plugs  everyone  in, noob 
or old, young or geriatric, die-hard fan or dilettante. Your goal is to offer the reader a win-
dow into a specialized world that is at once simple and complex. 
 Turn no one away. Remember that today’s bafﬂ ed forum readers are your future blog 
fans. There is a lot to be said for a solid curatorial instinct. 
 Your goal in this chapter is to prepare a one-minute introduction. This introduction 
allows you to deﬁ ne yourself as a writer in one minute or less by explaining:

 Why what you do is important 
 Think of your bio as something a reporter or reader will use to guide his research. You 
need to seem like someone worth reading and talking to. Let’s, then, begin with a bio. 
 Here’s John’s: 
 I live in Brooklyn, NY, and write about technology, security, gadget, 
gear, wristwatches, and the Internet. After spending four years as an 
IT programmer, I switched gears and became a full-time journalist. My 
work has appeared in  The New York Times ,  Laptop ,  PC Upgrade ,  Surge , 
 Gizmodo ,  Men’s Health ,  InSync ,  Linux Journal ,  Popular Science , and 
 Sync , and I’ve written a book called  Black Hat: Misﬁ ts, Criminals, and 
Scammers in the Internet Age . 
 I am currently East Coast editor of TechCrunch.com, and I run the BWL 
family of blogs, SlushPile.net and WristWatchReview.com. I also run 
the HourTime Podcast with Ariel Adams.  
 Note these lines: 
 I live in Brooklyn, NY, and write about technology, security, gadget, 
gear, wristwatches, and the Internet.  
 and 
 After spending four years as an IT programmer, I switched gears and 
became a full-time journalist.  
 These lines deﬁ ne you to readers. The ﬁ rst describes what you write about, the sec-
ond why you’re uniquely qualiﬁ ed to write about that topic. For example, you could say: 
 Joe lives in the Great North Woods and writes about cooking and kitchen 
gear. He worked as a cook for a spell in New York, London, and Beijing 
and then settled down with his wife and family and now runs a restau-
rant in Rutland, Vermont. This is his blog about running a Thai/Swedish 
Fusion restaurant in granola country.  
 Or 
 Sally writes about Manga and Anime. She lives in Tokyo and has been an 
avid reader of the form for twenty of her twenty-nine years.  
 Or 
 Joe is a mechanic by day and gamer by night. He loves racing games—
every single one of them, from  Pole Position to  Gran Turismo —and will 
rap you on the head with a ratchet if you make fun of  Gran Trak 10.

 As you see, these are a mix of mirth and cold hard fact. Your niche should ﬂ ow directly 
into your bio and explain why, exactly, you are the man or woman for the job. 
 Here’s a quick work-sheet to help you build your bio. 
 Make a set of lists, each one noting three pertinent aspects of your CV. 
 Work/Educational Experience 
 A list of pertinent jobs/degrees 
 Play Experience 
 A list of pertinent hobbies 
 Location History 
 Something to give you character and encourage local news to pick up your story 
 Notable Facts 
 Things about you no one knows, also pertinent to the mission 
 Pick the most interesting to use in the ﬁ rst sentence of your bio (for a blog about 
werewolves: “Frank  has been working as a costume designer  for four years in  Portland 
and loves werewolf movies”), the second most interesting things in the second sentence 
(“ Since studying drama at Carnegie Mellon , birthplace to Sam Romero’s ﬁ rst movies, 
and  catching the horror bug , he has  been collecting werewolf memorabilia and costume 
components ”). The third sentence sums up the blog (“This blog is about his unnatural 
obsession with the hairy and scary”). 
 Crafting a good bio is the ﬁ rst step in deﬁ ning yourself as a blogger. Think of this biog-
raphy as the ﬁ rst thing people will see when they search for your niche on Google. You 
are the face of this topic. 
 Producing Intro Posts 
 Before you launch your blog, you should create a group of sample posts. Make the blog 
look like an ongoing concern, populated with numerous stories. Many of these can be 
evergreen, meaning they need not be immediately newsy. Evergreen posts are sort of 
“freebies,” features that live outside of the normal news cycle. As in our werewolf exam-
ple, a few evergreen posts would include: 
 Top 10 Werewolf Movies 
 Scariest Werewolf Snouts 
 How Did They Film Teen Wolf? 
 Rrrawr: What the Stars Would Look Like as Werewolves 
 Create a list of ﬁ ve of these and prepare them before launch. Your ﬁ rst post, however, 
should introduce yourself and your mission. It should describe your mission.

 Hello, and welcome to the latest CrunchNetwork blog, CrunchGear.com, 
a daily journal of all things gadget-tastic. Our goal is to take a 
long, hard look at the daily gadget grind and separate the wheat—the 
gear we will actually buy and that will actually reach our shores—
from the chaff. Every day we hope to bring a digest of the hottest 
tech stories and intelligent and informed commentary on the industry 
as a whole. 
 No greasy kid stuff here—this is all meat. We have a great boss 
(Mr. Arrington—heckuva guy), a great team and a great mission—to bring 
you the next-generation tech that will keep you connected, enter-
tained, and educated. We have a great global audience—you—and you’re 
the folks to whom we’re going to deliver our daily missives from the 
heart of gadgetopia. 
 We have one request: if you work at a tech company, please add us to 
your PR list ASAP. If you are releasing a product, email us a high-res 
image of the device and a spec sheet at the very instant you launch. 
Our press release and tips email is tips at crunchgear dot com. If 
you’re a super-secret spy in the house of tech, please send tips and 
rumors to the same address. 
 That said, let’s get started. If there’s something you’d like to see 
or just feel lonely, drop us a line or AIM me. 
 Here we go. Let’s have some fun. 
 Take a look at the structure we used for this post. It is fairly basic, consisting of: 
 Intro —What’s going on here? 
 Bio —Who is running this joint? 
 What? —What’s going on at this site? How often will you post? How quickly will things 
be updated? 
 Why? —Why should you return? 
 Closer —Something fun and personal. This is your letter to the world. 
 When you start your blog, publish four or ﬁ ve new posts from your evergreen pile 
and then post your intro. The evergreen content we discussed earlier will make a 
great bit of “padding” for readers to enjoy while they’re getting used to your style and 
schedule.  
 Writing Your Contact Page 
 Short and sweet is key for the “Contact Us” page of your blog. Always have a tips@[your 
domain] email address available to readers, and you can also include pertinent contact 
details for PR professionals and general website questions. If you don’t want to craft an 
entirely new “contact” page, simply cut and paste your intro post onto this page.

 Building a Social Media Presence 
 Now that you’ve got your ﬁ rst few posts up, you have to tell the world what you hath 
wrought. Social media should not be your only means of spreading the news about your 
new site. You can’t just Tweet yourself into existence. Social media is a means to an end. 
 Social media has become a powerful engine for promoting your blog. In fact, if you’re 
not tweeting and posting on Facebook about your content, you don’t exist on today’s 
Internet. It’s that important. If you haven’t already, you should make it one of your main 
missions to build up your Twitter following, beef up your friend count on Facebook, and 
add people to your LinkedIn network. 
 In this section, we will show you how we’ve done these difﬁ cult feats on  TechCrunch 
and  Mashable . We’ll describe the tools we use to maintain our presences on those social 
media platforms. Most importantly, we’ll give you tips for leveraging social media to 
address your audience, promote your content, and make people feel good about you and 
your blog. 
 Twitter 
 This microblogging platform has become ubiquitous among journalists, denizens of the 
Internet, and anyone who wants to ﬁ nd out what’s happening in the world as quickly as 
possible. 
 Before you get started, learn the basic rules of Twitter. The platform works in speciﬁ c 
ways that are not immediately evident. For example, when you’re replying to an indi-
vidual, start with that person’s Twitter handle, like so: “@charlie_white, I agree with you 
100% on that.” By designating that person’s handle, that tweet won’t be seen on the feed 
of everyone who’s following you on Twitter, but can be seen by the person you’re address-
ing it to. If you want everyone to see your reply to that person, place one character before 
the @ symbol, such as a period, like this: “.@charlie_white, I agree with you 100% on that.” 
Then it will be seen by all your followers. 
 When someone addresses you by your Twitter handle, you can see the message in the 
“Connect” section of the Twitter site on the web, Tweetdeck, other Twitter software, or one 
of the many Twitter mobile apps. If you address a Twitter message to two people (such as 
@charlie_white @johnbiggs), it’s like setting up a conversation between the three of you. 
Keep in mind that those tweets are semi-private—if someone visits your individual Twit-
ter account, all those tweets will be visible. But they won’t be automatically sent to the 
main Twitter feed of everyone following you on Twitter. These are the most basic rules 
of the road with Twitter. Online, you can get exquisitely detailed information and advice 
about Twitter, and we advise you to do so before you dive in. 
 Once you have the rules down, keep in mind that this is  social media, so be social. 
Reply to tweets that interest you, especially when you have something to add. When 
you initiate your own tweets, tweet about not only your own content—you don’t want to 
become known as just a promoter of yourself—but also other articles and posts you ﬁ nd 
fascinating. If you have a sudden ﬂ ash of insight, tweet it. Just like in the world of inter-
personal relationships, on Twitter, to make friends you have to  be a friend. 
 Join the conversation. If everyone is talking about, say, the Super Bowl, ﬁ nd out what 
the hashtag for the Super Bowl is (for instance, #superbowl2014), tweet something inter-
esting or insightful about the Super Bowl, and include that hashtag. Reply to other’s

Hello, World

comments about the Super Bowl. Get involved, and you will be noticed. The more involved 
you are, the higher you’ll see your follower count go. 
 By the way, hashtags used to be placed on every tweet, but lately they’ve become 
more specialized, useful only in a situation where there is a particular event going on, 
and you want to tweet about that speciﬁ c event. In some ways, hashtags are redundant, 
because you can still search tweets and ﬁ nd your keywords without using hashtags. In 
the modern world of Twitter, hashtags are most useful when referring to an ongoing and 
speciﬁ c event. 
 Sometimes, you’ll be tempted to write a story on your blog, but it might be better 
suited to the 140 characters of a Tweet. If you don’t have anything more than 140 charac-
ters to say about a topic, go ahead and tweet about it. Such a pithy and compact missive 
might be exactly what you need to make your point and show people that you’re insight-
ful and interesting—and worth following. 
 We’ll have more about promoting your site using Twitter in  Chapter 8 . 
 •  Google Hangouts —Google’s Hangouts (formerly called Chat) application is gaining 
traction as well. It’s increasingly popular with those who use Gmail.  Mashable  uses it 
all the time, and gets a lot of good use out of its “off the record” feature where there’s 
less risk in typing passwords and sensitive information to each other because they’re 
not logged and potentially accessible to hackers. 
 •  Facebook page —A Facebook page is different from an individual account. It lets you do 
more sophisticated advertising for posts, and gives your blog a presence on Facebook 
that is separate from your personal account. Feel free to start a Facebook page for your 
blog, but don’t worry about updating it at ﬁ rst. Without more of an audience, a Face-
book page can be pretty barren. For now, you can paste links of your best stories into 
your personal Facebook feed (you do have a Facebook account, don’t you? No? Get one, 
now). As your blog gains popularity, Facebook will become a powerful promotion tool. 
Then, you can also use it for instant messaging—Facebook’s on-board chat tool is gain-
ing a lot of traction lately. Once you begin to get more people liking your Facebook page, 
you might want to consider boosting posts by advertising. We’ll address strategies for 
Facebook promotion of your posts and advertising posts on Facebook later in this book. 
 •  LinkedIn account —LinkedIn is not as strong for promoting your blog as Facebook or 
Twitter, but it’s excellent for promoting yourself. If you’re not already on LinkedIn, 
we’d suggest you open an account and start linking with people you know. Build up 
your proﬁ le so all can see what you’ve accomplished, while promoting your blog at the 
same time. Once you develop a network of those both inside and outside the blogo-
sphere, you’ll be surprised how often people contact you with job offers, useful infor-
mation, and serious networking opportunities. 
 Crystal Ponti, whose successful MommiFried blog ( http://mommifried.com/ ) is among 
the best “mommy blogs” we’ve seen, uses LinkedIn to her advantage. She suggests that 
you “create a killer proﬁ le that includes who you are, what you’ve done and where you’ve 
done it. Make sure you include your blog as part of your resume, with an active link.” She 
discourages linking with every single person who contacts you. “Consider each connec-
tion a link in a very long chain,” she said. “Weak links do nothing to support or enhance 
your network or professional opportunities.” Armed with a strong network, then you can 
post updates on LinkedIn that will help to promote your blog. Once you’ve assembled a 
network of people you actually know, Ponti suggests, “post regular updates including a

63
mix of your own work (blog posts) and also third-party content that your speciﬁ c network 
will ﬁ nd relevant and useful.” She also recommends joining groups and participating in 
discussions, and adds, “when possible, reference material that you’ve produced.” 
 Here are some other accounts you’ll need at ﬁ rst:  
 •  YouTube account —This is the simplest and easiest way to make your videos instantly 
available. The only caveat is that you cannot under any circumstances upload video 
that could be misconstrued as infringing on anyone’s copyright. Doing this could result 
in your account being closed, and as a result, you’ll lose control of your videos. If pos-
sible, keep copies of all videos you upload on your own machine. Another advantage of 
YouTube is that you can upload HD video, and unlike other video sites such as Vimeo, 
you can enjoy unlimited pageviews free of charge. Best of all, if one of your videos gets 
popular, YouTube will start putting ads at the beginning and superimposed over that 
video, and you get to share the proﬁ ts. 
 •  Google Analytics —This is a free web-based application that shows your site’s trafﬁ c, 
visitor engagement, and lets you know where your visitors are coming from. This is 
an invaluable tool that will let you watch your trafﬁ c grow. Go to google.com/analytics 
and follow the instructions for adding analytics to your account.  
 Here are a couple of accounts you  won’t need at ﬁ rst:  
 •  Any other analytics provider—Until your trafﬁ c hits quadruple-digit visits daily, you 
probably don’t need more complex analytics tools. Keep it simple at ﬁ rst. 
 •  Any other image or video hosting service—Host images on your own server. Do not 
host images on any other system simply because of the current vagaries of the mar-
ket. You want control over your content. If an image hosting service shuts down you 
may be stuck with a set of empty pages and little to show for your work. 
 •  Any other social networks—Do you focus on design or fashion? You’d better have a 
Pinterest account. This service is designed with speciﬁ c goals in mind, and you should 
use them accordingly. For example, Ariel Adams’s  A Blog to Watch  features a Pinterest 
page and ways to pin pictures of famous and expensive watches to Pinterest. This is 
intrinsically important to him. It may not be that important to someone writing about, 
say, entrepreneurs. 
 Dangers of Social Media 
 Don’t let Twitter be a part of your 1,000 words a day. Social media is, in a word, addictive. 
Hanging out on Facebook all day does not a blogger make. It may be fun to connect with 
friends and potential readers on social media services, but what you’re really doing is 
procrastinating. No good work is ever done on social networks. They are tools for expand-
ing your reach and presence. They shouldn’t be your primary medium of communication. 
 Social media is secondary to your goal as a blogger. We’ve seen too many people 
sucked into mundane conversations on Facebook while avoiding real work. To some 
social media is a calling. To you it’s something to do when you have a few minutes. 
 Three Rules for Spreading the Word 
 Be nice but human.  Your feed is your public face. Be nice but human. Endlessly perky 
quotes and “Go get ’em” commentary is grating. Be human. Talk about issues. Ask ques-
tions. Discuss news. But try to be nice.

 Don’t ﬂ ood the feed.  We’d recommend creating a separate account for only your blog 
posts—try Twitterfeed.com to connect your blog’s RSS feed to Twitter. This will Tweet your 
stories automatically to an account dedicated to your site. Your personal feed should 
contain select stories with a bit of commentary to make them interesting. For example, 
John’s feed, @johnbiggs, consists of dumb jokes and banter with some posts thrown in. 
The @techcrunch feed consists only of posts. 
 Don’t feed the trolls.  Some social media users will hassle you, complain about you, 
and say you’re doing something wrong. Ignore them. Connecting with a troll is exactly 
what they’re looking for. Interaction should be respectful and if it isn’t, drop the call.

 What to Write About 
 Now that you know how much you need to be posting, let’s discuss  what  you need to be 
posting. There are millions of blogs now in existence, so your mission will be to convince 
your readers to bypass most of those other blogs and come directly to yours. Why would 
they do that? Because they can get original content from you, in your own voice, and in 
your own style, which they will  like . Your original content is something that’s sitting on 
your blog—something they can’t get anywhere else. It’s your job to consistently deliver 
that new stuff every day. 
 Therein lies the problem, dear blogger. There is only a limited amount of new stuff 
every day, and most of your competitors probably know about the most exciting items, 
too. That’s why you’re going to have to make the news  new . Make it yours and add your 
perspective, getting to the heart of what’s really going on, not only on the surface but 
underneath, around, and through every topic you tackle. 
 Here’s a little secret:  Most bloggers are ﬁ nding news items on the web, and then 
rewriting those stories with their own byline at the top. That has worked just ﬁ ne for 
the past half of a decade, but things are changing. What you might call “paraphrasing” is 
what’s known as “content creation” in some circles and “lazy blogging” in others. To be 
clear, it’s still a valid strategy, but it’s not an ideal one. 
 This is where you need to go further than simply paraphrasing news, not just rewrit-
ing stories but ﬁ nding more, fresh information, and adding your own opinions to the 
mix. If the story of the day is a major rally on Wall Street or a revolutionary change at 
a famous restaurant, ﬁ gure out what you can do to gather just a bit more than your 
competitors. Compare and contrast the various points of the story with other concepts 
or products that have come before, and explain what’s really new about it, and what’s 
just a rehash of other stories you’ve reported. Link to those earlier stories you’ve writ-
ten, which is as good for enhancing your pageview numbers as it is for adding context 
to your story. 
 This is not to say there isn’t room for “straight” industry news. Straight news—the act 
of reporting a few simple facts—can be valuable to readers of certain blogs. A blog about 
publishing would be remiss in ignoring the big book deal of the day, and a blog about 
bikes would be useless if it didn’t at least include the latest news from Cannondale and 
Specialized.

 There is a huge misconception about blogs: You see it at least once a week, where 
people who have just started reading blogs make comments such as, “Why do you insert 
your opinion into this news?” and “This is biased!” Another expectation is that you report 
the news objectively. So why not be a “just the facts, ma’am” reporter when you’re telling 
us the story? We’ll tell you why—because the list of objective facts can be told only once, 
and that list is probably already being recounted dozens of times.  Commentary is great 
when it’s backed up by a steady stream of fact.  Yes, you’ll need to state at least  some of 
those facts quickly and concisely (and link to all the details for the beneﬁ t of your more 
curious readers), but you’ll need to differentiate yourself by going a few steps further. 
 Journalism as we know it is changing, but that doesn’t mean the old methods are no 
longer viable. Online journalism, as opposed to mainstream “old-fashioned” journalism, 
is characterized by a few deﬁ ning and important factors: 
 •  Lack of access —Most posts  are  built on other posts. This means that you may not 
have access to the original source, and therefore are depending on hearsay or “reliable 
sources.” Sadly, these reliable sources are actually shrinking, giving rise to unreliable 
stories based on, ironically, blog posts and tweets. 
 •  Quick and dirty —In the “old days,” newspapers ran through a full gamut of fact check-
ing and copy editing systems put in place to ensure that the publishers didn’t get sued. 
These failsafe measures are gone. You, if you’re a lone blogger, will not have a “word 
nerd” sitting in a room sipping coffee and reading your pages. Instead, you will have 
angry readers who complain about every typo. Be aware of this and proofread. Read, 
re-read, and re-re-read every story you write before publishing. Make it quick and  clean . 
 •  Readability —New journalism requires readability. This can mean the posts are short 
and quick, or the posts are long and full of detail and opinion. Either way, there is some 
research required to gather the “nut” of the story, and the shell is formed of your own 
opinions or experience. 
 Old and New 
 This is not to say the traditional “news pyramid” is dead. The news pyramid consists of a 
few basic rules that state, in short, that the ﬁ ve Ws—who, what, where, when, and why—
appear in the “lede,” or ﬁ rst paragraph (this newsroom slang is spelled “lede” to avoid con-
ﬂ ict with another publishing term, “leading,” or the distance between lines of type) and the 
most important detail appears in a “nut graf” in the second or third paragraph position. Just 
in case you’re not hip to this newsy  patois , remember that newspaper editors usually use 
the word “hed” for headline and “graf” for paragraph, along with the aforementioned “lede.” 
 For example: 
 HED: 
 AT&T and RIM Release the Blackberry Torch, a Social Media Phone Running OS 6 
 LEDE: 
 Today in New York, RIM released the Blackberry Torch for AT&T’s network, a new 
smartphone with touchscreen and keyboard. 
 NUT: 
 The phone marks RIM’s ﬁ rst foray into social media with the addition of OS 6, a new 
operating system that adds RSS and Twitter functionality.

 Here you see three important bits of information, the hed, the lede, and the nut graf, 
arrayed in easy-to-read order. The following is an actual report on Lincoln’s death written 
in 1865. It is one of the earliest examples of the  inverted pyramid style: 
 This evening at about 9:30 p.m. at Ford’s Theatre, the President, while 
sitting in his private box with Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Harris and Major 
Rathburn, was shot by an assassin, who suddenly entered the box and 
approached behind the President. 
 The assassin then leaped upon the stage, brandishing a large dagger 
or knife, and made his escape in the rear of the theatre. 
 The pistol ball entered the back of the President’s head and pen-
etrated nearly through the head. The wound is mortal. 
 The President has been insensible ever since it was inﬂ icted, and is 
now dying. 
 About the same hour an assassin, whether the same or not, entered 
Mr. Seward’s apartment and under pretense of having a prescription was 
shown to the Secretary’s sick chamber. The assassin immediately rushed 
to the bed and inﬂ icted two or three stabs on the chest and two on the 
face. It is hoped the wounds may not be mortal. My apprehension is that 
they will prove fatal. 
 The nurse alarmed Mr. Frederick Seward, who was in an adjoining 
room, and he hastened to the door of his father’s room, when he met 
the assassin, who inﬂ icted upon him one or more dangerous wounds. The 
recovery of Frederick Seward is doubtful. 
 It is not probable that the President will live through the night. 
 General Grant and his wife were advertised to be at the theatre . . .  
 To be clear we’re not trying to make you an AP reporter (but that is a noble goal to 
which to strive). But when you pay attention to the stylistic techniques used for more 
than a century by reporters around the world, you become a better writer. 
 Rules are made to be broken. Straight news is often boring and does not grab readers. 
However, before you ﬁ nd your voice, we’d advise you to let straight news be your guide 
until you feel conﬁ dent enough to try your hand at more adventuresome writing. 
 Need to Know 
 After that ﬁ rst paragraph of the inverted pyramid style, the rest is, in many cases, 
detail, seen as marginal but equally valid. Bang out the ﬁ rst paragraph as accurately 
as possible and then work magic with the rest of the story. Add context that only you 
know. Add your opinion, stating your position on the story’s place in the great river of 
content ﬂ owing through this strange world of your niche. Bring the story into context 
in the grand scheme of things. Why is this news important? Why should your readers 
care? 
 The job of a successful blogger is to convey the facts about a story, and start a con-
versation. You can get your readers ﬁ red up—maybe even start an argument—simply by 
writing. This is not merely inciting a mob, though. Readers will see right through some

cheap-shot post designed just to lure comments at the bottom of the page. Readers will, 
however, react to a well-reasoned stand you take on a particular topic. 
 That’s why you need to take special care not to write a bunch of hurried nonsense. 
Readers will cry out that you need to “do your research,” and many will become so frus-
trated with your lack of knowledge about a topic that they’ll never come back. So, yes, you 
need to know all the available facts of a particular story, giving you a basis upon which to 
state your opinions. In turn, that entices your readers to state their opinions, and boom! 
You’ve started a mega-conversation. 
 What is news? Does it have to be new?  That depends entirely on how you’re going to 
write your blog post. For instance, if the latest iPhone was introduced yesterday morning 
and you write a blog post today acting like no one’s heard about it yet, you won’t capture 
the interest of many readers, especially gadget aﬁ cionados. However, if you write that 
post a day after the iPhone’s introduction telling people why they don’t need this new 
iPhone, explaining why they won’t miss anything if they keep their old one, and give 
them some perspective about how unimportant its new features are and why there are 
plenty of other phones that can do the same thing, you have yourself a “Day Two” story. 
 Many will say bloggers aren’t journalists. In fact, one prominent writer, Chris Hedges, 
calls the entire industry a sham: 
 It has been replaced by Internet creations that mimic journalism. Good reporters, like good 
copy editors or good photographers, who must be paid and trained for years while they learn 
the trade, are becoming as rare as blacksmiths. Stories on popular sites are judged not by the 
traditional standards of journalism but by how many hits they receive, how much Internet 
trafﬁ c they generate, and how much advertising they can attract. News is irrelevant. Facts 
mean little. Reporting is largely nonexistent. 1 
 Hedges, as magniﬁ cent as he is at his job, is simply wrong. The “training” he’s talking 
about happens in blogging. His complaint smacks of elitism. His argument—that journal-
ists need long years of training—sounds like an older journalist complaining that the 
reporters at a community newspaper (with its wispy coverage of parades and school 
boards) aren’t doing real “reporting.” 
 And it’s important to note that advertising pays his salary. In short, the next Chris 
Hedges or Walter Cronkite or E. B. White will come from the realm of blogging, a place 
where advertising can still pay salaries and the practice of journalism as an art is still 
prized. 
 Bloggers are practicing journalism just as ballet dancers are practicing dance. There 
are many disciplines inside the umbrella of each deﬁ ned activity. It’s our mission to teach 
you how to be a good blogger, not a newspaper-era reporter. The expectations, the con-
text, and the readership are different for both, and the distinction is real. But the mission 
is the same: to inform and entertain. 
 We must also make a distinction between blogging for fun and blogging for proﬁ t. 
While we don’t like to come down on either side of the “What is blogging?” debate, our 
goal is to make you a readable and successful blogger, not someone who is good at writ-
ing about stuff that interests you and you alone. Your goal is to gather readers by covering 
a niche. You can do it for free or you can do it professionally, but you must do it with a 
mindset of maximizing reader utility.

 How to Decide What Matters to Your Readers 
 Try to think about why your readers should give a damn about what you’re writing, and 
try to picture them asking,  “ Why should I care? ” Tell them why they should care. How-
ever, all the logic, reason, and cleverness in the world won’t make a bit of difference if the 
topics you’re choosing don’t matter to your readers. 
 Try to picture your readers in your mind’s eye. Remember they don’t have the dedi-
cation to a topic you do, but they might understand it more deeply and completely than 
you. Be prepared to defend your work in the public sphere, and more importantly, be 
aware that there are some readers who just won’t be placated. 
 Sometimes, it’s not that hard. If you have good news sense, what interests you will 
interest your readers. But that’s not always the case. When you’re ﬁ rst starting out, it’s 
going to be tricky to ﬁ gure out exactly what your readers want. But as you go along, pay 
close attention to which stories give you the most trafﬁ c, and then you’ll get a better 
sense of your readers’ interests. 
 Finding News 
 Before you write anything, you’re going to need to ﬁ nd out what’s going on. There are so 
many websites blasting out news every day, you might think it’s impossible to gather it all 
in one place, make sense of it, and sort through what’s news and what isn’t. Thankfully, 
that’s gotten a whole lot easier than you might think. There are speciﬁ c tools created for 
just this purpose, and you’ll need to use them every day, making sure you’re aware of 
what’s happening in the real world, giving you a solid foundation upon which to write 
your own original material. 
 RSS 
 You might already be using an RSS reader, but if you’re not, let us ﬁ ll you in: RSS stands 
for Really Simple Syndication, and it’s an essential tool for bloggers. An RSS reader allows 
you to create your own personal collection of news sources that you can quickly dive into, 
alleviating the need for hunting and clicking through hundreds of websites. Best of all, 
you can sort the various news items from your chosen sources according to when they 
were published, letting you see only the freshest news. When you ﬁ rst use an RSS reader, 
you quickly realize you’ve lashed yourself onto a tool that turns you into a superhuman 
newshound. This tool is so important for blogging that if you’re not using an RSS reader, 
you’re at a tremendous disadvantage. 
 There are a variety of RSS readers available, and most are free. Most RSS readers let you 
easily identify and then sort through stories you’re interested in covering. Most let you 
place a star on the stories you deem worthy of further investigation, and then later 
you can list only the starred stories you’ve culled from the herd. 
 We mourn the loss of Google Reader, summarily discontinued by the search giant 
with no reason given, but celebrate the crowd of newsreaders that arose in its absence. 
One of our favorite survivors that sprang up just in time for Google Reader’s demise is 
Digg Reader, built by the same group that brought us the once-powerful (and now faded 
but still alive) source of crowd news-picking wisdom, Digg.

 The Digg Reader gives you a rough approximation of the features of Google Reader, 
and lets you import all your settings from Google Reader, too. Sign up for an account, 
and you can access Digg Reader and your settings anywhere, and you can mark your 
favorite stories to read later. There are iOS and Android apps for Digg Reader, giving you 
the same features you get on the browser version. The service even shows you which 
stories in your feeds are most popular on Digg, but that’s of limited usefulness at this 
writing. Even so, it’s a useful RSS reader, and includes the most powerful features for our 
purposes. 
 That’s just the beginning of the RSS reader story, though. Since Google Reader dis-
appeared, dozens of replacements have appeared, and many that already existed have 
been improved. They are sprouting so quickly and gaining so many new features that it’s 
beyond the scope of this book to evaluate all of the components of this fast-moving train 
of development and innovation. We advise you to search for the latest reviews and opin-
ions about the readers, and pick the one that best ﬁ ts your style. 
 One key point: Don’t miss out on RSS readers and get all your news from Twitter. 
While Twitter can give you the news quickest, RSS feeds accelerate your overall news-
gathering power, showing you more stories in less time than any other tool. 
 How to Select Sites for RSS 
 Regardless of which RSS reader you choose, the most important task you’ll ﬁ rst need to 
do is select the sites you’ll visit every day when you’re looking for news. You probably 
already have a good idea of which sites are the market leaders in your chosen topic area. 
Place those sites in your newsreader (or in newsreader parlance,  subscribe  to the sites). 
You’ll soon discover that the blogosphere is aptly named, where there is an intercon-
nected web of sites covering the same topic. These will be your competitors, and this is 
the environment against which you’ll differentiate your own blog. 
 A superﬁ cial roundup of top sites is not going to be enough, though. Your search 
for the ideal sources has just begun. You’ll need to go way beyond just using the same 
sources your competitors do. Search your topic, and ﬁ nd your own group of sources you 
like, probing deep within your area of expertise for blogs that might be less well known 
but on their way up. Sometimes offbeat sources can provide you with powerful and origi-
nal news tips that haven’t been beaten to death on all the other blogs yet. 
 Begin by ﬁ guring out which blogs are your favorites. Then follow those blogs to see 
which sources they link to. Then follow the sites those sites link to. Repeat  ad inﬁ nitum . 
Are you writing about interior decoration? You’ll need to read tech blogs to see what the 
latest TVs are. Are you writing about food? You’d better be subscribing to liquor and cigar 
blogs as well. Create a constellation of information on which you can depend daily. 
 You can also ask friends and co-workers which news sources they tend to use and 
enjoy. By hand-picking news sources and adding them to your newsreader list, you’ll ﬁ nd 
that you have quite a collection of blogs and websites from which to gather your news. 
 Looking for the best sources will be an ongoing project for you. We’ve noticed that 
the best bloggers are constantly reﬁ ning and adding new sources to their lists of sites. 
Building a strong list of sites for your RSS feed will be an illuminating quest. It will give 
you a feel for the lay of the land, determining who the big dogs are and who the followers 
are. As you build your RSS subscription list to its peak of reﬁ nement, keep it conﬁ dential, 
especially from your competitors. That’s proprietary information—guard it with your life.

The sites where we’ve worked consider their lists of sites trade secrets, constantly reﬁ n-
ing them to a keen edge. 
 Our absolute favorite news sources are industry websites like Eurekalert and blogs 
that cover speciﬁ c topics. If you read other blogs, all you’re going to be doing is reading 
the same stories over and over again. If you read industry sources you will learn some-
thing new every time. 
 Hopefully, one day soon, all those sites you’re evaluating will be adding  your site to  their 
lists! By the way, your lists can be freely exchanged between your colleagues, exported 
from RSS readers in the OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) ﬁ le format. 2 
 Building Your RSS Feed 
 Let’s put this site hunt into action. How do you build your own OPML ﬁ le? There are many 
ways to use an RSS reader, but we’ve developed a method that enhances its efﬁ ciency, 
grouping sites in a hierarchy where we can grab the top stories quickly and then go more 
in-depth after we’ve covered the most important stories of the day. 
 For this method to work well, you need to ﬁ rst become intimately familiar with the 
best sources for your topic area. Let’s start with those two or three sites you’ve chosen for 
your RSS feed as market leaders, those that consistently break news ﬁ rst and cover your 
topic in the most comprehensive way. 
 In your RSS reader, subscribe to those top sites, and then create a new folder, which 
most RSS readers will let you do (and if yours doesn’t, ﬁ nd another one). Name that folder 
something meaningful like Top Sites (Charlie named his Engagzmodo, after his top sites 
for tech), drag your chosen sites into the folder, and you’re ready to go. 
 Now, when you start your workday, you can simply select that top folder with your 
two hottest sites, and on the right side of your RSS reader you’ll immediately see the top 
twenty or thirty stories the two sites have published since you ﬁ nished working the day 
before. It’s fast—this will give you a quick look at any breaking stories, especially if you’ve 
picked sites that stay on top of the news every minute. 
 Every RSS reader has a way to bookmark stories for later reading (Digg Reader calls it 
“saving” stories), so select stories you deem post-worthy, and then after you’ve ﬁ nished 
your preliminary story search, you 
can quickly bring forth a list of your 
chosen items with a single click. 
 Once you’ve determined those 
top two or three sites, then ﬁ nd and 
subscribe to the next-best twenty-
ﬁ ve sites that have proven to be good 
sources of stories and news. Create 
a separate folder for them, and that 
will be your second group of news 
stories to scan each morning. 
 After you’ve created those two 
top tiers, create a third tier of the 
next ﬁ fty most reliable and credible 
sites, and then a bottom tier with all 
the rest, placing each of those groups

into its own folders as well. Any time you want to know what the absolute latest stories 
are, click on All Items, and at the top of the list will be the newest stories of all the sites 
in your RSS feed. 
 Twitter 
 Don’t just stick with Google when you’re searching for the latest happenings, because 
Twitter often gives you more immediate and targeted results. The microblogging service 
has gone way beyond people just using 140 characters to tell us what they had for break-
fast. Now it’s a gigantic forum where people point to hot stories, and it’s all-searchable. 
It’s a powerful, real-time link-fest that lets you put your ﬁ ngers on the pulse of the popu-
lace. Yes, here’s a near-perfect tool for the up-to-the-minute blogger. 
 The way to get the most out of Twitter as a blogger is a two-pronged attack. First, you 
must follow the right people. However, that’s easier said than done, and Twitter experts 
say that curating the list of people you follow on Twitter is something you should always 
be working on and evolving. According to Stephanie Haberman, social media producer at 
NBC News, it’s an ongoing process of trial and error. “I will follow someone, and if I don’t 
like their stuff, I will unfollow them,” she told us. She’s been doing this for years, so she 
has one of the sharpest lists of newsmakers to follow in the business. Armed with that 
highly evolved list, Stephanie parlayed her expertise as a news ﬁ nder at  Mashable into a 
big-time job at NBC News. 
 How did she build that list? She said, “I curate it over time based on my interests, 
what’s going on in the world, and how my subjects’ personal news feeds have evolved.” 
She reads lots of news, and carefully observes who’s reporting on it. She said, “If I’m read-
ing a story that I’m really interested in, or if I’m reading about a news event I’m interested 
in, I will look up that reporter and see if they are on Twitter.” Constantly adding to and 
subtracting from her list results in an up-to-the-minute group of reporters who feed her 
the most important stories, all in real time. 
 The best way to ﬁ nd stories on Twitter is to use Twitter Advanced Search, located at 
search.twitter.com/advanced. It’s a surprisingly pow-
erful tool for sifting through Twitter’s enormous hay-
stack of information, helping you ﬁ nd that needle of 
info you seek. Haberman said, “It’s incredibly underuti-
lized. If you go into Twitter Advanced Search you can 
search for absolutely anything.” She likes the ﬂ exibil-
ity of Advanced Search, and especially its extensive ﬁ l-
ters. She said, “Instead of just putting in a term, you 
can search for ‘all these words,’ ‘this exact word,’ ‘this 
phrase,’ ‘these hashtags,’ ‘this language,’ ‘from these 
accounts,’ and ‘near this place.’ I use ‘near this place’ 
all the time. I use it with disasters, tornadoes, trying 
to ﬁ nd not just journalists who are tweeting about 
things but  people who are tweeting about them from 
that location.” 
 That powerful “near this place” ﬁ lter could also 
be useful for, say, a sports blogger who’s covering the 
trade of a beloved player. For example, let’s say Green

Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was traded to the Minnesota Vikings. In that 
nightmare scenario, you’d ﬁ nd a huge contrast in fan sentiment by searching for tweets 
about Aaron Rodgers within 50 miles of Green Bay, and then comparing that to the tweets 
about Rodgers within 50 miles of Minneapolis. Twitter Advanced Search even lets you 
ﬁ nd tweets with a positive or negative attitude. Imagine the results you’d ﬁ nd. Sounds 
like the makings of a good blog post, doesn’t it? 
 Twitter is getting to be so ubiquitous that now news breaks ﬁ rst on it. Set yourself up 
to ﬁ nd out what’s going on from people within your blogging topic by creating a Twitter 
list. This works like an RSS feed, except it’s even more immediate. Besides her main feed, 
Haberman has two lists that come in handy. She said, “I have one list that I keep just for 
fun—it’s sports people. I have another that I keep of newsmakers.” That 500-name list is a 
subset of the 2,500 people she follows. 
“I know 500 sounds like a lot, but it 
can be local people from one area or 
local people from another area.” She’s 
following newsmakers, rather than 
news outlets. Haberman points out 
the weakness of following just news 
outlets when a big story hits: “If you 
create a media list like that, you’re 
going to see a lot of the same tweets 
over and over again.” 
 Here’s how to create a list on Twit-
ter that you can use just as you would 
an RSS feed, keeping track of breaking 
news from sources you trust. To cre-
ate a list, ﬁ rst use Twitter Advanced 
Search to ﬁ nd industry luminaries, 
pundits, and experts in your chosen 
ﬁ eld who are using Twitter. You can 
combine them all in an easily scan-
nable list right there on your home 
page at Twitter.com. You know, on 
your Twitter account. You do have a 
Twitter account, don’t you? If not, 
sign up for one now—it’s free. 
 Under the Settings and help gear 
icon, click on Lists, and then select 
Create List. 
 Name your list, and decide if you’d 
like for it to be public or private. In this 
case, click Private, because you don’t 
want your blogging competitors to 
see your list of sources, a proprietary 
asset you’ll want to guard carefully. 
 Name your list, and then start pop-
ulating it with publications, websites,

inﬂ uential people and experts you’ve found. You might 
be surprised at how many publications are tweeting 
links to every one of their articles, every day. You can 
search for companies and people to add to your list, or 
you can add people from any proﬁ le page. 
 In this example, we’d like to add popular tech site 
 Engadget  to our list, so we’ve searched  Engadget from 
the Twitter home page, gone to  Engadget ’s proﬁ le page, 
clicked the “user actions” drop-down list to the left of 
“Follow,” and then clicked “Add or remove from lists.? 
 That brings up the “your lists” box, where we select our new list,  Bloggers Boot Camp . 
 Engadget will take its place among our other sources we selected. 
 To use our new list, simply go back to your Twitter home page, click the “Me” tab, 
click Lists, and select the list you just made. Behold, a custom queue of sizzling stories, 
selected speciﬁ cally by you according to your area of interest. Of course, your list is only 
as powerful as the sources you’ve added, so dedicate some time curating and reﬁ ning 
your list, and it will repay you many times over. Use your list wisely, and soon people 
will be adding you to their Twitter lists. As you probably already realize, Twitter is also a 
powerful way to promote your own stories, and we’re going to show you how to use this 
microblogging powerhouse to its fullest extent later in this book. 
 LinkedIn 
 One of our favorite sources of information is LinkedIn Groups. Many professionals form 
ad hoc groups on line—UAV manufacturers, journalists, interior decorators—and post 
news and job listings. These groups allow you to gather sources straight from the indus-
try you’re interested in and see what they like to read about. Think of it as a cheat sheet 
for your niche. 
 Go to  www.linkedin.com/myGroups  to start adding groups to your account. Do 
searches for interesting topics and add them. Some groups require a moderator to 
approve you, but that’s usually not a problem. In a few seconds you can gain some fasci-
nating insight on your niche. 
 Aggregators Such as Google News 
 A good starting point for big stories is to visit the huge aggregators of the news of the day, 
including such names as Google and Yahoo. You can search for your preferred topic area, 
or you can subscribe to the RSS feeds of these giants, narrowing it down to your area of 
interest. For instance, you can sign up for the RSS feed of technology and science news 
with Google, and read the results in your RSS reader every day, along with your other 
news sources. Or you can sign up with Google Alerts, where you’ll receive free email 
updates of relevant Google results matching your topic or keywords. 
 When we’re looking for a list of raw press releases, one of our most useful services is 
BusinessWire.com. If you sign up for the free PressPass News, you can designate which 
areas you’d like to hear about. Then, you’ll receive a list of press releases speciﬁ cally 
tailored for your subjects of interest. Of course, the press releases are just a bunch of

corporate-speak, but it’s a starting point for information and the PR agents responsible 
are usually listed. 
 Google Trends 
 Another efﬁ cient way to put your ﬁ ngers on the pulse of the Internet is to check Google 
Trends. Check Google Trends regularly, and it will give you powerful guidance about what 
people are searching for on the world’s largest search engine. If you want to give your 
readers what they want, look on the Google Trends list of Hot Searches, and you’ll ﬁ nd 
what they’re looking for. Whenever we see a hot search term that is within our topic area, 
we’ll write a post about it that usually performs well. That possibility is a good reason to 
make it a habit to check Google Trends at the beginning of every day and often through-
out the day. 
 More Sources: Press Releases from PR People 
 A large percentage of original news is ﬁ rst generated in press releases, written by public 
relations (PR) professionals hired by all kinds of companies and individuals, large and 
small. After you’ve made numerous contacts in your chosen ﬁ eld, you’ll be receiving a lot 
more press releases than you’d like. But at ﬁ rst, you won’t be receiving  any . You’ll need to 
start somewhere, so look on websites to ﬁ nd press contacts. Almost every company has 
a press area—go there and make your ﬁ rst contact with that organization’s press person-
nel. Send them a brief email, introducing yourself and asking them to include you on 
their list of contacts to receive their latest press releases. They’re almost always happy 
to comply with your request, and before you know it, you’ll be receiving plenty of ﬁ rst-
hand (yet often overblown, propagandistic, boring, and hyperbolic) information about 
your chosen companies. 
 You’ll discover the people in the world of public relations are outgoing and gregarious, 
more than happy to include you on their email lists. As you receive responses from press 
people and otherwise unravel which public relations and marketing people are associ-
ated with which companies, place them in your contacts list (you do have a My Contacts 
section in your email software, don’t you?), and don’t forget to associate the name of any 
PR person with the company he or she is working for. Be sure to use contacts software 
that’s always available to you on your computer and cellphone, and that’s easily search-
able and quickly updated. For that, we like to use the Contacts area of Gmail because it’s 
so easily searchable and ubiquitously available on all network-connected computers and 
smartphones. As you continue building these press contacts, that database will grow into 
one of your most valuable assets. By the way, because this info is so valuable, be sure to 
back up any cloud-based databases onto a storage medium you can hold in your hands. 
 Finding those press contacts by searching websites is a ﬁ rst step, but there are easier 
ways to ﬁ nd press releases, which usually include contact information at the end of the 
document. There is a bountiful barrage of press releases blasted out onto the web every 
day. You can ﬁ nd them on services such as  PR Newswire  and  Business Wire , which will let 
you sign up for daily listings of press releases in your chosen ﬁ eld, delivered free to your 
email address. Once you start the torrent of press releases ﬂ owing your way, you might 
be wishing you didn’t have so many coming in every day. However, those press releases

will help you get in touch with the people who are making the news, and often a quick 
phone call or email can uncover additional information and get your questions answered 
immediately. This is where the news starts, not where it ends. 
 Conferences/Trade Shows 
 One of the best sources of original stories is a trade show or industry conference. This is 
the most target-rich environment in the world for bloggers, because it’s ﬁ lled with man-
ufacturers, product managers, inventors, analysts, and entrepreneurs. Pursuing these 
sources are droves of fellow journalists and bloggers like you, all interested in gathering 
original information from those who are responsible for the products and services they 
write about every day. 
 Larger events such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) are so big that if your 
beat is consumer electronics, your cup runneth over. Held in Las Vegas each January, 
CES attracts so many thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of attendees 
that it’s almost to the point of being impossible to cover. There are lots of trade shows 
like that. At such a large event, you’ll need to narrow it down, identifying the companies 
you’re most interested in covering before the show starts. That list will be subject to 
many changes, of course, but at least you’ll have a starting point. Pay close attention to 
the pre-show buzz (use your newfound Twitter search skills), and you’ll get a good idea 
of which companies will be most worthy of your attention. At the same time, stay alert 
for surprises. 
 Then there are smaller shows like JCK, a jewelry show in Las Vegas. Or various home 
and fabric shows in New York and Europe. Or mobile phone shows in Orlando and Barce-
lona. Or auto shows in most major cities. The list is long and exhausting, but be sure to 
assess which events will make the most sense for you as a writer. Attending these shows 
is expensive and time-consuming, and if you aren’t making your living blogging yet, you 
might have to take time off from work. Choose wisely before buying a ticket to Outer 
Nowheresville to cover the Eastern Seaboard’s Mid-Sized Quilting and Canning Festival 
when the main Quilting and Canning event in Las Vegas could be a better bargain and 
much better source of news and information. 
 How do you decide what’s worth visiting? Here’s where your earlier legwork of build-
ing a network of PR representatives can pay off. Pay attention to early press releases before 
a key trade show, and if something looks like a big story that will interest your readers, 
make an appointment with the company to meet at the show. There is no substitute 
for the ﬁ rsthand experience, personal conversations, and hands-on evaluation of new 
products that you’ll get on the trade show ﬂ oor. Better yet, you can meet with companies 
or newsmakers in meeting rooms that are either attached to the trade show or off-site 
in hotel suites. This is where you get a chance to ﬁ nd out a lot more about the products 
you’re writing about. But be careful about accepting off-site appointments, which can 
waste a lot of precious time if there is no new product or exciting story to cover. 
 At smaller trade shows, you can often ﬁ nd topics for posts that no one has thought 
about before. These smaller get-togethers are either stand-alone events or organized 
around the same time as major trade shows as a subset of what’s happening on the 
gigantic show ﬂ oor. We’ve noticed that the major challenge of these smaller events is to 
discern which products are new, and which ones have already been available for a while. 
It’s also a challenge to ﬁ gure out when many of the products and prototypes on display 
www.ebook777.com

77
will actually become available to consumers. Vaporware abounds. Be careful. Too often, 
it’s a little game that exhibitors play with press people and bloggers, trying to convince 
them that a product is real when it’s not, or that a product is new when it’s years old. It’s 
your job to know when something is new, but there are so many products available that 
it’s impossible to keep up with it all. Ask a lot of questions. 
 Should you ask for press passes to these events? Sure, if you are well-established. 
Smaller blogs are now part of the news cycle, and these events need as much exposure 
as possible. This doesn’t mean you’ll always get a press pass, but it never hurts to ask. 
 Before you go to a trade show, be sure to have high-quality business cards on hand, 
prominently displaying your blog logo, your name, email address, and phone number 
(although many bloggers like to leave off the phone number these days, keeping junk 
calls to a minimum). Part of your mission at a trade show or conference is to collect as 
many business cards as possible, and to pass out as many of your own at the same time. 
If you’re not working for a company that supplies business cards, get your own. We found 
the best deal for business cards at Vistaprint.com or MooCards.com, but don’t go for the 
free business cards that have a printer’s logo on the back—that will reﬂ ect poorly on your 
professionalism. However, for very little money, you can get yourself hundreds of busi-
ness cards that look ﬁ rst-rate. We’d suggest using quality 100-lb. paper with a glossy front 
and matte back, giving your logo graphics a supersharp presentation. And the contrast in 
texture between the front and the back makes them easier to grab quickly. 
 Dinners and Events 
 As you get to know more PR people and company ofﬁ cials, you’ll be invited to special 
press dinners as well as various events featuring music and alcohol. This is fertile ground 
for rooting out vital background information. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll hear hints 
about upcoming products or services that might fascinate your readers. These hybrid and 
sometimes intimate gatherings are a combination of social occasion and business meet-
ing, but they can serve the purpose of bonding between you and the company you cover 
(but don’t get too close—remember, you’re a watchdog, not a lapdog). Pay close attention 
to off-the-record opinions, statements, or information. Even though you can’t write about 
them right away, some of the most valuable things you’ll hear are off the record, giving 
you an idea of what the company has in mind, and what direction it’s headed. Be sure 
to honor any off-the-record information, and that will help you build trust with those 
people who might give you a scoop later. 
 To be clear, there is no such thing as “off the record,” although the tradition of taking 
information and not writing about it, or printing it without clear attribution, has existed for 
most of the past ﬁ fty years. Anything anyone says to a reporter is fair game, especially in 
the world of blogging. However, if you abuse the privilege offered you by trusting sources, 
you may ﬁ nd yourself cast out of the inner circle and in hot water. If you agree not to write 
about something, stick to your promise. Tell the truth. Journalism is a  gentleman’s—or 
gentlewoman’s—agreement to tell the truth, not only in your writings but also in your 
dealings with your sources. You need to gain their trust. Abuse that at your peril. 
 Other more elaborate events are frequently called “parties,” but that’s a misnomer. 
While these get-togethers also can offer a good opportunity to get to know company 
ofﬁ cials and socialize with some of your colleagues, they’re frequently a waste of time. 
Many of the fanciest events hosted by large companies are done to thumb the corporate

nose at the competition, and massage the egos of the company’s top ofﬁ cials. “We’re big, 
and we can spend a lot of money on this kind of junk,” is the statement made by these 
evening events held at expensive venues. Carefully consider whether it’s worth your time 
to become a theatrical extra in these corporate dramas.  
 Tipsters 
 When you’re ﬁ rst starting out, you won’t be getting a torrent of tips in your inbox. But 
if you prominently display a link for tipsters, as your site grows, you’ll notice a trickle 
of information starting to ﬁ nd its way into your email. The challenge with these tips is 
separating fact from ﬁ ction. For every one tip showing you spy shots of the next iPhone, 
there are hundreds of others of lesser import. Whenever you receive a tip that looks like 
it could contain a kernel of truth, investigate it thoroughly, ask a lot of questions, and 
probe as deeply as you can, and you might be lucky enough to come up with the scoop 
of the year. 
 Tread carefully here, though, because many tips are just rumor, hearsay, or gainsay-
ing against competitors. If you ﬁ nd yourself getting numerous usable tips every day, 
 congratulations—you’ve made it to the top of the blog world. In our experience with 
 Gizmodo , a good percentage of our biggest and most original stories came from insider 
tips. With  Mashable , for some reason our tipbox usually contained a much higher per-
centage of useless pitches, but there was still the occasional gold nugget. However, your 
goal is to get as many tips as possible, even if a large percentage of them breathlessly tell 
you, “The Apple Store is down!” Always encourage your readers to send you tips, and as 
your blog grows in size and stature, you might be lucky enough to receive some ﬁ rsthand, 
valuable information. 
 Dealing with PR People 
 It’s inevitable: you’re cruising along, publishing content, getting popular, and suddenly 
fawning PR people want to bend your ear about a new product or service. They want to 
send free stuff your way; they want you to write about their clients. Once you’ve reached 
this pinnacle, be intensely wary. 
 You’re not friends with these companies—you’re more of a friendly watchdog, keep-
ing an eye on them for your readers. So no, the PR people are not really your friends, but 
they’re not your adversaries, either. They need you to write about the company they’re 
working for, but you also need them to get you the information and let you talk with 
the company’s newsmakers. There is a unique relationship between journalists and PR 
 Companies will try almost anything to get you off the show floor, away 
from their competitors, and in front of their products. Once at a trade show, a company offered 
to whisk Charlie from Las Vegas to San Francisco in a corporate jet, show him its product, and 
return him to the convention center two hours later. That sounded like so much fun, but Charlie 
refused—it’s  Mashable ’s official policy not to accept such extravagances from sources.

people, with the PR person’s boss-company sometimes hiding behind those representa-
tives, and with you always standing up for your readers. 
 This strange relationship takes a little getting used to. It feels like all of the PR people 
love you, and they might, but in reality, they’re afraid of you. They’re afraid of what you 
might write. They know you can give them the most valuable thing they seek, a positive 
review on your website or blog. To them, you are what they call “uncontrolled media,” as 
opposed to an advertisement they completely control. The gold that you can dole out to 
them is a well-reasoned and fair review that shows their product in a positive light. But 
if you negatively review their product, that could mean curtains for their prospects of 
selling many of them. In that transaction, they lose, but your readers win: You’ve warned 
your readers of a crappy product or service, saving them from worlds of grief. Nice. 
 Underneath this delicate relationship with companies and their PR agents, it’s your 
job to build your personal credibility so your readers will trust you and believe what you 
write. A friendly rapport with PR representatives will help you get the facts you need in 
a timely way. But it can also go overboard, where you become such close friends with 
the PR person that you feel like you’re jeopardizing a personal relationship by writing 
anything negative about the company. Keep your distance. As long as you remember 
you’re experiencing these products and presentations for the beneﬁ t of your readers, 
you’ll be ﬁ ne.  
 Review Units 
 There is a school of thought that says when a product has already been reviewed by 
numerous blogs, there is no point in your reviewing it too. However, if you’ve been devel-
oping a relationship of trust with your readers, they will probably want to read about your 
opinion of said gadget, product, or service. That review won’t be redundant if you weave 
your own personal experience, perceptions, opinions, and perspective. 
 Is It Worth It to Review? 
 Even though a speciﬁ c review might constitute a lot of work for you, and might not seem 
to get more pageviews than simple posts, doing reviews adds prestige to your site, keeps 
readers returning for more, and shows that you’re a writer with your hands on the hot-
test products. You learn a lot more about the products when you use them yourself. You’ll 
know what you’re talking about. That will come in handy, especially when you want to 
compare that item to its competitors. 
 You can’t review everything, but think of it this way: You don’t  need to review  every-
thing . If you go to a dance and say you’re not going to dance at all unless you can dance 
with every guy or gal in the room, you won’t be dancing much. Forget that! Review every 
worthy product or service you can ﬁ nd, and your readers will thank you for it. You’ll be 
more knowledgeable, and so will they. 
 How to Snag Review Units 
 Of course you’d like to review stuff, but how on earth do you get your hands on products 
or services without buying them yourself? Welcome to the review unit, the press sample,

the freebies that make it so you can do original research and report to your readers about 
your ﬁ rsthand experiences. As you establish contact with various press representatives, 
they’ll start to offer you review units of new products. If they don’t, ask. Be assertive. As 
your site grows and gains readership and credibility, it will be easier to convince compa-
nies to part with review samples. Especially at ﬁ rst, it helps to assure the company you’ll 
be fair with reviews, emphasize the growing number of readers to your site, and promise 
to return review units promptly. 
 Review It or Not—Pan It or Skip It? 
 Sometimes you’ll receive products that are of questionable value. Then you’re left 
with a quandary: Should you bash this product to hell, giving it a horribly negative 
review? The plus side of that scenario is that you’ll be warning readers to save their 
money and time, a valuable service that could increase your blog’s value. On the other 
hand, there is that old adage about how “any press is good press,” meaning that even 
 mentioning this product will be its own type of promotion, a good argument against 
reviewing it at all. 
 In our experience, this has been a tricky call to make. Generally, if a product is so 
ubiquitous, highly anticipated, and well known that most people have heard of it or its 
brand name, it’s a good idea for you to relish the fact that you’ve gotten your hands on 
one, and honestly and fairly criticize or praise it. But if it’s some cheap gadget that few 
people care about, what is the point of holding it up and smashing it to pieces like a 
piñata? Negative reviews can be fun to read (and write), so you don’t want to eliminate 
them entirely, but you also don’t want  all of your reviews to be negative, unless that’s the 
particular kind of site you’re planning. 
 Should I Return Review Units? 
 We cover this extensively in the Ethics chapter, but the rule of thumb is the more stuff 
you return to PR people in a timely manner, the better your chance of receiving more 
review units.  Blogging isn’t a way to get free junk. Sometimes getting a beer koozie or a 
USB key is a nice side effect of being a blogger, but it should not be your primary mission 
to get as much swag as possible. 
 Further News Gathering 
 Don’t depend just on the computer and the Internet to ﬁ nd news. Most of the bloggers 
and journalists you’re competing against are ﬁ nding  all their stories on the web, so a 
smart way to beat them is to go out there in the real world and ﬁ nd some news. If you 
write about products, for example, look for things people are doing with those products. 
If you write about parenting, talk with parents and parenting experts, observe parent-
ing techniques in public, draw from your own parenting experience, and write about 
those. Firsthand experience is often unique and valuable, and stories come from the 
most unlikely of places. So go out, ﬁ nd news, and incorporate your personal experiences 
into your writing.

 Ten Questions to Ask before Posting 
 This is the one skill that you  must get right. If you miss it, you’ll fail. After all, if you con-
sistently choose stories none of your site’s visitors are interested in reading, they’re not 
likely to return for more. Before you decide to write a story, think about this: Why are my 
readers coming to my site? They’re probably looking for variety, novelty, and entertain-
ment in their lives. They want to be engaged. So you need to be sure that every post you 
write has entertainment value. That doesn’t mean you have to be a comedian. It simply 
means you need to tickle that novelty-and-variety jones almost every reader has. This 
story-selection process is complicated and changes from day to day, but we’re here to 
help. We’ve boiled down your selection of stories to a list of questions you need to ask 
yourself before you give it the go-ahead for publication. 
 1. Is It New? 
 There’s good reason why it’s called “news.” Your readers will be expecting the latest prod-
ucts, services, and occurrences. If you’re in the tech world, posting about an old product 
that you characterize as new will hurt your credibility, showing readers that you don’t 
know what’s old and what’s new. Check carefully to see if the product is indeed brand-
new, and this is not as easy as it seems, because as we’ve warned, PR people and over-
eager companies often try to characterize older products as new. 
 Example: “Ray Dolby, Father of Modern Noise Reduction, Dead At 80” 
 Ray Dolby, creator of the Dolby noise-reduction system that revolutionized 
recording, died on September 12, 2013. ( http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/
ray-dolby-father-of-modern-noise-reduction-dead-at-80/ ) 
 2. Is There Something Fascinating and Different about It? 
 People are drawn to novel situations and products, and if you’ve never seen anything like 
the item you’re considering, that might be a good enough reason to post it. Talk about 
why it’s groundbreaking, what’s new about it, and what you think about its implications 
for the future. 
 Example: “Your Board Game Is in My Video Game: Tangible Play Mixes the 
Real and Virtual” 
 What do you get when you put a pair of board gaming geeks who have worked 
at NVIDIA, Google, LucasArts, and Ubisoft together in the same room? 
( http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/your-board-game-is-in-my-video- 
 game-tangible-play-mixes-the-real-and-virtual/ ) 
 3. Does Anybody Really Care about This? 
 When you ask the question, “Why should I care?” do you have a good answer? Many 
skeptical readers are thinking that phrase to themselves as they read every one of your 
blog posts: “Why should I care? Why should I care?” After scanning the day’s possibilities, 
always ask yourself that, too. If you can’t come up with an answer, move along—there’s 
nothing to see here.

 Example: “Bing Refresh Brings a New Logo, More ‘At a Glance’ Info with 
Cards and Info from Your Friends” 
 Microsoft’s search engine continues to push the rock up a hillside as 
it chases Google, and some new Bing features add or enhance its search in 
very familiar ways. ( www.engadget.com/2013/09/17/bing-logo-refresh-new-
features/ )  
 4. Is There Something Hilarious, Quirky, or Unbelievable about It? 
 Some story topics are wonderful sight gags, with built-in humor that will make readers 
laugh as you tell them the story or show them the picture. Sometimes few words are 
needed for these humorous and crazy stories. 
 Example: “Hilarious iPhone 5S Launch Parody Touches on Truth” 
 As buzz reaches a fever pitch over the iPhone 5S launch just a few 
days away, Matthias and J-Fred might have stumbled upon some truth in 
this parody video. ( www.charliewhite.net/2013/09/iphone-5s-launch/ ) 
 5. Have You Had Personal Experience with It? 
 Here’s your chance to relate your own unique experiences. This is the gold that you have 
to mine—your own observations, judgments, and ﬁ rsthand opinions about your topic. 
Elevate yourself above the crowd that’s busy rewriting press releases and scribbling their 
secondhand accounts, and talk about what you’ve learned, ﬁ rsthand, about your chosen 
topic. Maximize your personal experiences with the ﬁ eld you’re writing about, and you’ll 
be a much better blogger. 
 Example: “iOS 7 Makes My iPhone 5 Feel Brand New [REVIEW]” 
 Even if you aren’t buying a new iPhone this week, you’ll feel 
like you did if you upgrade to iOS 7. ( www.charliewhite.net/2013/09/
ios-7-review/ ) 
 6. Is There a Good Graphic or Photo Available? 
 Sometimes even a so-so story will be a winner if you’ve found an interesting graphic. 
Most readers are skimmers, and a compelling photo will draw their eyes into the story 
and get them instantly involved, where a blurry shot or tiny icon-sized graphic might not 
draw in their attention enough. Besides the headline, the quality of the graphic is one of 
the main factors in drawing readers into your work. And we’ve noticed that a big graphic 
is more likely to attract the interest of users of discovery engine StumbleUpon, who are 
more likely to be lured into your post—and ultimately click that “Thumbs Up” button—if 
there’s a compelling pic at the top of your post. 
 Example: “Smartphones Leave Yesterday’s Supercomputers in the Dust 
[INFOGRAPHIC]” 
 Do you have any idea how powerful that smartphone in your pocket is? ( www.char
liewhite.net/2013/09/smartphones-vs-supercomputers/ )

 7. Is Everybody Else in the World Covering It? 
 When a major story hits (such as the release of the next iPhone), everyone will be writing 
about it, and if you’re writing about gadgets, you will, too. But if there is a minor gadget or 
story topic that everyone seems to be writing about, and you don’t really have anything 
extra to add to the conversation, skip it. However, don’t let what other blogs are cover-
ing dictate what you’ll cover. Keep in mind that your readers aren’t scanning hundreds 
of blogs like you do. See the situation from your readers’ point of view—do they want 
to hear what  you have to say about this product? If you’re a good blogger, the answer is 
probably yes. 
 Example: “The NSA Can Read Some Encrypted Tor Trafﬁ c” 
 Security expert Robert Graham has done a bit of research and posts 
that the encryption standard used by earlier versions of the “secure” 
Tor protocol is most probably insecure and readable by the NSA. ( http://
techcrunch.com/2013/09/07/the-nsa-can-read-some-encrypted-tor-
trafﬁ c/ ) 
 8. Is It a World’s First or Record-Breaking? 
 People are delighted by something they haven’t seen before, and ﬁ nding something that’s 
the world’s ﬁ rst, fastest, craziest, tallest, oldest, smallest, etc. might be interesting enough 
to capture a crowd of readers. Just think, something that’s the best in the world! How can 
they resist? 
 Example: “Sharp Unveils World’s First THX-Certiﬁ ed Ultra HDTV” 
 Ultra HDTV is getting more affordable, and Sharp did its part on 
Wednesday by unveiling a THX-certiﬁ ed 70-inch ultra-HD television for 
$8,000. ( http://mashable.com/2013/06/26/sharp-ultra-hdtv/ ) 
 9.  Is It a Hot Topic of Considerable Controversy That Will Lure 
Comments from Readers? 
 Sometimes people are itching to comment about something that’s going on in the news. 
Give them a chance to comment on that topic in your blog, too. Be sure that the current 
event that’s causing such controversy is related to your blog’s mission, but if the story 
is, for example, a massive terrorist attack or natural disaster, there’s probably a way you 
can ﬁ gure out an angle that would ﬁ t with your blog. (Find the hot topics of the moment 
by using the Google Trends site we mentioned earlier in this chapter:  www.google.com/
trends/hottrends. ) 
 Example: “NSA Project XKeyscore Collects Nearly Everything You Do on 
the Internet” 
 Further leaks have revealed an NSA project called XKeyscore that, with 
a few keystrokes, can give a data analyst access to nearly everything a 
user does on the Internet—from chat sessions to email to browsing habits.

 10. Do You Have a Unique Opinion or Spin on the Topic? 
 If an item you’re considering writing about has the potential to function as a springboard 
for you to go off on a rant about a related topic, this might be your chance. After all, your 
unique interpretations of topics are what will make your blog unique and keep those 
readers coming back to you day after day. Maybe there’s a great unanswered question 
you’ve pondered, and you’re ready to reveal your grand answer. Post it. 
 Example: “Are iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C Worth the Upgrade?” 
 Apple rolled out the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C on Tuesday, and there were 
few surprises ( www.charliewhite.net/2013/09/iphone-5s/ )

 How to Write 
a Blog Post 
 Now that we’ve addressed  what you’ll write about, let’s talk about  how to write fo r blogs. 
 You’re about to dive into a whole new way of writing, creating stories that are cer-
tainly “ journalism, ”  but with added peculiarities and immediacy that are nothing like the 
newspapering of the past.  You’re trying to set yourself apart from the crowd, to attract 
readers who might feel jaded by your particular choice of material. The key is to entertain 
and inform those visitors so much that they’ll want to come back again and again. 
 You’ve got to keep your audience engaged, and remember that you’re not making 
your pronouncements from some ivory tower, but you’re starting a conversation. That’s 
one of the main differences between this new type of journalism and the old-school 
newspapers and magazines, which publish letters their readers wrote, but only at the 
whim and convenience of their editors. Now, your readers can type back at you immedi-
ately, often with no censorship and complete anonymity, depending on how you choose 
to handle your comments. 
 While you might not want to constantly ask questions of your readers, with contro-
versial topics, you can spark the discussion by asserting your own point of view. With 
most stories, you can inject your opinion, which can be bolstered by adding a few key 
facts. Don’t be afraid to speak out—your unique opinions will ultimately be what dif-
ferentiates your blog from all the others. Accompany your posts with strong opinions, 
and you’ll bond tightly with some of your readers. But others will vehemently disagree 
with you. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, either, because sometimes readers are enter-
tained by a writer with whom they constantly disagree. 
 With breaking news stories, in the interest of speed, you might ﬁ nd yourself quickly 
writing the story and giving it to the readers straight, without injecting your own opinion. 
For example, if Jay-Z and Kanye West just got into a ﬁ stﬁ ght on national television, you 
might want to do your readers the service of giving them a “just the facts, ma’am” look at 
what’s just happened. With those kinds of stories, you want to break the news as quickly 
as possible; there will be plenty of time for blow-by-blow analysis later. A simple headline 
like “BREAKING—Kanye Punches Jay-Z” is often more than enough for an important piece 
of news. It gives your readers exactly what they need. Do this sparingly, however. It’s akin 
to the boy who cried wolf—if everything is breaking, nothing is.

 When Should You Post? 
 As we mentioned before, your goal is ABP—Always Be Posting.  However, you may ﬁ nd 
that blowing out all your posts at once in the morning is counterproductive. If you write 
on a slow-moving topic, post slowly. Write your 1,000 words in multiple posts and slowly 
post them over the course of a day. How? 
 Most content management systems allow for “scheduled” posts. The key here is to 
post once every few hours to give your readers something to read during the course of 
a day. Try to post as much as possible early. For example, if you already have three posts 
on your site at 9 a.m., other sleepyhead sites are more likely to link to you when they get 
up later in the day, ﬁ nding your fresh slate of stories glistening there in the noonday sun. 
This is why Charlie would get up every morning at 6 a.m. to start his day with  Gizmodo , 
ﬁ nding the stories ﬁ rst and then enjoying the link love from the late-sleeping me-too 
bloggers. Experts say people read blogs the most in the morning, with the hour between 
10 a.m. and 11 a.m. at the peak. But since you’re blogging worldwide, it’s always between 
10 a.m. and 11 a.m. somewhere, so know where your readers are before you start trying 
to time the blog-reading market. 
 You should be posting every day, but don’t post all at once. If you are posting ten sto-
ries a day, we’d recommend dropping them out once an hour. Many larger blogs will post 
every ten to ﬁ fteen minutes, although there is no hard evidence that slow or fast posting 
 Pro Tip 
 Your story needs context to stand out from the crowd. For example, if the 
Tesla Model S electric car just got the best safety rating ever from the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA), every car site will be reporting that as quickly as possible. If you 
add the fact that a few months earlier, the Tesla Model S also received the highest rating ever 
from  Consumer Reports , and point out that Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned a week earlier that 
later this decade the company will introduce mass-market electric cars that will cost half the 
Model S’s steep $70K+ price, you’ve put the NHTSA rating into perspective. Your readers might 
not know this additional information. Now you’ve given them insight they wouldn’t have found 
elsewhere. They’ll thank you for that by returning to your site the next time a hot story breaks. 
 With any topic, bring your own perspective to the conversation. Many times you’ll be 
getting your facts from other sources, and that’s when you have to make a special effort 
to refrain from copying the work of your sources, unless directly quoting them. In addi-
tion, beyond the plagiaristic verbatim lifting of sentences from other news sources, you 
need to constantly strive to place your own spin or analysis into any story. 
 While you’re reading a source’s story, think of your own ideas and angles for the story, 
rather than copying your source’s original ideas. Many a failed blog was brought down by 
simple paraphrasing of all the other posts written that day on that speciﬁ c story. Don’t 
simply rewrite. Own the story with your own perspective, comparing it to what you’ve 
seen before, explaining why this matters, and drawing readers into it. That will make it 
your own. That’s what makes this your blog, your story, and your work. That’s one thing 
that will keep readers coming back for more.

will change trafﬁ c overall. However, it does offer a sense of routine and rhythm to a blog, 
and by spacing out posts you encourage the reader to graze throughout the day rather 
than only during a set period. 
 This is not an attempt to solicit pageviews. It is an attempt to secure  an audience . Con-
sider your posts as a sort of delicacy to be savored by your readers during the course of a 
day. If you lay out this smorgasbord all at once, your readers will overdose. At all the large 
blogs where we’ve worked, our teams posted more than ﬁ fty items per day on a good 
day; if we posted all of those between 9:30 and 9:45 in the morning, we’d basically train 
our readers to visit our sites once a day to pick up all our stories, leaving the sites dead 
for the rest of the day. Scheduling posts is a great way to maintain space between posts, 
just like you want to maintain an assured stopping distance between cars in trafﬁ c. A few 
feet—or hours—keeps things from backing up and crashing. It also keeps your posts from 
competing against themselves so much. 
 The blog is an animated medium. It has a life cycle and a pace. The best blogs have 
a pulse, a sense that they’re constantly being updated. The worst blog is updated once a 
week or less, with no rhythm or regularity to the posting. Blogs are popular because they 
are always fresh. Some bloggers can get away with one big post a day, but if you want 
to keep your interest high and the site moving, we’d recommend a few posts, one every 
three hours or so. This is not an exact science, but generally it is something to consider. 
 Now, without further ado . . . 
 Deadly Headline Kills 200,000 Innocent Readers 
 Gotcha. It worked, didn’t it? We’d like to ﬂ atter ourselves into thinking that readers will 
pore over our every word. In reality, the most widely read words you’ll ever write are 
headlines (or “heds” in old newspaper talk). Many readers are scanners, not taking in 
everything you’ve written in depth, but skimming over headlines and their accompany-
ing graphics. Many of your prospective readers are seeing your story for the ﬁ rst time on 
an RSS reader, or in a link on Twitter or Facebook. That’s why you must think of how every 
headline will look on Twitter, or on someone’s Facebook newsfeed. It must be tightly writ-
ten. If you don’t get this headline-writing task right, no one will ever know if your posts 
are well written or not. How will they know? Just as the old carnival barkers said, “You’ve 
got to get them into the tent.” 
 Blog readers read quickly. They have no interest in your ﬁ nely crafted ﬁ fth paragraph 
if your ﬁ rst graf is sufﬁ cient for their information-gathering needs. Feel honored if they 
care enough to read all the way down to the end of a story. One of our favorite writ-
ers, Farhad Manjoo, did an informal study for website  Slate , and discovered that most 
visitors read about 60 percent of each story. But almost all read the heds, and 10 percent 
 never  scroll ( www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_
online_why_you_won_t_ﬁ nish_this_article.html ). The headline, in many cases, is the big 
opener that encourages them to stay for at least part of the main attraction. 
  Headlines are gold. Without a good headline, no one will read your story.  Headlines 
must be concise, interesting, and  almost tell the story, or if you are taking a contrary posi-
tion on a popular news story, express your opinion cleanly and succinctly. In fact, some 
of the best headlines are those that ignore the conventional storyline—“Dog Bites Man”—
and instead focus on an aspect of the story that will be of interest to your readers—“Are 
Shi Tzus Dangerous?”

 Question 
 Is God Dead?  Remember that title from the cover of  Time magazine in 1966? 1 A question 
can have tremendous allure, especially if it’s one that readers have been asking them-
selves. Question marks at the end of titles also serve as an indicator that the accompany-
ing story is a rumor or not completely understood yet. 
 Secrets 
 The Secret to Living Forever . You would read that post, wouldn’t you? That’s why readers 
read, isn’t it—to discover secrets, to uncover things they didn’t know? Establish yourself 
as a reliable source of those secrets, and the readers will keep coming back for more. 
 Numbers 
 Affordable Supersonic Mini-Jet Zips along at 2,000 MPH . Use a number in your head-
line if it’s something unusual, something never done before, a key fact of your story, or 
a breakthrough. In this case, even ﬁ ghter jets rarely travel at 2,000 mph, so, yes, that’s 
compelling. 
 Weird or Unusual 
 A headline stating  Dog Bites Man  is not that unusual, but  Man Bites Dog  is. Your readers 
are looking for the unusual, the novel, and the strange. Something completely unheard of 
 Remember, you want to lead the reader into your story, not  mis lead. For 
instance, some readers will laugh when they find out your headline “Friend Count Linked to the 
Size of a Certain Body Part? ” (an actual hed written by Charlie) is referring to almond-shaped 
portions of the brain called the amygdalae, not that other body part you’re thinking about. Others 
will feel tricked and cheated, and will complain about it in the comments. Using misleading terms 
as a joke places this headline right on the edge of acceptability, but when your credibility is at 
stake, misleading headlines are best saved for April Fools’ Day. 
 War Story 
 Use action words in your headlines, and give your readers good reasons to read your 
posts without revealing everything. Lure them in, make them curious, startle them, or 
outrage them, but just get them into that tent. How is this done? Write your headline 
ﬁ rst, leveraging its most intriguing point, before you write the story. You can revise it after 
you write your post, if you learn new facts in the meantime or think of something better. 
 What was it that made you decide to pick this topic? Encapsulate that into a punchy 
headline. Entertain your readers with your headline, while at the same time giving them 
a good sense of what the story is about. 
 When writing heds, keep them as short as possible, while still including enough info 
to entice the reader. And keep it simple. Don’t write a bunch of jargon or use obscure 
acronyms in your headlines, because not everyone knows what all those initials stand 
for. But be careful because readers aren’t dumb. If you keep posting the same gimmicky 
headlines—lists, questions, and the like—they will move on.

might be just what you need to get them to click through and read the entire story. Con-
nect it to a question and ask  What Do You Get When You Mix Pecans and Beer? The Best 
Cheese in the World. 
 Amazing 
 Household Robot Cooks Breakfast, Cleans Up . If it made your jaw drop when you ﬁ rst 
heard about it, it will probably do the same to your readers if you express that in the 
headline. They’re sitting there, dying to be amazed, and it’s your job to fulﬁ ll that wish. 
 Finally 
 Finally, Electric Car Drives Coast-to-Coast without Recharging . Is your story about some-
thing everyone has been waiting for? People are looking for relief, they’re tired of waiting, 
and they will be more than happy to read about how the wait is over, at long last. 
 Lists 
 Top 10 Ways to Kill Your Landlord . Top 10 lists are so pervasive on the web that you’d 
think they’ve been overused. You’d be right, but the venerable list shows no signs of abat-
ing. Heck, the site  Cracked  publishes lists almost exclusively. Lists are popular because it’s 
easy to read these bite-sized morsels, they’re usually accompanied by pictures, and they 
usually revolve around a fun topic. Make your headline signal how fun its topic is, and 
your list is well on its way to success. 
 Shock 
 The iPhone Sucks . Half your readers will love you, the other half will hate you, but they’ll 
all be compelled to read whatever prose you place underneath an outrageous and contro-
versial headline. Use sparingly. 
 Rumor 
 Rumor: Warp Drive to Debut in 2020?  You can lead with a rumor as long as you preface it 
with an explanation. When you’ve heard a rumor you trust, feel free to publish it. Just be 
careful to couch it in terms that carefully explain the sourcing and the potential validity. 
At  Mashable , we put a [REPORT] at the end of hed to make it clear the story’s not a con-
ﬁ rmed fact. 
 The Straight Story 
 Scranton-Area Teachers Walk Out of Union Talks . There is something to be said about 
straight news headlines. Not everything has to be an absolute gimmick. Telling the story 
clearly in the headline and then expanding it in text is always a winner when nothing 
else ﬁ ts. Not every headline has to be a gotcha. 
 To Capitalize or Not to Capitalize 
 We’re used to seeing capitalized headlines in newspapers and magazines. Generally, we 
would recommend capitalization of the ﬁ rst letter of each word, unless it’s an article 
(a, an, the) or coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for) that’s not the ﬁ rst word of

the title. There are some esoteric beliefs that Google reads capitalized headlines as dif-
ferent content than body text and treats it accordingly, although in many cases that is no 
longer true. According to UK style, only the ﬁ rst word of a headline is capitalized. Outside 
of the UK and Europe, capitalized heds seem to be falling out of favor. In a  Conductor study 
of reader preferences of headlines, 64 percent preferred sentence case ( www.conductor.
com/news/5-data-insights-headlines-readers-click ). However, never write a HEADLINE 
IN ALL CAPS. It is considered junk by Google and makes you look like you’re screaming 
in text. 
 Lead with Your Ledes, Don’t Bury Them 
 Get to the point, fast. When you’re starting up your story, make it punchy. What you’re 
trying to avoid here is burying the lead (or, in newspaper talk, “lede”). That means in the 
ﬁ rst sentence, or at most, in the second sentence, plainly tell your readers what the story 
is about, drawing them in with a good reason or two why they should care. 
 News stories consist of a lede, a nut graf (the important statement you are trying to 
make), and research. In general, the lede brings the reader into the story and the nut graf 
tells them why they came. The research is an added bonus (although many stories are far 
too long and boring to be considered a bonus). 
 What you don’t want to do: “throat clearing,” where you dance around the subject 
and don’t really say anything about the topic until many sentences, or heaven forbid, 
paragraphs later.  Don’t bury the lede, or you’ll soon be burying your blog. 
 This is not to say your ﬁ rst paragraph can’t be playful. For example, you could write: 
 Remember when Coca-Cola released New Coke? The uproar? The anger? Well, the company’s 
done it again.  
 It’s called Coca-Cola Throwback, a new beverage that contains 100% real organic sugar 
instead of corn syrup. And trust me: There will be no riots in the streets over this new addition 
to the Coca-Cola family. 
 Your nut is actually the second graf, but the ﬁ rst graf, in this case the lede, was some-
thing to catch your reader’s attention. It gives them something to think about—perhaps 
reminisce about. Then you can move right into the meat of the story in the nut. A lede 
should be a few dozen words, at most, and express everything you’re trying to say in 
encapsulated form. 
 Use Perfect Grammar or Your Credibility Is Shot 
 Even if your story selection is the world’s best and your headlines the grabbiest, your read-
ers’ respect for you and your writing plummet when you make a grammatical error. As 
soon as your readers think you’re uneducated, they’ll start suspecting that your research 
methods, your judgment, and your basic level of intelligence suck, too. 
 This is not to say you can’t make typos—go ahead! You can always ﬁ x them. But if 
you’re not comfortable with a certain construction or turn of phrase, avoid it. Simplify 
your writing to prevent potential problems. 
 If you decided to become a writer, yet still aren’t familiar with basic rules of grammar, 
you’ve got some work to do. Of course, we know that most of the readers of this book are

well versed in the eccentricities of English grammar, but if you don’t fall into this group, 
it’s time to study up and hone your grammatical accuracy to perfection. 
 This is especially true if you’re writing in English as a second language. We’ve seen 
countless excellent posts butchered by poor translations. If you’re writing in English, 
write in an English that a native speaker would ﬁ nd concise and dry rather than impre-
cise and ﬂ oridly bad. 
 How do you study grammar? One way to hone your grammatical skills is to read a lot, 
learning by observation. Or you could visit one of the dozens of websites that specialize 
in grammar and common usage mistakes. Or you could get Strunk and White’s  The Ele-
ments of Style , laying it all out for you in one terse treatise. There’s a multitude of books 
written about grammar, but for the sake of a quick lesson, we’ll school you on the gram-
matical, style, and usage crimes you’re most likely to commit. Keep in mind that many 
of the following examples are opinions John and Charlie have honed over the years of 
writing books, magazine and website articles, and blog posts—your site or editors might 
have a slightly different approach. 
 Top Fifty Grammar, Usage, and Style Goofs 
 1. 
  It’s/Its:  This is by far the most prevalent grammatical error on the Internet. Just 
keep in mind that the word “it’s” is a contraction of the words “it” and “is.” What 
you’re saying is a shortened form of “it is.” The possessive form of “its” doesn’t work 
like other possessives in the English language, because it needs no apostrophe. For 
example:  It’s a shame that the English language must be mangled by those who haven’t 
mastered its subtleties.  By the way, whenever a word is plural, don’t go putting an 
apostrophe before the s. We’re reminded of a sign at a gas station that read, “Drink’s, 
50 cent.” Of course, no reader of this book has ever been guilty of such a grammatical 
crime. 
 2. 
  There/Their/They’re:  “Their” is a possessive of “they,” “they’re” is the contraction of 
“they are,” and “there” is the opposite of “here.” 
 For example: 
 They’re lying there, checking their email. 
 By the way, this brings to mind the terms lie and lay: You lie around, you lay yourself 
down to sleep, you’re not an easy lay. Hens lay, you lie! 
 3. 
  Lose/Loose:  People constantly misuse these words. We’re still trying to ﬁ gure out 
why, because it’s so easy to understand that loose describes something that’s not 
tight, while to lose means to misplace something. 
 For example: 
 As he ran, his phone worked its way loose from his belt, causing him to lose it. 
 4. 
  Your/You’re/You: This one’s easy. “Your” is the possessive of “you,” and “you’re” is just 
an easy way to say “you are.” 
 For example: 
 You’re certainly taking your time, aren’t you? 
 By the way, increasingly, we’re seeing the word “you” used instead of your, but we 
suspect that’s usually a typo.

  5.  Pronoun and antecedent agreement:  “Each person must remember their own name.” 
No. “Each person must remember his own name,” or write around it if you want to be 
gender-neutral: People must remember their own names. Or if you must, write “his 
or her.” 
  6.  For free: The word “for” is not necessary. “Get out of jail free.” 
  7.  As: We can’t understand how the word “as” has crept into writing like this, but it has: 
“He can walk long distances, as he is a nomad.” “. . . then look no further, as we’ve 
found 10 . . .” Use a dash if you have to, but don’t misuse the word “as.” 
  8. 
  Out there:  This is almost always unnecessary. It separates writer from reader. Products 
are not “out there.” Out where? For example, “There are thousands of cellphones out 
there.” “For all you readers out there . . .” Draw them in—don’t place them “out there.” 
  9.  Over at:  “The writers over at  Boing Boing  found an entertaining video.” Unnecessary 
words. It’s electronic, they’re not “over at” anything or anywhere. And you need only 
one directional, not two of them up in here. 
 10.  Reach out:  Strangely enough, this cliché phrase began its touchy-feely life in a tele-
vision commercial for AT&T. “Reach out and touch someone.” That was the slogan. 
Now it’s grown into an all-consuming monster. It’s dragged out every time we want 
to say we contacted someone. I think it’s important to be speciﬁ c about how you 
contacted someone. Say emailed, or called, or talked with someone. How did you 
“reach out?” Was the guy drowning and you reached out to pull him onto the dock? 
Even if you have to say “contacted someone,” it’s better than “reaching out.” You’re 
not reaching out to anything—this is all electronic. No reaching. 
 11.  Clichés: Grails, antes, touch base, loop in—the ﬁ rst time someone used these, it was 
probably clever. Now it’s tired business speak. No grails, and don’t raise any more 
antes. 
 12.  Towards:  It’s toward. It’s forward. Not towards, not forwards (unless you’re writing in 
British English). 
 13.  The word “that” can often be omitted: —for example, “There’s not much that its 
code-free apps can’t do.” We use the word “that” in sentences so often that it’s some-
thing that we think that we might want to stop. Stop that. Try dropping the word 
“that,” and you’ll notice that your sentences are tighter. We mean you’ll notice your 
sentences are tighter. 
 14.  Company/their:  A company is singular. People in a company are “they,” but the com-
pany is an “it.” 
 15.  “Should” instead of “if”:  “Should you ﬁ nd yourself without water or power . . .” We’re 
not sure where this one came from, but it’s popping up too often. The correct form 
using “should” would be “If you should ﬁ nd yourself . . .” 
 16.  Awesome: This used to be a wonderful word. Now, it’s been overused and it’s lost 
all its power. I would suggest using it only in its proper context, such as times when 
you’re referring to explosions, hurricanes, things that are gigantic, unbelievable, 
one-of-a-kind, and rare. 
 17.  Amazing: This word is elbowing in to take the place of “awesome.” Use it sparingly. 
 18.  Use a semicolon  if the second part of your sentence can stand by itself but is still 
related to the ﬁ rst part: “Basic apps are free; more advanced options start at $39 per 
month.” 
 19.  An ellipsis  needs an extra dot (with a total of four) if it’s the end of a sentence. . . . 
And be careful with the ellipses overall—they’re on the verge of overuse.

 20.   Impact as a verb:  “How has Google impacted your life?” Although some grammar 
mavens will disagree with us on this one, “impact” is not a verb unless you’re talking 
about an asteroid impacting the earth, or a wisdom tooth being impacted. You could 
have an impact on something, but you can’t impact it. 
 21.   Very: Write very, very, very powerfully and you won’t need to lean on this crutch. 
 22.   We want to hear your thoughts:  We’ve never heard a thought before. We would rather 
use the word “opinion” for thought, anyway. Or perhaps say, “Let us know what you 
think.” Thoughts? Don’t ask for them. No one is going to write down thoughts. They’re 
thinking them, not writing them. 
 23.   Premiere vs. premier:  Charlie messed this one up on a TV graphic once, and that’s 
how he learned it. A premiere is an event when something new is presented. Pre-
mier is something at the top of its class, the best, or a person who is in charge of a 
government. Adobe Premiere is a software application. It is the premier video edit-
ing application. 
 24.   No period  at the end of a phrase that isn’t a complete sentence and isn’t followed by 
another sentence (think: bullet-pointed lists) 
 25.   Passed away, passed:  “Passed away” softens death and sounds folksy. Funeral 
directors say it a lot. But it doesn’t sound professional for writers. People die. Deal 
with it. They are dead. Someone has died. “Passed away” has religious connota-
tions, and it’s amateurish. “Passed” is even worse, sounding like something your 
 great-grandmother would have said. I don’t even like to use the term “RIP,” which 
also has religious connotations and is archaic, but it’s good for SEO. 
 26.   People that, those that:  This should be “people who,” or “those who.” People are 
referred to as “who,” not “that.” People are humans, not things. 
 27.   Throat clearing:  When emailing or writing anything, you have only about a dozen 
words to grab a reader’s attention. Use them wisely. Get to the point in the ﬁ rst 
paragraph, as quickly as possible. People are busy, and you can’t squander your only 
chance to lure them in. 
 28.   In order to:  There’s rarely a case when you need to use this phrase. Just leave out 
the words “in order” and just say “to.” In order to make the most of your writing, 
stop using the inefﬁ cient and ﬂ abby phrase, “in order to.” It’s similar to that other 
hitchhiker of a word, “that.” Try getting rid of “in order to” and “that,” and notice how 
much tighter your sentence sounds. 
 29.   Whenever you talk about a couple of things , don’t forget the word “couple” has 
a trusty companion, the word “of.” Sure, people like to talk about having a couple 
beers, things that happened a couple months ago, giving a couple examples—but 
I think it’s a bit too folksy for pro writing. 
 30.   Passive voice: Make your writing more rigid by losing that passive voice. “The world 
was in disarray, so changes were made.” Changes were made? No. “World War III 
changed the world.” BOOM! 
 31.   New words:  These two relatively new words haven’t gotten their usage nailed 
down yet: ereader and checkin. Make those electronic books easier to read about by 
referring to them as e-readers. And please, make your favorite thing to do on Four-
square sound like something beyond a description of barnyard animals, and call it a 
check-in. 
 32.   Junkies:  The era of calling people “junkies” if they like to do something is over. If 
you’ve ever seen, known, or heard about what junkies are really like, you won’t want

to call someone that, or refer to yourself as such, either. Better to use the words aﬁ -
cionado, fan, lover, or even fanatic if you must, but junkies are sad and ill and need 
our help. 
 33.  Real time:  When you talk about real time, leave out the hyphen. If the words “real 
time” modify another word, put in the hyphen. (Correct: in real time, real-time 
acceptance.) 
 34.  Wide variety:  A variety is already wide enough without adding the word wide. Ask 
yourself whether there is such a thing as a narrow variety. 
 35.  Tweeted out:  It’s stylish to talk about “tweeting out” and “sharing out” things, but is 
the word “out” really necessary in this context? Is it possible to “tweet in” something? 
 36.  Called out:  Unless you’re writing extremely informally, the phrase “called out” is not 
exactly a professional term to use if, say, a company has criticized another company. 
Nor does it need a hyphen in this context: “Being called-out for his policies by the 
public.” 
 37.  Retina: Apple’s high-resolution displays are Retina displays, not Retina Displays or 
retina displays. 
 38.  Dollars dollars:  When you have a dollar sign next to a word, you don’t need to have 
the word dollar written after it: “$13 billion dollars” is incorrect. All you need is 
$13 billion. And love. Love is all you need. 
 39.  Crowdsourced, not crowd-sourced . 
 40.  “Like” instead of “such as”:  If something is like something else, then you’re not 
referring to that thing. You’re referring to something else—for example: “Bands like 
the Beatles were big in the ’60s.” A band like the Beatles would be the Rolling Stones, 
not the Beatles. The correct usage here would be, “Bands such as the Beatles were big 
in the ’60s.” 
 41.  Teen slang:  While we’re on the subject of the word “like,” a word we hippies were so 
fond of using in the ’60s and which has grown to the teen-slang monster it is today: 
like, stop, like, using it in that context. You know? 
 42.  “My personal favorite”:  No need to write the word “personal” here; tighten it up. Just 
write “my favorite.” Same with the word “personally.” 
 43.  How many?  “A number of” or “numerous” tells you nothing. What’s that number? Is 
it a secret? Just write “several,” or “a few” for rough estimates—or better yet, get the 
actual number. 
 44.  Begs the question:  Writers get this wrong almost every time it’s used. The phrase 
“begs the question” seems to say that it practically begs for a question to be asked. 
But the term “begs the question” actually means using an unproved point to prove 
itself. For example, “You shouldn’t beg the question because begging the question is 
something you shouldn’t do.” That’s begging the question. 
 45.  Cellphone: one word 
 46.  Borrow:  “Can you borrow me a dollar?” This might be a Midwestern thing, something 
we were surprised to hear someone say. But we put it in here for laughs and to make 
you feel superior for not saying it. 
 47.  But: Starting a sentence or paragraph with “but” is not a good idea, in the opinion 
of some grammar sticklers. But we think it’s okay, and this is our book —it says right 
there on the cover. So that’s our opinion. But we could be wrong. 
 48.  Email: This word has no hyphen—it’s just “email.”

 49.   Any more/anymore:  Here’s how to use these words: “I don’t buy books anymore 
because I don’t need any more books.” 
 50.   Only time will tell:  Charlie once worked at a TV station where the news director said 
he would ﬁ re anyone who used the term “only time will tell” at the end of a story. 
That was unforgettable, and maybe the guy had a point. The news team had just 
gone through four newscasts in a row where reporters ended their stories with those 
words. The phrase was never spoken again within those walls. Will we actually use 
this phrase again? Only time will tell. Uh, no, we won’t. 
 Choosing Details 
 People talk about paying attention to details, but what they really mean is paying atten-
tion to the  right  details. Invariably, you’ll ﬁ nd yourself writing a blog post about a concept, 
product, or service that’s complicated. In the political world there might be a detailed 
proposal that you’d like to critique. Or in the technology world, there could be a new digi-
tal camera that was just rolled out, with a feature list as long as your arm. 
 Will you write about every one of those new features? No, please don’t. Pick the most 
important details, and write about those. For instance, in that digital camera example, 
write about the one thing that makes this camera better than its predecessor. Is it the 
camera’s ability to shoot image-stabilized HD video as well as pro-quality stills? Write 
about that, rather than waxing poetic about megapixels, ISO numbers, and a long list of 
shooting modes included in the camera’s interminable menus. 
 Find the meat of the story, write about it, put it into context, and nail it. Few read-
ers will remember a ﬂ urry of details, but more will remember a single point you made. 
Tell them why that new feature that you singled out is so important; tell them some-
thing they didn’t already know. Some of your readers will be interested in the minutiae— 
provide them with a link to a list of the product speciﬁ cations. That should satisfy the 
small percentage of people who want to know every detail. 
 Include “telling detail,” a ﬁ ner point that could potentially explain a situation in a 
more poetic and lucid way than your own explanation. If a politician kept ﬁ ddling with 
her hair during a debate, write that instead of saying, “She was nervous.” If a musician 
ﬂ ipped off the crowd and threw a water bottle at his roadies, write that instead of “He 
looked angry.” Blogging is a visual medium, and the text should reﬂ ect that vibrancy and 
immediacy. 
 Another consideration when you’re trying to decide what to write about and what 
to leave out: Take a look at the picture you’ve selected to go along with your post. If, 
for example, you can plainly see that the camera you’re writing about is available in 
four different colors, you need not mention that in the text. The same goes for food, 
cars, people—anything visual. Why show it once and say it twice? Economy of lan-
guage is key. 
 Some topics simply cry out for detail, and that’s when you can artfully include numer-
ous speciﬁ cations in your post. There is a way to do this, but you must be clever about 
it. For example, you can use some of the camera’s attributes as modiﬁ ers, like so: “This 
12-megapixel sharpshooter gets you up close with its macro lens.” While it’s best to avoid 
long lists of specs, if you must include them, compare them with other competing prod-
ucts for context.

 Repeating Yourself Again and Again, Using Unneeded, 
Unnecessary, and Uncalled-For Words and Phrases 
and Expressions and Stuff 
 Avoid constructing a twenty-word sentence when four words will do. Think more like 
Mickey Spillane, with his arresting four-word sentence, “He punched him, hard.” Think 
about Ernest Hemingway’s six-word short story: “For sale: Baby shoes, never worn.” Be 
yourself when you write, shedding that college-level formality you used when writ-
ing those oh-so-important term papers. This means you can toss out all those wordy 
and useless phrases you have swimming around in your brain. We’ll give you a little 
preview. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it contains the ones that bother us 
the most:

 Developing Your Writer’s Voice 
 Once you’ve gotten comfortable with grammar, vocabulary, word usage, and all those other 
nitpicky details, toss it all out the window and be yourself. By now, that should all be auto-
matic. The most important thing you need to do as a blogger is to develop your own voice, 
and the way to do that is toss the caution and let your readers get to know you. 
 Will you be friendly? Angry? Rant-prone? Authoritative? An expert?  Reader-dependent? 
Whiny? Asking a lot of questions like we are right now? Look at your posts and see if 
there’s a thread connecting them all. Do they sound alike? Can readers tell you wrote it 
because of the style? Then you, sir/madam, have a voice. Do your humble authors have 
distinctive voices? Can you tell which of us wrote this paragraph? Go ahead, guess. 
 Be warned: Your voice may move into your everyday writing, something that could 
hinder you if your day job involves more formal forms of communication. While we’ve 
never met a person whose writing hasn’t been improved by regular blogging, we have 
noticed a change in tone and detail when it comes to more advanced projects. Take this 
book, for example: We wrote it like we would write a blog post, peppered with whimsy 
and in a conversational style. However, if we had to go to work tomorrow and write docu-
mentation for a computer system or a digital camera, we’d be concerned the blogging 
style may emerge. Writing for blogs is different from writing for, say, a law ofﬁ ce. Be aware 
of the effects blogging may have on your outlook and voice. 
 Think of it this way: You wouldn’t go up to your best pal and start phrasing things 
differently, picking out unusual words, and distracting your friend with ﬂ owery phrases 
from somewhere way beyond left ﬁ eld. Of course not. You’ll get to the point of what you’re

saying, speaking clearly in a friendly tone, and injecting everything you say with . . . the 
essence of you. That’s what you need to do with your writing. Relax, be yourself, ﬁ nd your 
personal essence, and put it down on the page. 
 An easy way to accomplish this exercise is to imagine one particular person you’re 
writing for, and then dash out your post while keeping that person in mind, telling the 
story exactly the way you would if the two of you were face to face. Just like you would 
with your best friend, don’t be afraid to take risks, veer over to that quirky angle, inject 
humor, and generally play around with your message. But if you’re not funny, or quirky, 
or never generally play around with anything, don’t start doing it now. Just be yourself. 
 How to Keep Your Readers Engaged 
 You picked your blog’s topic already, right? That doesn’t mean you have to write only 
about an extremely narrow subject. Part of what will entertain your readers is the ele-
ment of surprise, where you write occasional posts that are entirely off topic, but are 
certainly something your readers have never seen. Don’t be afraid to diversify. Keep 
your mind open to novelty, and your readers will thank you for it. You might choose 
to place this sort of novelty on your blog at random, or you could reserve a day and 
time for your quirkiness—for example, “Freaky Friday’s craziest video,” or “Kooky Pic of 
the Day.” Tie these themed ideas into your topic, and they’re even better. Keeping your 
posts unpredictable plays into the main reason your readers are visiting your blog: for 
entertainment. 
 You can also write outside of your comfort zone to gain a new readership. For exam-
ple, we often recommend writing about topics outside of your realm of experience, but 
on topics that will appeal to other bloggers you admire. One blogger we spoke with writes 
primarily about parenting the over-twenty-one set—boomerang kids—but she wrote a 
handful of posts about “technology and the older parent” to catch the attention of a few 
of the tech blogs. 
 This is not “writing to suit.” Instead, it is more like writing to get a bit more attention 
and to cross over into other audiences. If you write primarily about cars, why not write 
about a bike that features some special Porsche technology? If you write about beekeep-
ing, why not interview a scientist about ecological issues facing not just bees but birds, 
trees, and even humans? You’re trying to gather new readers by working outside of your 
comfort zone. 
 Scannability 
 Make your writing more accessible by inserting scannable elements such as boldface 
subheads, or short beginning sentences for each paragraph that are highlighted in bold-
face. See that subhead above this paragraph? That’s making this text more scannable. 
These elements encourage your site visitors to read your post, luring them with easily 
accessible, bite-sized pieces rather than the gigantic wall of solid text. 
 At the very least, follow our earlier suggestion of keeping your paragraphs from run-
ning on too long, further discouraging your readers to dive in. When your paragraphs get 
longer than four or ﬁ ve lines, that’s pushing the edge of too much text in one place for a 
blog. Many of your readers will scan just the subheads if you do give them these boldface 
steppingstones, but that’s better than having them skip reading the page altogether.

 Blogging Traps 
 When you begin blogging, all is lilacs and peppermints. However, after a few weeks or 
months, you may ﬁ nd your resolve and attitude wavering and waning. Don’t worry; it 
happens to everybody. Maintain your 1,000-word minimum and watch out for these blog-
ging traps. 
 The Cynicism Trap 
 There is a period in blogging when nothing you do is any good and you will become 
mean. Commenters will know you’re not writing well, and they’ll call you on it. You’ll also 
notice that nothing is any good and that everything you write about is, in a word, stupid. 
You’ve hit the cynicism cycle, but if you’re careful you can escape it fairly quickly. 
 Writers, when given the opportunity to express their opinions to a real audience, will 
eventually gravitate to a period of wild cynicism. We’ve seen it happen time and time 
again: Let’s say you’re a new blogger who gains some readers and becomes an expert in a 
ﬁ eld. Instead of looking at things with fresh eyes, you’d rather that your chosen topic be 
shut down altogether. You’ve started to believe there’s nothing new under the sun for you 
to write about. You’ll be so enamored with the process that you’ll forget the ground rules. 
Stop, take a deep breath, and start writing “straight” news. Don’t inject your wisecracks 
or cynicism into the news and slowly dig yourself out of the cynicism trap. 
 This is only one of the traps bloggers will face, but it is the most insidious and the 
most damaging. If unchecked, the cynicism trap could become your entire MO, thereby 
reducing the value of your opinion. Watch for untoward anger toward your subject, and 
slow it down before it runs away with you. 
 The Swearing Trap 
 Go ahead and swear, but watch out: You’re writing for a big audience. If you assume 
your audience is comfortable with your language, so be it. We’re not here to stop you. 
As a rule of thumb, however, treat swearing the same way you’d treat lawn fertilizer—a 
little can help a sentence pop, a lot can burn out your whole post. Our stance is there 
should be no profanity in straight news reporting, and as much as you see ﬁ t in more 
 opinion-orientated pieces. As blogs mature, this is changing. For instance, when we ﬁ rst 
started writing for  Gizmodo , we both liberally used vulgarities, even in headlines. As the 
years went by, a quiet plea to omit them in headlines emerged from the ivory tower of 
management. Now, the site is nowhere near as profane as it once was. That’s because 
excess profanity can chase away a mainstream audience. Now, we don’t choose to swear 
a lot when we write about tech, damn it, but politics could drive you toward uttering a 
blue word or two. It’s your choice, but remember that not all vulgarities and oaths are 
created equal. You might be able to get away with a saucy vulgarity sometimes, but be 
careful with the F word, and unless you’re a skinhead or crazy, never use racial or sexist 
slurs. Your commenters will let you know if you’ve gone too far. 
 The Context Trap 
 In most blog posts, context is king. You may have followed a story from beginning to end, 
but that doesn’t mean a new reader has followed you on that journey. Remember that 
nothing is ever self-evident. Assume that your readers are familiar with what you’ve

written about in the past, but always offer a way for newer visitors to further research 
the topic at hand if they are unfamiliar with all of the details. How? You can simply write 
something like “If you’ll recall, XYZ Corp. was involved in shady dealings (detailed here) 
in the cat food trade, resulting in an ASPCA investigation.” The words “detailed here” will 
link back to a previous story about the topic you—or someone else—wrote. You can also 
link to resources like dictionaries or Wikipedia or you can add a few links at the bottom 
of the story pointing to previous stories in the same thread. For example, perhaps you’re 
writing about the building of a new dam on a nearby river. You can link to the ﬁ rst story 
written—the proposal for the dam passing at City Hall—and then the subsequent debate 
and discussion. This is called a “tick-tock,” and newspapers used to create these stories 
at the end of a news cycle, recounting everything that happened from the beginning. 
This is rarely productive, however, and as you can imagine, it’s far easier to use hyper-
links to build a timeline for your reader to follow along in history. And, if you hyperlink 
to stories you’ve written on your own blog, it’s a great way to enhance your pageview 
statistics. 
 You should also use tags and categories to create archives of data for your readers. For 
example,  CrunchGear  used to have a set of tag pages—words that WordPress recognizes 
as tags—to organize posts on a particular topic. If you visit crunchgear.com/tag/ipad, you 
will ﬁ nd a list of all iPad-related posts we’ve ever written. Consult your blogging plat-
form’s instructions for handling tags and use them to add context to your stories within 
the text. 
 The “Not Today” Trap 
 Blogging is like any sustained, regular activity: You get better with practice and you 
get worse with inattention. If you put something off today, you’ll probably put it off 
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Like working out and ﬂ ossing, blogging should 
become a habit before it becomes your job. Remember: a dead blog is worse than no blog 
at all.  
 Types of Posts 
 Short Post 
 This is where blogs started. A writer would roam the web, ﬁ nd interesting links, hopefully 
add a comment or two, and publish it in a time-based layout starting with the latest posts 
at the top. It was a web log of what the author had seen that day, or that hour, similar to 
the way Twitter is used today. A short blog post is probably going to be the mainstay of 
your site, where you ﬁ nd a story, post a picture of it, brieﬂ y tell the readers the gist of the 
story, add a pithy comment or some context of your own, and you’re done. Write it tight. 
No need to be overly verbose—just make your point, perhaps link to another story within 
your blog that you’ve written on a similar topic, and then show them the link where you 
found the story, letting them peruse all the details for themselves. 
 Reviews 
 If your blog is about products or services, here’s where you show your stuff. The pres-
ence of reviews on your site can accomplish a lot, such as protecting your readers from

slipshod products, alerting them to spectacular values and showing them aspects of a 
product no one else has noticed yet. Beyond that, a good review satisﬁ es your readers’ 
basic curiosity about a product. When you’re reviewing products, the objective is to call 
’em as you see ’em, just like an impartial umpire at a baseball game. Prove yourself to 
be a trustworthy guide to your topic. Along the way, you’ll learn a lot about your chosen 
ﬁ eld, getting your hands on the products that deﬁ ne your blog’s essence. Reviews can be 
simple and short when you’re covering a minor product, or can be thousands of words 
long if you’re covering a complicated and important item. 
 If you’re writing a technology blog or something that involves a highly technical 
review, we recommend creating a boilerplate header for reviews. For example,  TechCrunch 
usually uses a bulleted list of pertinent features and then a basic pros/cons list. Then we 
have a “short version” of the review to sum up our opinions. 
 Using that macro software for Mac we told you about in  Chapter 2  called QuicKeys (or 
KeyText for Windows), we paste this boilerplate into every review. It saves time. Instead 
of entering the code for those lists, we simply type “revhed” and the following HTML 
appears in our posts. 
 <strong>Features:</strong> 
 <ul> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 </ul> 
 <strong>Pros:</strong> 
 <ul> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 </ul> 
 <strong>Cons:</strong> 
 <ul> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 <li></li> 
 </ul> 
 These sorts of macro systems are excellent if you type the same things over and 
over again and are available on both Macs and PCs. Develop your own “look and feel” 
for reviews for your blog, such as various icons for pros and cons, or your own rating 
system.

 Features 
 A “feature” is a longer story about a speciﬁ c subject or news item. It can be a proﬁ le—a 
discussion of a person or item—in context or it can tell a longer story. Feel free to split 
longer features up into multiple posts. 
 You’re close to your subject, studying it every day and discovering all the details sur-
rounding it. Give your readers perspective by writing in-depth features about your chosen 
topic. As you work on your blog each day, develop a running list of features that you’d 
be interested in learning more about. If there is a local event that ﬁ ts into your category, 
attend that, take lots of pictures, and turn it into a feature. Identify relationships between 
subjects that you routinely cover, and write an exposé. Think about trends, undercur-
rents, and potentially explosive controversies within your chosen ﬁ eld, and then call 
some experts, interview people, and turn that kernel of an idea into a full-blown feature. 
A few good features add a lot of credibility. 
 There’s an old adage that often rings true:  posts bring pageviews, but features bring 
readers.  Some of the most important features you write might not get tremendous waves 
of pageviews, but regular readers will appreciate the more in-depth articles. That appre-
ciation can spread to multitudes of other readers through word of mouth or linking on 
social networks. Think long-term. That could likely be responsible for a slow groundswell 
of growth that will eventually make your blog consistently successful. 
 Lists 
 There’s good reason why lists of items are so popular on the web. Their ordinal nature 
implies judgment, where you’ve placed all of the items on that list in a hierarchical layout. 
The posts are written in bite-sized, easy-to-digest chunks. They’re enticing, and readers 
eat them up, especially if you pick compelling items for your lists but stick to your prem-
ise. And, if you place a picture with each of your list items, they serve a pictorial purpose, 
entertaining those readers who don’t feel like diving into intense text. 
 Infographic 
 Gather a pile of facts, ﬁ gures, and statistics about a topic, and if you’re a pretty good Pho-
toshop artist, you can put together a large, visually pleasing graphic that’ll be packed with 
information that’s easy to scan. This kind of visual presentation has gained considerable 
popularity lately. If you come up with a good idea for an infographic but your design skills 
won’t quite let you execute it yourself, ﬁ nd someone who can, and the resulting boost 
in trafﬁ c might be well worth your time, effort, and expenditure. We noticed at  Mashable 
that the most successful infographics are more than just a page full of graphs. Sprinkle 
fun facts within, along with amusing illustrations, and you’ll have yourself a winning 
formula. 
 Commentary 
 Go ahead, rant! This is your chance to sound off, telling them what you really think. Of 
course, nearly all of your posts and articles will contain your opinions, but this category 
lets you dive into the controversy, raise new talking points, and get your readers worked 
up. Don’t be afraid to take a stand on an issue, but keep in mind that if most of your 
readers disagree with you, you could be wrong. When you’re writing your commentary,

it helps to cite facts to back up each of your points, along with links to your sources so 
readers can see the information for themselves. Don’t just pull a bunch of statements out 
of your ass whose sole factual support is “because I said so”—well, unless you’re a proven 
expert in the ﬁ eld. Don’t be “Captain Obvious,” stating opinions that are so well-trodden 
that everyone knows about them and has heard them over and over. The goal here is to 
introduce viewpoints to your readers that they might not have ever considered. At the 
same time, if readers have considered your opinions themselves and wondered if anyone 
else ever thought that way, they’ll get a lift, enjoying the commiseration and validation. 
You get extra juju if you think up a topic that’s bugging everyone but few have written 
about it yet. Just be sure you clearly mark your missive as “opinion.” 
 Poll/Quiz 
 When you’re ﬁ rst starting out, your number of readers will be so small, it will be embar-
rassing to create a poll, but a quiz will work with any number of readers. Polls and quizzes 
have the underlying advantage of adding to your pageview count, because most require 
more than one page to register votes and display results. Quizzes are a ripe opportunity 
for humor, slipping in some absurd answers along with the right ones. Be sure to con-
gratulate those who did well on the quiz, while gently ribbing those who didn’t. 
 Polls will entice those readers who don’t normally take the trouble to comment to 
participate. They can be versatile, occupying a small space on your front page, or turning 
into an entire demographic study within your site. Polls are easy to insert on any site, 
and at  Mashable  we’ve had good experiences with  Polldaddy ( http://polldaddy.com ), which 
allows us to customize the look of the poll. You create the poll on the  Polldaddy site, and 
when you’re done, like  YouTube , you’re provided with code to embed on your own site 
to display the poll. It’s an easy way (and free for those just starting out with less than 
100 responses per month) to create quick polls, and we recommend it highly.  
 Pro Tip 
 If you want to get more in-depth with your readers and find out demographic 
information, their story preferences, or anything else about them, you’ll need to create a survey. 
A popular online survey service is Survey Monkey, whose basic free plan lets you create a ten-
question survey with up to 100 responses per survey, probably enough for a site that’s just 
starting out. But to get a large enough sample for validity of your data, you’ll need to spring for 
at least the “Select” plan, giving you unlimited questions and responses for $17 per month. 
 Caption 
 If you ﬁ nd a video, picture, or sight gag that tells a story by itself, a caption underneath 
that content consisting of a half-dozen words or less might be all you need. Other times, 
photos or videos need more setup and explanation, but keep it simple and let the pictures 
do most of the talking. You might even dive into the latest click-whoring gallery scheme 
where you present a group of twenty photographs or videos in a slideshow or gallery for-
mat, with each pic earning you a click. Go ahead, write your story within the captions for 
each of the gallery items, but know this: Many readers are increasingly annoyed at this 
obvious ploy for more pageviews. You might consider placing all the photos or embedded

videos on one easily scrollable page with captions attached, just to keep your readers 
happy (at  Mashable , we offer a single-page option for all of our galleries). On the other 
hand, if you’re looking for a bonanza of pageviews, see what happens when you write a 
blockbuster post with thirty photos, each earning its own pageview. So here it is: Should 
you make your site easy to navigate and please your readers, or go for the gold? The deci-
sion is yours, Captain, but we’d say keep your decisions user-friendly most of the time. 
 Interview 
 If you get lucky enough (or if you’re aggressive or well-connected enough) to have a chance 
to talk with a newsmaker, important person, or generally interesting industry maven, you 
might want to transcribe that VIP’s words into a text interview, just like the ones that 
appear in  Playboy magazine. And yes, we do read the articles in that girlie mag. Get your-
self a voice recorder or use an app on your smartphone, and record that celebrity’s every 
word, later transcribing it faithfully for your readers. Try making it punchier by publishing 
only the most pithy phrases and sentences, but don’t edit it so much that the content is 
distorted. If it doesn’t play well as a full verbatim interview, write a story with numerous 
quotes. If you’re up for it, shoot video of your interview for the full face-to-face effect, or 
you can go for a combination of transcript and audio ﬁ le, giving your readers a choice of 
hearing or reading the interview.  
 How-To 
 How-tos are some of the most popular posts you can write. People love them. The goal of 
a how-to (some people call them tutorials) is to explain a process in step-by-step fashion, 
describing each step in as much detail as you can muster. What kind of how-tos can you 
post? Beer bloggers can write about how to pour the perfect pint. Knitters can describe 
special stitches. Bike bloggers can describe brake upgrades. Anything you do and want 
others to learn is fair game. 
 Battles 
 Will your blog be a pugnacious, ﬁ ghting publication? Will you be constantly on the offen-
sive, aggressively attacking anything and everything? Picking ﬁ ghts with everyone and 
anyone is not necessarily a strategy—it’s just aggression. On top of that, if you always go 
negative, your writing becomes predictable. Pick your battles. Attack a product or a per-
son only if something outrageous has happened. Keep in mind that it’s always easier to 
tear things down than to build them up, and you might discover that you’re going nega-
tive just because it’s easier. Finally, protect yourself from libel lawsuits by refraining from 
attacking someone with false accusations. Truth is the best defense, so if you’re going to 
get into the negative game, be sure you have the truth on your side. 
 Graphics and How to Use Them 
 Find a graphic for every post.  If you’re writing about a product, this is easy, because compa-
nies are usually more than happy to provide you with high-resolution shots of their prod-
ucts from all conceivable angles. In that context, feel free to use any company-supplied 
pictures you want.

 In other cases, combining or modifying graphics using Photoshop (or any other image 
editor) usually turns those graphical elements into a new-enough image, especially if 
you’re making fun of those depicted within—copyright law calls it “parody.” The Fair Use 
provisions of U.S. copyright law will usually protect you when you want to use pieces of 
images, particularly if they’re small, otherwise known as “thumbnails.” 
 If you’re in doubt and feeling paranoid, ask the organization that owns those images 
for permission before publishing. That’s not good enough for some corporations and those 
who want to follow the letter of the law. Each site has its own philosophy; for example, at 
 Mashable  and at one NBC site, each graphic we used required written permission from its 
owner. Within the same company, at another NBC site, we were allowed to grab graphics 
from wherever we wanted, regardless of whether we linked to its owner. At  Mashable , we 
used only graphics we bought from iStockPhoto or Getty Images, and graphics or photos 
we’d created ourselves, were provided by companies, or were licensed for Creative Com-
mons. Many of those images can be found on the photo-sharing site Flickr.com, and are 
easily found by using search engines such as CC Search ( http://search.creativecommons.
org/ ) or Compﬁ ght.com.  
 Snark and the Single Blogger 
 Comedy and snark are deﬁ ning characteristics of blogs, but they’re not necessary to write 
interesting posts. Because both of your humble narrators spent many of our formative 
years at the snark capital of the world, otherwise known as Gawker Media, we sometimes 
ﬁ nd ourselves spewing out geyser-loads of snarkcasm. Here’s how we’ve controlled that 
urge: if you do choose to go snarky, remember to use a light touch. As we described ear-
lier, the Cynicism Trap will capture you in its clutches when you least expect it, resulting 
in less humor and more bile. 
 The easiest way to decide on insult humor is to remember the old rule of thumb for 
comedy: saying “I suck” is funny, saying “You suck” is not funny. While there are many 
insult comics who make a decent living, there are far more comics who focus more on 
introspective humor. 
 Use humor and snark the way you’d use any writing technique. Repetition can get 
boring. However, it’s always fun to end a post with a quip or include a funny graphic that 
closely relates to your topic. Serious blogs are often too straight-laced for many readers, 
and the wellspring of most early blogs was snark, wit, and anger. Poking fun at your sub-
jects or yourself is the soul of blogging. 
 War Story 
 At  Mashable , Charlie never once had anyone refuse to allow him to use a 
photo, even if it was an exclusive. But that was on a major site where a link back to the picture’s 
originator was valuable. It might not be so easy if you’re just starting out. 
 With conceptual stories, commentaries, and features, graphics can get a little trickier. 
In our experience, if we use a picture found on another website, simply linking to that site 
at the end of the article is not enough—you must ask the owner of that graphic for per-
mission to use it. If it’s a unique, clever graphic, you’re better off creating one of your own.

 However, remember that sarcasm doesn’t translate well in the blogging arena. Users 
read your posts quickly and often with minimal comprehension. Parodies can work well 
as long as you’re over the top. Imagine that blogging is like mime—to express emotion, 
the emotion has to be exaggerated to the point of being grotesque. For example, users 
who may not know your position on a topic may see your sarcasm as support or condem-
nation of a competing viewpoint. This, in turn, leads to angry comments hurled in your 
direction. 
 Post Length 
 Mashable ,  TechCrunch , and  Gizmodo  were all built on the concept of variety, where long 
posts have always been juxtaposed with medium-length and shorter posts. This works 
because you’re giving busy readers a way to quickly entertain themselves with the short 
posts, while offering in-depth coverage to those with longer attention spans and higher 
interest levels. This also gives you the ability to write longer pieces for more complicated 
topics, and ﬁ re away short, punchy posts that make just a single point. 
 Some say longer posts gather more readers—we disagree. Longer posts require real 
dedication from a busy reader and unless your writing is top-notch, you can expect a 
reader to stop at the third graf. If you haven’t held a reader’s attention for that long with 
your prose, you’re sunk. 
 Many bloggers focus primarily on longer posts, writing one or two items per day. 
This is one way to go, but these bloggers often include large, enticing photos and lots of 
commentary. The best examples of these include the aforementioned  BikeSnobNYC and 
 ABlogToRead .com, a blog about watches. 
 Being a Better Blogger 
 As you blog, constantly strive to improve. Reread old posts for typos. Plan new posts. 
Assess, through analytics, what gets the most attention. See which posts attract the most 
visitors—those are your readers telling you what they want. Give them what they want! 
Write posts that  you’d  like to read. Create goals and match them. These are steps you 
need to take to become a better blogger. If you do this every day or do this as a source 
of livelihood, all of these improvements will come naturally. However, if you don’t treat 
blogging as a daily exercise you will not succeed. 
 Here are some tips for better blogging: 
 •  Write punchy: Not every sentence has to be ﬁ fty words long. Write text that is short, 
concise, and rhythmic. 
 •  Remember the pyramid structure of news writing and use it as often as possible. 
 •  Use quotes: Quotes from your original source are an excellent way to propel a story 
along without much work. 
 •  Use short paragraphs: Your lede and nut should be as short and concise as possible. 
 •  Write as if no one wants to ﬁ nish your stories: Remember that your readers don’t have 
a lot of time. You are vying for their attention. Unless you give them a good reason to 
keep coming back, they won’t. 
 •  Write for the F: Studies have found that the average reader looks at two words in a 
headline and reads in an F pattern—sliding their eyes along the ﬁ rst line, then barely

How to Write a Blog Post
106
6
grazing the remaining lines, until they hit the end of the page. The remainder of the F, 
the downstroke, is them skimming the rest of the story. Put your most important news 
in the top bar of that F. 
 •  Modern readers love brevity over longer stories: This is a fact of journalism. Your beau-
tifully wrought tick-tock about the rise of a political ﬁ gure will be overshadowed by 
pictures of that ﬁ gure  in ﬂ agrante . This does not mean we want you to pander—we just 
want you to understand what makes news. Building a great story out of great news is 
excellent, but, to quote the bard, “Be brief, I pray you.” 
 •  Look at the rest of the story: What are other sites missing when it comes to your story? 
What can you add? 
 •  Leave your ofﬁ ce: Go and meet people—even PR people. Go and explore your beat by 
going to a conference or meeting. Hands-on posts are much more valuable and widely 
read. 
 •  Do no harm: Don’t be a battle blogger, always itching for a ﬁ ght. Do your own thing 
and work with other bloggers. Competition in the blogging space is real and it’s tight, 
but you don’t have to stoop to “beating” the other guy on news items that everyone 
shares. Shine with your exclusives and scoops, and work together on the news that 
may or may not bring readers. You should always keep the competition in mind, but 
in many cases it’s far better to link to another blogger and create a relationship of 
mutual trust. Many people try to fake links in hopes of better rankings on search 
engines. Why not ask a friendly blogger to link to you because she owes you a favor 
for linking to her? It happens every day, and it’s a helpful way for a blogger to gain 
traction.  
 Writing So Someone Will Read You 
 Imagine your ideal reader. That reader is who you need to be writing for every day you 
blog. The ideal reader could be your dad. She could be your wife. She could be a blogger 
you particularly admire. Aim to write things that readers will understand. 
 The moment you write solely for Google or keywords or other SEO claptrap is the 
moment you’ve stopped writing for humans. There are far too many examples of news 
sources that focus primarily on getting pageviews, clicks, and advertising impressions. 
Those are secondary to your goal and come organically with good work. Let no one tell 
you different. 
 Write for people. Learn about your audience and ask them what they need or want. 
Create a mailing list for your blog and send surveys every half a year. Use systems like 
Mailchimp and Survey Monkey to create these feedback loops. 
 Your goal is to be indispensable to your readership. Understanding them completely 
does this. Writing speciﬁ cally for them ensures they will read you again and again. 
 As bloggers we’re given permission to write in any way we see ﬁ t. We can be crazy, 
we can be wacky, or we can be deadly serious. It’s this freedom that is so frightening to 
the average journalist who grew up in an era of editors, deadlines, and free coffee in the 
newsroom. Those days, it’s sad to note, are long gone. 
 Most important, however, is write things you’d love to read. If we can offer any advice 
to you, the ﬂ edgling blogger, it’s that you must believe that what you have to say is impor-
tant. You’re doing yourself a disservice by not sharing it.

 Email and Its Discontents 
 Not exactly sure you want to create a public blog? You can follow all of these same rules 
while creating an email newsletter, essentially building a digest of stories that you blast 
out to your followers. While this technique isn’t as popular as building a blog, it does have 
its advantages, especially for more business-oriented sites. 
 What does an email newsletter get you? Well, you have a dedicated swarm of readers 
who are, on the average, going to read your posts. It also lends an air of exclusivity to your 
content. One blogger, Jason Calacanis, even capped his email list at a certain number of 
people to exude a sort of exclusivity associated with fancy handbags and secret night-
clubs. If you have to earn a place at the table, you tend to eat whatever’s given you. 
 So how do you create an email newsletter? I’d recommend using something like 
Mailchimp, a mailing list service that lets you send a massive number of emails for about 
$40 a month. Mailchimp allows you to embed “Subscribe” code in your web page so peo-
ple can sign up to your newsletter and then offers multiple templates and other goodies 
to contact your list regularly. Email is a great contact medium. While many love social 
media, it’s not quite there in terms of reach and return on investment. Building an email 
list is a great way to maintain contact with your audience. 
 Should you just use an email newsletter and not a blog? That’s up to you. Some of 
the best blogs have an email component, and it’s become more and more important to 
have a great list of avid readers. In short, it’s a good idea, but offering email-only content 
depends on your goal. Are you aiming to be an expert that sells your expertise to a certain 
audience? Do you write about a very speciﬁ c niche? Are you willing to forgo advertising 
revenue for reach? 
 Create 
 First, familiarize yourself with your mailing application. Many systems allow for rich 
emails that include images and nice-looking text. We’d recommend creating two news-
letters and allow users to opt-in for a text-only version. You will also need to build a list. 
Don’t steal or buy email addresses. Your email newsletter needs to grow organically or 
you risk being banned from your email provider and angering a whole mess of people. 
 Email once a week, but ﬁ ll the newsletter with a week’s worth of content. Daily emails 
are horrible, and monthly emails are easy to forget. Your goal is to create an experience 
for your readers, something they expect to see and enjoy regularly. 
 Write your emails like you would write a blog post. In fact, we’d recommend leading 
people back to your blog. Reading long-form writing in a mail window is a tough sell. 
 Solicit 
 Now you have to ﬁ nd those readers. As with any online endeavor, you will ﬁ nd yourself 
preaching to an empty room until you grow your audience. This is natural and shouldn’t 
frustrate you. We’d recommend creating a website for your newsletter and placing your 
text up there a few days after you email it out. You can also truncate articles and encour-
age readers to get the whole thing by requesting they sign up for your newsletter. You can 
also create an interstitial ad requesting that people join your mailing list. In this case you 
can treat your blog as a secondary location for your hard-won content.

 Distribute 
 Now press send. And repeat. An email newsletter must appear regularly and at approxi-
mately the same time on the same day of the week. Imagine it as a television sitcom. 
 Modern Family  doesn’t just appear whenever the station feels like it. Instead, it appears at 
a set time and location. This familiarity is key and will keep people coming back. 
 What’s the most important thing? You now have a huge list of emails you can use 
to contact your readers about special content and offers. In fact, this also allows you to 
monetize by offering products right inside your emails—but be careful. Today’s email 
newsletter is tomorrow’s spam.

 Mob Rule, Inciting 
a Riot, and Freedom 
of Speech 
 It’s a common perception that in the old days, journalists resided in their ivory towers, 
typing out their sacred texts and knowing their readers would absorb their scribbling 
without question. Some readers wanting to raise a stink about what was written would 
sit down at their typewriters and peck out a letter to the editor. Those journalists who 
received such screeds would often toss them in the trash, but every once in a while a few 
of them would ﬁ nd their way into print. Those were published alongside the sacred texts, 
completing the circle of communication. The cranks had one page in the paper while the 
journalists had the other hundred. 
 This mode of communication in which writer is disconnected from reader created an 
aura of permissiveness, and more important, an infallibility that gave rise to images of 
“papers of record” recording every important thing happening in the world. But papers 
of record are fallible, and without oversight these journalists became egoists and felt 
beholden to no one except, perhaps, the grouchy editor at the top. 
 There were reasons this system existed. It protected journalists from outside attacks 
and allowed for some truly groundbreaking stories—stories that redeﬁ ned the paths of 
nations and history—to appear in print. However, it created an exclusive club of journal-
ists who looked down on so-called citizen journalism and the voice of the rabble. They 
controlled the conversation. 
 This is clearly no longer the case. 
 Fast-forward to the present, where letters to the editor, now called “commenting” in 
the text of blogs and websites, have been completely transformed into instant reaction. 
Depending on how you set up your blog, usually readers can immediately and anony-
mously pound out their opinions, appearing directly below what you just wrote. It’s a 
conversation, where you receive instant feedback. Welcome to the roller-coaster world of 
blog comments. As a blogger, one day you’ll love them, and sometimes, even a few sec-
onds later, you’ll loathe them. 
 One reason to love them: They let you dip your toe into the tremendous power 
of what’s called “crowdsourcing.” The collective IQ of a large group of readers who’ve 
been inspired to comment about your post is mind-boggling. It’s a level of intelligence

signiﬁ cantly higher than any individual could ever muster, and can serve as an ampliﬁ er 
for your posts, a wellspring of new information you might never have considered. Unfor-
tunately, sometimes this crowd can be a cruel and instant editor, notifying you of just 
how wrong you really are. 
 In blogging, the crowd acts as your copy editor, your fact checker, and the crabby boss 
upstairs. By creating an open forum for people to express their views, opinions, and edu-
cation on a particular topic, you, the blogger, are able to get much more done in a shorter 
time and with a smaller budget. This is not to say you can write junk and expect the 
crowd to ﬁ x it for you. Instead, think of the crowd as both cheering section and inquisi-
tor. Heck, it’s almost like a jury of your peers. They are not interested in what you  meant ; 
they’re interested in what you  wrote . 
 What does this mean? It means that everything you write must have context. You 
cannot assume your reader knows anything about your topic or that your reader assumes 
 you know anything about the topic. Your reader assumes you are an idiot on the Internet 
unless proven otherwise and vice versa. The age of civil discourse has, sadly, passed, and 
your every foible will be fodder for wild rants. 
 But don’t let it get to you. Our rule of thumb is this: for every rude comment there are 
ten innocuous comments and two positive comments. Take these other twelve to heart 
and learn from the rant or, barring that, ignore it. 
 But sometimes you’ll hate the comments you get. Sure, many of them are instructive 
and constructive, and will effectively show you the error of your ways. Others are simple 
 ad hominem  attacks, making you feel so bad that you’ll be ruminating over some of these 
insults all night long and well into the next day. Yes, we’ve been there, receiving criticisms 
so harsh that we’ve never forgotten the pain they cause. But as a blogger, know this: you 
will be criticized, and you will be praised. Develop a thick skin now, because no matter 
how perfect and great a blogger and writer you are, sometimes you will be wrong, you 
will be criticized, and you will be hurt, badly. Get used to the idea now, and steel yourself 
for the torture that rains down upon you when you’re being attacked by an angry mob. 
 Before we begin exploring the madness of crowds, we want to offer two ironclad rules 
of conversational blogging. 
 It is a bad idea to delete comments.  There are good reasons to delete comments for 
content and tone and we’ll explore them, but unless we’re talking about spam or crazy 
talk, you are doing yourself and your readers a disservice if you delete more than one 
comment per week. 
 Also, do not delete a post that appears to have drawn criticism or anger.  Deleting a 
post for fear of retribution is a dangerous precedent to set on your site. If necessary, strike 
out the offending text using the <s> </s> tag in HTML and update the post, stating clearly 
why you updated it either in comments or in the post itself. Do this even if the story ends 
up being an entire post full of crossed-out text. You can correct or transparently modify a 
story, but to delete it raises problems of control and potential chilling effects. 
 Gizmodo ’s Commenting Evolution: A Case Study 
 In our early days at  Gizmodo , the privilege to comment, appearing in the form of a cov-
eted invitation, was rare. Before the “invite” system was implemented, Gawker blogs did 
not have comments at all. The pages were barren. It was a single voice braying to the 
multitudes, and sadly, that held the company’s sites back for almost two years. Then the

invite system was formed. We would require readers to  apply to become a commenter, 
asking them to write a sample comment or two. We’d want them to tell us why they’d 
like to express their opinions at the bottom of our posts. We needed them to assure us 
they wouldn’t be stinking up the place. If they passed through our gauntlet, we’d grant 
them access—a valuable privilege indeed, one they would guard carefully. Oddly enough, 
we were also encouraged to send comment invites to old-guard journalists. The men and 
women who wanted their readers to have no voice were suddenly faced with the alien 
concept of having one online. 
 The early  Gizmodo  commenters were part of an exclusive club, and took that honor 
seriously. They remained faithful to us, even though some of us Gizmodians (especially 
the site’s second editor, Joel Johnson) would ridicule them, pretending they were mind-
less drones who blurted out whatever ﬁ rst came to their feeble minds. Of course, the 
gentle ribbing we sent their way was all in good fun, because we appreciated what they 
wrote. They often took more time writing their comments than we had spent writing the 
posts to which they referred. 
 It was easy for us to love them. What’s not to love about a pack of sycophantic lap-
dogs that rarely criticized anything we wrote? Why risk their exclusive club membership 
by pissing on those who have bestowed it upon them? Every once in a while, they would 
object to (or correct) what we’d written (which was not a bad thing), but generally their 
criticism was constructive, albeit skewed toward the delicate, as far as criticism of us 
bloggers was concerned. 
 What was the result of this love fest? How did that work out for us? Well, the com-
ments we received were generally astute, often surpassing what we had written by orders 
of magnitude. Because we chose our commenters carefully, most of them were knowl-
edgeable, and some were even luminaries in their ﬁ elds. 
 But there was one problem with that. We had set up such a tall barrier to entry that 
we weren’t getting  enough  comments. Hungry to build trafﬁ c, we wanted more people 
involved in this instant criticism/praise/ampliﬁ cation, because more comments attract 
more trafﬁ c. Why? Once a reader had written a comment, that reader would usually 
return to the site repeatedly to see if there were any responses, reactions, praise, or criti-
cism of the comment. 
 And so we opened the ﬂ oodgates to commenters. Gone was the requirement that 
they pass some sort of test we had constructed. Our next technique was to let just 
about any commenter blurt out whatever they wanted, but then we would revoke their 
commenting privileges if they did something that displeased us. They would be banned. 
The banhammer was born. 
 An interim experiment involved a technique called “disemvowelling.” 1 Just as it 
sounds, it involves removing the vowels from an offending comment, turning it into 
barely readable gibberish that can still be vaguely understood if someone wants to go 
to the trouble. It’s an intermediate step before deleting a post, which lets you deny sup-
pression of unpleasant posts, but stops short of permitting it full run of your site. We’ve 
tried using this technique once or twice, but it seems to have an odd effect, where it only 
makes the offenders angrier, and confuses a lot of readers. If this sounds like something 
you’d be interested in trying, you can get plug-ins for content management systems such 
as Movable Type and WordPress that make the technique easy to implement. 
 Sometimes disemvowelling seemed too mild a remedy, so it was time to get out the 
banhammer. What would constitute grounds for banishment? At ﬁ rst, we had vague and

general guidelines—for example, if somebody was “being a douche,” we would ban that 
person. Other capital offenses included attacking a writer personally, repeatedly writing 
incorrect information, attacking other commenters, spamming us with links to their own 
sites, writing a bunch of clichés such as “I for one, welcome our ___ overlords,” annoy-
ing comments such as “How is this news?” or bragging how they were the ﬁ rst ones to 
 comment—boom! Down came the dreaded banhammer. 
 Interestingly, these are problems faced by most well-developed websites but rarely 
encountered by smaller sites. If a reader cries out “FIRST!” on your growing website, 
you’re probably going to welcome the excitement. By the ten-thousandth time, however, 
you’re going to get tired of it. 
 So, as you can see here, we were dealing with two ends of the spectrum with a few 
stopgaps in between. The ﬁ rst approach was the most restrictive. Going beyond moderat-
ing comments, we were moderating the commenters themselves. We created a club of 
quasi-journalists who added signiﬁ cantly to our content, but unfortunately didn’t add 
much to our trafﬁ c. Our reaction to that was the second approach, to swing open the 
doors to all who desired to comment, and then we’d weed out the trolls. But that wasn’t 
perfect, either—there would still be lots of inane comments sitting on our site until some-
one removed them. 
 What was  Gizmodo ’s solution to this problem? In those days, the site developed one 
of the best and most highly effective commenting systems on the web. Just like the tech-
nique that’s commonplace in kindergartens across the country, a gold star was awarded 
to commenters who proved themselves worthy. Once a commenter had earned that gold 
star, he or she then had the right to moderate other comments. How could commenters 
get one of these coveted baubles? According to  Gizmodo , “You just need to blow away the 
moderators with some great contributions in the comments and they’ll reward you with 
a star.” That gold star appears next to the commenter’s name with each entry. 
 Effectively,  Gizmodo  returned to the comment auditioning system, where user com-
ments didn’t show up on the site unless they’d been approved by either a  Gizmodo editor 
or one of the commenters who possessed a gold star. This caste system turned out to be 
extremely effective, making all lower-ranked commenters strive for the gold standard. 
This rising tide lifts all boats. The site also implemented proﬁ le pages for each com-
menter, where all that person’s comments, replies, private messages, proﬁ le picture, and 
friends appear. 
 Since then,  Gizmodo  has further reﬁ ned its commenting system, turning it into what 
Gawker Media calls Kinja. It allows readers to turn their proﬁ les into blogs, and lets them 
use the company’s commenting system. This lets them curate and moderate comments 
as if they were an editor on one of the main Gawker sites. This is a comment system 
taken to the extreme, almost like a comedian inviting hecklers onstage to see if they can 
do any better. 
 Short of building an elaborate and wonderful system such as this, there are other 
ways of using peer pressure to accomplish roughly the same thing. One effective tech-
nique is used on the explosively popular site Reddit, and the once-popular social journal-
ism site Digg. It uses crowdsourcing to elevate or demote comments. Readers can choose 
to click on either an up-arrow or down-arrow (or on one of the many custom icons cre-
ated in many of Reddit’s “Subreddits”), and as a commenter gets more votes, a number 
designating the vote count is prominently displayed. Comments with too many down

113
votes become invisible (but can still be accessed with a click), and the threshold of nega-
tive votes resulting in invisibility can be set by each user. It works well. 
 Now, the system of other readers voting their approval or disdain of another com-
ment with a single click is more commonplace. Even a simple system can have a positive 
effect, such as an option to recommend a comment by a single click on a “recommend” 
or “like” button, a technique used by  The New York Times . 
 We’ve had success at  Mashable  and  TechCruch  with Disqus (but  Mashable  and  TechCrunch 
have since moved beyond that to a Livefyre WordPress plug-in), a commenting system by 
Big Head Labs that’s gaining popularity on a variety of sites such as  CNN ,  Wired , and  The 
Daily Telegraph . Disqus is an online service that embeds a commenting system into your 
blog. It’s integrated with Facebook, Twitter, and Yahoo, and users can log in using those 
accounts; then their Disqus account can be used across any of the 500,000+ communities 
that have already installed the service. Our favorite part of Disqus? Its easy moderation 
tools, and its “like” button, letting others vote in support of a particular comment. The 
only thing missing is the downvoting capability that’s been so popular on Reddit. 
 There are many companies offering to “manage” your conversations for you, includ-
ing Disqus and Facebook. Although there are often major concerns about abusive com-
menters, what usually ends up happening is that most beginning bloggers just depend 
on the standard mode of anonymous or account-based comment systems available on 
most content management systems. Having to depend on third-party systems to prevent 
abuse and general douchebaggery is a good problem to have—it means you have lots of 
amazing discussion on your site that’s being slightly ruined by a few bad apples.  
 You’re in Control 
 These are all methods to moderate anonymous commenters. Beyond these crowdsourced 
methods, you can also moderate comments the old-fashioned way: Read them yourself, 
and delete those that displease you, or are contrary to your terms of service (which we’ll 
discuss later in this chapter). Or, you could engage in an activity that we wish were the 
standard throughout the Internet, and that is requiring your commenters to reveal their 
real names. 
 This is a controversial topic on the Internet at this writing, with those who are against 
using real names saying that many comments would never be made if people would be 
held accountable for them. Politically persecuted commenters won’t want to express neg-
ative feelings against their governments (think Arab Spring or the later conﬂ icts in Syria 
or Egypt) unless they can comment anonymously. Keep that in mind if you’re running 
a political or world-news blog. Barring that, however, we think people’s behavior when 
assured anonymity is skewing toward the antisocial, and often veers into the obnoxious, 
abusive, racist, homophobic, and even illegal. On top of that, the cowardice of the anony-
mous commenter is something we’d rather not support. However, banning anonymity 
will cost you comments, and the fewer comments you have, the less trafﬁ c. 
 One way to banish anonymity is to require people to use a Facebook proﬁ le if they 
want to comment (Disqus doesn’t  require  the user to log in using a traceable account such 
as Facebook). That way, their real reputation is at stake every time they type anything on 
your site. Or you could simply require people to use their real names, and conﬁ rm their 
identities via email. This is not perfect, but many times it’s better than nothing.

 Some form of comment moderation is necessary, even if it does feel like censorship. 
Let us remind you that the First Amendment forbids only  government censorship of writ-
ings and speech. It doesn’t apply to your blog, where you’re allowed to censor whatever 
you want. This works just like it does in the workplace, where you’re not allowed to say 
anything you want there, either. Call the boss an asshole to her face, and see what hap-
pens. Yes, she can ﬁ re you, First Amendment be damned. If you must, you can do the same 
thing with those visitors to your blog. 
 It’s hard to get around the obnoxious commenter problem. Each way to deal with the 
problem is imperfect. Whatever method of moderation you pick, make a serious attempt 
at encouraging your readers to enhance your site, rather than detract from it. After all, 
that’s your ultimate goal. 
 Some comments might be okay for some sites, but not for others. For example, there 
are the borderline commenters who might add insights from time to time, but generally 
seem to have a mission of self-aggrandizement. These are the ones who gainsay over 
other commenters (or you), and constantly attempt to pump themselves up into some 
sort of superhuman wonder boy. “I’ve done that, I’ve seen that, I have better than that, 
I’m better than you.” Bah. Depending on how closely you want to moderate your com-
ments, these douchebag braggarts might also be part of the useless detritus you’d like to 
eliminate with extreme prejudice. We wouldn’t blame you. 
 Again, we encourage restraint when removing comments or commenters, especially at 
ﬁ rst. The potential value of every new comment far outweighs the annoyance wrought by 
these selfsame comments. It may bother you to see someone so overtly annoying using 
your site as a sounding board for such insane ideas, but what is the Internet but a reposi-
tory that consists of 99 percent ridiculous ideas and 1 percent gold? Your goal is to tease 
that 1 percent out of your readers. Let the rest of the world maintain the rest. 
 Encourage comments, but let everyone know what you expect from them. The best 
idea is to be transparent to those who would like to comment on your site. Set up explicit 
ground rules, in the form of Terms of Service, a special post with a permanent link to it 
prominently displayed on your front page. Let this guidepost be a manifesto for com-
menting on your site, laying down exactly what’s permitted and what isn’t. 
 What kinds of guidelines will you use in your comments manifesto? That’s entirely 
up to you, but we’d suggest choosing from the following: 
 1. 
 Tell them how much you want and appreciate their comments, and how valuable 
they are. 
 2. 
 Remind them that this is  your blog, your home on the web, and you will treat those 
who comment on it as visitors in your home. If a visitor to your home does something 
rude that you ﬁ nd unacceptable, that person will be asked to leave. 
 3. 
 Remind them your site is not a democracy, but more akin to a benevolent dicta-
torship. In your little ﬁ efdom, you reserve the right to delete any comment for any 
reason. 
 4. 
 Reassure them that you won’t delete comments just because their writers disagree 
with your posts. In fact, you should  encourage disagreement, especially that which is 
constructive and furthers the discussion. 
 5. 
 Spell out speciﬁ cally what kinds of comments will be deleted; for example, what 
sort of profanity or vulgarity will or won’t be tolerated, whether you’ll allow personal 
attacks and smear tactics (let’s hope you won’t!), and so on.

 6. 
 Encourage them to keep the conversations relevant, on-topic, and civil, with a prom-
ise that violating comments will be removed. 
 7. 
 Remind them you will delete commenter accounts if necessary, and in extreme cases 
you’ll even ban the IP addresses whence those offending comments came. 
 8. 
 Encourage them to report abusive comments and commenters when they ﬁ nd them. 
Eventually your site will be big enough that you won’t be able to police all these com-
ments yourself. 
 Dealing with the Angry Mob 
 There are many ways for the conversation to go sour. Perhaps you posted an unpopular 
opinion about a popular topic, either based on your own feelings or in an effort to raise 
ire and incite conversation. Both of these are valid methods to create an online presence, 
and these methods have been used by many of the best bloggers. You are not out to make 
friends, nor are you out to speciﬁ cally please your audience at every turn. 
 While this is a Machiavellian idea, it also further expresses your role as journalist and 
pundit. You do not have the resources available to the big guys, but that does not mean 
you have to be beholden to their ideals. To quote Fleetwood Mac, you can go your own way.  
 So What Did You Do to Unnerve Your Readers? 
 You hold an opposing viewpoint.  Your readers, for the most part, are used to a uniﬁ ed 
wall of opinion that comes at them from multiple media. These opinions, as we will 
explore shortly, have the habit of creating internecine wars between two camps. This can 
be Democrat vs. Republican, Mac vs. PC, or this season’s hot starlet vs. last season’s. It 
literally does not matter: you will face strong opinions  no matter what you say . 
 You offer a review that is not enthusiastic about a subject that engenders enthusi-
asm. Saying a band sucks is considered ﬁ ghting words in many parts of the world. Saying 
you liked a movie when everyone “knows” it was bad can endanger your life. Saying a 
product is bad when hype says it is good is grounds for homicide. Your shield in this case 
is truth. 
 You are trolling.  Trolling is the process by which you express an opinion or perform 
an action just to get a rise out of people. Done well, it can be an art form. Many of the best 
bloggers troll at least a few times a month, just to keep the conversation ﬂ owing. How-
ever, we wouldn’t recommend espousing an opinion you don’t support just for the sake 
of luring in higher trafﬁ c numbers. 
 By trolling on everything that is not Apple, for example, Jon Gruber of Daringﬁ reball.
com encourages interaction between blogs. How? Many people look at his acerbic posts 
as calls to action, and as such, they post about what he has written. For example, he often 
cites statistics about Android that support his view that the iPhone is better. This angers 
many Android supporters to no end and encourages them to respond to him in their own 
post, thereby encouraging cross-pollination of his ideas. He may be called an idiot on 
other blogs, but at least someone is paying attention. 
 The bedrock of a blog is its conversational nature. That means once you’ve ﬁ nished 
writing your post, you’re not really ﬁ nished. As your blog gains popularity, comments will 
soon proliferate. They’ll start rolling in soon after you’ve published your post, and some 
will be addressed to you. Go ahead! Respond. In fact, some posts will collect comments

long after they’ve been read. So-called “evergreen posts” include reviews, bits of conjec-
ture or rumor, and longer think pieces. Check your reviews for occasional updates. 
 If you’ve written a particularly controversial post, sometimes the ﬁ rst few comments 
set the tone for all the rest. Just like mob behavior in the physical world, one person’s 
online anger becomes contagious, spreading to everyone until it festers and accumu-
lates into a huge gang of aggressive slanderers, all attacking you for your “thoughtless 
post,” where you failed to “do your research.” Often, in an irate commenter’s mind, “your 
research” means you haven’t read exactly the same things that commenter has read, and 
don’t agree 100 percent with that reader’s opinions. Sometimes, they gather on a mes-
sage board, and all plan to attack you in concert with each other. 
 You talk back to the backtalkers.  The best way to defuse such a riot is to get involved 
in the discussion. When you, the author, show up in the comments area, we’ve noticed 
things instantly cool down. Now, the commenters see a real person behind those opin-
ions, and it usually softens them. This works especially well if you’re completely trans-
parent. Be honest. If you’ve made a mistake, apologize. If you’ve changed your text after 
publishing it, after some people had already criticized you for your errors, own up to it. 
Even the most sadistic readers tend to forgive you if you’re honest with them, and if you 
apologize for any transgressions you’ve actually committed. Admitting a mistake shows 
readers what kind of person you are, and can bolster their respect for you. After you’ve 
made your apologies, it’s time to move on, and either close the comments on that post, 
or just ignore subsequent abuse. 
 But you’re not always required to respond to each comment. No response is also a 
response. Many unhinged comments deserve nothing but icy silence from you. Those that 
are direct questions are probably the most obvious candidates for a return volley. Other 
times, you might see ﬁ t to react to an insult, defending yourself and clarifying what you’ve 
written. However, sometimes your response will only beget more comments, often devolv-
ing into a ﬂ ame war that’s more akin to simple ﬁ st ﬁ ghting than an illuminating discussion. 
 If you ﬁ nd yourself the victim of a particularly caustic comment, assess its merits and 
demerits, and put it on the back burner. If you can get back to it later and still feel the 
same way about the comment, feel free to add your opinion. But realize you are pulling 
on a rope with many people attached. 
 You are a fanboy.  The culprit behind many ﬂ ame wars is the fanboy. You’ve heard of 
him (and it’s almost always a male), the fanatic who’s so attached to a particular brand 
that showing affection for any others constitutes blasphemy. The most rabid fanboys 
cling to Apple as their deity, and now there’s a rising army of smartphone operating sys-
tem Android acolytes. There are others following celebrities. Some of these people have 
serious psychiatric problems, while others are just in the throes of an obsession. The 
best way for you to think of this is to consider these obsessions a religion. Handle this 
delicately, because these people can’t see any other opinions as being valid except their 
own. They’ve been so intensely brainwashed that anything you say or write that doesn’t 
completely agree with their worldview is met with astonishment and vitriol. 
 People become fanboys for many reasons. First, fanboyism is fun and safe. If you are 
online, you want to be part of a networked community. By choosing a side, you are guar-
anteed a seat at the table regardless of your opinion. But the key thought here is to under-
stand that fanboys have chosen sides to protect a few things. First, they must protect 
their investment in a technology. While many of us wouldn’t think twice about which

operating system we use, many have invested time, money, and effort into one of their 
choices. Perhaps they are simply fans—maybe they really like a particular politician or 
point of order. Or perhaps it is a matter of faith (and some nonreligious choices can take 
on aspects of faith). Or perhaps they have already bought thousands of dollars’ worth of 
gear, or maybe they don’t have much money at all and they made a choice to support one 
side or another. It is not our place to judge or fear these folks. It is our place to avoid fan-
boyism at all costs and offer opinions tempered with intelligence and wit. You can hold 
an opinion, but fall into fanboyism at your peril. 
 You’ve been targeted for abuse.  In fact, there are way too many blog readers who 
get their jollies by marauding around the Internet, trying to incite such controversy with 
lots of insulting, rude remarks, and crazy stuff. They troll the bottom, often making com-
ments just for the sake of eliciting a reaction. That’s why they’re called trolls. Either that, 
or they resemble the villains of fairytales, ogres who live under bridges and lick their 
chops in anticipation of eviscerating some innocent passerby. 
 Remember, you can immediately handle trolls with a fell swoop of your mouse. Being 
the god of your blog has its beneﬁ ts, and if some readers seem like they’re just making 
comments solely for the purpose of starting useless ﬁ ghts, you can delete their comments 
forthwith. Unfortunately, this often draws you into a game of whack-a-mole, where your 
little troll friend will make more comments, accusing you of censorship, and then you 
delete those comments, eliciting even more. With a determined sicko, this game could go 
on for hours, days, or even weeks. If you’re using a commenting system such as Disqus, 
you can bring out the nuclear weapon and ban that person’s IP address. But keep in mind 
that particular IP address might be in use for an entire company, and your fell swoop 
might accidentally forbid a large group of innocent readers from commenting. And your 
nemesis might just continue commenting on a smartphone, or simply turn off his cable 
modem for a few minutes, long enough for his service provider to assign a completely 
different IP address. 
 Sometimes these conﬂ icts even devolve into stalking, with a hateful reader virtu-
ally following you wherever you write, sabotaging your every post.  Occasionally, these 
issues can be dealt with one-on-one, where you ask the offender to contact you ofﬂ ine, 
via email. The vast majority of times a quick email (“Hey, what’s going on with your 
comments?”) is enough to send a troll packing. We’ve used this technique and received 
consistent results. Sometimes you get a heartfelt, if inappropriate, excuse (“The wife has 
been sick and I was just angry at work and I don’t know why I told you I wanted you to 
 Once I had a commenter who was so angry at me about a post I had 
written that he stalked me for days, continuing his hate-filled comments on our site. He wouldn’t 
respond to anything I wrote to him. Perhaps coincidentally, during those days there was a veiled 
death threat sent to me anonymously via Facebook. I had to take action. After a bit of searching 
online, I found the offending person’s phone number and called him. He was defiant at first, but 
then calmed down. He still refused to stop harassing me, though, until I threatened legal action. 
He remained defiant, but it was all bluster. I never heard from him again after that conversation.

die of cancer when you wrote Archie was better than Jughead”). Other times they curse 
you out a bit more and then stop commenting entirely. It’s a win-win. 
 Sometimes contacting an angry commenter helps to humanize you; other times, a 
phone call will do the trick. At its worst, it might be a good idea to call the police. Other 
times, the heat dies down as the commenter moves on to another target. Don’t ever 
agree to meet a disgruntled commenter face-to-face, though. Better to cut off communi-
cation and let the lunatic wear himself out ﬁ rst. The best advice is to refrain from escalat-
ing conﬂ ict, instead diffusing it whenever possible and answering verbal violence with 
silence most of the time.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the blogosphere. 
 Should You Turn Off Comments? 
 The short answer is “No.” The long answer is “Why would you?” Turning off comments 
is convenient for your own ego, but it reduces online interaction and makes you look, 
at best, scared of your readership. Some sites refuse to allow comments for historical 
 reasons—DaringFireball just never had them—but most sites need them. Even the small-
est town newspaper can beneﬁ t from commenters (even though comment forms tend to 
bring out the cranks). If you are doing a good job and you are an expert in your niche, you 
shouldn’t have a problem with commenters online. 
 Understanding Spam 
 At the very least, we’d recommend you use a CAPTCHA (“Completely Automated Public 
Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”), a challenge-response system that 
requires prospective commenters to decipher twisted graphics that are hard for machines 
to read, and then enter those nonsensical words or phrases before any comments are 
accepted. This will prevent boatloads of spam comments infecting your site. Some spam-
mers are so determined that they’ll hire low-paid workers to decipher and enter CAPT-
CHA text, and then try to slip links to their employers’ sites into your comments. To deal 
with comment spam, most bloggers use nofollow 2 tags to prevent spam links from gain-
ing spammers any traction in their wild-eyed quest for web domination. This is usually a 
setting in your content management system. 
 For your site, you’ll probably choose something between these two extremes— 
perhaps starting out with admitting almost all comments, and then as your site grows 
and comments proliferate, you can begin pruning those who aren’t adding much to the 
conversation. This work is worthwhile, because you want comments, and you need them. 
Comments are content, and at their best, add knowledge to your posts. They have enter-
tainment value, often add clarity, boost your credibility with praise, and sometimes even 
scold you when you deserve it. 
 Comment spam can also be reduced by using a ﬁ lter such as Akismet for WordPress 
and other content management systems. Akismet compares comments to a known body 
of spam and spam-like comments. It is one of the most effective ways to maintain com-
ments without much work. It is free for small sites, but if you have a larger site it may 
begin to cost you. Check the current terms on Akismet’s site. 
 How does spam work? When a commenter posts a spam message, it usually includes 
a link to his own website. This link from your well-respected site allows spammers 
to gain some of your hard-earned respect. This rarely if ever works, but that doesn’t

mean that you won’t get hundreds or thousands of spam messages daily. If something 
is in your spam queue, delete it. You can occasionally go through your queue to conﬁ rm 
that a real comment hasn’t slipped through, but in general, delete spam from your site 
immediately.  
 Rewarding Loyal Fans 
 We like to thank our readers by holding contests and giving away freebies. In almost 
every industry there will be someone willing to offer your readers something small. Don’t 
force your readers to jump through hoops to get something good. Just create a comment 
contest—ask them to comment on a post and pick one reader at random. Or, encourage 
better commenting by choosing the best one of the bunch. 
 We often single out commenters and contact them via email to ask for a mailing 
address. We then send them something from the odds-and-ends pile that quickly builds 
up in our ofﬁ ces. Many folks may be delighted to receive a USB key or a hat from a popu-
lar brand you cover. Imagine the value you’re creating with this singular act of kindness. 
You’re not only thanking a friendly face in the “crowd,” you’re creating a vociferous and 
enthusiastic defender of you, your site, and your practices. Politicians of old probably 
called this glad-handing. We call it a love letter to your readers. 
 Finally,  listen to your readers . If they send you tips, thank them in the post. The best 
feeling in the (Internet) world is to see your name under a post. We remember the days 
before we got to run large blogs. It was a real treat to see a “[ Thanks, John! ]” or “ Hat tip to 
Charlie W .” When thanking someone in a post, it is customary to put the person’s name at 
the bottom of the page and italicize the note, simultaneously calling it out while ensuring 
it’s not confused with the actual content of your site.

 Building Traffic, 
Making Money, and 
Measuring Success 
 There are plenty of people who will sell you snake oil they claim can gain more trafﬁ c. 
You don’t have to go far on Google to ﬁ nd plenty of balderdash about keywords, secret 
algorithms, and trafﬁ c-boosting tricks. In our own history as bloggers we have rarely had 
much truck with those sorts.  In fact, there have been times when we’ve ignored search 
engine optimization (SEO) completely, writing stuff that we know will appeal to humans 
and not robots. That’s our trick. 
 Here’s our piece of advice:  write good stuff, tell people about it, keep writing good 
stuff.  As one of our favorite authors Farhad Manjoo once wrote, “Optimizing for Google 
results is a little like going out and buying the best VCR on the market.” 1 Are you going to 
invest in something that will soon be obsolete? Google’s algorithms change regularly—
it’s something the SEO-heads call the “Google Dance”—and anything you do today will be 
obsolete a few months from now. 
 SEO for Bloggers 
 However, we didn’t want you to feel short-changed, so we approached well-known search 
expert Eli Feldblum, CTO of RankAbove, to explain a bit about SEO for bloggers. 
 One of the most popular ways to get trafﬁ c to your blog is through search engines. 
People are always searching for stuff online, and if you’re writing about that same stuff, 
they probably should come to your blog. That theory is correct; in fact, it’s the theory that 
the major search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing were founded on: connecting 
searchers to results. 
 But if you want to be in those results, and especially if you want to be at the  top  of 
those results, you need to make sure the search engines know what your blog is about—
and you need to ensure that once they do, they think your blog is the most relevant site 
to show a searcher. That process is called search engine optimization, or SEO. Simply put, 
SEO is the process of explaining to search engines that your site is relevant (there’s that 
word again) to speciﬁ c queries, which are primarily deﬁ ned by the keywords people use 
when they search for stuff online.

 The Key Phrase 
 The ﬁ rst step to SEO is making sure your content is truly relevant to what people search 
for, and that takes knowing what people search for. Let’s say you just bought a new 
iPhone. You start getting into it, and you start buying accessories and apps, and pretty 
soon you’re the guy your friends with iPhones ask for advice. You think you can turn 
the knowledge into cash by starting a blog about iPhone accessories. The most popular 
question you get is about hooking up an iPhone to a car stereo, so your ﬁ rst post is about 
iPhone car cables. 
 If your content is good, your page is optimized (we’ll get to that in a minute), and you 
get some links (we’ll get to that, too), you should bring in visitors by the thousands. So 
you’re pretty surprised when no one shows up. What gives? Your post was the perfectly 
optimized answer to any queries to any searches about iPhone car cables. Does Google 
just not like you? 
 The problem is this: no one searches for iPhone car cables. Lots of people want to 
hook up their iPhones to their cars; they just don’t use the word “cable.” Searchers prefer, 
in descending order, “iPhone car chargers,” “iPhone car mounts,” and “iPhone car kits.” 
According to data from Google, “iPhone car chargers” gets more than 27,000 searches 
every month in the U.S.—while “iPhone car cables” gets a mere 700 searchers monthly. 
 The bots look at how often the key phrase and its variations are used. That will occur 
naturally when you discuss a topic, and there is no need to force it. Your content needs to 
appeal to users ﬁ rst, and then search engines. 
 Keep in mind that the perfect key phrase describes your story accurately, and also 
predicts which terms your readers will use to search for your story. When you’re choos-
ing your key phrase, think of what you would search for if you were looking for the story 
you just wrote. 
 However, if the story you just wrote is a story that thousands of other bloggers are 
also writing at the same time, try to think of a slightly different angle that will attract 
readers searching for a key phrase that’s not so heavily populated. 
 For instance, if you’re writing about the new iPhone 7, your ﬁ rst instinct will of course 
be to use “iPhone 7” as your key phrase. But you will be competing against literally mil-
lions of other posts if you decide to use that key phrase. Think of a different angle, such as 
“iPhone 7 compared,” and then you can tailor your post around those keywords, compar-
ing and contrasting that product with its competitors. 
 Isn’t determining keywords before you’ve written your post getting into “gray 
hat” SEO? Not exactly, because what you’re doing is trying to figure out a way to best 
reach your readers, and you’re not misrepresenting the content of your post with 
your key phrase. Of course, you’ll have to want to write a post comparing your prod-
uct to others if you’re going to use our foregoing example, but you won’t be dishon-
est to your readers and those who have searched for your article by using that key 
phrase. 
 When optimizing SEO, keep honesty and integrity in mind. There are shady char-
acters on the Internet who are abusing SEO. There are certain topics that you can’t 
search on the Internet and get a reliable result, because SEO has been gamed so much. 
For instance, try searching “SEO,” and you’ll see how SEO experts have made it impos-
sible to ﬁ nd reliable information about that topic, just because of their unparalleled 
expertise.

 On-Page 
 So now that you’ve picked the correct keywords, the ones that meet audience demand, 
it’s time to let Google and the other search engines know that your post is about those 
keywords. That’s called on-page optimization. 
 At the same time, think about the supply of readers. If there are a million people 
searching for a certain keyword and a billion blogs playing to that keyword, you’re going 
to get lost in the crowd. Look for niche keywords that are less competitive, giving you a 
ﬁ ghting chance of grabbing a share of the audience. 
 No one from Google will come and read your site to determine how relevant you 
are—it’s all done via automated “bots” that crawl the web, jumping from link to link and 
reading the content (to the best of their ability) on each page, called “spiders.” (Get it? Spi-
ders crawl the web? Funny people, those Google guys.) Because they are not people, the 
spiders are not perfect readers. They can’t read everything that appears on the page. And 
they rely on you highlighting speciﬁ c sections of the page, called “signals,” to alert them 
to the most relevant content on the page. 
 These spiders operate by a few basic rules: 
 •  They read only text, not images or Flash video or audio (at least, not fully, and not yet). 
 •  They read from top to bottom. 
 •  They look for signals to tell them what’s important. 
 Our friend Farhad was so right when he said Google’s search algorithm is a mov-
ing target. However, there are some basic parts of the search algorithm that can’t really 
change. For instance, the title of your post will always be the best place to ﬁ nd out what 
your post is actually about. 
 So that’s the ﬁ rst basic rule of our SEO philosophy: state the topic of your post as early 
as possible in the title. For instance, if you’re writing about the new Krazy Kikz shoes 
everybody’s talking about, you’ll want to have the words Krazy Kikz as close to the begin-
ning of your title as possible. For optimum SEO, you’ll want the term Krazy Kikz in the 
ﬁ rst paragraph of your post, and in the ﬁ rst sentence if you can swing it. 
 You’ll want to add the term “Krazy Kikz” as an “alt” to all of the images on your page, 
and then in your content management system (CMS) such as WordPress or Blogger, you’ll 
want to be sure to include the term Krazy Kikz in your meta description of the story. 
Finally, be sure the term Krazy Kikz is part of your permalink for the story—that is, be 
sure the URL of your story includes it. 
 If you follow the routine of creating a thoroughly descriptive key phrase (often called 
“focus keyword”) and then use it in those speciﬁ c places in your post, you’ll be well on 
your way toward SEO perfection. Let’s go over each of the speciﬁ c places where your key 
phrase should reside in your post, and explain why each is signiﬁ cant.  
 Article heading:  This is the title you use to populate the Title ﬁ eld of your page. It’s the 
SEO title as well—unless you would like to use a separate SEO title. There’s a place 
for you to change it to something different in most content management systems. 
 Page title:  If you leave this blank, your article heading will also function as your SEO 
title. Why would you want to change it? One good reason is that the display in most 
search engines is limited to seventy characters, so if your display title is longer than

124
8
that, it will get cut off when people are searching for your story. In addition, for 
best SEO results, your title should be at least forty characters long. The page title is 
important, so if you can’t part with your display title, write a separate one for SEO 
and be sure to place that key phrase at the title’s beginning. 
 Page URL:  Otherwise known as a permalink, this is where your post will reside on your 
site. You can set defaults for what all of your permalink’s look like, but you’ll always 
want to contain your key phrase in that permalink for maximum optimization. For 
example, when I’m writing about the iBarge, here’s how that post’s permalink will 
look:  http://charliewhite.net/2013/08/iBarge/ . 
 Inside the content:  You’ll want to include that magic word or phrase in the ﬁ rst para-
graph, and even in the ﬁ rst sentence if possible. You’ll want to mention it a few 
times within your post as well, but don’t go overboard. There is such a thing as 
mentioning your keyword too many times, for which your post will be downgraded. 
In our experience, using the key phrase before it feels forced or awkward is usually 
a good rule of thumb. 
 Meta description:  If you’ve written a tight ﬁ rst sentence to your post, that will usually 
serve you well as a meta description. It’s usually limited to 156 characters, so stay 
within those parameters, mentioning your key phrase at least once. 
 Other SEO enhancements: 
 Outbound links:  Include at least a backlink—that is, one link outside of your own site, 
and the SEO gods will smile upon you. We’ll tell you more about backlinks a bit later 
in this chapter. 
 Image Alt:  Whenever you place an image in a page, there’s always a spot for alternate 
text, so place your key phrase in there, too. Try to add it to all of your images in the 
post. Before you’ve added it, you’ll see this in the code: alt="". Between those two 
quotes is where you’ll add your key phrase. Here’s an example: 
 <img src=" http://charliewhite.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Apple-iWatch-02.png" 
 alt= " iWatch " width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-630" /> 
 Subheadings: If you ﬁ nd it aesthetically pleasing or editorially necessary to place sub-
heads within your text, the more times you include your key phrase in those sub-
heads, the more SEO power you’ll have. 
 Post length: Three hundred words seems to be the magic number for some SEO mavens, 
but there’s little if any research that supports that number. However, as an esteemed 
colleague pointed out, a 300-word minimum is a good way to urge you to expound 
upon your post topic. Write more, add context, and make it yours on the way to get-
ting the length up to 300 words. However, this rule is made to be broken, because 
many photos and factoids do ﬁ ne with just one sentence or a short paragraph. 
 Writing style:  You can adopt some styles of writing that will help, like the “Inverted 
Pyramid,” which is what some journalists use for news articles. In the Inverted 
Pyramid, all the crucial information is imparted in the ﬁ rst paragraph and then 
examined and explained in depth throughout the article. Because the spider reads 
a page from top to bottom, this style quickly alerts them to the content of the page, 
and it ensures the bots don’t give up on a long page before getting to the point. 
 After all that, we come back to this:  the most important thing is good content.  In 
the world of SEO, content is king. The foregoing rules will help Google understand your 
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com

125
content, but if it’s not good content to begin with, it’s worthless. The search engines look 
for content relevant to what people search for, but that also abides by the rules of good—
or at least pretty good—writing. And good content will also naturally get other people to 
link to your blog, which, as we’ll soon see, could be the most important part of all. 
 Overall, Google is looking for three things from your content: relevance, uniqueness, 
and freshness. Write good content frequently, using these rules, and you’ll soon see visi-
tors from SEO. 
 Off-Page 
 Okay, so your blog is now relevant for the keywords people use when they’re interested in 
your topic. Here’s a dirty little secret. You’re not the only person reading about SEO. Lots 
of other bloggers and webmasters have also been working to optimize their sites. They 
may all be equally relevant to the keywords you are going after. 
 Once the spiders ﬁ gure out all the pages that are relevant to a certain query, they need 
to rank the pages in a way that beneﬁ ts the user. They want to show the user the best page 
ﬁ rst, and “best” is usually synonymous with most popular. The more people who like your 
site—and express that sentiment by linking to your blog—the higher you will rank for 
your relevant content. Google’s big innovation when it came on the scene was looking at 
the web the same way kids look at high school. The coolest kids are not just the ones with 
the most friends, but also those with the coolest friends (deﬁ ned the same way; Google 
loves recursion). The kid with lots of friends on the football team and cheerleading squad 
is usually more popular than the one with friends on the chess club and the debate team. 
Google applied this to the web. Sites with more links—especially links from sites that also 
had lots of links to them, called backlinks—were more popular. Google gave each site a 
popularity quotient, called PageRank (named after co-founder Larry Page, no kidding). 
 Given two identically relevant and equally optimized pages, the one with better back-
links wins. 
 The SEO Bottom Line 
 So you’ve got three steps to make sure your blog ranks and gets trafﬁ c from SEO: 
 1. Make sure your content matches up with the keywords people are using for their 
search queries. 
 2. Make sure your content is optimized so that the search engines can read it and know 
what the important parts are. 
 3. Make sure other sites know about—and link to—your content. 
 That’s basically it, with an emphasis on “basic.” There are a host of other factors and 
signals the engines use to rank pages, but everything is based on keywords, relevance, 
and links. 
 Social Media 
 When you’ve written all your wonderful guff, you need to get the word out and let every-
one know it exists. This is where you can leverage social media to spread the word about

your shiny new site, alerting all those information-hungry visitors to click into your 
world. The beauty of social networks to market your site is that you get other people to 
do your marketing for you. In fact, for blogs that are just starting out, social media can 
refer more trafﬁ c to blogs than search engines. For example, many news startups get as 
much as 40 percent of their trafﬁ c from Facebook and Twitter. Even for sites that have 
been around for a while, social media experts are starting to see Twitter and Facebook as 
the fastest-growing way to refer trafﬁ c to your blog. 
 All the social networking in the world is not going to do any good if you can’t get 
people to click on your links. This points back to creating a compelling headline. You’re 
going to need to lure those people with Twitter links, especially if you’re generating them 
automatically with the headline and link. A catchy, punchy headline will go a long way 
toward facilitating all of your social networking. 
 But using social media to promote your site is not the sort of thing that just happens 
overnight. You ﬁ rst must build a following on Twitter and gather your friends on Face-
book. Before you’re going to direct the crowd to scurry over to your website to read that 
fascinating story you just teased them about, you’re going to need to gather that crowd 
ﬁ rst. How’s that done? 
 Social Media Tips 
 Promoting with Twitter 
 If you want to promote your posts on Twitter, you need followers, and the more you 
can get, the more promotion you can do. Every Twitter user started with zero follow-
ers. How do you build up that list? You need to organically expand your list of Twitter 
followers by giving them a reason to follow you, read your stuff, and click on the links 
you provide. There are automated tools that purport to boost your followers on Twitter, 
but they result in low-quality followers who all require you to follow them at the same 
time. This results in a high follower count, but not a whole lot of clicks will be coming 
from those followers you bought. That’s not really going to help you much in the long 
run. What you really need are engaged followers who look forward to your next link or 
comment. 
 The best way to gain followers is to offer compelling content. Twitter is known as a 
microblogging service, so treat it as such. Give your followers real content in the short 
space allowed, constantly tweeting a sampling of content from your site, 140 characters 
at a time. That doesn’t mean just pushing links onto your growing list of followers. Offer 
analysis, and include fun facts and maybe a few words of pithy commentary. Whatever 
you do, after they read that actual information, make them want to read more. Lure them 
to your site; get them into the tent. The more you engage, the more followers you’ll get, 
and the more people will pay attention to whatever you share, resulting in more visitors 
driven to your blog. 
 The number of followers is important, but the quality of your followers is even more 
important. Says Stephanie Haberman, social media producer at NBC news, “I’m passion-
ate about quality over quantity. I would much rather have ﬁ ve people who will retweet 
your tweets, share and talk about them and create chatter and interest in the brand, 
rather than having twenty people who are ignoring you.” Find those valuable followers, 
and they will help you build your brand.

 One way to gather followers quickly is to follow others. There are varying schools of 
thought here, where some Twitter experts think it’s a good practice to follow everyone 
who follows you. However, if you follow Twitter power users who have thousands of fol-
lowers, they’re not likely to follow you. Start out by following those power users anyway 
(because of all the great info you’ll gather from them), but don’t forget to also follow 
people you know, and they’ll probably be willing to reciprocate. 
 Treat your Twitter stream like an alternative blog, albeit in miniature. You can engage 
with your readers using Twitter, and the interactions you have using the service are often 
surprisingly rich. 
 When you want to promote a post using Twitter, in most Twitter apps and tools, your 
link will be automatically shortened, giving you more room within your 140-character 
allotment to offer some actual content along with that link. And keep your total charac-
ter count below 120, so your followers will have room to retweet (RT) your tweet and add 
some of their own opinions alongside it. 
 Should you tweet every headline you post? Yes. This is the bare minimum of expected 
Twitter interaction, and even if you think Twitter is just a fad, your posts should appear 
there and on your Facebook page. Says Haberman, “I will tweet out the headlines of a post 
at least once. The ﬁ rst time I will tweet out the headline, because if you write your head-
line as well you should, that does encapsulate everything you want to say.” 
 Beyond that, Haberman says that it’s okay to tweet about a post more than once. 
However, she says, “When you’re repromoting it and when you’re resharing it, you can 
add an interesting quote from it, or something that’s a lot more grabby.” Chances are, if 
you Tweet about that post again, and delay it by a few hours, most of your followers won’t 
see it twice. Even if they’ve already seen it, Haberman adds, “that quote might make them 
think they should revisit the topic.” 
 Establish your presence on Twitter throughout the day with your pithy prose, and 
over time, people will begin to know you and respect you. Interact with other Twitter 
users by responding to their tweets. Interject your opinions into conversations that are 
happening within your chosen topic area. Find the most interesting links about your 
topic, even if they aren’t from your own site, and place them on your Twitter feed along 
with an opinion or two of your own. Some experts even recommend sending private Twit-
ter messages to those who might ﬁ nd a particular piece useful, adding a personal touch 
that goes a long way. But beware: being a pest on Twitter is worse than undertweeting. 
 Automate It! 
 An even easier way to promote your Twitter and Facebook feeds is using an automated 
site such as twitterfeed.com. You create an account, point it to your site’s RSS feed, and 
then you designate when and where you’d like your tweets and Facebook entries to be 
posted. 
 That’s the easiest way to automate your Twitter posting, but not the best. Twitter 
posting tools are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, and now there are services 
such as Buffer and SocialFlow that give you even more control over what you’ll be tweet-
ing and when. 
 Buffer is a service that lets you tweet at designated intervals during the day, or allows 
you to schedule when each of those tweets will occur. A free account lets you choose how 
many post-times during the day you need, spreading them out so followers won’t get 

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com

128

tired of hearing from you over and over again. Buffer 
even has a way to interface with a service called Social 
Bro, which shows you statistics about your followers 
and community, and creates a “best time to tweet” ﬁ le 
you can use in Buffer. 
 However, for the ability to conﬁ gure different time 
intervals for different days of the week and post unlim-
ited numbers of tweets with twelve social proﬁ les, 
you’ll need Buffer’s “Awesome Plan” for $10 per month. 
 When your trafﬁ c increases and your operation 
becomes more sophisticated, you might want to try 
a tool we used at  Mashable called SocialFlow. Working 
with either a browser-based version or a browser plug-
in, you designate a story you’d like to tweet about, and 
then tell SocialFlow you’d like for it to optimize your tweet over the next hour, number of 
hours, or days. Then, SocialFlow ﬁ gures out the optimal time to tweet that story, not only 
gauging the engagement of your usual readers but also determining the time when that 
story is most likely to attract the most trafﬁ c to your site. It’s not cheap, with prices start-
ing at $99 per month for one Twitter account and one Facebook account, but it’s the most 
sophisticated Twitter software we’ve used so far. While we didn’t get the 40 to 60 percent 
increase in click rate the company touted at SocialFlow’s launch in early 2012, we found 
the tool easy to use, especially when dealing with multiple tweets. 
 Facebook Promotion 
 Promoting your blog posts on Facebook and getting people to engage with them is a great 
way to build trafﬁ c to your blog. This is the most valuable of all social media for promo-
tion, potentially giving you more visitors than you can get from search engines. Build up 
your list of friends on Facebook, and you’ll have a ready-made group of people who will 
be likely to spread your links far and wide. Beyond those people you know, there are more 
than 500 million active users on Facebook. Obviously, this is where the people are, so this 
is where you need to promote your site. 
 On Facebook, you have a bit more room to write a tease than you’ll get on Twitter, 
and there are certain ways you can encourage discussions on Facebook, as well as entice 
those readers to click on your link and come to your website. Try asking those Facebook 
readers a provocative question, luring them into the discussion. Or consider placing an 
exclusive fact on your Facebook tease that points toward your article, giving people more 
information as you convince them to click on your link. You’ll ﬁ nd that a pithy quote from 
your post will often do the trick. Don’t give away the whole story with your teaser sen-
tence or question. Most importantly, try to think of something that can compel someone 
to click through to your blog or “like” your update, in as few words as possible. 
 After posting on Facebook for  Mashable  over a period of more than two and a half years, 
Charlie’s in a position to tell us about a few idiosyncrasies of the mainstream Facebook 
audience that you might want to know about. One area of special concern is when some-
one has died. If your blog is in the business of writing about stories like that, be extremely 
careful how you present any Facebook posts about the death. It’s been my experience that 
people don’t go to Facebook to ﬁ nd news of death, and are often angered when they see

 Charlie was promoting a post on Facebook he wrote for  Mashable  about a 
tragic incident where a football player shot his wife and then himself. In an attempt to maximize 
sensitivity, Charlie wrote in his Facebook tease, “Our deepest sympathy goes to [player’s name] 
and his family in this tragic incident.” Seems innocent enough, doesn’t it? Immediately, a firestorm 
of anger erupted in the comments underneath the Facebook tease. “Where’s the sympathy for 
the wife who was shot, Mashable?” said a few readers. “Completely insensitive not to mention 
the wife, Mashable!” said another. “Why did you even post this at all?” said even more. After 
a few comments like that, a chain reaction erupted with even more readers piling on, and the 
anger began to approach the level of a raging mob. Realizing his mistake, Charlie deleted the 
Facebook update. It was not an ideal way to handle a Facebook problem, but this was such 
an explosion of anger that it was the only solution. Sometimes you just have to punt. Never 
mind that Charlie had thought the words “his family” would include the guy’s wife—apparently 
that wasn’t sensitive enough for readers who were going through the stages of grief over this 
incident, and unfortunately were stuck on that stage that has to do with anger. 
 Hits and Misses of Facebook Promotion 
 Pro Tip 
 Positive stories do best:  The neighbor’s cat that just had a litter of the cutest 
kittens ever will make people smile. The litter of kittens being run over by the garbage truck will 
make people cry, and they won’t want to see your face on Facebook for a while. 
 Showcase a photo:  Research shows that Facebook users are more likely to “Like” or click a 
link associated with an image than an update where you merely link to your blog post. So if you 
have a dramatic picture, post it along with a description of its accompanying story, and be sure 
to place a shortened link in the description to direct readers to your post. 
 Ask questions, but not too many:  If people catch onto a pattern where you’re always 
asking questions and trying to get them to engage, some of them will grow angry, and be more 
interested in criticizing your question than answering it. 
 Sometimes you just have to delete:  Facebook is touchy, and sometimes your entertaining 
clip might be completely misunderstood, or roundly hated by your audience. Better to delete 
the post before it gets out of hand and have it shared far and wide, at the expense of your 
reputation. 
War Story
stories like that posted (see the following War Story). Our advice: avoid posting about death 
and mayhem unless that’s part of your site’s stock in trade. You might get lots of engage-
ment with a post about death, but it’s likely not the kind of trafﬁ c you actually want.  
 Stories about rival social services don’t do well on Facebook, either. Many in the main-
stream Facebook audience are mostly concentrating on Facebook for their social media 
needs, and tend to be only mildly interested in stories about Twitter, for instance. So if 
you’re writing about Twitter, Facebook, or other social media services, you’re better off 
posting Twitter stories to Twitter, where they invariably do well, and Facebook stories to 
Facebook, where the same is true.

 A new addition to Facebook is the ability to add hashtags to keywords. An example 
would be when you write a sentence such as this: “Check out the new #iPhone6—we have 
pics.” The strength of this is, whenever someone clicks on #iPhone6 in another Facebook 
update, it will result in a list that includes your update, too, theoretically giving it wider 
exposure. However, hashtags on Facebook are relatively new, and according to authori-
tative source Edge Rank ( http://edgerankchecker.com/blog/2013/09/hashtags-on-face
book-do-nothing-to-help-additional-exposure/ ), they haven’t helped anyone gain much 
additional exposure yet. But it’s still early in the game, and hashtags might become more 
important on Facebook as more users become aware of them. 
 Facebook Advertising 
 If your posts aren’t getting promoted fast enough on 
Facebook, now Facebook allows you to buy favorable 
placement of your updates on the gigantic social net-
work. But can’t you get this anyway? Not exactly. If you 
update your status, it won’t be seen by all your friends, 
but will be displayed according to a proprietary Face-
book algorithm. Whether it will be displayed to your 
friends has to do with how they interacted with you, 
whether your friends have chosen to avoid your posts, 
what sorts of things they’re interested in, and how 
quickly your post experienced engagement after it was 
ﬁ rst shared. 
 You’ll see at the bottom of each of your Facebook 
updates an invitation to “Promote.” Click on that, and 
you’ll see an offer to promote an important update, 
making it move higher on your friends’ news feeds for 
$6.99. You’re able to pay with PayPal or credit card. 
 Once you’ve established your site, it’s a good idea to 
start a Facebook page for your site. This gives you addi-
tional promotional capabilities, letting you plunk down 
higher amounts of cash to spread your reach across 
 Police this area:  Just like comments on your blog, sometimes Facebook comments can get 
out of hand, too. Treat your Facebook readers as if they’re visitors in your own home, and eject 
them if necessary. A feature on Facebook allows you to “almost delete” an offensive post, making 
it visible only to whoever wrote it and that person’s friends. Its usefulness is extraordinary—
deploy it liberally. 
 Don’t overdo it: Whenever you write a post, share it on Facebook and all your other social 
platforms, but don’t overdo it. At  Mashable , we’ve noticed that people start complaining if we 
place updates on Facebook more often than every hour or so. Don’t wear out your welcome, 
posting multiple times each hour, because you’ll reach a point of diminishing returns, annoying 
more potential readers than you entice. 
 Contribute to other posts   , discussions, and interactions on Facebook, so it won’t look like 
you’re just there as a promoter and a spammer. Participate. The more you put into it, the more 
you’ll get out of it.

people you don’t know yet, such as friends of friends. We’ve tried some of this promotion, 
and you’d be surprised how many visitors you can get for, say, $45. 
 How’s the best way to spend this advertising money? One winning strategy is to wait 
until you have a post that resonates much more than most of your posts do. That would 
be the one to promote, spreading the word to between 10,000 and 20,000 Facebook users 
who might be tempted to click on that link. It can start getting expensive, but this is a 
good way to get a new site off the ground quickly, and get additional people to “like” your 
site’s Facebook page. 
 Buying advertising for a post can become seriously addicting. You put money in here, 
and the pageviews come out there. However, spending $30 for every single one of your 
posts might not be sustainable for you. We’ve noticed that even with posts that are wildly 
popular, at ﬁ rst we weren’t able to proﬁ t from the pageviews as much as we spent on the 
advertising to get them. 
 Some bloggers promote many posts. For example, Crystal Ponti of MommiFried.com 
selectively promotes posts with a few bucks. “I religiously promote posts on Facebook—
mostly between $5 and $15,” she told us. But she is more likely to buy ads for particular top-
ics. “Facebook advertising responds well to topics that have a family/personal nature. So 
I frequently promote my posts related to cooking/recipes and parenting,” she says. Other 
topics don’t do as well for her mommy blog. “I’ve tried promoting posts related to social 
media and blogging, but even with targeting they didn’t do nearly as well as the others.” 
 If you have a little extra cash, it’s a good idea to experiment with Facebook advertis-
ing, but we think it’s better to use it as a seasoning, just for special occasions. If you have 
a post that feels like it’s on ﬁ re, give it a rocket engine to propel it into orbit with adver-
tising. However, we’ve also noticed that a post that isn’t particularly resonating with the 
readers doesn’t do much better no matter how much advertising money you throw at it. 
 The more people who are attracted by your ads, the more you can earn with the ads 
you’ve placed on your site. But the advantages of advertising can go beyond short-term 
monetary gains, too. Says Crystal Ponti, “I’ve recovered the costs in terms of referral traf-
ﬁ c; not monetary. But there is a long-tail to blog monetization. The more readers and 
unique visitors, the greater the chances of attracting the interest of an advertising or 
brand. So a clickthrough from Facebook doesn’t necessarily monetize, but the trafﬁ c is 
one part of the larger puzzle.” 
 Whether you promote every post, just a few, or none, the object of this game is to get 
your Facebook updates in front of the largest crowd you could possibly gather. Unless you 
have a huge following on Facebook already, you’ll need that advertising to get people to 
come to your site. Get as many people liking your Facebook page as possible, and then 
you’ll have a ready-made group with whom you can share each of your posts. Once you 
have a few hundred fans who are eager to read your next missive, you’ll see a delightful 
difference in the trafﬁ c you can lure with your posts on your site’s Facebook page. 
 The ultimate goal is thousands more “likes” than that. Once you get up to 1.3 million 
likes, every time you place something on your Facebook page, hundreds—and sometimes 
thousands—of people will come ﬂ ocking to your posts. At that level, Facebook becomes a 
spectacular promotion machine. 
 The downside? You’re depending on the vagaries of one social network (which some 
people believe is just a fad) for most of your site promotion. Spread out your promotional 
efforts, also sharing each of your posts to LinkedIn, Google+, Twitter, and if the post’s con-
tent has an eye-catching picture or two on board, Instagram.

 Your two mainstays will be Facebook and Twitter. Become familiar with their intrica-
cies, and if you need help, there are thousands of articles on the web and books in the 
library that will ﬁ ll you in on all the details. However, the big picture is this: It doesn’t 
matter if you’re feeding Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, or some other social net-
work, if you don’t have that hot title or that compelling hook, then it doesn’t matter 
where or what you’re promoting—nobody will care. 
 Contests 
 Want thousands of readers? The closest thing to buying them is to put on a contest. One 
advantage of this technique is that it attracts readers who normally wouldn’t visit your 
site. Hopefully, after they’ve visited for the contest, they’ll stay for the content. 
 You’ve probably developed contacts with companies that supply products for your 
chosen topic, so you can approach them for prizes, assuring them lots of promotion dur-
ing the process. As your site gets bigger, those companies will come to you with contest 
ideas. If you’re looking for a high-impact prize that might be too expensive for a company 
to provide, you might need to buy that yourself. However, offering something like an iPad 
might be such a huge enticement and audience builder, it could be worth the investment. 
 There are a variety of contests you can conduct. The most basic contest is simply 
offering prizes to randomly chosen winners. That works to attract readers, but even bet-
ter for a blog is a contest that gets readers involved. For instance, a sewing site could have 
an annual Halloween costume contest, with promises to showcase the top ten entries, 
and a complete how-to article showing how the winning costume was created. If you pro-
mote it right, the prize for this contest is the exposure, giving the winner bragging rights 
and prestige. Best of all, entrants will certainly ask all their friends to come to your site 
and vote for them. This results in the ideal situation: Your readers are promoting your site 
for you. In this case, they’re even supplying content for you. In this sort of contest, both 
you and your site visitors win. 
 Promote! 
 Once you become microfamous, you might have radio stations or other broadcast out-
lets contacting you for interviews. If you get a call to do such an interview, you’ve struck 
gold. You might not see an immediate beneﬁ t to your blog’s trafﬁ c, but to have your 
name mentioned on radio or television, or in a newspaper, is a tremendous boon to your 
brand. 
 Another way to promote your brand is when you’re reviewing products. Once you’ve 
ﬁ nished your review, if you liked the product and gave it a positive review, mention to the 
people who sent you the review unit that they would be welcome to quote a few words of 
your review in their advertising materials. There’s nothing quite like shopping around in 
Best Buy and seeing one of your comments next to your name on a product box. 
 Spreading the word about your blog can take an inﬁ nite number of forms, where 
you’re limited only by the amount of creativity you can bring to bear on the subject. We’re 
not saying you have to transmogrify a bus into a cigar-shaped vehicle to promote your 
cigar blog, but any sort of wildly creative publicity stunt—as long as it’s legal—leaves a 
lasting impression.

 Measuring Success 
 How do you know if your blog is doing well? Analytics. Analytics measure your visitors, 
your reach, and the time individual users stay on your site. When you’re a new blogger, 
the difference between 1,000 pageviews and 10,000 is huge. However, before we discuss 
the various services, remember that focusing too much on pageviews can become frus-
trating at best. By writing to “get Google juice,” as the analytics-fanatics call it, you may 
fall into the trap of writing to please machines and not humans. 
 Also note that we are not here to offer a foolproof method for monetizing your blog. 
We’re trying to teach you how to write for blogs and make your blog a success, and mak-
ing money is part of it. However, there are plenty of online resources for monetizing and 
analyzing your blog. Here are a few notable ones. 
 Google Analytics 
 Google Analytics is the premier 
free analytics service. We recom-
mend that everyone use it to keep 
track of trafﬁ c to their blogs. To add 
it to your website, simply create a 
Google Analytics account (use your 
Gmail account to do this) and paste 
the tracking code into your site 
(where on a page you place this code 
varies, so be sure to read the in -
struc tions). The site you’re seeing to 
the right is WristWatchReview.com, 
a property that sees a fairly regu-
lar stream of trafﬁ c on a daily basis 
(about 1,000 visitors a day) who view 
an average of 1.5 pages per visit. Most 
users spend a minute on the site, 
and most of the trafﬁ c comes from 
searches. 
 That little box there, the Top Con-
tent read-out, is probably the most 
interesting and addicting. It shows 
you what content performs the best 
and can become a problematic source of obsession for many bloggers. 
 It gets even more interesting when you watch visitors interacting with your site in 
real time. On the left column of Google Analytics, click on Real-Time, and you can get a 
live look at your active audience. Here’s a real-time tracking tool that shows you trafﬁ c 
numbers as they happen, organized in a useful and constantly updating list. If there’s 
such a thing as exciting website analytics, this is it. It’s a thrill to post a story and then 
see the immediate reaction of your readers, watching that story climb to the top of your 
Google Analytics chart after you’ve published it.

 Our favorite mode is “Overview,” which gives you a look at the locations where your 
trafﬁ c is originating, pageviews per minute and per second, and the number of active 
visitors on the site right now. To show you what’s driving the trafﬁ c to your site, there’s a 
live list of where your trafﬁ c is coming from, as well as your top social trafﬁ c. You can get 
closer looks at visitor locations, trafﬁ c sources, content, and more using this live tool, a 
service so powerful it hard to believe it’s free. 
 Want to know more? We’d recommend taking a few hours on a weekend to study 
Google Analytics, learning how to customize it to your liking, and how to use it 
to track traffic. Don’t worry—it’s nowhere near as complicated as it looks at first. 
Google provides excellent free training for new users at “Conversion University” 
(look it up on Google), a site featuring a comprehensive suite of video tutorials that 
show you everything you need to know to take advantage of this powerful and free 
tool.   
 Woopra 
 Woopra beat Google Analytics to the live trafﬁ c monitoring game, and it has a vari-
ety of tools that Google Analytics Real-Time can’t match. Like most analytics tools, 
Woopra requires you to slip a snippet of JavaScript code onto each of your site’s pages 
(or install a simple plug-in in a CMS such as WordPress), and then you’re good to go, 
with each page communicating with 
Woopra’s mothership and delivering 
the numerical goods to you, lickety-
split. Even with all that number 
crunching, it doesn’t seem to slow 
your site down at all. And, if your 
site is still in its beginning stages 
with less than 30,000 pageviews per 
month, Woopra is free. Once you’ve 
graduated into the big leagues of 
pageviews, the price goes up, from 
the “Startup” plan—$79.95/month 
for 1,000,000 actions, up to the 
“Small Business” plan that handles 
4,000,000 actions per month for 
$199.95. 
 Let’s take a close look at how it 
works. 
 Here’s the browser-based version of Woopra’s main screen, where the Active Pages 
area on the top right shows you exactly how many visitors are reading your posts, 
listed in hierarchical order. You can see which search terms people are using to get to 
your site on the bottom-left Recent Search Queries window, and the handy Today vs. 
Trend window in the upper left shows you how you’re doing compared to your site’s 
historical averages. Imagine all of this data moving and updating in real time. It’s a 
kick.

 Woopra does a lot more than just 
track trafﬁ c, though. It offers in-depth 
analytics, letting you see how sto-
ries performed, and letting you ﬁ lter 
them by any combination of dates or 
geographical area. And it offers an 
odd feature that some users might 
ﬁ nd creepy: it allows you to chat with 
your visitors, live. Take a look at Woo-
pra’s map view, depicting each visitor 
with a red pin: 
 Click on one of these pins, and you’ll 
see live information about that user. 
 Click “start chat” and as adminis-
trator of your site, you can try to ini-
tiate a live conversation with one of 
your visitors. 
 The visitor sees an invitation to 
chat, and if accepted, the interrupted 
and surprised reader will probably be 
asking you what the heck is going on. 
This feature could be useful—Woopra 
reports that some people are using it 
for contests, notifying winners via live 
chat. Others are using it for answer-
ing questions about a visitor’s orders 
 Here’s an example of how this real-time data proved itself to be extremely 
valuable to  Mashable . It was Oscars Sunday, and in Woopra’s Recent Search Queries window we 
noticed a tremendous number of users searching Google for the term “Oscar predictions.” Looking 
over to the right Active Pages window, it turned out that it was last year’s Oscars story that was 
attracting increasing numbers of users. Uh-oh. Users were searching for these terms, finding 
them on  Mashable , but quickly leaving our site because they were getting information that was 
a year old. Still, they were coming to the site in constantly increasing numbers. We acted quickly 
on this, writing a post with as many Oscar details as we could muster in a half-hour. After posting 
that story, we modified last year’s Oscars story with a prominent link at the top of the page  
 to this year’s new Oscars post. Instantly, Woopra showed the crowd’s reaction, showing us in 
real time how visitors were landing on last year’s Oscars page, and then immediately clicking the 
link that took them to this year’s Oscars page. Suddenly, we were getting twice the pageviews 
for this timely topic. By knowing exactly what was happening in real time, Woopra allowed us to 
enlarge our audience.

or other customer service functions. 
Be careful how you use this, or your 
readers will soon feel like they’re 
under surveillance. 
 Compete.com 
 Compete.com is another interesting 
source for information about compet-
ing   blogs, but the data found at Compete 
can’t be taken completely seriously. 
 Take the foregoing comparison, 
for example. We’ve just conﬁ rmed 
that WristWatchReview saw 39,000 
visitors over the past month or so. 
Therefore, the estimate there is far 
from 
correct. 
However, 
Compete 
describes its service (signup required) 
as similar to the Nielsen Ratings. The 
company explains: 
 Compete’s data comes from a statisti-
cally representative cross-section of 2 mil-
lion consumers across the United States 
who have given permission to have their 
internet clickstream behaviors and opt-in 
survey responses analyzed anonymously 
as a new source of marketing research. 
 Clearly Compete’s base of 2 million 
consumers is not representative of the 
entire Internet, but for general assess-
ments of site performance, it’s a great 
intelligence tool. Even though its data 
seems to skew low, showing fewer vis-
itors than you really have, true to its 
name, its data is useful for showing 
competition, displaying the ongoing 
trafﬁ c differences between sites.  
 Chartbeat 
 Chartbeat.com is one of the more interesting “web dashboards” available for standard 
websites. As you can see on the next page, it gives you a speedometer of active visits as 
well as views on individual stories. It also maintains a history of your average perfor-
mance over time and allows you to replay days the way you’d roll back the tape in a sports 
game so you can understand when—and why—posts do well. 
 Chartbeat costs $9.95 per month after an initial trial period, but if you’re serious about 
analytics and truly paying attention to what’s going on at your site minute-by-minute,

it’s a stat aﬁ cionado’s dream come 
true. John has used it for more than a 
year, and it’s a useful way to see what 
exactly is happening on your site at 
any time. For folks used to “old” ana-
lytics, it’s amazing. 
 Give Them What They Want 
 One last thing about your web stats: 
Use these tools to ﬁ nd out what peo-
ple are looking for when they come 
to your website. Are they looking for 
reviews? Are they looking for speciﬁ c 
terms in articles that you’ve written? Keep those terms in mind, and even write more 
articles about them if they’re appropriate for your topic. Give your visitors what they 
want, but ﬁ rst, be sure to ﬁ nd out exactly what that is. 
 How to Make Money 
 So how do you make money blogging? First, as we said at the outset, there is no magic 
bullet. Living off the proceeds of your blog requires you to be one part hustler, one part 
entrepreneur, and two parts lucky. And it can take a long time to reach the point where 
you’re making money blogging. 
 Crystal Ponti with MommiFried.com has a multipronged approach. “I do sponsored 
reviews and posts that come in directly from brands and indirectly through organiza-
tions like BlogHer and Mom Central,” she said. But she gives mixed reviews to afﬁ liate 
programs that give her cash when people click on (and then buy) products mentioned on 
her site. “I’ve tried several afﬁ liate programs, with little success,” she said. 
 When we asked her what was the most effective thing she’s done to enhance trafﬁ c, 
she answered, “Syndicating on some of these larger sites has helped considerably. They 
are great sources of trafﬁ c and referrals.” That reveals an important fact about blogging 
and competition: teaming up with the biggest and most formidable competitors in your 
topic space can pay off. 
 You can also attract some attention to your blog by commenting on other blogs. Says 
Ponti, “Blog commenting is also another huge source of trafﬁ c and referrals.” She says the 
combination of blog comments and syndicating her posts on other blogs “bring in a large 
percentage of unique visits to MommiFried.” 
 Notice, too, that besides being a writer and a mom, Crystal is a businessperson—
that’s a crucial component of blogger success.  
 Once, when John was on a media trip with another writer, he asked what 
the hardest thing about running your own “writing business” was. The wizened reporter replied, 
“the hustle.” Freelance reporters have to always hustle and always sell their wares. Bloggers are 
no different, although they already have a place to publish their work. The real key for both the 
freelance writer and the blogger is to get paid for writing.

 The Brick Wall 
 There’s more than a mere line between editorial and advertising—it’s more commonly 
characterized as a brick wall. In larger operations, it’s customary for those who are selling 
advertising to separate themselves from those who are writing, reviewing, and posting. If 
you’re part of a one-person staff, make a special effort to separate your ad sales activities 
from editorial. 
 You might be tempted to review your main advertisers’ products in the best possible 
light, but you’re probably better off not writing about that product at all if you’ve been 
brainwashed by an advertiser, manufacturer, or source. If you ﬁ nd yourself falling into a 
situation where there are too many conﬂ icts between advertising and editorial, perhaps 
it’s time for you to accept only brokered advertising on your site through services like 
Federated Media or Google AdSense. Sadly, these brokered situations are often less lucra-
tive, but they do ensure journalistic integrity. Bloggers cannot live on integrity alone, but 
be careful when crossing the line from writer to sales manager. 
 Any sense that you need to maintain a brick wall between advertising and editorial, 
especially if you choose to sell your own ads, could go out the window once you start 
thinking about your blog as a money-making venture. However, do not allow yourself to 
be pulled to the dark side of marketing. 
 Another thing to consider is the lure of monetization to the detriment of your con-
tent. Is your desire to monetize strangling your need to produce strong posts, at least in 
the ﬁ rst few months of your blog? If this is the case, step back, take a breath, and work 
through some entry-level advertising systems like Google AdSense, explained ahead. 
There is no reason to go chasing big money when there is none to be had. 
 We recommend hitting at least 5,000 pageviews a day before considering approach-
ing outside advertisers—unless your niche is razor-focused and you personally know the 
major players in it. You may be able to sell an inexpensive ad to a knitting store, but don’t 
try the same thing with Sony if you run a headphone review site. We leave weighing the 
pros and cons of these methods as an exercise for the reader, and there are many excel-
lent monetization websites out there, including the well-known ProBlogger.com. Run-
ning a website and monetizing it are, in the end, jobs for two different people, and if your 
site becomes popular at all you will eventually need to take the steps necessary to hire 
an outside ad sales manager. 
 You Don’t Have to Sell Your Opinion Tonight 
 As an Internet journalist extraordinaire, your opinion is not for sale. What you are sell-
ing is your credibility, and your readers will stop believing what you say if they ﬁ nd out 
someone paid you to express an opinion that’s not necessarily yours. Some bloggers 
accept a certain kind of advertising that looks like a blog post, but here’s where transpar-
ency comes in. As long as you’re clearly designating which stories you post are paid for 
by advertisers and which are your own work, you’re probably in the clear. However, it’s 
up to you to decide just how desperate for advertising you are, to the point of posting 
paid reviews from various manufacturers on your site. You’re on thin ice here, so just be 
sure to completely divulge any pay-for-play relationships. Advertisers often try to con-
vince online journalists to blur the line between advertising and editorial, but don’t let 
them do it.

 One writer I know refuses advertorial but will sell his time as a consultant to compa-
nies who want to break into his portion of the market. This sort of advising relationship 
should also be disclosed but is not as wildly inappropriate as accepting money for a good 
review. 
 In general, don’t sell advertorial. It helps no one in the end and makes you look like 
a shill. 
 AdSense 
 If you’re looking to start advertising on your site right away, you can always begin by serv-
ing ads from Google AdSense. It’s relatively simple to apply the ad codes to your site, and 
you can start earning a few bucks right away. 
 After a quick application process, you can quickly get approved to place a maximum 
of three ads per page on your site. With a CMS system such as WordPress, it’s simple to 
place the AdSense code onto a post page, and suddenly you’re in the ad business. Best 
of all, Google helps you along every step of the way. However, Google doesn’t have any 
phone support, so if you need additional help for a complicated matter, that must be 
done over email. 
 One reason AdSense works so well is because of Google’s system that scans your blog 
post’s text for keywords and inserts a text or display ad on your website that’s related to 
the content. For example, if you write about ﬁ shing, AdSense will offer your readers ads 
for ﬁ shing lures, rods, and spinners. It won’t offer them deals on mopeds (unless you sud-
denly write about mopeds). 
 You’ll ﬁ nd yourself going to the AdSense dashboard often, checking to see how many 
clicks your ads have gotten. On that same “estimated earnings” page is a helpful score-
card from Google, letting you know if you’re using the most effective ads, if your site is 
fast enough to rank high on Google, and congratulating you if you link its ads to its own 
service, Google+. 
 There are a variety of plug-ins you can use on your content management system for 
placing ads on various parts of your site. Or, as we like to do, you can copy the speciﬁ c 
code Google gives you for each ad type and paste that directly into your site. 
 As your trafﬁ c grows, you can begin to make good money with Google AdSense. You’re 
paid according to the number of clicks or views each ad gets—whichever is greater. In 
our experience, the clickthroughs make the most money. The return you get on each of 
the clicks and trafﬁ c varies widely each day, with some days more lucrative than others. 
To give you an idea of how much you can earn, we’ve received around $30 for each 5,000 
pageviews we get. John’s been able to make about $100 to $200 per month on a site with 
1,000 pageviews a day with very little updating. 
 That doesn’t sound like much, but as your trafﬁ c builds and you persevere day after 
day, it adds up. It’s not exactly free money, but it’s the easiest way to start. Build and sus-
tain your blog, and before you know it you’ll have enough income to replace that full-time 
job you just left. 
 Remember that some blogs are immune to AdSense, especially if you’re working on 
an esoteric topic. AdSense may not work if your topic is not easily monetizable or particu-
larly offensive or lurid. Covering murders in Georgia or the porn industry may not endear 
you to certain advertisers.

 A competing service with Google AdSense is the Lijit (pronounced “legit”) Network, a 
division of Federated Media, a company that serves as a clearinghouse for selling ads on 
larger sites. Until you make it to that uber-site level, for smaller sites, Lijit performs the 
same function as Google AdSense. It delivers eyeballs to advertisers, with Lijit furnish-
ing the advertisers as you furnish the eyeballs. Like AdSense, you place the code on your 
site, and get paid for a combination of clicks and pageviews. You can choose to ban cer-
tain advertisers and ads from your site, and you can get paid automatically with direct 
deposit, replenishing your bank account every thirty days. There are many more such 
services, all operating in basically the same way. 
 Advertising Partnerships.  Do you write about cigars? Partner with a cigar company. 
Sell your ad space to them and review the products they have available. But wait, you 
say, isn’t that shilling for the cigar company? No, because you will make it clear from the 
very beginning that you are not part of the partner organization. It is instead a pooling of 
resources to build trafﬁ c for yourself and your partner. 
 Take care, though, because partnerships can quickly become overpowered by an over-
zealous partner. If you’re not able to maintain your editorial integrity—or if your readers 
notice you tend to prefer your partner’s products versus the competitors—then you’re 
sunk. You can obviously take a salary from your partner and focus primarily on their 
business in your blogging, but that is hardly a partnership. 
 Sponsorship.  Related to partnerships are paid sponsorships. Some of the best blog-
gers offer sponsorships for multiple news sources on their blog. For example, you can sell 
a sponsorship to your RSS feed, your podcast, and even offer sponsorships for certain 
tags, categories, or posts. Make it clear at the beginning that this sponsorship does not 
allow editorial control, and you can safely accept a bit of cash for your hard work. 
 Donations. Oddly enough, few people try to accept donations for their hard work. Pay-
Pal offers ready-made buttons for webmasters who want to accept donations. You could 
also bank on your popularity to run a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign to raise money 
when starting your site or sell merchandise branded with your site’s logo. This assumes, 
of course, that you have an excellent and hardcore fan base, which shouldn’t be hard if 
you’ve been following our advice. If you need help, ask for it. The Internet is great at help-
ing the little guy. 
 Affiliate Sales 
 Afﬁ liate sales come from people purchasing something based on either your post or 
your direct recommendation. The most popular source for afﬁ liate sales is Amazon, 
whose afﬁ liate program is simple and easy to understand. You can either place a 
standard ad on your site or you can select items from the Amazon catalog tagged with 
your own afﬁ liate ID. When you mention those items in your post, you link to the item 
on Amazon with your Afﬁ liate ID. Get readers to click, and it could be lucrative. In 
fact, a percentage of any sale that happens on the reader’s computer within twenty-
four hours of clicking on the link goes into your coffers. Hey, this could amount to 
some cash! 
 Google has a similar afﬁ liate network, and another popular site is Commission Junc-
tion (cj.com). If performed correctly, this can be an excellent source for many bloggers 
to make a little cash. For example, you can create a little store containing items you use 
every day—gardening items, knitting items, ﬁ shing items—and send people to Amazon

to buy them. If you are careful and don’t make afﬁ liate marketing the absolute reason for 
your blog, you can steer your readers to some good products and earn a few bucks. 
 Ad Networks 
 There are many so-called ad networks, and choosing among them can be difﬁ cult. Ad 
networks aggregate ad sales for many sites and try to get their editors better deals by sell-
ing many pageviews over many sites rather than focusing on one site. The most popular 
purveyor is probably Federated Media, although a network like Chitika.com could also 
offer beginner bloggers a break. It is often hard to “join” ad networks—a more apt term 
would be “accepted by”—because the managers require a certain level of involvement 
and a large number of pageviews to get through the door. 
 However, the number of pageviews required to become involved with an online ad 
network is not so astronomical that you couldn’t reach it—once your site has grown to 
about 10,000 page views per month, for example, it’s possible to successfully apply to 
the online advertising network Federated Media.  Mashable got its start this way, earning 
enough money to grow to a staff of about ﬁ fty employees.  Mashable severed its relation-
ship with Federated Media and hired its own sales staff in February 2011 ( http://adage.
com/article/digital/mashable-breaks-federated-media-hires-ad-sales-force/149123/ ). 
The site got to be a tremendous success, even while using a syndicated advertiser for its 
ﬁ rst six years. 
 Personal Ad Sales 
 The highest echelon of monetization 
is direct ad sales. By connecting with 
the manufacturers of the items you 
write about the most, you can create 
a relationship that would potentially 
allow you to write about their products 
objectively while still accepting ad 
money for banners on your site. How 
is this done? 
 First, you need to create a Media 
Kit and Rate Card. The Media Kit will 
describe your site and mention some 
pertinent facts about your readers (age, 
salary range, geographical location), and 
some information about your trafﬁ c. 
 This, for example, is  Mashable ’s 
media kit. 
 ABlogToRead’s media kit is shown 
on the next page. 
 You’ll notice that both are fairly 
compact. Think of this as a “top-
level presentation” to ad buyers. The 
real work and detail will come when 
you present your case to them in a

more personal fashion. Also prepare a 
rate card for a number of placement 
opportunities. We recommend stick-
ing with banner and skyscraper adver-
tisements on most blogs— banners 
being the long, thin advertisements 
that appear between stories or at the 
top of a page, and skyscrapers being 
the long, tall, and skinny ones that 
feature text or graphics. 
 Other 
sites 
sell 
“roadblocks,” 
essentially rebranding the entire site 
to an advertiser’s wishes during a 
set period. In many cases, this is an 
excellent way to sell a large ad for a 
period of time—a day or a week—that 
will prevent all other ad inventory 
from being visible, and it gives your 
intended advertiser the run of the 
site. For example, all of the banners 
and skyscrapers would belong to one advertiser, all AdSense ads would be turned off for 
that period, and the site background will change to suit the theme of the roadblock ads. 
 All of this is theoretical, however, if you can’t get advertisers. Start small. Approach 
PR people you know asking to be put in touch with their ad-buying and marketing teams. 
Introduce yourself, offer your media kit, and a rate card noting your “cost per thousand” or 
CPM, and follow up every few months. Your job is to produce quality content, not go chas-
ing every dollar. As your site grows you may ﬁ nd advertisers beginning to approach you. 
It will take work and dedication, but monetizing through personal ad sales is possible.  
 Advertorial 
 We didn’t want to have to discuss this, but advertorial—essentially “paid content”—is  not 
okay . Anything you write for an advertiser to showcase its brand or product is advertorial, 
and it should never be done for any money. It jeopardizes your respectability and objec-
tiveness in the space and turns you into a shill.  Don’t do it . Don’t accept a product for a 
“good review.” Don’t accept “corrections” because an advertiser requested them (unless 
your error was wildly egregious). 
 Another problem to consider is the misuse of afﬁ liate links. If you write a post just to 
plop in a potentially lucrative afﬁ liate link, scrap it. There is no reason to risk the reader’s 
ire at your crass commercialism over a few dollars made from selling a box of diapers or 
a steak knife. 
 A more acceptable way of getting companies involved in your advertising—but not 
selling out—is with “sponsored posts.” You can create a series of posts that would be sup-
ported by one advertiser with its logo and graphics all over each post. However, none of 
the articles within that series would be about that particular advertiser. This is a favorite 
technique of  Mashable ’s. For instance, you could write a series of ten articles about “Back 
to School,” and all of those could be sponsored by a company that makes lunchboxes. 
www.ebook777.com

143
However, don’t cross the line into writing about those lunchboxes, because that would be 
the same as taking part in an advertorial. 
 This can backﬁ re. For example,  The Atlantic  once posted a “sponsored post” about 
Scientology that expressed some charming hagiography about the religion. Regardless 
of which side of the religious debate you fall on,  The Atlantic  couldn’t afford to be seen as 
supporting Scientology, no matter how rich the payoff. The outcry forced  The Atlantic to 
rescind the article. 
 There are varying schools of thought in regards to advertorial. If you can avoid it, 
avoid it. It might be hard and it might lose you money, but it’s often better to post adver-
tising in more traditional ways.  
 Merchandising 
 Depending on your chosen topic, merchandising might be a huge way for you to make 
money. One blogging guru we know makes a killing selling T-shirts on his comic book site. 
He had the T-shirts specially designed with unique graphics that have widespread appeal, 
and he sells dozens of them every week at a hugely proﬁ table markup. Perhaps you can 
think of a particular piece of merchandise that could sell well on your site. Include your 
site logo on those items, and you can get your readers to advertise for you when they wear 
that shirt or carry around that tote bag. If you do decide to have custom merchandise 
made, we’d suggest having it created locally, saving yourself some shipping costs. Then 
take care of handling and shipping the items yourself. Even though you might spend your 
weekends boxing up products and mailing them out, if you create the right products and 
make them appealing enough, this might be a good proﬁ t center for you. 
 “Donate” Button 
 You’ve probably seen those PayPal buttons on websites, asking for donations, but did you 
know that they actually work? Yes, readers donate cash to websites using this simple 
method. One of our blogging friends says he gets about a 10 percent donation rate from 
his visitors using this “Donate” button, compared with a 1 percent clickthrough rate for 
his ads. Not all his visitors donate huge sums of money—many of the donations are $1—
but as his number of visitors grows, it’s paralleled by the number of contributions. 
 Handle this tactfully. We advise you to add just a small amount of text near your 
“please donate” button, eschewing the guilt trip or high-pressure public-television-style 
tactics, and keeping your begging short and simple. Try to make your pitch for donations 
more like the highly skilled guitar player at the train station, busking with his case open 
and passively inviting contributions, rather than the pushy wino, tapping you on the 
shoulder while hustling you for spare change. 
 Indirect Monetization 
 Remember when we told you, early on, that bloggers were experts in their ﬁ elds? This is 
your chance to shine. By giving away the content on your blog, you become more likely 
to pick up freelance writing contracts, book deals, speaking engagements, and consulting 
opportunities. In fact, many individuals and companies use a blog as a way to advertise 
themselves, thereby informing their readers and the world at large about their skills and 
expertise.

 Say you’re a garden planner. By creating a gardening blog (and noting in the sidebar 
that you’re available for consultations) you can talk about your favorite subject and build 
your business. This sort of work—simple, basic, and eminently scalable—is the kind of 
monetization we like best. Take what you love to do, add blogging, and you create a syn-
ergy unavailable to nonbloggers in the same ﬁ eld.

 Ethics Problems and 
How to Solve Them 
 We wish ethics questions in blogging could exist in a vacuum. “Is it okay to keep a source 
secret?” “Is it okay to publish business secrets? State secrets? Personal secrets?” “Is it 
ethical to take money for a blog post?” All of these questions would be easier to answer if 
we didn’t have to answer the primary question in modern blogging: “Is this going to get 
me sued?” 
 Libel and Slander 
 Blogs are journalistic endeavors—but they aren’t. You are free to write what you want, but 
you must always understand that you have neither the might of an organization nor the 
law behind you. However, you have the laws of the country where you’re blogging on your 
side (or against you, as the case may be). In one recent example, a blogger named John 
“Johnny Northside” Hoff wrote a blog post about mortgage fraud involving Jerry Moore, 1 
a former community leader in Minneapolis whom Hoff wrote about three times on his 
local blog. Moore sued for libel and was unable to make the charge stick. Instead he sued 
for $60,000 for “meddling” with Moore’s employment after he was ﬁ red, and he won that 
original case. 2 
 Hoff appealed the case in 2012, and the court reversed the award, because that old 
saying about how “truth is the best defense” turns out to be, uh, true. The appeals court 
found that Hoff’s statements about Moore were true, and under the First Amendment 
of the U.S. Constitution, you can’t be found liable for true statements ( www.startribune.
com/local/minneapolis/166762386.html ). 
 So what have we learned from this? What is libel and slander, and who are public vs. 
private individuals? Let’s go over a few deﬁ nitions. 
 You’ll notice all the scare quotes here. That’s because we’re basically dealing with 
uncharted territory. Anything you write can get you sued, and you may or may not have 
legal recourse. 
 Libel , according to the  Random House Dictionary , is “defamation by written or printed 
words, pictures, or in any form other than by spoken words or gestures.” This means 
printed or written matter that scandalizes a person. This could include images. The key

point here is falsity: What you are trying to prove in a libel case is that the libelous party 
is writing something false about you. The same goes for libel’s talky cousin,  slander (“The 
action or crime of making a false  spoken statement  damaging to a person’s reputation”): 
both of these require  falsity . 
 Here, then, is the rub: If you are publishing rumor or hearsay, you will inevitably pub-
lish false information. This is ﬁ ne if you mess up rumors of an upcoming electric car, but 
not so good if you’re talking about a public or private person. 
 The vast majority of libel and slander threats are never taken to court. Persons ﬁ nd-
ing their good names besmirched on the Internet often send “cease and desist” (C&D) 
letters, ostensibly from a lawyer, that politely (or impolitely) require that a blogger take 
down this or that post or comment.  As a rule of thumb do not remove anything you 
have written, unless you know it is false, or it has been proven false and potentially 
damaging by an impartial third party, usually a court . Thus, any C&Ds—unless followed 
by real legal wrangling on the offended party’s part, should be quietly ignored. Don’t get 
in a shouting match with someone who has a big legal budget, but don’t concede defeat, 
either. The chilling effect created by these C&Ds damages the business of blogging (and 
all journalism, for that matter) by causing real newsgathering to wither due to fear of 
retribution. You will write unpopular things, and the best thing you can do is be accurate, 
truthful, and have well-documented sources. 
 Bloggers often receive C&D letters for one reason and one reason only—the rumors 
they reported are true. In most of the cases when we’ve received C&D letters, they were 
sent by companies who found that we had acquired internal information through an 
informal leak, the most memorable case being a letter from Apple about images of the 
iPod Nano we had received from a tipster. The C&D conﬁ rmed the rumors as true and we 
published the C&D alongside the news. 
 Libel and slander cases are notoriously hard to win, and those who feel themselves 
wronged usually decide against continuing the cases once they realize the expenditures 
involved. But to bring people to the point of consulting a lawyer is not in an independent 
blogger’s best interest. 
 Getting Called Out 
 So you’ve written something that disagrees with something someone else wrote later on, 
and they call you out. What do you do? 
 Well, are they right? Did they add context to your piece that you missed? Did you 
mess up? If any of these are true, a correction is in order but not a retraction. There are 
plenty of people out there who will take pot shots from the sidelines, but if you did your 
job right you have nothing to fear. 
 This happened to us recently: A post we did a few months prior was called out as 
an example of how “bad” our work was. The post was written on good faith with details 
supplied by people in the know. The takedown, on the other hand, was written from the 
perspective of disgruntled former employees of the operation we wrote about. Therefore, 
our post looked nice and saccharine, and the other reporter looked like a hard-working 
muckracker. In the world of media, both posts should exist, but we were not wrong for 
posting our slightly more supportive piece. In context, we were both right. 
 If you value your integrity, don’t cave to online pressure.  That’s the long and the 
short of it.

 Shield Law 
 There’s one other legal right you might have as a blogger called a shield law, 3 applying to 
you just as it does to news reporters. Those laws, different in every state, give you the right 
to refuse to reveal your sources during the newsgathering process. There is no national 
shield law, but forty states and the District of Columbia offer those protections, otherwise 
known as “reporters’ privilege.” So unless you live in Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missis-
sippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, or Wyoming, you won’t 
need to worry about being subpoenaed or forced to reveal your sources in a court of law. 
For those other states, all except Wyoming have court-recognized privilege, which varies 
from state to state. We hope a national shield law will soon be enacted, something that’s 
been under consideration for several years now. 
 Mr(s). Cellophane 
 Transparency is just a newfangled word for being candid and telling the truth. Transpar-
ency means not doing anything sneaky, tricky, or sleazy. You’re going to be writing some 
quick stories on your online site, and being human, it’s inevitable you’ll get something 
wrong. If you’re entirely transparent, rather than sneaking in and changing something 
that you got wrong, you’ll let the readers know you’ve changed it. 
 When you’ve written a post and you discover you’ve made a mistake, the urge to edit 
those errant words or phrases without saying anything will grip you like a vice. “Maybe 
nobody will notice if I go in and change 1,000 to the correct number, 2,000,” you say to 
yourself as you go back into your publishing program and start editing stuff. Maybe they 
won’t notice, but then you won’t exactly be telling the truth to your readers, now will you? 
 In a fast-moving news environment, new facts tend to emerge, and you can call atten-
tion to those either inside the body of text or at the end of the story. When you publish 
an update to your story, it gives readers a good feeling, assuring them they are getting 
the latest information. Sometimes an update is so crucial to the story, you’ll want to put 
the word “updated” in the story’s headline to call attention to the new stuff. Sometimes 
that headline modiﬁ cation can draw in more readers, looking for new information. You 
can tweet that new headline, announcing the new information, and visitors will come to 
your site to read it. 
 Other times, you mistype something—for example, writing “teh” instead of “the,” and 
we think it’s okay to ﬁ x typos without correction notices or undue fanfare unless the 
whole meaning of the story is changed by that one typo. 
 Whether you go to great lengths to apologize and correct your mistakes is up to you. 
There are different variations on such corrections, such as striking out the errant word 
and replacing it with the correct one. If you want to do that, just place an <s> before the 
word you’d like to strike out, and a </s> after it, and then it will be plain for all to see 
exactly what you’ve changed. It’s a little humiliating and looks messy on the page, but 
this is the most straightforward way to call attention to changes and updates you’ve 
made since the piece was published. 
 An emerging standard on serious news sites is to keep a list of all the changes you 
made on a special page on your site. Each item in that list includes a link to the corrected 
article. It’s also helpful to formulate a corrections policy, and post that on the site as well. 
Make your corrections policy and corrections page accessible with one click from any

location on your site, and if you follow your own rules, you’ll be well on your way toward 
complete honesty and transparency. 
 Going back into your text and correcting yourself—admitting you’re wrong—is a 
tough thing to do, especially for someone just starting out. You might ask, “Won’t that 
take the site’s credibility down a few notches every time I make a correction?” Not neces-
sarily. If you have to correct almost everything you write, your readers will stop believing 
you. But if you make an occasional correction, in our experience we’ve noticed that  read-
ers love that . You’re reminding them that you made a mistake, but at the same time you’re 
conﬁ rming that you’re honest and transparent. 
 Are there exceptions to this corrections rule? Like most things, there is a gray area 
where you’ve published a story mere minutes before, and you suddenly realize you’ve left 
out information, or that you needed to edit some grammatical errors, or that you would 
like to polish up that last paragraph. Our rule is akin to the “ﬁ ve-second rule” when you 
drop food on the ﬂ oor—any correction you make within ﬁ ve minutes of the publishing 
time is okay. Depending on how fast your server is, sometimes the story might not have 
even become available to the public by then. 
 An exception to that rule is when someone has commented on your story within those 
ﬁ rst ﬁ ve minutes. For example, what if a  Mashable  blogger misspelled former Egyptian pres-
ident Hosni Mubarak’s ﬁ rst name (oops, spelled it “Mosni”), and then made the correction 
within ﬁ ve  seconds of clicking “publish?” Complicating matters: a reader spotted the error, 
commenting about it even within that short ﬁ ve-second exposure. Would it be okay to  
 delete that comment? Technically, no, but it’s a gray area, one where you as king of your 
blog will have to make an executive decision. Here’s our take: If a commenter points out 
that error you made, and then you change it underneath him, you’ll leave him hanging, 
and subsequent readers of the comments will wonder what the heck happened. Don’t do 
that to your readers. They will always know that  you were the one who made them look 
silly. It’s not worth it. Simply add a comment thanking your eagle-eyed reader and move on. 
 As the ultimate grand poo-bah of your site, you’ll be the one who decides whether 
that ﬁ ve-minute rule holds sway, if there is zero tolerance for any sneaky corrections, 
or if you’ll just go ahead and correct whatever you want and never tell anybody. Maybe 
we’re wusses, but we’ve always thought the best way to do business is with honesty and 
transparency. Do what you want, but in our experience with numerous successful blogs, 
we’ve noticed that the more transparent you are, the better. 
 Whichever route you take, it’s usually the best idea to fess up, letting the readers 
know you made a mistake and that you’re ﬁ xing it. It’s simply the right thing to do, just 
like they used to teach you in kindergarten—when you make a mistake, take responsibil-
ity for it, apologize, and then do your best to make it right. 
 When Hosting Providers Attack 
 If your hosting provider ever pulls your plug because of something you wrote—and we’re 
assuming that the thing you wrote isn’t 100 scanned pages of a Harry Potter novel (i.e., 
pirated material)—then ﬁ nd a new host. In some cases hosts like Wordpress.com receive 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices from malicious  organizations 
that want to, say, silence debate. This is not okay. 
 If your provider tries to censor you, it’s time to get a new provider. Pulling your post 
is never “within their rights,” and shutting down your site is even worse. The unwritten 
www.ebook777.com

Ethics Problems and How to Solve Them
149
contract between us and the Internet states that information must be free. Providers 
ignore that at their peril. 
 If you ﬁ nd yourself in a position where you have to ﬁ ght a hosting provider to let you 
post something, quit that host immediately. There is no reason to ﬁ ght them on points 
they will eventually lose. 
 Junket Junkies 
 The same level of transparency is required in dealings with trips provided by companies 
that want to share news with you in some exotic locale. Sometimes corporations are so 
awash in cash that they elect to take a group of lucky journalists on a trip, showing off 
the company’s products and generally bathing those ink-stained wretches in the glow of 
corporate largesse. Some might even call it brainwashing. 
 This is a tricky area for you, Mr. or Ms. Watchdog. You want the info that’s doled out on 
these fancy trips, many of which will include brand-new facts, ﬁ gures, and products. But 
you don’t want to get too close to the company. As a rule of thumb, you must make your 
reader understand what free stuff you were given while writing a story. Disclose. 
 What’s wrong with taking a trip with a company to cover a bit of news? Well, ﬁ rst, 
let’s talk about what’s  not  wrong. On the positive side, accepting an invitation to a junket 
usually gives you a close-up look at products or services before they’re introduced to 
anyone else. You’ll get ﬁ rsthand experience with the latest stuff, and usually the engi-
neers, developers, and executives who brought the product from idea to reality will be 
right there, ready and willing to answer all your questions. This can be a valuable source 
of information, giving you the ability to relate your ﬁ rsthand experience to your readers 
before they hear it from anyone else. 
 There’s a social value to traveling on these junkets, too. Besides the original content 
you’ll be able to glean from such trips, it’s also advantageous to you as a journalist to hob-
nob with others of your ilk. And, once you establish a congenial face-to-face relationship 
with a corporation and its agents, product managers, executives, and engineers, they’ll 
be more likely to place a name with a face when it’s time for even more new products and 
information to roll out. As long as you realize that the companies are trying to bribe you 
into writing positive articles about their products, you’re probably okay. 
 As a practical matter, most bloggers don’t have the ﬁ nancial backing of a large orga-
nization, and can’t afford a lot of travel. A freelance travel writer would go out of busi-
ness after her ﬁ rst trip to a ﬁ ve-star resort in Burma. It’s not ﬁ nancially feasible for much 
“lifestyle” journalism to exist without this relationship. It is not completely savory, but it 
happens all the time anyway. 
 So what does that mean? It means a company comes to expect coverage of a certain 
tenor from the authors they fête at their ranches and on their yachts. Clearly, the balance 
of power is out of the journalist’s favor in this case, and the resulting disparity creates 
the worst kind of writing: bespoke or access journalism. If company A offers you a trip 
with the promise of more to come, what are you going to say about company A? That its 
product is subpar? That it misses the mark? That it sucks? If you do end up publishing a 
negative article about that company, would that be your last junket with that company? 
 The primary mission of any journalist is to comfort the afﬂ icted and afﬂ ict the com-
fortable. It’s hard to afﬂ ict the comfortable when you’re rubbing shoulders with oligarchs 
and drinking ﬁ ne wine from the CEO’s private cellar.

 So what to do? Keeping your credibility intact is not that hard. All you have to do is 
maintain a level head, remembering that you can’t be bought and that you’re on a search 
for truth. Keep things ethical when you write about what you’ve learned on the trip by 
revealing that the company paid your way. 
 You don’t think you can maintain credibility and judgment on such a trip? Then don’t 
go, or if you do, don’t write about what you saw. If you’re working for a larger organiza-
tion, you might be completely forbidden from attending any paid trips by manufacturers. 
Some organizations (such as  The New York Times ) will not let you write for their publica-
tions unless it’s been a set amount of time (sometimes two years) since you’ve been on 
any paid junkets. Others such as  Mashable insist on paying their journalists’ way to these 
events. But as an online journalist or blogger, if you’re in charge and you do decide that 
junkets are okay, it’s in your best interest to divulge this free travel, entertainment, win-
ing, and dining to your readers when you write the articles describing the products and 
experiences you’ve had, seen, and touched on those trips. Beyond the transparency of 
divulging a company’s attempt to bribe you, the most important thing of all is not to let 
your own opinion be swayed by such luxuries. 
 The bottom line is this: PR people, during business hours, aren’t your friends. Their goal 
is to maximize the reach of a piece of news, and if they can get you to practice bespoke 
journalism, gaining their client a bit of free advertising, so be it. With advertising rates 
high and the value of online presence increasing, there is a recently popular trend to send 
product out to almost everyone and his dog. Five hundred good reviews are better than 
499, at least when it comes to Google and other ranking sites, and so PR people depend on 
some laxity of morals to ensure that less experienced journalists will support their posi-
tion in hopes of receiving future free products. Don’t be one of those corporate stooges. 
 Your goal is to tell the truth. If the truth as you perceive it matches their pitch, then 
everything is ﬁ ne. But don’t be pressured to change your mind by a fancy steak and whis-
key chaser. 
 A few more tips: 
 Should you ever befriend PR people? Yes, but don’t let them pitch you. 
 Should you ever date PR people? The heart wants what the heart wants, but don’t let 
them pitch you. 
 Should you ever take gifts from PR people? No. 
 Should you ever take calls from PR people? No. Make them email you. 
 Are PR people valuable? Yes, when they help you achieve a coverage goal. They are at 
their worst when they get in the way of your work. 
 Free Stuff 
 Review units: Do you send them back or not? 
 It’s tempting to simply keep review units, giving yourself free perks for your trouble. The 
problem with that is the appearance of impropriety when you accept free products from 
companies, which could be construed as bribes. In most cases, you’re obligated to send 
a product you reviewed back to its maker, and it’s customary for the company to pay for 
shipping costs on any review units, both ways. For more valuable products, companies will 
often ask you to sign a product loan agreement. At the end of the designated loan period, 
they’ll usually nudge you to send the review unit back, which you should do promptly.

 If you’re writing favorable comments about a product that was given to you for free, 
that could be seen as advertising, but it’s deceptive only if you’re praising the product 
simply because you got it free. That’s why some journalists go to great extremes to avoid 
even the appearance of bribery.  
 There are exceptions to this quandary of hanging on to review units. Many 
times, there are updates, bug fixes, and modifications applied to products. For example, Logitech 
sent us its Revue Google TV set-top box, which we promptly reviewed. As product development 
continued, the company continually updated its operating system, added applications to it, and 
generally improved upon its usability. We wanted to write about these incremental improvements 
to this important device, so we held onto the review unit, and Logitech wasn’t asking for it back 
anytime soon. This is still ethical, because a reviewer must continue to possess the hardware to 
do further reviews of the product. Other times, you need to use those products longer than just 
a few days, so you’ll be conversant about its particular characteristics. These sorts of arrange-
ments can be worked out with companies, but it’s your obligation to immediately return any 
review unit upon request. 
 War Story 
 At the end of a dinner we enjoyed with former  Wall Street Journal  tech 
guru Walt Mossberg, we saw the sage columnist paying cash to our corporate host for the price 
of the dinner we just ate, and for the Las Vegas show we were about to attend. To be fair, the 
 Wall Street Journal  probably has an impressive entertainment budget, but the spirit of his action 
should guide your dealings with PR folks. 
 War Story 
 Your ultimate desire should be to serve your readers, and tell them the truth about 
the products you review. Your credibility hinges on the fact that you are incorruptible; 
that no matter how hard companies try to sway your opinion with gifts, travel, expensive 
dinners, and plenty of drinks, you’re an ironclad journalist who can’t be bought. Accord-
ing to your own set of ethics and morals, you’ll need to decide for yourself how you’ll 
handle the issue of journalistic integrity. 
 What if you’ve reviewed a product, and like it so much you’d like to keep it, but the 
company is asking for it back? Again in murky ethical territory, you could ask the com-
pany for what’s known as an “editorial accommodation price,” allowing you to settle 
accounts with the price that is usually around what it costs for the company to manu-
facture it. Companies are often eager to do this, because shipping costs and the fact that 
you’ll be returning a used product make it unproﬁ table to return review units, especially 
if they’re bulky yet inexpensive. 
 This opens up a larger discussion of bribes and payola. Should you accept  anything 
free from companies you’re writing about? It’s complicated. For example, some publica-
tions such as  Consumer Reports  don’t accept free samples, instead hiring secret shoppers 
to buy all their own review units from the same stores where consumers will buy those 
products.

 That’s not practical for a blogger just starting out. You’ll need to convince companies 
to send you free review units if you want to write reviews, but that doesn’t give those com-
panies the right to expect you to suddenly be under their control. Ultimately, you need to 
maintain your own distance from the companies that supply you with products to review. 
 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has addressed this issue, and it’s put together 
its Revised Endorsement Guides 4 for bloggers using review units and free services from 
companies. The Guides say that afﬁ liation must be disclosed if the writer strays from typ-
ical “just the facts” reporting. So “this widget is blue” requires no disclosure, while “This 
beautiful widget is a rich, cerulean blue and will remind you of your ﬁ rst love [Disclosure: 
The company gave me 500 of these widgets for my friends and family]” does. 
 While the Guides are detailed and contain lots of useful suggestions, the gist is that 
the FTC recommends transparency. That means if you review a car, for instance, and you 
got to use that car free for a month, mention that in your post. The FTC even goes so far 
as to say if you borrowed a review unit and then returned it, you should mention that, too. 
 Contrary to rumors, the FTC will not be levying ﬁ nes of $11,000 per post against those 
who don’t choose to follow its Endorsement Guides, and the agency will not be monitor-
ing bloggers for compliance, nor does it have any plans to. Go ahead, read the govern-
ment gobbledygook recommended by the Federal Trade Commission—it’s enlightening. 
Or skip it, and remember the most important lesson:  keeping your journalistic activities 
transparent will serve you well in every aspect of your blog. 
 Whatever you decide about review units and how you’ll handle them, it’s difﬁ cult not 
to be inﬂ uenced by someone who bestows lavish gifts upon you. Resist that inﬂ uence. 
Ideally, every reviewer would buy all review samples like  Consumer Reports  does, and not 
accept any advertising. But this is the real world, so we’ll leave this topic here: Remember, 
your obligation is to your readers, not to those companies whose products you’re review-
ing. Tell the truth, no matter how much companies try to bribe you. Readers will trust you 
to do the right thing, if you’ll just be straight with them. The government’s not going to 
bust you for being dishonest, but your readers will. 
 Caught in a Trap 
 “Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when ﬁ rst we practice to deceive.” You’ve lied, and 
now you’re caught. First of all, just don’t lie. Stop it. Now. You’re a blogger, on a search for 
truth, and lies are anathema. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, how do you con-
trol damage from a lie you told on your blog? The easy way seems to be to just stonewall 
it, and keep insisting that you didn’t lie, and that whoever says you’re lying is himself a 
liar. But that doesn’t work. Forget that. The ﬁ rst thing you need to do is much like what 
you do when you make a mistake and correct it: Take responsibility for your falsehood, 
apologize for it, assure your readers that you won’t do it again, and then don’t. And make 
it a sincere apology, none of this half-baked, “mistakes were made” crap. Use phrases like 
“I was wrong,” “For that I sincerely apologize,” “I take complete responsibility.” These ear-
nest apologies will let the readers know you are truly contrite. Just don’t lie. 
 Leaks and Trust 
 As you get to know more PR reps and company ofﬁ cials, they’ll start letting you in on 
secret products, ideas, policies, or plans. No, they usually won’t trust you with that

information, requiring you to sign a nondisclosure agreement, known in the industry 
as an NDA. Inside the NDA are provisions that will allow them to sue you if you reveal 
this information before the agreed-upon embargo date. Signing an NDA can be a great 
help to you as a writer, giving you time to write a well-considered and carefully crafted 
review or story that you can publish the instant the product is announced. However, in 
our fast-paced world, an embargo can make or break a scoop. Perhaps someone isn’t as 
scrupulous as you, or maybe the news appeared on a rumor site. It’s couched as rumor, 
but you know it’s true. What to do? 
 The easy, glib thing to say in this situation is “Stick by your agreements and don’t 
reveal any secrets until the embargo date.” But sometimes it gets tricky. What if you and 
twenty other sites have signed this NDA, and then one of the sites publishes a story a 
couple of days before the embargo lifts? Under those circumstances, is it all right to go 
ahead with the story, since the cat’s already out of the bag? Technically, no, but realisti-
cally, if one major website has already told this secret story, it’s no longer a secret. Care-
ful, though—you could get sued (although it’s highly unlikely). You signed that NDA that 
promised you wouldn’t reveal any of this information, not that you would keep it a secret 
as long as everyone else did. 
 The solution to this, obviously, is to refuse to sign NDAs on principle, and for the same 
reasons that disclosure is important: an NDA is a restraint, as is an embargo. Embargoes 
started out for a good reason: it was to allow journalists far from the major news hubs 
to receive and digest information before a nationwide release. However, now embargoes 
often allow bigger names “exclusive” rights to news while the rest of the rabble waits out 
the embargo time. While not particularly fair, this is a bad habit that crops up quite often 
on many beats. For example, many electronics companies release products on Wednes-
day nights so the big papers— The Wall Street Journal  and  The New York Times —can have 
ﬁ rst crack at publication on Thursday. This sort of tacit collusion, while unseemly, is fairly 
commonplace. 
 Again, because of this gray area, many bloggers and website editors refuse to sign 
NDAs. Their argument is that NDAs give companies too much control over the dissemi-
nation of information. At the same time, numerous companies abuse the concept of an 
NDA, making you sign such an agreement months before a product release, and then 
controlling what you can and can’t write about that product in the ensuing months. The 
tail wags the dog. Now, many companies are asking writers to sign NDAs even for the 
slightest triﬂ e of a product release. Honestly, it’s getting out of hand. You can refuse to 
sign NDAs, or do what we do, and play the NDA game on a case-by-case basis. 
 Stand Up Straight, Private 
 You’ll notice we spent quite a while on the maintenance of propriety in blogging. There 
is a good reason: blogs, for the longest time, have not been taken seriously. Long seen as 
side projects and hobbies, it took us and the other blogging stalwarts years to gain status 
in the journalistic world. Some, like  Mashable , don’t even want to be called “blogs” any-
more, opting to be called “digital news sites.” 
 We remember the early 2000s when the Consumer Electronics Show would barely 
recognize bloggers, let alone offer them journalist credentials to cover the show. This 
started to change in about 2004, but it was only in the past four years or so that blogs 
far out-reported mainstream sources in terms of word count and access. Local papers

are folding left and right, while companies are ﬁ nding the web to be a much more com-
fortable outlet for many of their messages. As a result, bloggers are seen as, if not valu-
able, then necessary. For every major newspaper review of a new product or vacation 
spot there are three or four—or forty—blog posts. Marketers have begrudgingly begun to 
accept that maybe, just maybe, we know what we’re doing. 
 Not to sound rude, but we don’t want you ruining a good thing. Once you get into 
our shoes, you will want to maintain blogging’s integrity and value as a medium. If you 
came into this so you could get free stuff and trips to Hawaii, then you’re in the wrong 
business (we hear sweepstakes entry is an up-and-coming industry). Sure, you’ll get 
your share of fun doing this job, but the satisfaction that your work is read and appreci-
ated and actually makes a difference is worth far more than a new iPod, no matter what 
anyone else says. 
 We are telling you how to act because we want you, as a new blogger, to make us 
proud. As we mentioned before, blogging is a big deal. Scandals only reinforce negative 
stereotypes and reduce our value in the ecosystem of information.  
 Be Nice or Be Right 
 Remember when your mom told you that if you didn’t have anything nice to say don’t say 
anything at all? She was partially right. If you have solid evidence of wrongdoing, mal-
feasance, messiness, or mendacity and you can prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, you 
should. If you hear rumors that someone did something to someone else, then maybe 
you should hold off until you hear more. In short, be nice or be right. 
 Blogging’s Golden Rule 
 You can’t work in a vacuum. Blogging is now mainstream, and what you write can poten-
tially damage blogging’s reputation. The new golden rule is this:  respect the blog and the 
blogger.  The days of trolls, cranks, and lonely guys in their basements posting cat videos 
are over. Blogging is mainstream. You are entering a strange new world where media is 
not owned by massive corporations and where bloggers are becoming massive corpora-
tions in their own right. 
 Blogging is the front line of a new journalistic model. You are its vanguard. Make us 
proud.

 Blogging Perks 
 Blogging is not all grueling drudgery and gnashing of teeth. Once you get the heavy lifting 
done in the beginning, it’s time to set your mind free, relax, be yourself, and ﬁ nd fascinat-
ing topics where you can show everyone your stuff. 
 While blogging yourself into a notable presence (or a notorious one) takes a long 
time, you’ll be able to get a taste of the sweet perks of blogging early on. Watching 
Google real-time analytics gives you a cheap thrill right at the beginning, showing you 
how many active visitors you have on your site, what they’re reading and where they’re 
reading from. Here’s where you are reminded that the web is truly worldwide, with 
dots appearing on the global map from nearly everywhere on earth. It’s a humbling  
 feeling. 
 One of the lasting perks of being a blogger is the education you get from covering 
your chosen topic. Because you’re a driven and determined engine of expertise, you’ll be 
digging into your topic deeper than anyone else, perhaps uncovering brand-new knowl-
edge with your own experimentation. At the very least, you’ll be talking to the luminaries 
of your subject, ﬁ nding out what the current deep thinking is, and spinning along this 
information to your readers. Before too long, unless your topic is so vast that no one will 
ever get a ﬁ rm grip on it, you will know practically everything there is to know about your 
topic area. 
 This might not seem like a perk, but as soon as you press Publish, you’re suddenly 
plugged into the most gigantic fact-checking machine the world has ever known. If 
you’ve been diligent about writing that post, you’ll have all of your facts correct. However, 
no one’s perfect, and when your audience gets bigger, there will always be one reader 
who knows more than you do about the narrow subject you’re writing about. That reader 
might decide to admonish you in the comments, but take it as a perk and not an affront, 
learning from the experience and adding it to the most valuable asset you possess: your 
memory bank. 
 Perhaps the best part of being a blogger is the visibility you get. Most jobs that require 
deep thinking also require sharp writing skills, and your blog will be the perfect showcase

for those wondering if you can concisely express yourself with words on a page. If you 
have picked the right topic and written compelling blog posts, your blog can serve as the 
ultimate writing sample. Not only will it show those who might want to hire you that you 
are knowledgeable, but also they will get a good look at your personality just by reading 
through your blog. 
 The Job Hunt 
 You’re reading this book, so you’re probably considering blogging as a way to make a liv-
ing. If you persevere and have talent and a little luck, you could make sensational money 
from a successful blog. However, instead of starting your own blog, you might want to get 
a job at one of the established websites on the Internet. Or you might want to work for a 
big corporation, helping it communicate with its customers on a corporate blog. In this 
chapter we’ll offer tips about how to get hired at a big blog, and show you how to build 
your brand so you’ll get noticed. We’ll explain how networking can make all the differ-
ence for your blog and for your future employment, and how to make a career change to 
blogging in the smoothest possible way. 
 So what’s the best way to get a job at one of those top-ﬂ ight blogs? There are many 
routes to the same destination. For instance, at  Mashable , the best way to get hired is to 
get a job there ﬁ rst as an intern. The company hires more interns every semester, and the 
latest “internapalooza” saw thirty-ﬁ ve interns hired. That’s remarkable, considering that 
 Mashable has only about ninety staffers total. 
 As you work through your $10-per-hour gig, lots of friendly people are more than 
happy to be your mentor.  Mashable ’s interns get to work on the front lines, writing posts 
from almost their ﬁ rst day working at the site. They’re given tremendous responsibility, 
writing for 15 million unique visitors every day. This is the kind of internship you want. 
While the morality of using $10-per-hour interns to do the same work its paid staffers 
are doing is questionable—and if you can afford to live in New York City with that kind 
of income—you could work at a major blog for a semester or two, and that could be your 
ticket to the big time. 
 Another way to get noticed at the top blogs is to become an astute commenter. Find 
a story you know something about, add your own special brand of insight, and if you’re 
consistent in the quality and frequency of your comments, you will be noticed. Be sure not 
to simply write a post and paste it into the comments section. That’s bad form. Instead, 
add a pithy two-paragraph response to the post under which you’re commenting, show-
ing that your mindset is similar to those who are writing the blog. 
 In fact, as we worked for three of the top ﬁ ve blogs in the world, we were always on 
the lookout for promising writers. Most of those strong writers we noticed were writing 
posts on their own blogs, showing us every day that they had the chops to make it in the 
big time. Starting up your own blog is your chance to show your stuff. If your destination 
is one of the major blogs, the best thing for you to do ﬁ rst is to start your own blog, write 
1,000 words on it every day, and see if blogging is actually a career path you want to take. 
If you turn out to be spectacularly successful, not only will you be noticed by industry 
luminaries and big-time blogs, but also you might consider keeping your blog going for 
yourself, and perhaps even turn it into an empire.

 Networking 
 Looking for jobs on LinkedIn, other job sites such as Glassdoor.com ( www.glassdoor.
com/ ), and Monster.com can sometimes work, but there is no site that can match the magic 
of a recommendation from someone you know well when you’re looking for the perfect 
job. Most of the best jobs are never advertised, and are ﬁ lled solely by word-of-mouth. 
 We’ve been on both the hiring side and the job-seeking side of the employment equa-
tion, and the hiring side is a lot more stressful than you might think. Whenever you 
bring someone into your organization, you’re taking a risk. Will you be spending money 
on someone who will not work hard enough? Will you be introducing more trouble than 
beneﬁ t by hiring someone? As a job hunter, it’s up to you to show hiring managers that 
you will be a signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t to their organization. However, the company might not 
be willing to take on the risk of taking your word for it when you say you’re going to be 
an ideal employee. Hiring managers are looking for a sure thing, and a recommendation 
from a trusted colleague has extraordinary value. 
 Your best bet in ﬁ nding an appropriate blogging job is to seek out those you know 
who are blogging, and ask them if they’ve heard of any opportunities that might be suit-
able for you. You never know—a friend of yours who is working at a blog might be able 
to get a ﬁ nder’s fee for recommending you. That happens at  Mashable , where anyone 
ﬁ nding a person who ends up being employed at  Mashable  gets a few hundred bucks as 
a ﬁ nder’s fee. 
 An important way to tap into this word-of-mouth power is to be sure your friends 
know you’re looking for a job. You might even consider placing on your LinkedIn proﬁ le 
something along the lines of “looking for online reporting opportunities.” If you follow 
our advice and build up your LinkedIn network, a simple change in your proﬁ le could 
suddenly be viewed by thousands of your connections and result in job leads. 
 There’s no shortage of editorial jobs in today’s employment market; however, there 
is enormous competition for the best ones. That’s why you need to make yourself stand 
out by knowing someone at the company. That’s another area where LinkedIn can help; if 
you look up a particular company on LinkedIn, you’ll see how many of your connections 
either work there or know someone who does. 
 When we were working at  Gizmodo , there was one small blog that 
kept grabbing all the scoops. Who was this secretive and anonymous “Boy Genius” (whom we 
now know is Jonathan Geller) who seemed to find out about every cellphone and hot gadget 
before anyone else? Certainly he would like to step up to a major-league tech blog like  Gizmodo , 
abandoning all he had done for his site,  Boy Genius Report  (now known as  BGR ). It turned out 
the Boy Genius had already been through  Gizmodo ’s rival blog,  Engadget , and was so successful 
as an anonymous columnist there that he started his own website. He was not interested in 
leaving his blog, and it continued to grow, rivaling  Gizmodo  and all the other tech sites. It was 
so successful that in April 2010—less than four years after he started the blog—Geller sold  BGR 
to Los Angeles–based media company PMC for an undisclosed sum. Now, he’s probably worth 
millions while  BGR is “the biggest mobile news destination in the world.”

 Usually when you apply for a job as an online journalist, you’ll be asked for refer-
ences. Of course, you’ll want to include those trusted colleagues you’ve worked with in 
the past who are sure to put in a good word for you. But it would be even more helpful 
to get a recommendation from someone who works for the company to which you are 
applying. Either way, always check with someone before you list that person as one of 
your references, and if you’re applying to a company where someone you know will be 
your reference, be sure that person is liked and admired by those who are hiring you. 
 Beyond online networking, trade shows and industry events are where you’ll ﬁ nd 
your richest job-hunting targets. Your humble authors rarely go to a trade show where 
they’re not offered jobs, and the same can happen to you if you know enough people and 
have established a viable network. 
 If you can be seen at important events, that serves as its own endorsement—it means 
that you care enough about your topic to either spend money to get there, or you’re 
important enough to have a company paying your way. However you can get there, be 
seen at these events, and you’ll notice more opportunities coming your way.  
 Follow Your Own Dreams 
 Before you decide to try to get a job with an established blog, don’t give up on the idea 
of building your own blog to the point where it makes money. While the beneﬁ ts such as 
health insurance, vacation days, and holidays you get when working for a major-league 
website are enticing, you’ll be working for someone else. You won’t have control over 
what you do, and you won’t be able to implement your vision for the site. Sure, it means 
you’ll be able to contribute your ideas, but never forget that when you’re working for 
someone else, your mission is to fulﬁ ll that person’s entrepreneurial dreams, not yours. 
Unless you’re lucky enough to have the exact same dreams as your employer, you’re not 
going to have control over what happens in that job. And even if your dreams are similar, 
it often works out that your employer gets the gold mine, and you get the shaft. 
 On the other hand, if you start your own blog, everything on that site is yours. There 
is a risk—and often there’s an opportunity cost—to starting your own blog, but unless 
something is risked, there’s no opportunity for reward. Would you rather be earning 
$300,000 per year for your employer and then paid $50,000 in salary, or earning $300,000 a 
year for your blog, and then get to keep all of it for yourself? You’ll be working for some-
thing you built, something that belongs to you and that you can show to the world as 
completely yours. 
 The feeling of total ownership and responsibility is profound. The spirit of entrepre-
neurism is what you’ll need to start your own blog and see it through to success. The 
reward of entrepreneurism is the ability to visualize what will happen, put lots of sus-
tained and focused work into it, and then see the result. If you don’t like what’s happened, 
it’s your responsibility. At the same time, you will be the one receiving the kudos when 
it’s a success.  
 Get Rich Quick? 
 Blogging is a long-tail career. As in most “writerly” pursuits, you’re going to face the facts: 
most bloggers aren’t making much money. Even given all of their clout, many blogs can

support a single editor and little else. Although there are plenty of amazing bloggers 
making lots of money, most of them treat blogging as a labor of love. 
 That’s why you need to expect to be paid very little (if at all) if you sign on with a 
prominent blog. John’s niche blog, WristWatchReview.com, gets about 30,000 pageviews a 
month, barely makes enough to pay one writer—and John doesn’t see a penny of income 
from the site. It is important for John to keep it going because he likes watches but the 
writer who helps him out, Patrick Kansa, is basically doing it for the love of wristwatches. 
Could he be making more? Probably, but given both John and Patrick have day jobs, it’s 
hard to dedicate the hours to ad sales necessary to truly become proﬁ table. 
 There’s the rub: ridiculous claims can be made about the lucrative nature of blogging, 
and there are plenty of people who will sell you snake oil. But trust us: it’s hard. It’s not 
impossible, but it’s hard.  
 John joined  Gizmodo  because he got laid off and the editor at the time, 
Joel Johnson, liked pierogis. Before his work at  Gizmodo , John was technical editor for  Laptop 
magazine (yes, a paper magazine). Because that magazine apparently no longer needed technical 
expertise, he got the boot. After a few weeks of frenzied job hunting, he saw a post on  Gizmodo 
looking for writers. John drove to Brooklyn, where he and Joel ate Polish food and talked tech. 
In an hour John was sold. Joel’s life was exciting, fascinating, and looked exhausting. But even 
though Joel—who is a hale and hearty writer with a heart of gold—looked like he was about to 
have a heart attack because he was so far from his computer for that hour, it was clear that this 
was a life that offered quite a bit of freedom and a lot of future. Fast-forward nearly a decade, 
and Joel is still blogging and now John is that exhausted but exhilarated writer. 
 Changing Careers 
 What if you want to move into blogging as a full-time profession? We’ve met a few people 
who have done it with success, so we can address a few major concerns and give a bit of 
advice. 
 Blogging, like any profession, requires conviction. We have seen too many sites fall 
by the wayside simply because the creators didn’t follow through. Your blogging goal, 
deﬁ ned in  Chapter 1 , can be to become an expert in your ﬁ eld. Maybe you don’t need the 
cash. If that’s the case, skip ahead. 
 Still with us? Good. So here’s the truth: making money blogging is easy if you have the 
right niche. There are multiple monetization strategies that we’ve discussed in previous 
chapters but here are our favorites. 
 Consulting. The easiest way to make money blogging is the most indirect. Because 
you are considered an expert in your ﬁ eld you can parlay your recognition into speaking 
gigs (mostly unpaid) and consulting gigs (always paid). While creating a consulting career 
is outside the scope of this book, rest assured that we’ve met popular bloggers who blog 
to further their “second” careers. Think of your blog as a public portfolio; if you write 
regularly and using the tips we’ve described in previous chapters, you will get noticed. 
Some businesses buy billboards. You’ve chosen to make Google your billboard.

 Building a Brand 
 You might think corporations and products are the only ones who have brands, but you 
have a speciﬁ c brand to promote: you. Your name and the name of your blog are both 
parts of your brand, and your reputation is what makes it shiny and appealing, or repug-
nant and off-putting. 
 Keep your personal brand in mind with every action you take. Minding your brand 
is crucial at every turn, even if it’s the smallest interaction such as a reply to a comment 
on your blog, a comment anywhere on Facebook, the way you carry yourself at industry 
events, press conferences, and trade shows, and all of your interpersonal interactions 
with readers, other bloggers, and anyone else. 
 You might not be famous yet. You might not even be micro-famous, or even nano-
famous, but starting from the beginning, you need to think this way: that you’re not 
famous  yet . You never want to do anything to besmirch your good name, a valuable brand 
that will serve you well if you treat it with tender loving care. 
 Successfully building your brand hinges on how giving you are to everyone else. For 
instance, do more than just promote yourself and your blog posts on social media. Point 
your followers toward other sites’ posts, or point out happenings that you found interest-
ing. Give people content they can use, and that they’ll want, beyond simply promoting 
your posts. In fact, some stories you’re thinking about posting might work just as well or 
even better as a tweet or a Facebook update. Give people these morsels of content and 
information—things you know that they don’t—and that will build your brand. 
 Pay attention to detail if you want your brand to shine. If your blog is full of mis-
spellings, poor grammar, factual errors, and posts that no one cares about, your personal 
brand will emerge as something people would rather avoid. 
 Be consistent with your brand. Create a logo or look that people recognize as yours 
alone. Then spread that logo around as much as you can without being a grafﬁ ti artist. 
Place it on your business cards, make sure it’s always spelled and capitalized the same 
way, and treat it like gold. 
 Speaking of business cards, you never know when a branding opportunity might 
emerge, so any time you meet someone, make it a point to hand that person your busi-
ness card. He or she might not be someone who can directly help you, but it’s hard to 
predict when someone will know someone else who could approach you with a great gig, 
assignment, advertiser, or story tip. 
 You don’t need to be an annoying and pushy salesperson with your brand, but remind-
ing everyone that you’re a blogger, you write great stuff, and your site is worth a visit is 
crucial to your success. 
 John owns a 3D printer. It’s a printer that makes objects out of plastic. 
In his years blogging he’s followed the 3D printing industry with avid interest, and recently his 
posts have driven a great deal of traffic to an odd place—John’s own 3D printing service website. 
While he doesn’t make much on the services, he is number three in Google for “3D printing in 
Brooklyn” and he gets a steady stream of small clients who need small things printed on the fly. 
While 3D printing is little more than a hobby for John, imagine the damage he could do if he put 
his mind to growing the business.

 Building an Empire 
 The hardest thing you’ll face while blogging is realizing that it’s just too much work to do 
alone. While your 1,000-word regimen will allow you to post four or ﬁ ve items—or one big 
one, if you’re in the mood—you’ll soon realize that the amount of news you’re missing is 
becoming a detriment to the growth and evolution of the site. It’s a good problem to have. 
 We bloggers are often loath to admit we need help. We do. Blogging is difﬁ cult and 
constant work, and even the best bloggers eventually bring on teams of people to help 
them cover the day’s news. Add personnel when you’ve picked up enough trafﬁ c to pay 
yourself. Once you’re making a few hundred dollars a month on your site and you have 
good (or bad or any) relationships with your sources, you may be ready to take on an 
assistant, paid or unpaid. 
 Sadly, the current blogging model rarely supports paid interns or assistants, or even 
co-editors. If you’re making enough money to pass a little cash on to another person, 
however, no matter the amount, try to pay that person. If blogging is to be taken seriously 
it cannot depend on the kindness of strangers. As the boss, you might even consider 
paying other bloggers to work for you before you even pay yourself. Consider this unpaid 
work an investment in growth, part of the cost of boosting your blog from obscurity into 
a powerful force of the blogosphere. 
 Knowing When to Call in Reserves 
 If your beat is big—technology, fashion, or ﬁ lm, for example—you’ll probably need help 
off the bat but can’t afford it, or can’t ﬁ nd the right people. Do your best alone until you 
hit about 1,000 pageviews a month. The difference between 10 pageviews and 1,000 is 
fairly small—it just means more people have made you a daily read—but the difference 
between 1,000 and 10,000 pageviews is immense. Getting to that number is hard work. 
 Why do you need help? Because you can’t do everything. You need to be writing, pho-
tographing, interviewing, and reviewing. As a solo blogger, your three or four posts a day 
amount to your own personal statement, but if you want to build an empire, you’re going 
to need more than just a personal statement. To catch that shark, you’re going to need 
a bigger boat. You’re going to need to cover your topic comprehensively, and that can be 
done only with a highly motivated team of enthusiastic journalists. If you don’t know any

such people offhand, ﬁ nd some at job boards such as problogger.com, freelanceswitch.
com, or elance.com. Or ask around on Facebook or LinkedIn, especially helpful if you’ve 
built up a big list of friends or contacts there. 
 Is it time to start hiring? To quote the White Stripes: 
 Well you’re in your little room 
 And you’re working on something good 
 But if it’s really good 
 You’re gonna need a bigger room 
 The bigger room, in this case populated with a scintillating writer or two in addition 
to yourself, is a better support system for your site and your work. By the time you reach 
the point where your blog is starting to generate some income, it’s probably proven itself 
to be an entity poised for even more growth. That’s especially true when your blog is nur-
tured by extra ninjas at your side, adding additional content, putting forth more effort, 
and making their numerous points with a variety of voices. 
 Posts equal trafﬁ c.  To spur additional growth, increase the number of posts your blog 
presents to its readers every day. Generally, the more posts you have, the more popular 
your site will be. A blog that publishes twenty high-quality posts a day is going to be 
a lot more attractive to potential readers than one that cranks out a mere ﬁ ve equally 
high-quality posts a day. But there are limits to the number of posts a blog can handle in 
one day, organically restricted by the amount of content that’s worth covering and the 
amount of money available to pay those writers who are stoking this furnace. 
 Where is that sweet spot, where there are enough posts per day on a blog to ade-
quately cover the news, yet not so many that your team of bloggers has to scrape the 
bottom to ﬁ nd suitable content about which to write? There’s no hard and set rule for the 
sweet spot of post-count-to-audience-growth, because it varies with each topic niche. 
Some subjects are so vast and general that even 100 posts per day won’t cover the topic 
thoroughly, while others can be completely covered every day with just 10 posts. Some 
are completely covered with one or two per day. 
 You’ll know when you’re approaching that sweet spot. You know that feeling when 
you’re solo blogging, and when you ﬁ rst start your day, it seems like there are dozens of 
topics you could write about? That changes drastically when you build a team of blog-
gers. If you’ve built up your post count, it gets to the point where by mid-afternoon, when 
you’re looking for something to write about, every conceivable news story of the day has 
already been covered. That means you’re getting close to that sweet spot, if you haven’t 
already passed it. 
 Another indicator that you’ve reached that sweet spot: When you add posts, your 
trafﬁ c numbers stay the same. Unless that new writer you added isn’t cutting it, or you’ve 
done something else to offend your readers and slow down trafﬁ c, you might have gotten 
to the post-count saturation point for your blog. 
 In the early days of our work with  Gizmodo , we were cranking out about thirty posts 
a day with ﬁ ve bloggers. As the site grew, we added more writers, until about a year 
later we were publishing ﬁ fty posts per day with about ten bloggers. We noticed a siz-
able jump in our trafﬁ c when we raised the post count from thirty to about forty posts 
per day. It’s difﬁ cult to pinpoint if that trafﬁ c growth was due to the increased number of 
posts, improvement in the quality of the writing, or maybe the growing buzz surrounding 
www.ebook777.com

 Gizmodo . We suspect it was a combination of all three, but it felt like a big part of that 
boost was directly attributable to those additional posts. When writing about technology 
and gadgets, it felt like we were thoroughly covering our topic at forty posts per day. But 
when we raised that to ﬁ fty posts a day with an even bigger team, it felt like we were 
getting in each other’s way, and it often seemed like we were desperate to ﬁ nd worthy 
topics to cover, especially on a slow news day. Worse, it felt like our posts were competing 
against each other for the limited attention of our visitors. It felt the same way at  Mash-
able , which in 2013 was blasting forth around seventy posts per day. 
 Here’s the dirty secret to blogging: posting more makes you look bigger online. When 
people return again and again and see an entirely new front page with brand new stories 
they see your site as a source for up-to-date information and therefore more valuable. 
 Hufﬁ ngton Post  didn’t get big because it posted a few big stories a day. It got big because 
it ﬂ ooded the webwaves with information.  Drudge Report  is popular because new content 
appears on it seemingly every minute. That’s how web content works—by engulﬁ ng the 
user in stuff. 
 How to Be a Blogger Boss 
 The key to being a blogger boss is letting go of some things while holding tight to the 
core principles of your blog. It’s a loose/tight leadership that lets your writers ﬂ ex their 
own style while you take care of the big picture. Trying to control everything your writers 
do, editing their work to the point that it’s not their work anymore, and micromanaging 
everything that happens with your site is not a good way to motivate your chosen blog-
gers. That’s why you have to choose the right people, and then let them work their magic 
while you keep an eye on the direction your ship is headed. 
 The concept of teamwork is popular these days, but when it gets down to it, blogging 
is about 95 percent parallel work and 5 percent cooperative work. Your blogging team 
will need to coordinate its topic choices to avoid duplication of effort. And ideally, you, 
as editor-in-chief, will want to edit their work and offer constructive suggestions. But 
the actual writing of complicated, tight, and entertaining blog posts is a solitary activity 
requiring intense concentration, and doesn’t lend itself well to teamwork, which tends 
to devolve into distraction. There’s no shortage of starry-eyed managers who envision 
a tight-knit group working together like a well-oiled machine, cranking out a cohesive 
website with impressive teamwork. For sure, that 5 percent of the time spent on team-
work is crucial, like the 5 percent of the time pilots spend taking off and landing air-
planes. But the rest of the time, a group blog is not like a band playing together, blending 
in with each other in perfect harmony. It’s more like a continuous concert with a series of 
highly skilled and expressive soloists taking the stage, one at a time. Yes, they’re all play-
ing a similar kind of music, but each person is expressing him- or herself individually. 
Each soloist even gets to choose which music he’ll play, with your approval. Your job is to 
decide what  style  of music everyone will play, help clean up any sour notes that may ﬁ nd 
their way to the audience’s ears, ﬁ ll the concert hall with eager listeners, and supply the 
concert hall building at the same time. 
 That means you’re going to have to hire a team of self-starting individuals— people 
who are knowledgeable about your chosen topic, can write coherently enough not to 
require rewriting of everything they do, and have a likable and agreeable demeanor. Of 
all the eccentric personalities we’ve seen ﬂ oating through the blogging world, these

11
knowledgeable, borderline-obsessed creative types are the kind of people who are the 
most successful in a group blogging environment. 
 The most important quality we looked for when hiring bloggers was the ability to 
write quality content with a minimum of supervision. All other considerations were sec-
ondary. We didn’t need some hotshot reporter with a long resume writing in-depth sto-
ries about tax policy. We needed a person with energy who was able, in a few minutes, 
to pump out a post or two during a lull in the news. We needed someone who was like a 
speed chess player, who could write quickly, with smart style and wit. 
 How do you supervise these people? At the core, a blogger boss must be able to send out 
a quick message—do this, shoot that, take a look at this—and expect that your employees 
will be able to accurately carry out your wishes. Managing writers is a dicey proposition. 
Criticize them too much, and you’ll break their spirit, making them paranoid every time 
they sit down to write. Praise them too much, and they’ll either stop believing you, or will 
get so pumped up they will have less room to improve their work and might stop trying as 
hard. But if you must overdo something, err on the side of too much praise rather than too 
little. It’s best to couch criticism inside a sandwich of praise, and let a writer ﬁ nd his or her 
own style. If you don’t like that style, you might have hired the wrong person. However, 
don’t hire a seasoned writer hoping to mold that person into the blogger you want. Save 
your molding for interns or beginners you might take under your wing. Even then, these 
are human beings, not trained seals. Give people ownership of their work, trust them, and 
let them develop their own voices, and your team will be inspired to operate at its peak 
efﬁ ciency.  
 How to Find Bloggers 
 The best bloggers come from the ranks of your readers—those who already know and 
love your work will be most willing to supply their time and effort to your cause. Publish 
a post on your site asking for help, and more often than not, you’ll receive a few emails 
from qualiﬁ ed people willing to help. 
 Pay close attention to those who comment on your site. Sometimes there’s a standout 
who might already be writing comments good enough to be blog posts. Pursue that per-
son. It won’t be that much of a leap to turn your best commenter into your best blogger. 
 Trade shows and industry events are fertile ground for ﬁ nding suitable blogging part-
ners as well. If you’re attending a trade show about your chosen topic, you’ll be meeting 
a ready-made crowd of other writers working the same beat who might be interested in 
blogging with you. Keep an eye on sites that compete with you—you never know when 
one of your favorite bloggers might be looking for work. 
 The blogger interview process is simple: Send your candidates a few links or story 
ideas, and ask them to write sample posts. There’s no reason to ask for anything much 
longer than 300 words, and if the turnaround and intent are clear and the writing is 
good, give them a bit of a trial period blogging for the site. It’s literally that simple. The 
best bloggers aren’t professional journalists. They are students (like one of John’s writers, 
Nicholas Deleon), stay-at-home dads, retirees, Best Buy employees (another one of John’s 
writers), or frustrated video producers (like Charlie). 
 In our blogs there is usually a “hazing” period—albeit electronic—when a blogger’s 
work is picked apart with an intensity that is usually exaggerated. This process ensures 
that the new blogger understands the importance of his or her work, and understands 
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Building an Empire
165
that the writing will be judged by even more vehement readers—namely, an audience 
accustomed to seeing words spelled correctly and the rules of grammar followed. That’s 
not to mention the readers’ craving for posts that have their facts straight. 
 Blogging bosses must be on the lookout for cynicism as well. Blog posts that skew 
inordinately toward the negative crop up often in new bloggers, because it’s more fun to 
be snarky and write negatively. That’s a dangerous place for a new blogger to descend 
into. Catch cynicism early and prevent it by offering easier stories to write. 
 We usually ask new bloggers to start out writing “straight”—that is, without humor or 
opinion. This ensures they are able to at least ﬁ nd the basic facts of a story, and express 
them succinctly. Only after a few weeks of that do we consider allowing those ﬂ edgling 
bloggers to begin their inevitable ﬂ ights of lyrical fantasy. 
 Keeping Connected 
 Now we’re getting to the teamwork part. For your blog to function at its maximum efﬁ -
ciency, you must all become experts at communicating. For everyone to communicate 
with each other as a group, we use the web-based chat room we mentioned earlier, called 
Campﬁ re by 37 Signals (free thirty-day trial, $12 per month after that) to keep up with 
what our writers and colleagues are doing. That’s not the only one—others include IRC, 
Hipchat, and Yammer, a group communication app that is like Twitter for closed groups. 
Most of these web-based chat rooms function in a similar way, and all have one key ingre-
dient: privacy—you don’t want outsiders stumbling into your private virtual clubhouse. 
 Campﬁ re works well if everyone using it is aware of some basic etiquette. When you 
get more than four or ﬁ ve people using Campﬁ re, it can be distracting—each time some-
one enters an instant message on the service, it makes a dinging sound on everyone 
else’s computers. Imagine three conversations going on at once with all that constant 
dinging. That’s why everyone using Campﬁ re should also be using an instant messaging 
client at the same time ( Mashable uses Google Talk;  Gizmodo uses AIM;  TechCrunch  uses 
Skype), so only conversations that are necessary for everyone on the team to hear take 
place on the group chat application. 
 Campﬁ re is generally used to pitch or claim stories. When one blogger on the team 
ﬁ nds a story that he or she deems postworthy, a link to that story is pasted into Camp-
ﬁ re, where the editor and other bloggers can click that link and take a look at the story. 
Depending on how you set up your blog, this can be an active notiﬁ cation or a request 
for permission. In most blogs where we’ve worked, the act of pasting a link into Camp-
ﬁ re is akin to staking a claim on that story, but it’s no fair pasting more than one story 
into Campﬁ re at a time. As editor-in-chief, you have the right to veto any story proposal. 
Here’s where some lively discussions begin on Campﬁ re, but it’s best to move that dis-
cussion to individual instant messages, sparing the rest of the group the distraction of a 
heated discussion where every volley is accompanied by Campﬁ re’s dinging sound effect 
that gets more annoying with each iteration. 
 As your group of bloggers begins to coalesce, some individuals will gravitate toward 
certain topics. Encourage this individual interest, and even delineate beats for each of 
your bloggers to cover. That’ll make it easier for them to stay out of each other’s way 
when selecting and pitching stories, and you can begin to develop an expert system 
where your writers specialize in certain topics, products, and people. If someone on your 
team is an expert in a certain area or topic, pass ideas or leads onto that person, rather

11
than muddling through it yourself. Maybe even pass along an idea for an angle on that 
story, too. But don’t offer too much detail—it’ll seem like an order. People don’t work as 
passionately when they’re following orders. Give them ownership of their stories. 
 As a leader, you’ll be there to mediate disputes between your bloggers. When you’re 
dealing with talented, high-strung individuals, it’s inevitable that conﬂ icts will arise. 
These disputes usually have to do with two writers wanting to write the same story. This 
is where you’ll be the one to make the decision about who does the writing, but choose 
carefully. You’ll need to know your writers’ strengths and weaknesses to make a valid 
decision about which writer will cover which topic. It’s up to you as boss and facilitator 
to celebrate the strengths of your writers while downplaying their weaknesses. Whatever 
you do, avoid pitting one writer against another, or showing favoritism. There will already 
be enough natural competition between writers on your team without you stirring up 
more conﬂ ict.  
 Networking for Bloggers 
 Trying to meet bloggers? Trying to enter the blogging “upper echelon?” Trying to get  
 no ticed? Fine, but don’t be a pest. 
 Bloggers, like so many other cliques, have a certain way of approaching the world. 
Most bloggers respect quiet humor, wit, and friendliness over crass chest-beating. In 
short, be nice. 
 Want to meet a blogger? Tweet. Don’t email. Emailing a blogger will get you nowhere. 
In fact, if you have any questions we’d recommend you tweet us before you email (I know, 
we gave you our email addresses, but trust me on this). Twitter is far more direct than 
any other social network. Facebook posts tend to get buried, and LinkedIn is a black hole. 
 When you reach out, be nice. Don’t tweet or email, “HEY I SAW YOUR POST, YOU 
SUCK. THIS IS WHAT I WROTE.” Try emailing something like “Saw your video on XYZ. Can 
we chat? I’m familiar with XYZ and maybe we can collaborate on something.” 
 One of John’s closest blogger friends, Ariel Adams, approached him via email and 
explained that he might have some information that could help him with a research 
project. John, being John, ignored repeated emails until ﬁ nally relenting. Now Ariel is a 
boon friend and trusted conﬁ dant. 
 Charlie approached John for a job at  Gizmodo by offering to copy edit for free. John, 
knowing a good deal when he saw one, called him on his offer and Charlie joined up. 
Almost a decade later, the pair of us are some of the best bloggers in the business. 
 In short, be nice, be friendly, and be persistent. 
 Firing 
 Every blogger needs to be a self-contained universe. Each must produce content that is 
self-contained, context-aware, and 99.9 percent free of typos—if not 100 percent. 
 Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to nurture and mentor one of your newfound 
bloggers, things just don’t work out. Firing a blogger is hard. Assistants who usually come 
from your readership will count you as a friend rather than a boss, and even if you pay 
them, it will be difﬁ cult to pull the plug. 
 Every situation is different, but most bloggers who aren’t cutting it will know almost 
immediately. If a blogger doesn’t have time to help you, that person usually drops out of 
the group voluntarily rather than sustain the agony of disappointment. 
www.ebook777.com

167
 However, sometimes you just know it’s not working out, but the blogger refuses to 
go. It’s time to pull out the big guns. First, offer the blogger a month to shape up. Offer 
clear instruction and discuss what’s disappointing you. Do this on a private channel—in 
 person—if possible. Do not make this a public scolding. Make it clear to your errant blog-
ger that he or she is being watched. 
 A month later, either pull the trigger or give the newly improved blogger a reprieve. 
 Paying Bloggers 
 There is no way for us to tell you how to pay your bloggers, but we don’t recommend 
paying per post. Paying per post is great in theory, but in practice it encourages a certain 
amount of “spamming” by new or less scrupulous writers. The only way to truly do it is 
the way one blogger boss did it: He expected a certain number of posts from his min-
ions, read them all, but accepted and paid only for the ones he liked. While this makes 
some sort of ruthless and Darwinian sense, it’s not the best way to run a blog. But it does 
ensure quality, and also ensures your bloggers won’t go ﬁ ring posts at you at an unsus-
tainable clip. 
 We recommend a ﬂ at fee monthly. If that’s not possible, you can use the foregoing 
survival-of-the-ﬁ ttest method. We usually request 1,000 words per day and one or two 
posts on weekends. There are no baseline salaries we can recommend, but $4000–$6000 
per month if you’re really cooking is on par with what most bloggers are making in 2014. 
Some big-name bloggers earn $10,000 per month at top sites. 
 If you do have unpaid interns, treat them well and with kindness. 
 Who gets on your masthead or About page? Our rule of thumb is to add new col-
leagues to the About page after they’ve worked with us for a month. It’s nice for people 
to get recognized for their dedication, and it doesn’t cost you much—just a few seconds 
of typing. 
 Also remember: This industry is small. We know most of the professional bloggers 
on our beat, and we count them as friends. Don’t cause disorder and strife just because 
someone didn’t work out. Offer good, solid recommendations and always look out for 
fellow bloggers. When the time comes and you need some help, they’ll be there for you. 
 Group Blogging Workflow 
 There are a variety of ways to set up workﬂ ow for your blog. It seems so simple when 
you’re blogging by yourself, picking out topics, writing posts, publishing them, doing your 
own copy editing—you’re in charge of everything. Now that you have colleagues, you can 
keep everything individualistic, or with a larger group, divide the labor and specialize. 
 If your bloggers are less experienced than you, or if you are one who must control 
every aspect of your blog, you might want to set up a more traditional workﬂ ow. In this 
scenario, writers pitch story ideas to you as editor-in-chief, and then you approve or 
disapprove. You sometimes assign stories to your bloggers, and other times they pitch 
stories to you by placing a link in Campﬁ re along with a proposed headline. At this point, 
especially if your bloggers are new, you might want to suggest story angles, recommend 
sources, and generally shepherd the process. When they ﬁ nish writing their posts, they’re 
saved in “unpublished” mode and the writers send the link of their work to you, where

11
you edit for content, grammar, and spelling. In this system, you will be the only one who 
pushes the Publish button. 
 If you’re working with more advanced bloggers, or you’re striving for a more egalitar-
ian workplace, each blogger functions as both writer and publisher. Writers place links 
in Campﬁ re as notiﬁ cations, letting everyone else know which stories they’ll be covering. 
Once they’ve written their stories, your bloggers do their own copy editing and line edit-
ing, and publish their stories when they’re ready. This is the most satisfying setup for 
writers, giving them full rein over what they post. However, this system works only if you 
completely trust each of your bloggers to consistently pick compelling story topics and 
creative angles, something that’s more appropriate when you’ve put together an all-star 
team of blogosphere veterans. 
 There’s a middle ground. Once your team grows larger, you might have the budget 
for specialization. This is the way  Mashable works today, where each of the site’s main 
areas (business, social media, tech, lifestyle, etc.) has a channel editor. Each one of these 
people presides over his or her subject area, editing the posts and mentoring all those 
working for that channel. In addition, the channel editors assign stories received from 
the email news tips box and sources, and gleaned from RSS and Twitter feeds. After a 
story’s written, the writer sends the post to the channel editor for editing, who line edits 
for content and style, cleans up typos, and checks for other errors. Next, it’s passed along 
to the associate editor, who hits the Publish button at the appropriate time, and imme-
diately after that, the community manager and his or her colleagues share the story by 
placing witty prompts, lures, and links on  Mashable ’s extensive Twitter and Facebook 
feeds.  
 Story Tips via Email 
 At ﬁ rst, it will be easy to handle your email tips, because there won’t be many. But as your 
blog grows, those valuable tips will blossom, giving you story scoops with inside informa-
tion that you might be able to use in a blog post. Decide whether everyone will be allowed 
to receive these tips, or if they will be handled by one person. At  Mashable , whoever is the 
associate editor at the time is also responsible for the tips mailbox, news@mashable.com. 
Having one person handle all those emails, which are often rife with junk, is an efﬁ cient 
way to handle large volumes of email, because only one person must take the time to sift 
through it. As long as that person is diligent about forwarding tips to those who might be 
able to act upon them, the system works well. 
 CrunchGear  did this differently. John created two email addresses, everyone@[domain].
com and tips@[domain].com, that both go to every writer on the site. When an outsider 
emails the tips email box, everyone in the group can read it. Even though it requires more 
time from each individual, the strength of this workﬂ ow is that everyone gets to decide 
whether each email tip contains a story that’s appropriate for publication, rather than 
one person deciding for all, and perhaps not thinking of an angle that others on the team 
might have considered. 
 In this  CrunchGear workﬂ ow, the “everyone” box is for internal communication, but 
you’d be best served by changing the word “everyone” to, for example, “everyoneWWR” 
if your website is WristWatchReview. John has also created editors@ and writers@ email 
addresses, so team members can send email blasts to speciﬁ c groups in the organization.

 Communicate! 
 To be a great communicator, you need to use more than one medium. Instant messaging 
is quick and easy, but sometimes nuance is lost amid all the typing—emoticons can go 
only so far to convey subtle meaning and emotion. If you ﬁ nd yourself typing long mis-
sives in IM or Campﬁ re, maybe it’s time to pick up the phone. This is especially true when 
there’s a conﬂ ict, or if a complicated situation arises that’s hard to explain in just a few 
words. We know that it might sound old-fashioned, but just pick up the phone. Have all 
of your cobloggers’ phone numbers on your favorites list, and talk every once in a while. 
 But don’t talk too much—especially in that culprit of timewasters that’s the bane of 
many a corporate existence: meetings. We suggest avoiding regular meetings, and getting 
together on a conference call, videoconference, or at a meeting table only when there’s 
a speciﬁ c and important reason for doing so. Hopefully you’ll build your organization in 
such a way that it’s not overpopulated with middle managers whose only job is to attend 
meetings. Within some of the corporate giants where we’ve blogged, meetings take on 
lives of their own, wasting a multitude of hours while accomplishing little. While there 
are differences of opinion about the necessity of meetings, and their importance changes 
with the size of an organization and the topics covered, we’ll leave this hot topic with 
three suggestions: 
 1. 
 When you get together for a meeting, set a timer for thirty minutes. Point to the timer 
when someone gets too long-winded. 
 2. 
 Have a stand-up meeting, where everyone remains standing until the meeting is over. 
 3. 
 Everyone must report to a meeting with a full bladder—no stopping off at the bath-
room beforehand. This tends to speed things up. 
 Joining a Blogging Team 
 How did we get our blogging jobs? We found out about them either through personal 
contacts or through a quick email to an editor. Many blogs post want ads right on their 
front page. When you see one, jump. If you ﬁ nd a job posting looking for a blogger and 
you want the job, reply immediately with two posts written in the style of the blog. One 
post should be on an item the blog has covered in the past, and the other should be on an 
entirely new topic. Also include a short blurb about yourself. That’s all. You can include 
a resume, but we wouldn’t. If you have a particularly impressive resume, though, put it 
online and add a link to it, or point to your LinkedIn proﬁ le. 
 Blogging bosses don’t want to hear about your ability to juggle on a unicycle or train 
wolves. Regardless of what your mom told you, you are not a special, unique ﬂ ower. You 
are a random voice howling out from the Internet. Make it worth the editor’s while to 
open and read your email. 
 Be Careful What You Wish For 
 If you’ve managed to sidestep the whole business of starting up a blog yourself, and have 
somehow landed in a bustling, ongoing blog that has ﬁ rmly established itself already, 
consider yourself lucky. It happens. For instance, Charlie got his start at  Gizmodo  by

contacting John and bitching about all the typos on the site, offering his services as a 
copy editor. To his surprise, John asked him to start the next day. This could happen to 
you—a prominent blogger is suddenly looking for writers, you happen to live in the right 
city or have the right qualiﬁ cations, and boom! You suddenly ﬁ nd yourself in the middle 
of a screaming team of swaggering A-list bloggers. What to do? 
 What got you there? It was probably a combination of your blogging prowess and 
networking capability. Maybe you have a lot of connections. You’re probably a kind, out-
going person, so it won’t be hard for you to blend in. Our advice is this: Work together. 
Help one another. Share. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The rules 
you learned in kindergarten (or in Sunday school, if that applies to you) are helpful here. 
If you see a mistake someone has made, ﬁ x it. Tactfully let that person know you’ve cor-
rected the error if it’s something you’ve noticed before. Or another approach: just ﬁ x it 
and don’t say anything if it’s a one-time mistake. Find out who normally covers certain 
stories, and tread lightly when pitching an idea on that topic. Familiarize yourself with 
the local blog politics—are there other blogs to which you’re never supposed to link? 
When we were at  Gizmodo , it was considered taboo to ever link to our blogging nemesis 
and ﬁ erce competitor,  Engadget . And our number one tip for getting along in a new blog: 
It’s simple—don’t be a jerk.

 Tips and Tricks of the Trade 
 Multitasking: When to Use It and When to Avoid It 
 It’s hard to avoid multitasking if, say, you’re waiting for an email reply, you’re instant 
messaging with a source, and you’re in the middle of a blog post. But if you’re writing 
a complicated piece, turn off the email notiﬁ er for a while, close that Facebook tab, and 
put your cell in the other room. Everyone’s different, but solid, constant concentration is 
often the way important things get done, well. 
 Seven Ways to Enhance Your Blogging Efficiency 
 More screen real estate:  Numerous studies say that if you have a bigger screen, and 
preferably two (or maybe even three), you’ll be more productive. That’s because you don’t 
need to keep switching between documents, clicking around just to peek at something. 
For instance, one smaller monitor could be dedicated to email, half of another could 
be the home of your instant messaging and Campﬁ re communications, and front-and-
center could be your word processing area, with a browser open next to it. Even if you’re 
using a laptop, determine what is the biggest screen its graphics card can accommodate, 
and plug that in. You’ll see an immediate result of enhanced efﬁ ciency. 
 Comfortable chair:  It’s been called the most important component in your computer/
ofﬁ ce setup, and in our experience it rings true. Buy yourself a good chair—you’ll be sit-
ting in it for so many hours that it’s a huge quality-of-life issue. Which chair would we 
recommend? There’s a good reason why the Herman Miller Aeron Chair was such a hit 
with the dot-com bunch—it’s so damn comfortable, hanging your carcass over its frame 
like a comfy hammock, and keeping you cool at the same time with its vented seating 
surfaces. With prices that were formerly upwards of $800, you can ﬁ nd them on sale for 
much less, in a variety of colors. 
 Silence:  Many bloggers are so accustomed to the cacophonous din that is their sound 
backdrop that this suggestion might not mean much to them. For the rest of us, silence 
is golden. No blogging in noisy, distracting coffee shops for us. Even listening to the noise 
of a cooling fan whining away inside that PC all day is tiring. And yes, the tiny fan inside 
your laptop can be an annoyance, too. There are PCs that are so quiet that they make vir-
tually no noise at all, and we recommend you take a look at one of those. We found one

that’s got the most powerful processor in the world inside, and it doesn’t make a peep. 
Really, it makes absolutely no sound whatsoever. It’s earned the name we gave it—look it 
up on our network, and you’ll see it’s aptly named “ChurchMouse.” 
 Kill the telephone:  This might sound revolutionary or even rude to you, but it is pos-
sible to kill your telephone, making it so that device is there solely for your convenience, 
and not for the convenience of anyone else. We’re all so connected now in so many 
ways—instant messaging, texting, voicemail, email, and so on—that there’s no excuse for 
letting someone interrupt you with a phone call. Equip your phone with voicemail, and 
silence it. If someone wants to contact you, and only a voice conversation will do, ask that 
person to make an appointment with you via email. Politely make it clear to all of your 
friends, associates, and acquaintances that you are no longer accepting phone calls. Ever. 
They’ll get used to it, and you’ll save a boatload of time and free yourself from distraction. 
 Work at home:  Ah, the camaraderie of the workplace! What a huge beneﬁ t it is, hav-
ing your colleagues nearby, always at the ready for you to consult, ask questions, work 
together, and support each other. But they’re also at the ready to distract you, make noise, 
take you out for long, work-free lunches, ask you “quick questions,” and call “quick” meet-
ings that end up taking an hour. Then there’s that game of what will you wear today, and 
what will everyone else wear? It’s becoming increasingly clear to us that in an industry 
such as blogging, the only reason corporate management wants people in an ofﬁ ce is so 
the bosses can lord over their minions and make themselves feel important and useful. 
Stay home in your pajamas, oh fellow member of the  pajamahadeen . You’ll save time, 
suffer through fewer distractions, and you will have to take a shower only once a week, 
whether you need it or not. We’re kidding about that last one. 
 Minimize spam:  We could write a whole book about dealing with email and spam, 
but here’s the solution to the spam problem if you haven’t ﬁ gured it out already: Gmail. 
Google has solved that dilemma with a hefty dose of crowdsourcing. Whenever one 
of Gmail’s tens of millions of users reports spam, everyone else ﬁ nds out about it. The 
result? The spam problem is over, gone, kaput. Now, if you’re using Gmail, it’s a rarity to 
receive spam. Stuck with a different email account that you can’t get rid of for whatever 
reason? In a few seconds, you can conﬁ gure Gmail to fetch that account’s email through 
your primary Gmail account, ﬁ ltering it for spam, too. 
 Automate everything:  Use TextExpander, QuicKeys, Keytext, or the macro utility of 
your choice to bang out boilerplate text with a couple of keystrokes. Create “droplets” in 
Photoshop to crop and edit photos to a designated size by using simple drag-and-drop 
moves. Use NaturallySpeaking to talk to your computer and have it do all the typing for 
you. Check out the free Google Voice, which can turn all of your voicemail into text, let-
ting you quickly read it in email. Find more ways to automate your life. Automate every-
thing you can, and save time while enhancing your efﬁ ciency. 
 How to Avoid Burnout: Helpful Hints to Bring 
Back Your Spirit and Enthusiasm 
 Sometimes a cruel comment from a reader or a dip in trafﬁ c can get you bummed. Know 
when it’s time to step away for a while, even if it’s for a few minutes. Once I was stuck in 
a dead-end job with an annoying/controlling boss, and my coping strategy involved walk-
ing around for ﬁ ve minutes every time I felt myself reaching my personal boiling point.

Of course, that worked for only about six months, and I eventually had to separate myself 
from that situation. 
 If you’re dealing with a constant soul-sucking experience, it’ll probably cheer you up 
to start working on that resume. Know when to quit. Sometimes, quitting can be the best 
career move you ever made. I can think of three instances in my career where quitting at 
just the perfect time turned into the luckiest moves of my life. 
 Health Tips for Bloggers 
 Read the disclaimer on the back of your keyboard! Yeah, it’s there for wussy legal reasons, 
but there’s a lot of truth there. I get up and walk around at least once per hour. Drink cof-
fee if you like it, or tea, and don’t believe all the nonsense the fear-mongering medical 
press spouts about how coffee does this or that to you. 
 Exercise 
 In the most stressful job I ever had, you know how I made it through every day? I walked 
4 miles a day, right in the middle of the day. It took an hour, but it was the most valu-
able activity I did all day. I even went walking in below-zero (Fahrenheit) temperatures 
(properly equipped, mind you!). Blogging is a sedentary activity, so you’ll need to move 
around regularly unless you want to end up like those earth-orbiting invalids in the 
movie  Wall·E .  
 Diet 
 Yeah, I know. Cheetos and Mountain Dew, right? Oh wait, Red Bull. If you’re going to eat 
like that, at least take a multivitamin every day. Contrary to common mythology, pizza is 
actually a fairly nutritious food. But no, ketchup is not a vegetable. 
 Sleep 
 Everyone is different, but you won’t be able to stay up all night like you did in college for 
the rest of your life. I’ve noticed I get noticeably grouchy and spacy when I haven’t gotten 
enough sleep, so I make it a point to get at least seven hours every night. One suggestion: 
try not to do anything too exciting right before bed. Another: sleeping pills are a short-
term solution. Another: go to bed at the same time every night.

 9.  Context in every post 
 10.  Be a watchdog, not a lapdog 
 Readers like to click a star rating system. But be careful—if you start off your blog with 
a star rating system at ﬁ rst, it’ll display how only a few people are reading. Best to wait 
until trafﬁ c starts to build before you display any hints about your trafﬁ c numbers. 
 Trade show tip:  Don’t make too many appointments. Most PR people will try to rope 
you into meeting with their clients at trade shows, but all that does is lock you up for an 
hour (or more) when you could be covering breaking news that hasn’t been announced 
yet. When you get a meeting request, ask what will be announced, offering to keep that 
conﬁ dential. If there’s nothing newsworthy, politely refuse the meeting. Schedule meet-
ings with your most important sources, but leave yourself plenty of free time to pursue 
those stories that inevitably pop up at trade shows. 
 Keep neat notes:  When I started my blogs, I didn’t keep notes. So far, it’s not a prob-
lem because it’s all fresh in my mind . . . but in six months when, for instance, I want to 
change my four 125×125 ads to a single 300×250 ad, I may be kicking myself for not leav-
ing myself notes. Granted, the steps are on Pollock’s WP-Magazine Theme instructions, 
but sometimes even rediscovering the answers can be time-consuming. If I were to start 
a website again, I’d write everything down.
