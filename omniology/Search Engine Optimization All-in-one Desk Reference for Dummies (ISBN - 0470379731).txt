Foreword
I
n the search marketing industry, Bruce Clay is a legend. Those who sailed 
the largely uncharted waters of the Great Search Engine Ocean back in 
2000 remember fondly his fi rst Search Engine Relationship Chart. It plotted 
out the relationships between more than 20 different search engines, explain-
ing which search engines generated their original own results versus those 
that simply white-labeled results they got from others — the “powered by” 
search engines, as they used to be called. In such a confusing space, Bruce 
endeavored to bring order, guidance, and education.
But Bruce has been more than a chart-maker, of course. As early search mar-
keters struggled to understand which practices were acceptable to search 
engines and which weren’t, Bruce was among the few leading the calls for 
standardized best practices and a code of conduct. From the early years, 
he’s also been a leading educator for others coming into the space. Whether 
writing about search marketing, participating in forums, or speaking in con-
ferences, Bruce has been a consistent font of wisdom. He has freely shared 
knowledge and helped hundreds, if not thousands, of people successfully tap 
into the power of search marketing.
Finally, we get Bruce’s wisdom distilled into book form. And it’s no surprise 
that he’s plotted out a comprehensive guide to the still-vast Great Search 
Engine Ocean that exists out there. There might be fewer players these days, 
but that doesn’t mean search marketing has gotten simpler. If anything, it has 
become more complex. Rather than the world of the 1990s, where there was 
one type of search results — unpaid results that listed Web pages — today’s 
search engine world encompasses paid results, local results, video results, 
“blended” or “universal” search pages, and more. There are social sites that 
serve to build links. An entire economy revolves around the buying and sell-
ing of links, along with penalties that can hit those who do. We also have 
more ways to analyze the traffi c we receive, as well as ways to test different 
types of pages that people “land” upon to convert.
Don’t be scared. Although the world is more complex, it’s a complexity that 
can be mastered — and to great gain. Search engines remain one of the top 
ways Web sites gain traffi c. Moreover, they drive visitors who are poised to 
convert. Millions turn to them asking questions each day. The smart mar-
keter who understands search engines positions her content to answer those 
questions. It’s a perfect match-up.
In the spirit of his original relationship charts, Bruce has once again plotted 
out a path for others to follow. So read on, and I wish you the best in your 
search marketing success.

Introduction
S
ince the late 1990s, Internet marketing has taken off as a dynamic 
marketing channel because of its accuracy and ease of tracking. The 
Internet has come a long way in a short time: As it grew, finding the sites 
you were looking for with a directory became impossible. Search engines 
appeared as the way forward, offering a way to have the Web come to you. 
Savvy marketers began to realize that search engine results pages were 
the place to be for any business that wanted to take advantage of the Web. 
Search engine optimization grew out of the need to develop pages in a way 
that tells search engines that your site is the best for a particular topic.
Search engine optimization is not a difficult discipline, but it’s a complex 
one with many different parts that need to be tweaked and adjusted to work 
in harmony. It’s not a game of chasing search engine algorithms. Instead, the 
goal of search engine optimization is simply to present your pages as the 
most relevant for a given search query. Resist the urge to assume that one 
part is more important than another. All the various aspects of SEO need to 
work together in order to succeed.
About This Book
Throughout the book, we reference tools and other experts in the field. 
Search engine marketing (SEM), as an industry, is very active and excels at 
knowledge sharing. Although we cover the basics here, we strongly urge 
you to take advantage of the community that has developed since search 
engine marketing began. Truly, without the SEM community, this book could 
not have been written.
We hope that you keep this book at hand, picking it up when you need to 
check for answers. For that reason, we attempt to make each minibook 
stand on its own. If something is outside the scope of a particular minibook, 
we refer you to the correct chapter or minibook for more information.
Search engine optimization has grown and changed over the years, along 
with the search engines themselves, and it will continue to grow for years to 
come. Although we call this an “All in One” guide, we have to stress that it is 
a guide built of the moment with an eye on the future.

Foolish Assumptions
Foolish Assumptions
We wrote this book for a particular sort of person. We assume that you, 
the one holding this book, are a small business owner who is pretty new to 
Internet marketing. You might have a Web site or you might just be think-
ing about getting into this online thing, but either way, we presume that you 
have already figured out how to turn on your computer and connect to the 
Internet.
A second assumption is that you’re either somewhat familiar with the tech-
nologies that power Web sites or that you have access to someone who 
is. HTML, JavaScript, Flash, and other technologies are broad topics on 
their own. We don’t expect you to know everything there is to know about 
JavaScript programming or Flash, but we don’t spend time teaching you 
them. If you aren’t familiar with how to program in these technologies, we 
recommend that you find a super-smart programmer and treat her like she’s 
made of gold. For a primer, you may also wish to seek out the other For 
Dummies (Wiley) titles devoted to these topics.
How This Book Is Organized
Like most books in the For Dummies series, Search Engine Optimization All-
in-One For Dummies is structured as a reference that you can turn to again 
and again. You should be able to go to the Table of Contents or the Index 
and jump straight to the topic you’re interested in. Of course, if you’re com-
pletely new to search engine optimization and Internet marketing, you can 
read the book from cover to cover. In the next several sections, we outline 
what each minibook is all about.
Book I: How Search Engines Work
The first book is pretty much exactly what its title says it is. It focuses on 
how search engines developed and how they work, and introduces the 
basics of search engine optimization. For a little spice, we also throw in a 
brief introduction to spam and set out some ethical guidelines that we follow 
when working on our clients’ sites.
Book II: Keyword Strategy
This chapter focuses on how to research which keywords are going to bring 
the most valuable traffic to your site. It gives you the tools and tactics to 
build a keyword list and themes. These keywords serve as the basis for 
almost every other element in search engine optimization.

How This Book Is Organized
Book III: Competitive Positioning
Chances are there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Web pages 
that are relevant to the keywords that you want. The top ten sites for those 
keywords are your competitors, and you have a lot to learn from them. This 
book focuses on how to identify and analyze competitors in order to use 
their successes to make your own site soar.
Book IV: SEO Web Design
You’re not going to get very far in search engine marketing without a Web 
site. It’s simply a must. The most successful search engine optimization cam-
paigns begin before a single Web page is uploaded to your server. This book 
starts with a very high-level analysis of a search engine–friendly site struc-
ture and then goes a level down in specificity with each subsequent chapter 
to help you build the very best site you can.
Book V: Creating Content
Search engines can’t rank your site for something that it doesn’t have related 
content for. Content is one of the cornerstones of ranking, but it’s also the 
least understood element. This book focuses on developing content ideas, 
identifying different kinds of content, and explains the best ways to implement 
various types of engagement objects to enhance your site for your users.
Book VI: Linking
The humble hypertext link forms another of the cornerstones in SEO. 
Whether you’re linking to yourself (internal linking), others are linking to 
you (inbound links), or you’re linking to other sites (outbound links), this 
book covers them all and explains why each is vital and important. In addi-
tion, we give you firm guidelines to help you in your link building efforts.
Book VII: Optimizing the Foundations
The environment that your Web site lives in is critical to your SEO success. 
A slow server, badly written robots text file, or mishandled redirect can tank 
your rankings. In order to give your site the best place to live, check out this 
minibook.
Book VIII: Analyzing Results
You can’t know for sure if your SEO campaign is really working until you 
track the results. Web analytics packages are a must for any online business. 
This chapter covers basic methodology, implementation of one of the most 
common analytics tools, Google Analytics, and how to apply the findings to 
improve your business.

Icons Used in This Book
Book IX: International SEO
Most companies never look beyond the borders of their home country, 
but some companies like to dream big. For those businesses, we take a trip 
around the world and give some pointers on how to get started overseas. 
From Europe, to Asia, to Latin and South America, this book introduces the 
online culture of several nations and takes a look at the cultural and legal 
concerns that await an international business.
Book X: Search Marketing
There’s more to search engine marketing than just search engine optimiza-
tion, and each of the chapters in this minibook could be a book in them-
selves. This minibook is simply intended to be a very basic introduction 
to this subject and how search marketing can work together with SEO to 
deliver stellar results. Hopefully, it whets your appetite for more.
Icons Used in This Book
 
This icon calls out suggestions that help you work more effectively and 
save time.
 
You should try to keep items marked with this icon in mind while doing your 
Web site optimization. Sometimes it’s a random tidbit of information, but 
more often than not, it’s something that you’ll run into repeatedly and is 
therefore worth remembering.
 
SEO can get pretty technical pretty fast. If you’re not familiar with the termi-
nology, it can start to sound like gibberish. We marked the sections where 
we get extra-nerdy with this icon so that you can be prepared. If these sec-
tions go over your head, don’t worry: You can move on without understand-
ing every nuance.
 
We were sparing with this icon. If you see a Warning, take extra care. This icon 
denotes the times when getting something wrong can nuke your site, tank 
your rankings, and just generally devastate your online marketing campaign.
Conventions Used in This Book
When we talk about doing searches, which we do a lot, we need a way to dif-
ferentiate them from the rest of the text. Enclosing search terms in quotation 
marks doesn’t work because quotation marks have a special meaning when 

5
Where to Go from Here
you type them into a search engine, so throughout the book, you see search 
queries surrounded by square brackets, like this: [search query]. All the text 
inside the brackets is what you type into the search engine.
In most cases, we refer to the authority passed by links as link equity; how-
ever, in your travels through the wide world of Internet marketing, you’re 
bound to come across several other terms like link popularity, link juice, and 
PageRank. (The latter is a Google proprietary term and using it generically 
for all search engines is sort of like calling all facial tissue Kleenex.) They all 
mean the same thing; we picked link equity for clarity’s sake.
Where to Go from Here
The best thing about this book is that you can go anywhere from here. 
Although we’ve written it like a regular instruction manual that can be read 
from beginning to end, we also want you to be able to use it as a reference or 
a go-to guide for tricky problems. So start anywhere you want. Jump into link 
building or take a crack at creating great content.
Our recommendation, if you’re brand new to SEO, is to start at the begin-
ning. After that, it’s up to you. Good luck and have fun. Just because this is 
serious business doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the rollercoaster ride.

T
he Internet offers a world of information, both good and bad. Almost 
anything a person could want is merely a few taps on the keyboard and 
a couple clicks of a mouse away. A good rule of thumb for the Internet is if 
you want to know about something or purchase something, there’s prob-
ably already a Web site just for that. The catch is actually finding it. This is 
what brings you to this book. You have a Web site. You have hired what you 
hope is a crack team of designers and have unleashed your slick, shiny new 
site upon the Web, ready to start making money. However, there is a bit of 
a problem: Nobody knows that your site exists. How will people find your 
Web site?
The most common way that new visitors will find your site is through a 
search engine. A search engine is a Web application designed to hunt for 
specific keywords and group them according to relevance. It used to be, 
in the stone age of the 1990s, that most Web sites were found via directo-
ries or word-of-mouth. Somebody linked to your Web site from their Web 
site, or maybe somebody posted about it on one of their newsgroups, and 
people found their way to you. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and 
Microsoft Live were created to cut out the middleman and bring your user 
to you with little hassle and fuss.
In this chapter, we show you how to find your audience by giving you the 
tools to differentiate between types of users, teaching you to sort out 
search engines, identifying the necessary elements for being prominent in 
those engines, and giving you an insider look at how all the search engines 
work together.

Identifying Search Engine Users
Identifying Search Engine Users
Who is using search engines? Well, everyone. A significant amount of all Web 
traffic to Web sites comes from search engines. Unless you are a household 
name like eBay or Amazon, chances are people won’t know where you are 
unless they turn to a search engine and hunt you down. In fact, even the big 
brands get most of their traffic from search engines. Search engines are the 
biggest driver of traffic on the Web and their influence only continues to 
grow.
But although search engines drive traffic to Web sites, you have to remem-
ber that your Web site is only one of several and a half trillion other Web 
sites out there. Chances are, if someone does a search, even for a product 
that you sell, your Web site won’t automatically pop up in the first page of 
results. If you’re lucky and the query is targeted enough, you might end up 
somewhere in the top 100 of the millions of results returned. That might be 
okay if you’re only trying to share your vacation photos with your family, 
but if you need to sell a product, you need to appear higher in the results. In 
most cases, you want the number one spot on the first page because that’s 
the site everyone looks at and that most people click.
In this section, you find out a bit more about the audience available to you 
and how to narrow down how to reach them.
Figuring out how much people spend
The fact of the matter is that people spend money on the Internet. It’s fright-
fully easy: All you need is a credit card, a computer with an Internet connec-
tion, and something that you’ve been thinking about buying. E-commerce 
in the United States reached $34.7 billion in the third quarter of 2007 alone. 
Some project that e-commerce could reach $1 trillion a year by 2012. 
Combine that with the fact that most Americans spend an average of 24 
minutes a day shopping online, not including the time they spend actually 
getting to the Web site (19 minutes), and you’re looking at a viable means of 
moving your product. To put it simply, “There’s gold in them thar hills!”
So, now you need to get people to your Web site. In real estate, the most 
important thing is location, location, location, and the same is true of the 
Internet. On the Web, however, instead of having a prime piece of property, 
you need a high listing on the search engine results page (SERP). Your place-
ment in these results is referred to as your ranking. You have a few options 
when it comes to achieving that. One, you can make your page the best it 
can be and hope that people will find you, or two, you can pay for one of the 
few advertising slots. More than $12 billion was spent in 2007 on the North 
American search marketing industry alone. Eighty-eight percent of that was 
spent on pay per click (PPC) advertising, in which you pay to have search

engines display your ad. The other 12 percent goes to search engine optimi-
zation (SEO). SEO, when properly done, helps you to design your Web site 
in such a way that when a user is doing a search, your pages appear on the 
first page of returned results, hopefully in the top spot. Your main focus in 
this book is finding out about SEO, but because they overlap somewhat, you 
pick up a bit of PPC knowledge here and there along the way.
Knowing your demographics
In order to get the most bang for your SEO buck, you need to know the 
demographics for your Web visitors. You need to know who’s looking for 
you, because you’ll need to know where best to advertise. For example, if 
you’re selling dog sweaters, it’s probably not a great idea to advertise in 
biker bars. Sure, there might be a few Billy Bob Skullcrushers with a cute 
little Chihuahua in need of a cashmere shrug, but statistically, your ad would 
probably do much better in a beauty salon. The same goes for your Web 
site in a search engine. Gender, age, and income are just a few of the met-
rics that you’ll want to track in terms of identifying your audience. Search 
engine users are pretty evenly split between male and female search engine 
users, with a few slight differences: 50.2 percent of Yahoo! users are female, 
whereas 53.6 percent of Google users are male. In terms of age brackets, the 
older set leans more towards using Ask.com, and the younger users wind up 
on Yahoo! and MSN.com most often. In fact, Ask.com is changing their focus 
in order to cater specifically to married women. Google reaps the highest 
number of users with an income of $100,000 a year or more. Search engines 
even feed their results into other search engines, as you can in see our 
handy-dandy Search Engine Relationship Chart later in this chapter.

Identifying Search Engine Users
You need to know who your search engine visitors are because this demo-
graphic data helps you effectively target your market. This demographic 
distribution is often associated with search query keywords, the words that 
search engine visitors use to search for your products. For an in-depth look 
at choosing keywords, you can check out Book II, Chapter 2, but a brief sum-
mary is that keywords are what a search engine looks for when figuring out 
what sites to show in the SERP. Basically your keywords are the words you 
used in your search query — or what you typed into the little search window. 
If you are searching for something like information on customizing classic 
cars, for example, you would type [custom classic cars] into the search field. 
(When we discuss search queries through the book, we use square brack-
ets to show the keywords. You wouldn’t actually type the brackets into the 
search field.) Figure 1-1 displays a typical search engine results page for the 
query [custom classic cars].
 
Figure 1-1: 
Keywords 
in a search 
engine 
window: 
[custom 
classic 
cars].
 
The search engine goes to work combing its index for Web pages containing 
these specific keywords and returns to you with your results. That way, if 
you have a product that’s geared towards a certain age bracket, or towards 
women more than men, you can tailor your keywords accordingly. It may 
seem inconsequential, but trust me, this is important if you want to be 
ranked well for targeted searches.

Figuring Out Why People Use Search Engines
Figuring Out Why People Use Search Engines
We’ve already established that a lot of people use search engines. But what 
are people looking for when they use them? Are they doing research for 
restoring their classic car? Do people use them to look for a place that sells 
parts for classic cars? Or are they just looking to kill time with video that 
shows custom cars racing? The answer is yes to all of the above. A search 
engine is there to scour the billions on billions of Web sites out there in 
order to get you where you need to go, whether it’s doing research, going 
shopping, or just plain wasting time.
Research
 
Most people who are using a search engine are doing it for research pur-
poses. They are generally looking for answers or at least to data with which 
to make a decision. They’re looking to find a site to fulfill a specific purpose. 
Someone doing a term paper on classic cars for their Automotive History 
101 class would use it to find statistics on the number of cars sold in the 
United States, instructions for restoring and customizing old cars, and possi-
bly communities of classic car fanatics out there. Companies would use it in 
order to find where their clients are, and who their competition is.
Search engines are naturally drawn to research-oriented sites and usually 
consider them more relevant than shopping-oriented sites, which is why, a 
lot of the time, the highest listing for the average query is a Wikipedia page. 
Wikipedia is an open-source online reference site that has a lot of search-
able information, tightly cross-linked with millions of back links. Open source 
means that anyone can have access to the text and edit it. Wikipedia is 
practically guaranteed to have a high listing on the strength of its site archi-
tecture alone. (We go over site architecture in much more depth later on in 
Book IV.) Wikipedia is an open-source project, thus information should be 
taken with a grain of salt as there is no guarantee of accuracy. This brings 
us to an important lesson of search engines — they base “authority” on 
perceived expertise. Accuracy of information is not one of their criteria: 
Notability is.
 
In order to take advantage of research queries, you need to gear your site 
content toward things that would be of interest to a researcher. “How to” 
articles, product comparisons, reviews, and free information are all things 
that attract researchers to your site.
Shopping
A smaller percentage of people, but still very many, use a search engine in 
order to shop. After the research cycle is over, search queries change to 
terms that reflect a buying mindset. Terms like “best price” and “free ship-
ping” signal a searcher in need of a point of purchase. Optimizing a page to 

14
Figuring Out Why People Use Search Engines
meet the needs of that type of visitor results in higher conversions (actions 
taken by a user that meet a sales or business goal) for your site. As we 
mentioned, global search engines such as Google tend to reward research 
oriented sites, so your pages have to strike a balance between sales-oriented 
terms and research-oriented terms.
This is where specialized engines come into the picture. Although you can 
use a regular search engine to find what it is you’re shopping for, some 
people find it more efficient to use a search engine geared directly towards 
buying products. Some Web sites out there are actually search engines just 
for shopping. Amazon, eBay, and Shopping.com are all examples of shop-
ping-only engines. The mainstream engines have their own shopping prod-
ucts such as Google Product Search (formerly called Froogle) and Yahoo! 
Shopping, where you type in the search term for the particular item you 
are looking for and the engines return the actual item listed in the results 
instead of the Web site where the item is sold. For example, say you’re 
buying a book on Amazon.com. You type the title into the search bar, and 
it returns a page of results. Now, you also have the option of either buying 
it directly from Amazon, or, if you’re on a budget, you can click over to the 
used book section. Booksellers provide Amazon.com with a list of their used 
stock and Amazon handles all of the purchasing, shipping, and ordering info. 
The same is true of Yahoo! Shopping and Google Product Search. And like all 
things with the Internet, odds are that somebody, somewhere, has exactly 
what you’re looking for. Figure 1-2 displays a results page from Google 
Product Search.
Entertainment
Research and shopping aren’t the only reasons to visit a search engine. The 
Internet is a vast, addictive, reliable resource for consuming your entire 
afternoon, and there are users out there who use the search engines as a 
means of entertaining themselves. They look up things like videos, movie 
trailers, games, and social networking sites. Technically, it’s also research, 
but it’s research used strictly for entertainment purposes. A child of the 
80s might want to download an old-school version of the Oregon Trail video 
game onto her computer so she can recall the heady days of third grade. It’s 
a quest made easy with a quick search on Google. Or if you want to find out 
what those wacky young Hollywood starlets are up to, you can to turn to a 
search engine to bring you what you need.

If you’re looking for a video, odds are it’s going to be something from 
YouTube, much like your research results are going to come up with a 
Wikipedia page. YouTube is another excellent example that achieves a high 
listing on results pages. They’re an immensely popular video-sharing Web 
site where anyone with a camera and a working e-mail address can upload 
videos of themselves doing just about anything from talking about their 
day to shaving their cats. But the videos themselves have keyword-rich 
listings in order to be easily located, plus they have an option that also dis-
plays other videos. Many major companies have jumped on the YouTube 
bandwagon, creating channels for their companies (a YouTube channel is 
a specific account). Record companies use channels to promote bands, 
and production companies use them to unleash the official trailer for their 
upcoming movie.

Discovering the Necessary Elements for Getting High Keyword Rankings
Discovering the Necessary Elements for 
Getting High Keyword Rankings
If the mantra of real estate is location, location, location, and the very best 
location on the Web is on the search engines, the mantra of SEO should be 
keywords, keywords, keywords. Search engines use a process to categorize 
and grade keywords in order to bring you the Web pages you’re looking for. 
The more relevant your keywords are to the user’s query, the higher rank-
ing your page has in a search engine’s results. Keeping the keywords clear, 
precise, and simple helps the search engines do their job a whole lot faster. 
If you’re selling something like customized classic cars, you should probably 
make sure your text includes keywords like classic cars, customized cars, 
customized classic Mustangs, and so forth, as well as clarifying words like 
antique, vintage, and restored. You can read more about how to choose your 
keywords in Book II.
In this section, you get a broad, brief overview on how you get a higher rank 
than the other guy who’s selling macadamia nut butter. You need to know 
the basics, or you can’t do targeted SEO.
The advantage of an SEO-compliant site
Having an SEO-compliant Web site entails tailoring your Web site to have the 
highest SERP ranking for a keyword search. This includes optimizing your 
metadata and Title tag (for more on metadata, refer to Book IV, Chapter 
3) so they are chock full (but not too full) of relevant keywords for your 
industry. Also, make sure that your Web page contains searchable text as 
opposed to lots of pretty Flash animations and images (search engines have 
limited ability to understand non-text content), that all of your images con-
tain an Alt attribute (an alternative description of an image) with text that 
describes the content of the image, and that you have keywords embedded 
in your hyperlinks. You also need to be sure that all of your internal content 
as well as your links are siloed. You want to be sure to optimize every single 
one of these elements. Use this checklist to get yourself organized:
 
✦ Title tag
 
✦ Meta description tag
 
✦ Meta keywords tag
 
✦ Heading tag(s)
 
✦ Textual content
 
✦ Alt attributes on all images
 
✦ Strong/bold tags

✦ Privacy statement
 
✦ Contact information
 
✦ Dedicated IP address
Defining a clear subject theme
Another way of getting a high keyword ranking is having a clear subject 
theme. If you’re selling kits to customize classic cars, keeping your Web site 
streamlined and keeping all topics on the Web site relating exactly to clas-
sic car customization not only makes it easier for users to navigate your site 
and research or purchase what they need, but it also increases your chances 
of having a high page rank when those search engine spiders come by. The 
more similarly themed keywords you have on your pages, the better. It’s the 
nature of a search engine to break up a site into subjects that add up to an 
overall theme for easy categorization, and the more obvious your site theme 
is, the higher your results will be.
It’s kind of like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet and deciding you want to 
get a salad. You, the search engine, immediately go to the salad corner of 
the buffet because it’s been clearly labeled, and from there, you can do your 
breakdowns. You want romaine lettuce, croutons, parmesan cheese, and 
Caesar dressing, so you go to where they keep the lettuce, the trimmings, 
and the dressings in the salad bar section. It’s easy to find what you want if 
everything is grouped accordingly. But if the restaurant stuck the dressing 
over with the mashed potatoes, you’ll have trouble finding it because salad 
dressing and mashed potatoes don’t normally go together. Similarly, when 
you keep your Web site content organized with everything in its proper 
place, the search engine views your content with clarity, understanding what 
you’re about — which in turn increases your page ranking. Siloing is a way 
of structuring your site and links in order to present a clear subject theme to 
the search engines. For more on this technique, refer to Book II, Chapter 4 as 
well as the entirety of Book VI.

18
Understanding the Search Engines: They’re a Community
Focusing on consistency
Methodical consistent implementation is the principle that, when you update 
your Web site, you should do it the same way every time. Your site should 
have a consistent look and feel over time without massive reorganizations at 
every update. In order for a search engine to maintain efficiency, you need 
to keep related content all placed in the same area. You also need to keep all 
of your updating processes consistent. That way, if something goes wrong 
during your next update, you can pinpoint what went wrong where without 
too much hassle since you update things the same way every time. It is 
confusing to customers to have things constantly changing around. Search 
engines and visitors to your Web site face the same challenge as a restau-
rant patron. Getting back to our salad bar analogy, the restaurant owner 
shouldn’t scatter the salad dressings according to the whims of his salad bar 
designer, and randomly change things every time he gets in a new dressing 
or someone discontinues one of the old dressings.
Building for the long term
You need to consider your persistence for the long term. How long will your 
Web site be sticking around? Ideally, like with any business, you want to 
build it to last without letting it fall behind and look dated. Relevancy to the 
current market is a big part of this, and if you are behind the times, you are 
probably behind your competitors. The technology that you use to build 
your Web site is inevitably going to change as the Internet advances, but 
your approach to relevancy should remain the same, incorporating new 
technologies as they arise. This is also a process you should develop over 
time. In the early days of the Web, frames were used to build sites, but that 
looks very outdated now. A few years ago, splash pages (introductory pages, 
mostly built in Flash, that provided no content or value to the user) were 
very popular. Today, they are discouraged. The Internet is an ever-changing 
entity, and if you’re not persistent about keeping up with the times, you 
might fall by the wayside.
Understanding the Search Engines: 
They’re a Community
Although dozens of search engines dot the Internet landscape, you’ll be 
happy to hear there are really only a few you’ll need to consider in your SEO 
planning. Each search engine appears to be a unique company with its own 
unique service. When people choose to run a search using Google, Yahoo!, 
Microsoft Live Search, Ask.com, or any of the others, they might think 
they’ve made a choice between competing services and expect to get 
varying results. But they’d be surprised to find out that under the surface, 
these seeming competitors are actually working together — at least on the 
data level.

Understanding the Search Engines: They’re a Community
Google’s stated purpose is to “organize the world’s information.” When you 
think about the trillions of Web pages and multiple trillion words that exist, 
multiplying and morphing every day, it’s hard to imagine a more ambitious 
undertaking. It makes sense, then, that not every search engine attempts 
such a daunting task themselves. Instead, the different search engines share 
the wealth when it comes to indexed data, much like a community.
You can see at a glance how this community works. Figure 1-3 shows how 
the major players in the search-engine field interact.

This search engine relationship chart includes all the major players. The

and provide search results data themselves. All of the non-outlined search

engines on the chart, including AltaVista, AOL, and the like, receive their 
search results data from some other source. The chart makes it clear that 
when you do a search on Netscape, for instance, the order of the results is 
determined by Netscape, but the indexed results are supplied by Google. 
 
Bruce Clay’s Search Engine Relationship Chart is also available online in an 
interactive Flash applet at
http://www.bruceclay.com/serc/
As the arrows depict, most of the search engines receive their data from 
one of these four sources. To further reduce the field, you can tell from the 
number of arrows coming from Google and Yahoo! that they feed the vast 
majority of other search sites. So in the world of SEO, you can feel pretty 
comfortable that if you’re indexed in just two sites, Google and Yahoo!, you 
have a chance at ranking in most other search engines.
Looking at search results: Apples and oranges
One more thing to know about search results — there are two types. Figure 
1-4 points out that a search engine can show these two different types of 
results simultaneously:
 
✦ Organic search results are the Web page listings that most closely 
match the user’s search query based on relevance. Also called 
“natural” search results, ranking high in the organic results is what SEO 
is all about.
 
✦ Paid results are basically advertisements — the Web site owners have 
paid to have their Web pages display for certain keywords, so these 
listings show up when someone runs a search query containing those 
keywords. (For more on the whys and hows of paid results in greater 
detail, you can read about pay per click, in Chapter 5.)
Bruce Clay first published his Search Engine 
Relationship Chart in 2000. Back then, there 
were more major players in the search game 
and things were, to say the least, somewhat 
cluttered. The chart had 26 companies on it: 
everyone from Yahoo! to Magellan to that 
upstart Google. Fifteen of those companies took 
their primary results from their own indexes; 
five of those supplied secondary results to 
other engines. Without a roadmap, it was an 
impossible task to keep it all straight. But over 
the years, things changed. What was once 
a cluttered mess is now a tidy interplay of a 
select group of companies. Here is an example 
of what the very first search engine relation-
ship chart looked like:

Understanding the Search Engines: They’re a Community
On a search results page, you can tell paid results from primary ones 
because search engines set apart the paid listings, putting them above or to 
the right of the primary results, or giving them a shaded background, border 
lines, or other visual clues. Figure 1-4 shows the difference between paid 
listings and organic results.

The typical Web user might not realize they’re looking at apples and oranges 
when they get their search results. Knowing the difference enables a 
searcher to make a better informed decision about the relevancy of a result. 
Additionally, because the paid results are advertising, they may actually be 
more useful to a shopping searcher than a researcher (remembering that 
search engines favor research results).
How do they get all of that data?
Okay, so how do they do it? How do Google, Yahoo!, Ask.com, and Microsoft 
Live Search keep track of everything and pop up results so fast? Behold the 
wonder of technology!
Gathering the data is the first step. An automated process (known as spidering) 
constantly crawls the Internet, gathering Web-page data into servers. Google 
calls their spider the Googlebot; you could refer to them as spiders, robots, 
bots, or crawlers, but they’re all the same thing. Whatever you call the pro-
cess, it pulls in masses of raw data and does so continuously. This is why 
changes to your Web site might be seen within a day, or may take up to a 
few weeks to be reflected in search engine results.

Chapter 1
Putting Search 
Engines in Context

Understanding the Search Engines: They’re a Community
In the second step, search engines have to index the data to make it usable. 
Indexing is the process of taking the raw data and categorizing it, removing 
duplicate information, and generally organizing it all into an accessible 
structure (think filing cabinet versus paper pile).
For each query performed by a user, the search engines apply an algorithm — 
basically a math equation (formula) that weighs various criteria and generates 
a result — to decide which listings to display and in what order. The algorithms 
might be fairly simple or multi-layered and complex.
At industry conferences, Google representatives have said that their 
algorithm analyzes more than 200 variables to determine search ranking to 
a given query. You’re probably thinking, “What are their variables?” Google 
won’t say exactly, and that’s what makes SEO a challenge. But we can make 
educated guesses. (Same for Yahoo! and the others.)
So can you design a Web site that gets the attention of all the search 
engines, no matter which algorithm they use? The answer is yes, to an 
extent, but it’s a bit of an art. This is the nuts and bolts of SEO, and what we 
attempt to explain in this book.

Book I: How Search Engines Work

Chapter 2: Meeting the 
Search Engines
In This Chapter
✓ Finding common threads among the engines
✓ Meeting the major and minor search engines
✓ Finding your niche in the vertical engines
✓ Understanding metasearch engines
A
ll search engines try to make their results the most relevant. They 
want to make you happy, because when you get what you want, you’re 
more likely to use their site again. The more you use them, the more money 
they make. It’s a win/win situation. So when you do your search on classic 
car customization and find what you’re looking for right away instead of 
having to click through ten different pages, you’ll probably come back and 
use the same search engine again.
In this chapter, you meet the major search engines and discover their 
similarities and differences, find out what makes a directory work, get 
familiar with the difference between organic and paid results, and how the 
search engines get their organic results. Plus, you find out about the search 
engine’s paid search programs and decide if metasearch engines are impor-
tant to your SEO campaign.
Finding the Common Threads among the Engines
To keep their results relevant, all search engines need to understand the 
main subject of a Web site. You can help the search engines find your Web 
site by keeping in mind the three major factors they’re looking for:
 
✦ Content: Content is the meat and bones of your Web site. It’s all the 
information your Web site contains, not just the words but also the 
Engagement Objects (the images, videos, audio, interactive technolo-
gies, and so on that make up the visual space). Your page’s relevancy 
increases based upon your perceived expertise. And expertise is based 
on useful, keyword-containing content. The spiders, the robots the 
search engine uses to read you Web site, also measure whether you 
have enough content that suggests you know what it is you’re talking 
about. A Web site with ten pages of content is going to rank worse than 
a Web site with ten thousand pages of content.

26
Getting to Know the Major Engines
 
✦ Popularity: The Internet is a little like high school in that you are popu-
lar as long as a lot of people know you exist and are talking about you. 
Search engine spiders are looking for how many people are linking to 
your Web site, along with the number of outgoing links you have on your 
own site. Google really loves this factor.
 
✦ Architecture: If you walk into a grocery store and find everything 
stacked haphazardly on the shelves, it’s going to be harder to find 
things, and you might just give up and go to another store that’s better 
organized. Spiders do the same thing. As we mentioned earlier, search 
engines love Wikipedia because of how it’s built. It’s full of searchable 
text, Alt attribute text, and keyword-containing hyperlinks that support 
terms used on the page.
You also have some control over two variables that search engines are look-
ing at when they set the spiders on you. One is your site’s response time, 
which is how fast your server is and how long it takes for them to load a page. 
If you’re on a server that loads one page per second, the bots request pages 
at a very slow rate. A second seems fast to us, but it’s an eternity for a bot 
that wants five to seven pages per second. If the server can’t handle one page 
per second, imagine how long it would take the bots to go through 10,000 
pages. In order not to crash the server, spiders request fewer pages; this puts 
a slow site at a disadvantage of sites with faster load times. Chances are, bots 
will index sites on a fast server more frequently and thoroughly.
The second variable is somewhat contested. Some SEOs believe that your 
rank could be affected by something called bounce rate, which measures 
whether someone has clicked on a page and immediately hit the back button. 
The search engines can detect it when a user clicks on a result and then 
clicks on another result in a short time. If a Web site constantly has people 
loading the first page for only a few seconds before hitting the back button to 
return to the search results, it’s a good bet that the Web site is probably not 
very relevant. Remember, engines strive for relevancy in their results so this 
could very likely be a factor in how they’re determining rankings.
 
So if all search engines are looking at these things, does it matter if you’re 
looking at Yahoo! versus Google? Yes, it does, because all search engines 
evaluate subject relevance differently. All of the Big Players have their own 
algorithms that measure things in a different way than their competition. So 
something that Google thinks belongs on page 1 of listings might not pop up 
in the top ten over on Yahoo!
Getting to Know the Major Engines
It’s time to meet the major search engines. Like we said before, they all 
measure relevancy a bit differently. Google might rank a page as more rel-
evant than Yahoo! does, so their results pages would look quite different for 

Book I
Chapter 2
Meeting the Search 
Engines
27
Getting to Know the Major Engines
the same search query. One engine is not necessarily better at search than 
another. For this reason, deciding which search engine is best is often sub-
jective. It all depends on whether you find what you’re looking for.
Organic versus paid results
One of the major ways search engines are differentiated is how they handle 
their organic versus paid results. Organic results are the Web pages that the 
search engines find on their own using their spiders. Paid results (also called 
sponsored listings) are the listings that the site owners have paid for. Usually 
paid results appear as ads along the side of the window, or in a series of 
sponsored links above the organic results. Paid results don’t necessarily 
equal your search query either. Here’s how this happens.
Companies can bid on almost any keyword that they want to get traffic for 
(with some legal exceptions). The minimum bid price is based on many fac-
tors, including competition for the keyword, traffic on the keyword, and in 
Google’s case, on the quality of the landing page. The better-constructed 
the landing page (the Web page that a visitor receives when clicking on an 
ad) is, the lower the minimum bid price is. This doesn’t have to be an exact 
match. Businesses often bid on keywords that are related to their products 
in hopes of catching more visitors. For example, if a visitor searches for tick-
ets to Popular Musical A, a sponsored (paid or advertising) link might show 
up advertising Popular Musical B. This is what’s happening below in Figure 
2-1. Ticketmaster has bid on Musical A as a keyword in order to advertise 
Musical B, so that’s the musical you see when you click the sponsored link. 
The organic links, however, should all take you to sites related to Musical A.
 
Paid results are quite different than organic results. Generally, people click 
on organic results rather than paid. You can’t buy your way to the top of 
organic results. You can only earn your way there through effective search 
engine optimization.
Directories
Some search engines use a directory from which to pull information. A 
directory is a list of Web sites the engine can search through that’s typically 
compiled by people, rather than by computer programs. The greatest dis-
tinction between a directory and an index involves how the data is arranged: 
Whereas indexes use algorithms on a database gathered through spidering, 
directories simply structure the items by theme, like in a phone book. (Note 
that directories offer their own searches, but sometimes directory content 
influences regular search results as well.)
Table 2-1 lists all the major search-engine players and the attributes of each, 
for comparison. Below the table, we introduce you to each search engine in 
more detail, and talk about organic results, paid advertising (including pay 
per click), and directory services for each engine.

Yahoo!
In 1994, two electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, 
David Filo and Jerry Yang, created Yahoo! as a list of Web sites (later broken 
into categories and subcategories as it grew, making it into a directory). This 
directory became one of the most authoritative on the Web. If a site wasn’t 

Book I
Chapter 2
Meeting the Search 
Engines
29
Getting to Know the Major Engines
listed in Yahoo’s directory, it just couldn’t be found, much like having an 
unlisted number keeps your name out of the phone book. For many years, 
Yahoo! outsourced their search function to other providers (like Google).
Organic results
By the end of 2002, Yahoo! realized how important search was, and they 
started aggressively acquiring search companies. Yahoo! purchased 
Inktomi in December of 2002, and then acquired the pay per click com-
pany, Overture, in July of 2003 (Overture owned search sites AllTheWeb 
and AltaVista). Yahoo! then combined the technologies from these various 
search companies they had bought to make a new search engine, dropping 
Google’s engine in favor of their own in-house technology on February 17, 
2004. So now all of Yahoo!’s results come from its own index and directories 
instead of from Google.
Paid results
Yahoo! Search Marketing (YSM) was formerly Overture, and before that, 
GoTo !— the original PPC engine. The difference between YSM and Google 
AdWords is that YSM’s editorial process takes longer for ads to go live, and 
your ranking is primarily based on your bid. Therefore, the top bidder gets 
the top position, even if it’s a different company (like when you search for 
Musical A but see a paid result taking you to tickets for Musical B instead). 
That policy is now starting to change, however.
Yahoo! Search Marketing offers two sign-up options:
 
✦ Fast Track: Provides assistance with campaign setup, keyword selec-
tion, ad copy, budget advice, and strategy.
 
✦ Self Service: Advertisers create their own bidding strategy, with ads 
subject to review.
The Yahoo! distribution network also includes AltaVista, Excite, Go2Net, 
InfoSpace, and Microsoft Live Search. The content partners include Cool 
Savings, CNN, Consumer Review Network, Knight Ridder, and more.
Search Submit Pro
In addition to paid results, Yahoo! is now offering something called Search 
Submit Pro. The Search Submit Pro (SSP) Trusted Feed (sometimes called 
Paid Inclusion) option allows you to submit your Web pages and content 
to the search engine. Participation in SSP guarantees inclusion in Yahoo’s 
index, bypassing the need to be spidered because you’re feeding the pages 
directly to the engine. This theoretically gives your site a greater chance 
to be ranked because your whole site is known by Yahoo!. Your Web site 
listings are displayed based on the relevancy of your site content to search 
terms, so no keyword bidding is required. Search Submit Pro allows you 

30
Getting to Know the Major Engines
to tailor your titles and information provided in search-results listings and 
make content that is not normally seen by a spider visible. It’s a paid service 
for people with search marketing budgets of at least $5,000 per month, or 
advertisers who have more than 1,000 Web pages to submit to the program. 
Like we said before, you can’t pay your way into the top organic results, but 
there are systems out there that can help increase your page rank.
The criteria for acceptance are that your site must be high quality and 
worthwhile, and it must offer your own product or service, not simply be 
a lead generation or affiliate site. A self-service SSP program that caters to 
smaller firms is available at a lower price point. This is definitely worth con-
sidering if you’re having a hard time getting into Yahoo!.
Yahoo! Directory
The Yahoo! Directory is Yahoo!’s personal phone book of Web sites. It’s 
both a free and fee-based directory that’s human-reviewed. This means 
that actual people go through these Web sites and rank them according to 
popularity and relevance. You can search directly in Yahoo! Directory, and 
the results are ordered based on their own Yahoo! Search Technology. If it’s 
a big category, the listings display over multiple pages. Since the launch of 
Yahoo!’s search index, the traffic received from directory listings has fallen 
off dramatically as fewer people use the directory on a regular basis.
Google
Google began as a research project by two other Stanford University students, 
Larry Page and Sergey Brin, in January 1996. They hypothesized that a search 
engine that analyzed the relationships between Web sites would produce 
better ranking of results than the existing techniques, which ranked results 
according to the number of times the search term appeared on a page. They 
originally called it BackRub, because the system checked backlinks in order to 
estimate a site’s relevance. (A backlink is an incoming link to a Web page from 
another site.) They officially incorporated as Google in September 1998.
Organic results
Over time, Google has developed into the powerhouse of the search engine 
medium. Here are just some of the reasons why Google is the king of search 
engines and shows no signs of giving up the crown:
 
✦ Highly relevant: Google’s relevancy is one of its strongest suits thanks 
to its reliance on site popularity (links) and content searches. 
 
✦ Research-oriented: Most Internet searches are research-based in nature, 
making Google’s research-friendly results highly attractive to users.
 
✦ PageRank: PR is a famous (though somewhat minor in practice) part of 
Google’s search algorithm, which assigns a numerical weight to a set of 
hyperlinked documents in order to measure their importance.

✦ Enormous index: Google has indexed an estimated trillion pages on the 
Internet and still counting.
 
✦ Brand recognition: The Google brand is used as a verb and listed in dic-
tionaries (as in, “I just Googled something on Yahoo! the other day . . . ”).
 
✦ Most-visited Web property: Google has more of the search market than 
all of the other search engines combined. They net more than 60 percent 
of all of the search engine traffic (see Table 2-2).

domain of the five search engines are not included in the core search numbers.
Paid results
Google has a service called Google AdWords for its paid results. It’s a pay 
per click service that lets you create your own ads, choose your keyword 
phrases, and set your maximum bid price and a budget. Google ranks its ads 
based on the maximum bid price and their click-through rate, or how many 
times the ad is clicked on. Google AdWords can also help you create your 
ads if you’re stuck on how to do so. Google then matches your ads to the 
right audience within its network, and you pay only when your ad is clicked 
on. Google has also recently introduced limited demographic targeting, 
allowing you to select the gender, age group, annual household income, eth-
nicity, and number of children in the household you wish to target. They’ve 
also added location-based targeting, day-parting, which is advertising only at 
certain times of the day.
You can potentially get a lot of exposure for your paid ads. The Google 
AdWords distribution network includes Google sites and affiliates like 
America Online, HowStuffWorks, Ask (US and UK), T-Online (Europe), News 
Interactive (Australia), Tencent (China), and thousands of others worldwide.

32
Getting to Know the Major Engines
 
Google also offers the ability to publish ads on their content network of sites 
called AdSense. These are the same familiar ads that you can find on the 
search page fed to regular Web sites. AdSense offers a larger variety of ad 
types as well.
Google Directory
Google offers a directory based on the Open Directory Project. The Open 
Directory Project is an open-source directory maintained by an army of 
human volunteers. It’s a widely distributed, human-maintained direc-
tory. Google applies PageRank to sequence the results in their directory. 
PageRank is Google’s own patented algorithm that, in a nutshell, assigns 
weight to a page based on the number, quality, and authority of links to and 
from the page (and other factors).
Microsoft Live Search
Microsoft Live Search (previously named “MSN Search”) is a search engine 
designed by Microsoft in order to compete with Yahoo! and Google. It’s 
currently the fourth-most-used search engine in the United States behind 
Google and Yahoo!. Live Search differentiates itself through new features, 
like the ability to view additional search results on the same Web page 
instead of having to click through to subsequent search results pages. It also 
has the ability to adjust the amount of information displayed for each search 
result (for example, just the title, a short summary, or a longer summary).
Organic results
Microsoft Live Search has had many incarnations, but previous versions 
used outside search engine results from companies like Inktomi and 
Looksmart. After Yahoo! bought Inktomi and Overture, Microsoft realized 
that they needed to develop their own search product. They launched the 
preview of their search engine technology on July 1, 2004, and formally 
switched from Yahoo! organic search results to their own in-house technol-
ogy on January 31, 2005. Microsoft then announced they were dumping 
Yahoo!’s search ads program on May 4, 2006. Since then, Microsoft Live 
Search has been almost exclusively powered by its own search algorithms.
Paid results
Microsoft’s paid program is called adCenter. It’s the newest pay per click 
platform available on the Web right now and reports are that it offers 
extremely good return on investment (ROI). Like Google, Microsoft Live 
Search ranks its ads based on the maximum bid price and their click-through 
rate, or how many times the ad is clicked on. Microsoft also allows you to 
place adjustable bids based on demographic details. For example, a mort-
gage lead from an older person with a higher income might be worth more 
than an equivalent search by someone who is young and still in college.

Checking Out the Rest of the Field: AOL and Ask.com
Checking Out the Rest of the Field: AOL and Ask.com
The four biggest search engines worldwide right now are Yahoo!, Microsoft 
Live Search, Baidu (a Chinese search engine — see Book IX, Chapter 3 for 
more information on Baidu), and Google, with Google taking home the lion’s 
share. But other smaller engines operating that do draw a pretty respectable 
number of hits are still operating.
AOL
AOL has been around in some form or another since 1983. It has grown from 
a company that provided a service through which users could temporarily 
download video games through modems that connected their computers to 
the phone line, to a company that provided a link to other computers using 
software that provided a “gateway” to the rest of the Internet. Although not 
as big as it once was, it still provides some services such as e-mail, chat, 
and its own search engine. But AOL gets all of its search engine results from 
Google, both organic and paid.
 
If you want to appear in AOL search, you must focus on Google.
Ask.com
Ask.com was originally created as Ask Jeeves, and was founded by Garrett 
Gruener and David Warthen in 1996, launching in April of 1997. It set itself 
apart from Yahoo! and AOL by using editors to match common search que-
ries, and then compiling results using several other search engines. (See 
metasearch engines later in this chapter for a more in-depth analysis.)
As competition mounted, Ask Jeeves went through several search engine 
technologies before acquiring Teoma in 2001, which is the core search tech-
nology they still use today. In March 2005, InterActive Corp. announced they 
were buying Ask Jeeves, and, by March of 2006, they changed the name to 
simply Ask.com. After pioneering blended search (the integration of different 
content types onto the search results page, such as images, videos, news, 
blogs, books, maps, and so on) but failing to gain any significant market 
share from the larger three engines, Ask.com is now changing its market 
strategy and targeting what it sees as its core demographic: married women.
Ask.com gets most of their paid search ads from Google AdWords. Ask.com 
does have its own internal ad service, but they place their internal ads above 
the Google AdWords ads only if they feel the internal ads will bring in more 
revenue.

Finding Your Niche: Vertical Engines
Finding Your Niche: Vertical Engines
We’ve been talking mostly about general search engines, whose specific 
purpose is to scour everyone and everything and return results to you. But 
there’s also another type of search engine known as a vertical search engine. 
Vertical search engines are search engines that restrict their search either 
by industry, geographic area, or file type. Google has several vertical search 
engines listed in the upper left-hand corner on its home page, for images, 
maps, and so forth. So when you type [jam] into Google’s images search, it 
only returns images of jam instead of Web pages devoted to jam products 
and jam-making. The three main types of vertical search engines are detailed 
in the next sections.
Industry-specific
Industry-specific vertical search engines serve particular types of businesses. 
The real estate industry has its own search engines like Zillow.com, Roost.
com, and Realtor.com that provide housing listings, and companion sites 
like ServiceMagic.com, which is for home improvement contractors. For the 
medical industry, there’s WebMD, a search engine devoted entirely to medi-
cal questions and services. If you are searching for legal services, Findlaw.
com and Lawyers.com can help you search for an attorney by location and 
practice.
 
Niche engines like these deliver a lower traffic volume but make up for it 
in quality of traffic. Visitors from niche engines are prequalified because 
they’re looking for exactly your type of site.
Local
A local search engine is an engine specializing in Web sites that are tied to a 
limited physical area also known as a geo-targeted area. Basically, it’s look-
ing for things in your general neck of the woods. In addition to their main 
index, each of the major search engines has a local-only engine that they 
can integrate into their main results, like Google Local and Yahoo! Local. In 
submitting a page to a search engine, you have an option of listing up to five 
different criteria you can be searched under, including address, telephone 
number, city, and so on. That means if a site is submitted with information 
stating that it’s a local business, it’ll pop up if someone’s looking for that 
location and product. If you live in Milwaukee and you’re looking for a chiro-
practor, you would have to type in [Milwaukee chiropractor] into the search 
box: If you don’t, you would end up with listings of hundreds of different 
chiropractors in places that are a little out of your range, like Grand Rapids. 
Adding a city or a ZIP code to your search automatically narrows the focus.

Book I
Chapter 2
Meeting the Search 
Engines
35
Discovering Internal Site Search
In late 2008, Google began attempting to determine the intent of the search 
and automatically started to geo-target search results based on the loca-
tion of the searcher, even if the user did not specify a city or ZIP code in 
the query. Not every search gets these modifications automatically, but as 
Google’s algorithm gets more accurate, Google will certainly seek to custom-
ize results further.
 
Less than one percent of searches in the major search engines include local 
search criteria, however. That’s why many large cities have their own local 
search engines. TrueLocal.com and Local.com are the most well known 
local-only engines. Internet yellow pages like YellowPages.com, SuperPages.
com, DexKnows.com, and YellowBook.com are also out there clamoring for 
your local search queries.
Behavioral
A behavioral search engine is a little bit trickier. Behaviorals look for 
searches by prior history. In other words, these search engines try to guess 
what exactly you’re looking for based upon your previous search inquiries. 
If you’re a coffee-drinker, and you’re always searching for some good java, a 
general search engine might turn up results about coffee beans and the com-
puter programming language. By contrast, if you search using a behavioral 
engine, over time, it’s going to figure out by your user history that you’re 
only looking for coffee, and drop out the technology results completely the 
next time you run a search for [java].
A good example of a behavioral search engine is Collarity (www.collar-
ity.com), which sends you results and advertising based upon your search 
and browser history. The engines keep track of your history by using cook-
ies, tiny innocuous text files automatically stored on your computer that can 
be easily referenced by these external programs. You’re basically leaving 
an electronic breadcrumb trail as you browse, and the behavioral search 
engine uses it to give you the most relevant results possible.
Discovering Internal Site Search
Say you’re writing an article and you need to reference something in the New 
York Times. NYTimes.com keeps an archive of online articles, but because 
you can’t remember the date the article was published, you’d have a long 
trek through the online archives. Luckily, they have their own internal site 
search engine that enables you to look up articles using keywords. Any 
search engine that’s site specific, or searches just that Web site, is an inter-
nal site search engine.

36
Understanding Metasearch Engines
Larger Web sites with thousands of pages employ these as an easy way of 
browsing their archives. A very small site probably doesn’t need an internal 
search, but most e-commerce sites with more than a few products should 
consider implementing one.
Techniques that help you rank in general search engines also help your users 
when they need to find something on your site using an internal search. A 
good internal search can be the difference between making a sale and visitors 
leaving in frustration. To get started quickly, Google offers a hosted internal 
search solution as well as an enterprise level solution. See www.google.
com/enterprise/public_search.html for more information.
Understanding Metasearch Engines
Another breed of search engine you should be aware of is a metasearch 
engine. Metasearch engines do not maintain a database of their own, but 
instead combine results from multiple search engines. The advantage they 
tout is a twist on “bigger is better” — the more results you see in one fell 
swoop, the better. The sites Dogpile.com and Metacrawler.com top the list 
of metasearch engines. When you run a search on Metacrawler.com, it pulls 
and displays results from the four largest global engines (Google, Yahoo!, 
Microsoft Live Search, and Ask.com) in one place.
Metasearch engines have passed their 
heyday. In the old days (1996, if you’re curious, 
which is approximately 10,000 BC in Internet 
years), there were dozens of different search 
engines still in their growth stages. None had 
indexes that encompassed the whole Internet. 
Because every search engine had only a piece 
of the pie, metasearch engines that could dish 
up the whole thing at once served a real pur-
pose. Now, however, the big search engines 
all have fairly exhaustive indexes with billions 
of listings with usable and relevant results, and 
as we covered in Chapter 1 of this minibook, 
there’s already a lot of indexed-data sharing 
going on. When you run a search in any of 
today’s four major search engines, you can be 
sure that you’re seeing most of the applicable 
organic results, and many of the paid ones.
The metasearch engines today rank very low 
in total market share compared to the four big 
players. According to ComScore statistics (at 
the time of writing), Google has more than 63 
percent of all search market share in the U.S., 
and a majority of Web searches globally. That 
means that six out of ten searches performed 
in the U.S. are done using Google.com. In the 
United States, the four big guys combined 
(Google plus Yahoo!, Microsoft Live Search, 
and Ask.com) make up more than 90 percent 
market share. AOL takes a big chunk of the 
remaining few percentage points, leaving little 
left over for the metasearch engines to claim.

Understanding Metasearch Engines
After pulling results from multiple search engines, the metasearch engines 
filter those results to determine what the user sees. This is different than 
applying an algorithm as the indexed search engines do (an algorithm is a 
mathematical equation that weighs many specific criteria about each Web 
page to generate its “rank” result, as discussed in Chapter 1). Metasearch 
engines take more of a filtering approach to all of the indexed data gathered 
from the other search engines. They display organic and paid results mixed 
up on the page, according to the order they think is most relevant, based on 
your search terms.
Can metasearch engines help you at all in your quest for great traffic from 
search engines? Well, possibly. You might enjoy using metasearch engines to 
help monitor your search engine optimization efforts because the results page 
tells you exactly where each listing comes from. We’ve found them especially 
helpful for keeping track of which competitors buy paid results for which key-
words (you can read more about paid search in Book I, Chapter 4). Figure 2-2 
shows you a results page from Metacrawler (www.metacrawler.com).
You can see the source of each result in small, bracketed text at the end of 
each listing. Notice that you can only tell which results are paid ads by this 
source information (such as, “Found on Ads by Yahoo!”). Is it necessary to 
use a metasearch engine for this type of information? Not really, because 
it doesn’t take too long to run a search in several sites to find their paid 
results. However, running it in a metasearch engine could, theoretically at 
least, save you time.

n Chapter 2 of this minibook, we discuss organic versus paid results: 
organic results being the listings that are ranked by perceived merit by 
a search engine, and paid results (also called sponsored results or spon-
sored links) being purchased links and ads that appear along with your 
organic results. In this chapter, you discover what the rest of the results 
page means, find out about the Golden Triangle, are introduced to blended 
search results, and discover how blended search is changing the game.
Reading the Search Engine Results Page
Say Mother’s Day is coming up, and you want to buy your mother a nice 
bouquet of roses. (Good for you! No wonder Mom always liked you best.) 
After going to Google and typing your [roses] search query into the box, 
you’re presented with a results page. The results page contains many differ-
ent listings containing the keyword, or search word, [roses], sorted accord-
ing to what Google thinks is most relevant to you. Figure 3-1 shows a Google 
results page for the query [roses].
We labeled the different parts in Figure 3-1 so that we can explain them one 
by one. (Note that we’re using a Google results page because they get the 
lion’s share of traffic. Plus, there isn’t much difference between their results-
page layout and those of Yahoo! and Microsoft Live Search.)
 
✦ Search Box: The box where you type your search query, or whatever it 
is that you’re looking for. In this case, it’s roses.
 
✦ Search Verticals: Links to the vertical search engines, the specialized 
ones that narrow your search into a specific type of result, such as 
images or news. Clicking one of these links takes you to a results page 
with only news or only images.

✦ Page Count: The number of Web pages Google found that match your 
search query in some way. In this case, it’s a lot.
 
✦ Time Search Took: How long the search engine took to retrieve your 
results. 
 
✦ Related Searches: Other topics that contain your query or other 
searches Google thinks might be relevant.
 
✦ Images: Picture files that match your query. This comes from Google’s 
Images vertical engine. Clicking the link would take you to the vertical 
search results; in this case, a page containing only images of roses.
 
✦ News Results: Any news results pertaining to your query or containing 
a keyword. These come from the vertical news engine. Clicking the link 
would take you to the news page.
 
✦ Sponsored Links: The paid ads. Note how some of them relate to a spe-
cific geographic location near you. This is thanks to the local vertical 
search engine.
 
✦ Organic Results: The listing results from a general search of Google’s 
index, with algorithms applied to determine relevance.
 
✦ Pagination: Links to the additional pages of results.
 
✦ Disambiguation: (not pictured) The “Did you mean . . . ?” suggestions 
that usually displays after a misspelled search query or search queries 
that turned up very few results. It’s Google trying to guess what you 
actually wanted. Because [roses] was spelled correctly, no disambigu-
ation appears in Figure 3-1. You can test this feature for yourself by 
searching for [rozes] in Google.
Understanding the Golden Triangle
Knowing what is on the results page is important, but so is understanding 
how people read it. As it turns out, there is actually a predictable pattern 
in the way in which people read a results page. In 2005, Enquiro Research 
conducted a study to track people’s eye movements while reading a typical 
search engine results page. They discovered a pattern that they called the 
Golden Triangle. The Golden Triangle identifies on a visual heat map how 
people’s eyes scan a results page and how long they look at a particular 
result before moving on.
In Figure 3-2, you can see there is a common tendency for your eye to start 
in the upper left-hand corner and move down the page, and then out to the 
right when a title catches your attention. This eye-tracking pattern forms a 
triangle. You look the most at the top three or four positions on the upper 
left, a little bit at the ones in the middle, and with the last few results on the 
page, you tend not to look at all. So when you apply the Golden Triangle to 
figure out where you want your Web page to appear on the results page, the 
spot you aspire to is among the first two or three.

42
Understanding the Golden Triangle

It’s important to note that the size of the browser window matters. Although 
most screen resolutions are 800 x 600 or higher (with a growing percentage 
viewing 1024 px wide or larger), many users have their window minimized; 
in that circumstance, the Golden Triangle shrinks. Very few people scroll 
down to look at the results below the fold; that is, out of the visible browser 
window. The same is true of every results page, the Enquiro study found. 
So if your site ranks at the top of the second results page, it may actually be 
looked at more than the listings at the bottom of page one.
It should be noted that the full eye-tracking 
reports examine the results in much greater 
detail, focusing on intent, first and second 
looks, “scent,” and the different reactions to 
three engines. If you’re interested in delving 
deeper into this topic, the original 2005 report

Discovering Blended Search
Discovering Blended Search
The search engines have historically indexed pages based upon the text 
content. Now the search engines are displaying other types of content inte-
grated (blended) automatically onto the SERP. The intent of this blending is 
to satisfy the searcher and to engage them by making the results more rel-
evant, essentially making the user happier with the search results.
User search behavior was similar across all search results pages until the 
advent of blended search results. Blending search results are something that 
the search engines have been doing recently with their searches. A blended 
search gives you results that the engine thinks would be useful to you, by 
including results from their search verticals, specialized engines that search 
only one type of content, like images, videos, news, local results, or blog posts. 
Your focus here is to recognize blended search and understand that a 
blended search is the search engine’s way of trying to give you the most 
relevant results possible by giving you results drawn from multiple sources. 
Note the differences between the general search in Figure 3-1 and the 
blended search in Figure 3-3. The images at the top are brought in from 
Google Image Search as a result of blended search. It requires no effort on 
the part of the user to receive blended search results. Any query that the 
search engine algorithms consider to be a candidate for a blended result will 
have such results. Try this yourself with a query for a popular musician or 
movie and see what happens. Searching for a person or event in the news 
recently is another good way to see blended search in action.
The results for the blended search include news items, images, and local 
results and many other types of engagement objects. These might be results 
that aren’t exactly what you are looking for, but Google thinks they might be 
useful, so they include them. Notice how the inclusion of an image seems to 
break up the page. This is important because it changes the eye-tracking pat-
terns in the Golden Triangle.
Results of the blended search on the Golden Triangle
With a traditional results page, the Golden Triangle theory says that you 
want to be in a top spot for maximum exposure, based on how people’s eyes 
scan the search results page. In 2007, Enquiro released another study (this 
time as a free white paper) focusing on the impact of the search engines’ 
integration of other verticals into their main results. They concluded that 
blended search results change how the eye tracks the page. Figure 3-4 shows 
what happens when test subjects were shown a results page with a blended 
result included.

Discovering Blended Search
Instead of eye tracking forming a triangle as users’ eyes move down and 
out from the upper-left corner, they briefly glance at the left-hand corner, 
and then look down to check out the image and very briefly look at the text 
beside it, before looking lower to check out the listing that is immediately 
underneath the image. 
 
Humans are drawn to images because they include color and stand out 
against a text-filled page. Pictures are different, so people are automatically 
drawn to them. The inclusion of an image high in the results also leads us to 
mentally cut the page in half. This means that a link that achieves a much-
coveted third or fourth spot on the results page may get ignored completely. 
That’s right: Almost no one looks at the link above the image. Instead, nearly 
everyone looks at the link below the image.
However, inclusion of an image with the link doesn’t automatically mean 
the image gets a thorough scanning. We can determine quickly whether an 
image is relevant and move on just as fast if we deem the image irrelevant. 
Note in Figure 3-5, where the image is not relevant to the search, how fast 
the eye scans and moves on.

Discovering Blended Search
Understanding the effect of Blended Search
You can see why blended search impacts search engine optimization in a 
big way. The Golden Triangle research shows how adding an image into the 
search results, especially one that pops up high on the page, leads search-
ers’ eyes to jump to it, making the top spots on the page not as important 
as they used to be. This is subject to change in the future as people become 
more used to the idea of blended results, but, for right now, we’re still 
drawn to the image first. Which means that, in a blended results page with 
an image, instead of being the number one or number two result, you might 
actually be happy in the number four spot, under the image.
 
Understanding how changes to the search results page can affect traffic and 
click-throughs is important. This information comes in handy when you’re 
fine-tuning your optimization campaign. Armed with the knowledge that 
your industry is often in the news, you can guide your site to sit in those 
coveted hot spots on the search page and gain more traffic.

f the Internet were a mall, Google would be the biggest department 
store and the Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Ask department stores would be 
the smaller stores in between. But a mall is more than just its department 
stores: You can also shop in dozens of specialty stores, food venues, mer-
chant carts, and so on. In this chapter, you meet the specialty stores of 
searching, the vertical engines, and find out how to make sure your product 
(your Web site) displays on those stores’ shelves.
In this chapter, you discover how to put your products in front of your cus-
tomers by changing your focus to traffic, not rankings; avoiding spam tactics 
that could hurt your Web site; and understanding the way that behavioral and 
intent-based search changes what your audience sees on the search results 
page. You also find out about how to get into the local search results and how 
to get started with a pay per click campaign in the main engines.
Seeking Traffic, Not Ranking
First, a couple of reminders are in order. Your search-engine-optimization 
efforts, if done well, can earn your site a higher ranking in search results 
pages. However, do not confuse the means with the end. Keep in mind your 
real goal — getting lots and lots of people to visit your Web site. What you 
really want to do is drive more Web traffic your way, and ranking represents 
just one means for achieving that end. In this chapter, you discover another 
reason to set your sights on traffic rather than ranking — technological 
advances (namely behavioral targeting and personalization) are causing 
ranking to become less important.

48
Avoiding Spam
Avoiding Spam
In the search engine world, cheating is known as spam. Spam involves delib-
erately building Web pages that try to trick a search engine into offering 
inappropriate, redundant, or poor-quality search results. It’s not only unethi-
cal, but can also get your Web site removed from an index entirely, so you 
definitely want to avoid it.
Here’s a basic spam illustration: Site A is well written, content-rich, and 
exceptionally relevant for the search query [sailboat rigging.] Site B is not 
as well written, not as content-rich, and is considered not as relevant. Site 
B implements a few spam tactics to trick the engine into believing they’re 
more relevant, and suddenly Site B outranks Site A for searches on [sailboat 
rigging]. What’s the result? It lowers the users’ satisfaction with the rele-
vancy of their search results in that search engine, hurts the user experience 
because they didn’t find what they needed, and slaps the face of those work-
ing at the search engine company who are responsible for making sure that 
users actually see relevant content and are happy.
Is it any wonder that the search engines enforce spam rules? It’s one thing 
to want to improve the quality, presentation, and general use of keyword 
phrases on your Web page, and an entirely different thing to go about 
tricking the engines into higher rankings without providing the real goods. 
(Because unintentional spam can still get your site in trouble, you might 
refer to Book I, Chapter 6 for some specific spam techniques to avoid.)
A note about spam: Spam is largely based on perception. When you get 
e-mail that you do not want, you consider it spam even though you might 
have opted to receive emails from that company. However, if you’re plan-
ning a trip and get e-mail about your travel destination, you don’t think that 
e-mail is spam, even if it was unsolicited. Your interest makes the e-mail 
not spam. Search engines do the same thing by targeting ads to your inter-
est. This leads to more clicks and higher user satisfaction surrounding 
advertising.
Understanding Behavioral Search Impact on Ranking
Search engines use a technique called behavioral search to customize a 
results page based on the user’s previous search behavior. Behavioral 
targeting basically tracks the searches you’ve run and adjusts new search 
results to include listings the search engine assumes will interest you based 
on your recent and past searches. It doesn’t replace all of the results you’d 
normally get with a regular search, but it may throw in a few extra ones it 
thinks would be useful to you.

Understanding Behavioral Search Impact on Ranking
Have you ever noticed that sometimes your search results differ from 
another person’s search results — even when you both type the same query 
into the same search engine? This is a scenario that is becoming more and 
more common. Before you think this means that search engine optimization 
is completely futile and throw your hands up in exasperation, read on. Here 
is what’s really going on.
Search engines can individually customize search results based on the user’s:
 
✦ Recent search behavior
 
✦ Location
 
✦ Web history
 
✦ Demographic information
 
✦ Community
The major search engines use more than just keyword ranking to determine 
the order of results. Remember, they’re trying to deliver the most relevant 
listings possible for every search. As a result, they’ve recently started taking 
this down to the individual-user level. With behavioral search and personal-
ization, results revolve around users, not a single boiler plate algorithm.
Behavioral targeting particularly affects the paid results you see (that is, ads 
or sponsored links that site owners have paid the search engine to display 
on results pages, based on keywords). For instance, if you run a search for 
[coffee mugs] followed by a search for [java], the search engine throws a few 
extra paid results for coffee-related products at the top or sides of the page. 
(Note that this kind of advanced targeting costs advertisers a pretty penny; 
the coffee sites might get charged double when a user clicks their behav-
ioral-targeting-enhanced listing, compared to their standard pay-per-click 
rate. For more details on how pay per click works, see Book X, Chapter 2.)
 
The organic results (non-paid listings that display on results pages) also may 
show slightly different listings or listings in an altered order. Even if you’re 
not logged in, the data from your search history may influence your search 
engine results, compared to the search results you would see if you were a 
new searcher for [java]. Your previous search for [coffee mugs] influenced 
the search engine to assume you meant [java] as in coffee, rather than the 
computer language. 
Personalizing results by location
Thanks to some fairly simple (and occasionally inaccurate) technology, search 
engines can tell where you are! Your computer’s IP address identifies your 
approximate city location to a search engine, which can then personalize your 
search results to include local listings for your search terms. This technique, 

50
Understanding Behavioral Search Impact on Ranking
often called geotargeting, comes into play the most when you search for items 
that involve brick-and-mortar businesses or services that need to be provided 
locally (for example, the search terms “furniture reupholstery” or “house paint-
ers” would bring up some local businesses mixed in with the other results).
Personalizing results by Web history
Google, for one, tries to further understand searchers’ intentions by look-
ing at their personal Web history, or the complete records of their previous 
Google searches and the Web sites they’ve visited or bookmarked. How far 
back they go is unclear. It’s important to note that Google can only track your 
Web history while you’re signed in to your Google account. Because the extra 
services like free e-mail and customizable home pages are truly wonderful, 
many people have these accounts and may not realize their surfing behavior 
is being recorded. Google does give you ways to block this, however.
Personalizing results by demographics
Search engines often know demographic information about you such as your 
gender, age, home address, or city, as well as your interests. You may pro-
vide this information to them when you first sign up for an account. Yahoo!, 
for example, has a Tell Us About Yourself section on their form where you 
can optionally enter your gender and birth date. They don’t get it without 
your consent. However, lack of direct input doesn’t mean they’re not going 
to try to infer information about you based on what you have told them. 
Your income could be assumed from your location or your gender based 
on your search history. They also learn about you by tracking what you do 
within their site. For instance, if you do a search on their map and, for map-
searching convenience later, mark your home address as your starting loca-
tion, the search engine reasonably assumes that that’s where you live.
Opting out of personalized results
All of these personalization techniques enable search engines to target your 
search results more specifically to your individual needs. If the result gives 
you more relevant listings, it may not be a bad thing. (At least, that’s the 
position the search engines take.)
You might want to opt out of personalized results because of privacy con-
cerns. However, when you’re evaluating keywords and doing SEO research, 
you definitely don’t want the results you see to change based on your per-
sonal information. You want to see the results that show to most people, 
most of the time.
 
Here’s how you can opt out of personalization in Google:
 
1. To turn off personalized search for a particular query, just add 
&pws=0 to the end of your search results page URL.

Book I
Chapter 4
Getting Your Site in 
the Right Results
51
Understanding Behavioral Search Impact on Ranking
 
 For example, after running a search for [coffee mugs] on Google, type 
&pws=0 at the end of the URL in the navigation bar. These few extra 
characters appended to the end of your search string stop Google from 
personalizing your results.
 
2. Opt out of session-based personalization.
 
 Recently, Google began making it more obvious when your search 
results are customized by displaying the message Customized Based on 
Recent Search Activity near the upper-right corner of the window (see 
Figure 4-1). If you click the adjacent More Details link, you see a page 
explaining why your results were customized, and offering you a way to 
see your results without these changes. Unfortunately, clicking this link 
for every search is something of a pain, but it is another option.
 
3. Google’s Web History feature only tracks you while you’re signed in 
to your Google account, so if you sign out, it’s turned off — until you 
sign on again.
 
 Google does offer a Yes/No switch to turn it off altogether and ways to 
delete history records or pause tracking temporarily, but all of these 
options are a little buried. To find them, sign in to your Google account, 
and then click the Help link for the options under the heading, The 
Personalized Google Experience. (Note that turning off Web History does 
not prevent Google from applying behavioral search targeting to your 
searches based on session behavior, so you may still need steps 1 and 2.)

Using Verticals to Rank
Using Verticals to Rank
Getting into a vertical of a general search engine (like Google, Yahoo!, 
and Live Search) is fairly simple and requires little extra work. Ranking is 
another story. Ranking in a vertical is a lot like ranking in a general search 
engine. In order to optimize images, video, shopping, news, blogs, and RSS 
feeds, you must tailor your listing so that certain attributes are even more 
specific. In the next few sections, we highlight the most important attributes 
for ranking in each vertical.
Video
With the advances in streaming technology and faster Internet connection 
speeds, video is becoming more and more popular as time goes on. Like 
increasing the rank of your Web site, you can use similar techniques to make 
sure your video has a chance of achieving a high page rank.
Getting search-engine ranking for your video is as simple as this:
 
✦ Place keywords in the metadata of a video. Meta data is descriptive 
text, containing mostly keywords, that can be placed in the HTML of the 
video file. You want this text to both describe the video and give the spi-
ders something to look at.
 
✦ Place keywords in your video’s filename. Remember to keep your key-
words for both the metadata description and the filename specific and 
relevant.
 
✦ Use YouTube (www.youtube.com) to host your video. YouTube was 
acquired by Google a couple of years ago, so any video on YouTube gets 
spidered and indexed a lot faster than it would on other video hosting 
sites.
 
✦ Link from your video to your Web site. This could help drive up your 
site’s traffic and ranking. Of course, you especially benefit from this 
strategy if the video you post becomes popular (but don’t ask what 
makes a video popular, because not even Hollywood can predict accu-
rately what people will like).
 
✦ Include text about the video in the page area surrounding the video 
link, if possible. Keep in mind that video, along with images, can be 
spidered. Spiders can read and index the Meta data and the text sur-
rounding the video, as long as the text is descriptive of the video, full 
of keywords, and relevant to a user’s search. In Figure 4-2, note the 
description box and the list of keywords, which are all hyperlinked. 
Remember, Google loves this.
 
Keep in mind that because YouTube.com is a separate site, the video is not 
considered “your” content. You want to host the video on your own site as 
well so that you get credit for it as part of your content. Always link back to 
your site in the description of the video and in the video file itself.

Images
You can apply many of the tips we stated in the previous “Video” section to 
images, as well. Images and video can be identified by topic as long as the 
text surrounding them relates to the image or video. Spiders are also looking 
at the filename, so instead of naming your image file 00038.jpg, call it red-
porsche.jpg or something equally descriptive. Definitely include Alt attribute 
text for every image on your Web site. Alt attributes are used to describe an 
image for users who are using screen readers or when an image does not dis-
play. In some browsers, this text becomes user-visible when they move their 
mouse over the image. Spiders also read and index this text. With so many 
eyes looking at it, it’s worth the effort to write something meaningful. For 
example, the HTML of the image of the red Porsche could look like this:
<img src=”redporsche.jpg” ALT=”Red 2005 Porsche with leather 
interior”>
 
A short, simple, descriptive phrase is all you need for the Alt attribute. 
Stuffing it with keywords, however, is considered evil and might get your 
site dropped (see Book I, Chapter 6 for more info on that point). Keep it 
simple, keep it short, and keep it to the point. Consider the size of the image 
as a guideline: Smaller images probably only need a couple words to explain 
what they are. Larger images might require several words. Don’t go over-
board. If you have paragraphs of information about the image, consider put-
ting that on the Web page as content.

54
Using Verticals to Rank
News
Getting into a news vertical is a bit tricky. You might have a company Web 
site with a news site that you frequently update with articles and recent 
events, yet it won’t rank in a news vertical. Why? Google considers a site a 
news site if it is updated multiple times a week by multiple authors. Your 
company News page, for example, would not be considered for inclusion in 
Google News because even though it might be updated several times a week, 
it’s all written by the same person (or in this case, company). Compare this 
to a site like MarketWatch.com, which is updated multiple times a day by 
many different authors.
The easiest way to make your company news available for news searches is 
to send out a press release of your article. You can choose from a variety of 
different news wire services (PRNewswire, PRWebDirect, MarketWire, and 
so on); the fees vary depending on the length of your article, the geographic 
region you want to cover, and other factors. After you submit your press 
release, it’s available for any news agency to pick up and publish, increasing 
your company exposure and potentially your site traffic.
 
You can monitor who picks up your news using either the optional tools 
provided by your news wire service (for a fee), or by creating a free Google 
Alert. You can sign up for a Google Alert at www.google.com/alerts and 
enter your company name, keywords, or other descriptor for your search 
terms. Google then automatically e-mails you whenever an article relevant to 
your keywords hits the Web!
Shopping
Shopping verticals usually get their information by using an RSS feed. RSS 
is short for Really Simple Syndication, and it is a method for distributing 
frequently updated content. Basically, people who receive an RSS feed see 
a page that displays all of a Web page’s recent updates or uploads in a stan-
dardized format. An RSS document (which is called a feed) contains either 
a summary of content from an associated Web site or the full text that the 
spiders come and look over. We go over it a little more in depth later in this 
chapter, but what you need to know about it here is that shopping verticals 
use RSS feeds to check for new products. Google’s shopping vertical, Google 
Product Search, uses spiders along with RSS feeds to check for new content, 
and they’re the only shopping vertical out there that’s truly free to vendors. 
Yahoo! Shopping provides an e-commerce template to small business ven-
dors without a Web site, letting them build their own Yahoo! Shopping site 
that is entered into their shopping search engine for a fee based upon their 
expected sales, (the higher the sales you expect, the higher the fee). Users 
can log onto http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/merchant/ to sign up 
or take the tour for more information.

Blogs and RSS
Blogs (short for “Web logs”) have been increasing in popularity for the past 
couple of years and are starting to have their own vertical search engines. 
The same is true for RSS feeds. The thing is, in order for a blog site to rank in 
a vertical search engine, it needs its own RSS feed. Bloggers using software 
such as WordPress, Moveable Type, or Blogger have these feeds automati-
cally created for their sites.
Other ranking features beyond having an RSS feed vary between search 
engines; blogs usually rank based on their own merit (content and update 
frequency are key), and based on however the algorithm is set up for that 
particular search engine. Google has a beta version of a blog vertical called 
Google Blog Search (blogsearch.google.com). Figure 4-3 shows a typical 
Google Blog Search result page.

Showing Up in Local Search Results
You now know that local search engines provide another playing field for 
your Web site to attract potential customers. Better yet, they give you a 
much smaller field, where your business has an excellent chance of being a

star player. In this section, you discover the how-to and follow step-by-step 
instructions (which are accurate at the time of this writing) for getting your 
site to show up in local-oriented searches. Note that there is no charge for 
submitting a basic local listing, so think of this as free advertising! You can 
submit your listing to all three of the big search engines.
Getting your site into the local engines has another benefit. The traffic for 
local terms in a broad-base engine (such as Google) far outweighs any sort 
of search volume in a local-only search engine. Search engines like Google, 
Yahoo!, and Microsoft Live Search are the first stop for a consumer in search 
of a solution. However, listing your business in the local search engines also 
ensures that your site shows up for general searches that include geo-targeting 
(search queries that contain a city, ZIP code, or other geographic term). For 
example, if you have a florist’s shop in the Bronx, your shop’s Web site would 
come up when someone searches for [Bronx florist].
Getting into Google Local
Much like their main search index, Google Local is the most popular local 
vertical out there. Submitting your site to Google Local enables you to show 
up for local queries, appear on Google Maps for searches there, and of 
course, appear for relevant general queries via blended search when Google 
detects that a local result is appropriate. Here is a step-by-step guide to get-
ting your site listed in Google Local:
 
1. Check Google Local (local.google.com) to see if your business is 
already listed. Search for your company name or type of business, fol-
lowed by a space and your city or ZIP code.
 
2. If your listing isn’t there yet, go to https://www.google.com/
local/add/login.
 
3. Sign in to your Google account.
 
 If you have ever signed up for a Gmail or iGoogle account, you can enter 
that e-mail address and password. If you don’t have an account yet, 
choose Create a New Google Account and sign up for free.
 
4. Submit your free business listing by following the online instructions.
 
 You can specify your hours of operation, payment options you accept, 
and descriptive text. Click Add Another Category and choose up to five 
categories for your business — these help people find your business 
when searching, so be sure to choose well.
 
5. Select a verification method, either by
 
• Phone (immediate), or
 
• Postal mail (within two weeks)

Enrich your business listing for free and get maximum exposure: After your 
business is listed in Google Local, you can add coupons to entice local cus-
tomers. Google also lets you upload up to ten photos and five videos at no 
extra charge.
Getting into Yahoo! Local
Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) is an extremely popular home page for many 
people on the Web and, as a result, their local product receives a fair 
amount of traffic. Like Google, Yahoo! also integrates their local results into 
map search and incorporates them in blended search results. Follow these 
simple steps to increase your site’s exposure for relevant local searches:
 
1. Check Yahoo! Local (local.yahoo.com) to see if your business is 
already listed. Enter your company name or type of business, your 
city, or ZIP code, and click the Search button.
 
2. Scan the results to see if your business is already listed. If not, go to 
http://listings.local.yahoo.com.
 
3. Click Sign In near the top of the page and sign in to your Yahoo! 
account.
 
 (You would have a Yahoo! account if you’ve ever created a free e-mail 
or My Yahoo! account.) If you are a new user, click Sign Up instead and 
create an account.
 
4. Create your listing using the online form.
 
 You can specify hours of operation, payment methods, and so on. Be 
sure to pick the two best categories for your business.
 
5. Verify the listing and submit it.
 
Yahoo! offers a basic listing for free, but if you want to add coupons, photos, 
a logo, and so on, you have to upgrade to an “enhanced” listing with a small 
monthly fee. Note that Yahoo! has no official verification system in place, so 
to protect your business from being added incorrectly by someone else, you 
might want to jump on this.
Getting into MSN Local (local.msn.com)
Microsoft’s local product is the new kid on the block, but this scrappy 
underdog is worth the effort it takes to sign up. Follow this step-by-step list 
to get into the local results and capture a new market:
 
1. Go to https://llc.local.live.com/ListingCenter.aspx and 
click Add Listing.
 
2. Enter your business information in their first form to check if your list-
ing already exists.

3. If your listing is not found, you need to sign in to your Windows Live 
ID account. (Sign up if you don’t have one.)
 
4. Complete the online forms per their instructions and submit your listing.
 
5. Choose the most appropriate categories.
 
6. Wait two or three weeks for verification via postal mail.
Making the Most of Paid Search Results
We briefly went over paid search results in Book I, Chapter 2 for Google, 
Yahoo!, and Microsoft Live Search. If you’re wondering what the difference 
between them is, think of it like buying a commercial on television. Running 
a commercial during the biggest sporting event of the year is going to be 
much more expensive than running it at 3:00 A.M. on a local station. The 
same is true for buying an ad on Google versus buying an ad on one of the 
less-trafficked search engines. It will be cheaper on the smaller engines, sure, 
but the odds of someone seeing it are going to be about as low as the price. 
Price also depends on the popularity of the keyword being bid on. Your 
best bet for the widest reach when you’re getting started with PPC ads is to 
advertise on one of the three larger engines. Keep in mind that for the most 
visibility possible, you should probably advertise on as many as you can. In 
this section, we break PPC ads down for you in terms of how to buy on each 
of the engines, how much you’ll be paying, and who is going to see your ad.
Google AdWords
Google AdWords (adwords.google.com) is Google’s paid search program. 
It lets you create your own ads, choose your keyword phrases, set your 
maximum bid price, and specify a budget. If you’re having trouble creating 
ads, Google has a program to help you create and target your ads. It then 
matches your ads to the right audience within its network, and you pay only 
when your ad is clicked. How much you pay varies greatly depending on the 
keyword because competition drives the bid price. For instance, a keyword 
like mesothelioma, the cancer caused by asbestos, runs about $56 per click. 
Lawyers love this one because a case could arguably net them hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, so it’s worth getting the one case per hundred clicks, 
and multiple competitors drive the price up through bidding wars.
Signing up for Google AdWords
You can activate an AdWords account for $5, choosing a maximum cost-per-click 
(how much you pay when the ad is clicked) ranging from one cent on up; 
there’s really no limit. Google provides a calculator for determining your

daily budget, along with information on how to control your costs by setting 
limits. Google also has stringent editorial guidelines designed to ensure ad 
effectiveness and to discourage spam. Payment can be made by credit card, 
debit card, or direct debit, as well as via bank transfer.
Placement options
With Google AdWords, you have three placement options available to you. 
The most common is for your ads to appear on Google search engine results 
page based on a keyword trigger. The second option allows your site to 
show up in the search results pages of Google’s distribution partners like 
AOL and Ask.com. The third option is site-targeted campaigns in which 
you can have your ads show up on sites in Google’s content network (via 
Google’s AdSense publisher platform). Site-targeted campaigns are based 
on a cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM — the M stands for mille and is a 
holdover from the old printing press days) model with $0.25 as the minimum 
per 1,000 impressions.
Google has also recently introduced limited demographic targeting, allowing 
advertisers to select gender, age group, annual household income, ethnicity, 
and children/no children in the household (which raises the price, but also 
increases the potential effectiveness of your ad).
Most people want to advertise on Google because their ad has a chance 
of appearing across a wide range of networks, like America Online, 
HowStuffWorks, Ask (U.S. and U.K.), T-Online (Europe), News Interactive 
(Australia), Tencent (China), and thousands of others worldwide. Notice 
in Figure 4-4 how Google tries to target the ads based on the content of the 
Web page where the ads appear.
The major benefits of Google AdWords PPC advertising are
 
✦ An established brand: Google gets the most searches (61.5 percent in 
June 2008).
 
✦ Strong distribution network.
 
✦ Both pay-per-click and pay-per-impression cost models.
 
✦ Site targeting with both text and image ads.
 
✦ Costs automatically reduced to the lowest price required to maintain 
position.
 
✦ Immediate listings mean your ads go live in about 15 minutes.
 
✦ No minimum monthly spending or monthly fees.

60

✦ Daily budget visibility.
 
✦ Multiple ads can be created to test the effectiveness of keywords.
 
✦ Keyword suggestion tool.
 
✦ Conversion tracking tool that helps identify best performing keywords, 
define your target market, and set an ad budget. You can easily import 
your search campaign, pay on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis, and access 
millions of unique users.

Yahoo!
Yahoo! Search Marketing (searchmarketing.yahoo.com) was formerly 
Overture, and before that GoTo — the original pay-per-click engine. It differs 
from Google because its human editorial process means that it takes longer 
for ads to go live. It used to be that your rank was based solely on your bid, 
but Yahoo! is making changes so that their model is more like Google’s.

Signing up for Yahoo! Search Marketing
Yahoo! Search Marketing offers two sign-up options:
 
✦ Fast Track: Provides assistance with campaign setup, keyword selec-
tion, ad copy, budget advice, and strategy for a fee of $199. You get a 
proposal that shows estimated clicks and cost. Ads go online within 
three business days of your approval.
 
✦ Self Service: Processed online as advertisers create their own bidding 
strategy with ads subject to review. E-mail notification informs you when 
the ad goes live, usually within three business days. A full-service option 
is available if desired, where a Yahoo! Search Marketing specialist pro-
vides a proposal showing keywords and projected costs within ten busi-
ness days, subject to client approval before going live.
 
Besides the time it takes for campaigns to go live, there are also differences 
in payment policy. Yahoo! requires advance deposits to cover click-throughs 
(every time a user clicks a paid result ad) and has monthly minimums. If you 
fall short, you are charged for the difference. If your account runs out of 
funds, Yahoo! stops the campaign and requires a minimum deposit of three 
days’ worth of clicks based on recent campaign activity to reactivate the 
campaign.
Placement options
Yahoo!’s exact algorithm for ranking paid ads is a secret, but it’s basically
Bid Price x Quality Score = Ad Rank
Quality score is based on the ad’s CTR (click-through rate), the relevance of 
the ad to the keyword, and the quality of the landing page the ad is sending 
the user to. Yahoo! Search Marketing offers geo-targeting, which identifies 
users’ locations by their IP addresses and gives them local results. You ben-
efit most from geo-targeting if you are a local business. (Note that sometimes 
the user’s IP address happens to originate in a completely different city 
than where they actually are, so geo-targeting is still not a perfect solution.) 
Yahoo! Search Marketing also offers ad testing, campaign budgeting, and 
campaign scheduling.
Like Google, YSM offers several placement options — in their own search 
listings, on their partner sites (which includes AltaVista, Excite, Go2Net, 
InfoSpace, and all the Yahoo! properties), and on their content network 
(through Yahoo! Publisher Network), which includes Cool Savings, CNN, 
Consumer Review Network, Knight Ridder, and many more. Figure 4-5 shows 
a typical Yahoo! pay per click ad.

Here are some of the benefits of Yahoo! Search Marketing:
 
✦ Return on investments (ROI): Yahoo has one of the highest return on 
investments (ROI) of any of the search engines.
 
✦ Geotargeting for local businesses.
 
✦ Costs less than Google.
 
✦ Business-oriented: Much more business-oriented than Google.
 
✦ Campaign budgeting and scheduling.
 
✦ Large distribution network.
 
✦ Choice of either Fast Track or Self Service when building your adver-
tising campaigns, with Yahoo! helping you to create the most effective 
advertising campaign for a fee.
Microsoft Live Search
Microsoft’s paid search program is called adCenter (adcenter.microsoft.
com). AdCenter is the newest of the pay per click options and one of the most 
advanced. One thing they offer is a keyword research and optimization tool, 
based in Excel, which enables you to manage keyword lists, keep precise met-
rics, and more.

Microsoft adCenter
Signing up for Microsoft adCenter costs $5. After that, you only pay when 
someone clicks your ad, with cost-per-click bids starting as low as $0.05/
click. You can import your existing search campaign using Microsoft adCen-
ter and quickly build or expand keyword lists with adCenter’s Add-in (beta) 
for Excel 2007.
Placement options
Microsoft adCenter allows you to target your ads based on user demo-
graphics, such as gender, marital status, age, and so forth. You have to pay 
more to restrict your advertising in this way; the price per click increases 
or decreases depending on whether someone you picked for your target 
demographic is clicking your ad. On top of that, adCenter allows you to run 
your ads on specific days of the week or certain times of day. If you have 
an ad that targets teenagers, for example, you can choose to have your ad 
run after 3:00 P.M. on weekdays and all day on weekends in order to achieve 
higher visibility.
Like Yahoo! and Google, adCenter allows search ads in Live Search results 
and display ads on Microsoft adCenter Publisher. Opportunities for display 
ads include RSS feeds to their shopping site, banners, and e-mail. They target 
smaller business owners with this one, and the cost is $3,000 to $15,000 per 
month.
Microsoft is the latest engine to have done studies proving that audiences 
exposed to both search and display ads together deliver a greater positive 
brand lift (that is, user recall and positive associations with the brand) than 
either type of campaign can yield on its own.

✦ Cost by Segmentation: Adjusts cost per click to target demographic
 
✦ Search and Display: A useful tool for small businesses
 
✦ Tools: Keyword search and optimization tool
 
✦ Reach: Your ads appear on Microsoft’s content network, which cur-
rently covers about 43 million users
 
✦ Conversion Rates: adCenter typically returns better ROI than other 
engines
 
✦ Costs Less: Bids are usually lower than either Google or Yahoo!

n this chapter, you discover how to use the search engines like a pro 
through the use of advanced operators, targeting vertical engines. 
You also find out the difference between high traffic and high conversion 
terms, plus why it’s imperative to capture the so called Long Tail of search. 
Becoming an expert searcher gives you an edge for doing market research, 
keyword analysis, and much more. The expert-searcher skill set definitely 
complements your role as a search engine optimizer, so we’re devoting a 
whole chapter to it. At the end of this chapter, you get to apply your new-
found skills to enhancing your Web site with keywords targeted for your 
audience.
A typical search returns many results (commonly in the millions) and may 
include lots of irrelevant listings. Because search engines find what you 
tell them to search for, an overly large result set can be chalked up to a 
too-broad search query (the terms typed into the search box). You prob-
ably already know some simple techniques for narrowing a search, such as 
adding more specific terms (such as [bass fishing vacations] instead of just 
[bass fishing]), or including quotation marks around words that must be an 
exact phrase. For instance, searching for [“bass fishing vacations”] in quota-
tion marks reduces the result set to just a few hundred listings, compared 
to more than 600,000 without the quotes. You may even know to click the 
Advanced Search link to access additional search fields that let you specify 
what to exclude as well as include. We offer more tips along this line in this 
chapter.

66
Using Advanced Search Operators
Using Advanced Search Operators
Search engines have come up with additional tools called advanced search 
operators to give power users even more control when searching. Advanced 
search operators are special terms that you can insert in your search query 
to find specific types of information that a general search can’t provide. 
Several of these operators provide useful tools for SEO experts as well as 
others who want very specific information, or who want to restrict their 
search to very specific sources. These operators have a particular meaning 
to each of the different search engines, but not all engines accept the same 
operators.
Type the advanced search operators at the beginning of your search query, 
followed by a particular domain name (the base URL of a Web site, such as 
bruceclay.com). This type of query modifies the search to dig deeper into 
the engine’s algorithms (the mathematical formulas the search engine uses to 
weigh various factors and establish a Web site’s relevance to a search). The 
returned page provides entirely different results than the average search.
For example, say you type this query into a Google search box (substituting 
your own Web site domain name): [link:www.yourdomain.com]. The Google 
results page would include a list of some of the Web pages that actually 
link to your Web site. In this particular case, the advanced operator used 
is [link:] followed by the site’s domain name. (Note that you cannot put a 
space between the operator and the domain name.)
You have numerous operators at your fingertips that can provide significant 
and useful information. Another very helpful operator is the [site:] operator. 
If you type [site:] into the search box before the domain name, the search 
engine results tell you how many pages are within that particular domain 
and its sub-domains. Those results can also provide information on pages 
that have been indexed more than once, which in turn provides information 
regarding duplicate content. It also provides information about pages that 
are being dropped out of the search engines. You can see how powerful this 
can be for SEO!
 
You can also put additional search terms in your query. For example, this 
search would list all the pages on the given Web site: [site:bruceclay.com]. If 
you were looking for something specific on the site, however, you could add 
more search terms to the end. For instance, to find pages on the Web site that 
contain the word training you would type this: [site:bruceclay.com training].
Table 5-1 below shows several advanced operators for the three big engines 
and describes their use. It should be noted that Yahoo redirects most 
advanced operators to their advanced search console, Site Explorer, located 
at http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/.

Combining operators for turbo-powered searching
Whether you are an SEO expert or just now gleaning the basics of the search 
engine optimization industry, you may often find that you need to combine 
some of the commands to pinpoint the information you need.
For example, you find yourself wanting to determine how many pages on a 
site have a particular keyword phrase in their Title tag (one of the HTML 
tags contained in the HTML code that’s located at the top of a Web page). 
Because Title tags are weighted quite heavily in most search engines’ algo-
rithms, this information would be very useful in your search engine optimi-
zation work. Fortunately, it is possible to combine multiple search operators 
to find information just like this.
To find out how many pages on a site have a particular keyword phrase, you 
could type the following query in either Google or Yahoo!: [site:www.sample
domain.com intitle:keyword phrase]
Your query is basically asking, “Within the site, how many pages have this 
keyword phrase in their Title tags?”
However, keep in mind that many combinations of basic and advanced search 
operators do not work. For example, you cannot combine a [site:] command 
in Google with an [allintitle:] search, as we have below: [site:www.sample
domain.com allintitle:keyword phrase]. This query doesn’t always work.
 
A few types of search operators can never be used in combination with 
another operator. For your reference, we have included them below:
 
✦ Every Google [allin] operator
 
✦ Operators that request special information (for example, define:, stocks:, 
and so on)
 
✦ Search operators that are specific to a page (cache:, related:, url:, and 
so on)

Book I
Chapter 5
Knowing What 
Drives Search

69
Using Advanced Search Operators
 
Discovering which combinations work and which ones don’t is a matter of 
trial and error.
Searching for images
When doing search engine optimization, you find that it’s useful to know 
how to find specific types of files quickly. The vertical search engines and 
other file-type-specific sites (such as YouTube for videos) can make your life 
easier looking for image files, video files, news articles, blog posts, or maps. 
And if you can find the specific file, you can be sure it has been indexed by 
the search engine.
To search for image files, you can click the Images link located near the 
search box on all of the major search engines and then type in your search 
terms. Doing this restricts your search results to show only image files (file 
types such as JPEG and GIF, which include photos, diagrams, drawings, 
stars, lines. . . basically any static graphic on a Web page).
Besides the entertainment value of seeing tons of pictures on any subject, 
image searches also give you an easy way to make sure that the images on 
your Web site have been indexed by the search engine. For example, if you 
have a photo of a ten-gallon jar of peanut butter on your Web site, you can 
search for it by clicking Images and then typing descriptive text about your 
image, like [peanut butter jar]. If your webmaster gave the image an ALT 
attribute (text that displays in place of an image if it cannot display for some 
reason — for more details, see Book IV, Chapter 1) like “Ten-gallon peanut 
butter jar,” you can use the ALT attribute as your search query. If the search 
engine spidered your Web site and found the image, it also should have 
indexed the ALT attribute. To really target your search, you can first tell the 
search engine to look only within your Web site: [site:www.yourdomain.com 
“Ten-gallon peanut butter jar”]. Using quotation marks (“ “) around the query 
tells the search engine to return only pages with that exact text on them.
Searching for videos
Videos are being used more and more inside Web sites. Sites like YouTube 
store millions of videos that can be watched by anyone, anywhere, on nearly 
any subject. You can search within these sites for videos, but you can also 
do a broader video search using a vertical search engine.
From the Google, Yahoo!, or Microsoft Live Search page, click the Videos link 
near the search box and then type in your search terms. Your results only 
include video files that have been indexed by that search engine and that 
match your search terms.
Searching for news
Similar to running an image or video vertical search, you can click a News link 
on the major search engines near the search box to find news articles. The 

70
Using Advanced Search Operators
search engines consider a “news” site to be a site that has multiple authors 
and frequent postings. Additionally, Google requires that news sites have at 
least four numbers that aren’t a date in their URLs. (So your company’s News 
page that shows your own press releases probably wouldn’t qualify.)
In Google, the News vertical search engine only keeps articles published 
within the last 30 days. If you want to search for any news older than that, 
you can use Google’s news archive search. Google’s news archive indexes 
full-text content dating back to about 1800. (Google partnered with orga-
nizations such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Time, the 
Guardian, and The Washington Post, and massive data aggregators including 
Factiva, LexisNexis, and HighBeam Research, to obtain their information.) 
You can click News Archive Search on the Google News search page, or go 
to http://news.google.com/archivesearch to search Google’s news 
archives.
Searching through blogs
Blogs, which is short for Web logs, are rising in importance in online market-
ing. Though still new, these social marketing communities allow individuals 
to publish articles, comments, images, videos, and more as part of a running 
conversation online. A mention of your company with a link to your Web site 
on a well-read blog can potentially bring hundreds or thousands of people to 
your site. Because you generally have no warning when something like this 
might occur, such a sudden spike in traffic, though welcome, might over-
whelm your server’s capacity.
On the flipside, you might be reviewing your server logs and find that your 
site had nine times the normal traffic at 11:22 this morning, and you’d like to 
know why. The cause may have been someone’s blog post, and you want to 
know what it said.
If there’s a blog (or two or twenty) for your industry, it’s a good idea to sub-
scribe to it to keep your ear to the ground. You’ll get to know more than just 
information; you’ll also get to know the people in your industry. Think of it 
as passive networking and market research; plus it will help you figure out 
who the authoritative voices are in your industry. If every blog links to Blog 
A, it’s a good bet that Blog A is someone you should be paying attention to. 
Blogs are also a great way to find out what people think about your industry.
 
You can search through blogs using Google’s tool (which is still in beta test-
ing as we write this). Go to blogsearch.google.com and search as you 
would through any vertical. Your results contain links to blog sites only, and 
you can even isolate posts that were only published in the last hour, last 12 
hours, last day, or within a range of dates.

You may also find other blog searches helpful: Yahoo’s is www.ysearch
blog.com, Microsoft has one at blogs.msdn.com/livesearch, and there 
are plenty of others (to find them, do a search for [blog search]).
Searching with maps
We probably don’t need to say much about map searches because anyone 
who has ever needed directions has probably already used them. Online 
mapping is a fast-moving industry where the technology continues to 
advance at lightning speed. Companies spend a lot of money and time to 
improve their interactive maps because visual map tools attract visitors in 
droves. What’s good for you, though, is that maps are more than a tool for 
driving directions; they’re also a great way to perform a local search.
Click the Maps link at Google, Yahoo!, or Microsoft Live Search, and you see 
a large map image topped by a simple search field. This is a friendly, visual 
interface for finding a local dry cleaner, or orthodontist, or pet groomer. The 
search field is very flexible; you can enter a type of businesses, a specific 
company name, an address, or just a city. When your business shows up in 
a local search, not only can a user see your information on the left, but also 
your location pinpointed on a map. (Note: If your business does not show 
up, we highly recommend you submit it to the three major search engines’ 
local search indexes. For instructions, see Book I, Chapter 4.)
Distinguishing between High Traffic 
and High Conversion Search
You want to attract lots of people to your Web site. But it’s not just about 
quantity — you want quality traffic. You want to attract visitors who come 
and stay a while, and find what they’re looking for on your site. What you 
You sometimes see news items through the reg-
ular search page (not Google News). One way is 
to enter a search query that reads like a head-
line of a recent event. For instance, if you enter 
[man invents self-washing car] and this world-
shattering news has just broken, your results 
will very likely consist mostly of newspaper
article links. Also, search engines blend news 
stories into a regular search results page if a 
recent story is considered highly relevant to 
your search. In a blended search, Google usu-
ally places the news item in the first or fourth 
position on the search results page.

really need are customers. In the world of search engine marketing, site visi-
tors who become customers are called conversions. They came, they looked, 
they bought. They were converted.
 
When you design for search engine optimization, it’s important to keep in mind 
that you want high conversion rates, not just high traffic. You need to consider 
the Long Tail phenomenon (coined by Chris Anderson in an October 2004 
Wired magazine article, and frequently discussed in SEO circles ever since).
The Long Tail is a statistical concept that says that items that are in com-
paratively low demand can nonetheless add up to quite large volumes. For 
example, a large bookstore sells dozens of books from the bestseller lists 
every day. These popular titles make up only about 20 percent of the store’s 
inventory, yet their sales amount to more than half of the bookstore’s total 
revenue. The slower, incremental sales of the remaining 80 percent of the 
store’s inventory typically generate about 20% or more of the store’s rev-
enue. Individually, no one book sells a large number of copies, but added 
together, the revenue is substantial.
You can apply the Long Tail concept when you’re choosing keywords for 
your Web site. The graph in Figure 5-1 represents different keywords (across 
the horizontal axis) and the quantity of searches, or traffic, that each key-
word generates (up the vertical axis). The keywords that have high potential 
traffic appear at the left end of the graph, followed by keywords that are less 
frequently searched. Notice how the potential traffic drops off in a Long Tail 
as you move to the right.

Don’t ignore the long-tail traffic. In our bookstore example, this would be the 
equivalent of emptying all of the shelves except for the bestsellers’ table — 
and cutting revenue substantially.
Think about focusing your keywords for your target audience. You want 
to use some specialized phrases in your keywords to attract long-tail traf-
fic. A specialized keyword phrase might be three, four, five, or more words 
in length. A person coming to your Web site after searching for [compact 
rechargeable cordless widgets] would be more likely to purchase the item 
on your site than a person who had just searched for [widgets]. You might 
not have very many searches for that phrase, but the few who did search for 
it saw your listing (because it moved way up in the search engine results) 
and became conversions.

Chapter 6: Spam Issues: When 
Search Engines Get Fooled
In This Chapter
✓ Finding out about the different types of search engine spam
✓ Understanding the consequences of using spam
✓ Being wary of guaranteed results and other false promises
I
n this chapter, you find out about techniques used to fool or trick the search 
engines into delivering a higher listing on the results page, which we call 
spam. We go over some of the more popular methods that have been used, and 
then we delve into the guidelines search engines use to define what they con-
sider spam, as well as our Search Engine Optimization (SEO) code of ethics.
Understanding What Spam Is
When you normally think of Spam, the first thing that comes to mind is 
either the canned meat product or the junk e-mail that’s clogging up your 
inbox. (Or the Monty Python skit . . . “Spam, spam, spam, spam” . . . ahem.) 
When we here in SEO-land talk about spam, however, we mean something a 
little different than meat by-products, unwanted e-mails, or British comedy 
troupes. Search engine Spam (also sometimes known as spamdexing) is any 
tactic or Web page that is used to deceive the search engine into a false 
understanding of what the whole Web site is about or its importance. It can 
be external or internal; it may violate the search engines policies directly, 
or it may be a little bit sneakier about its misdirection. How spam is defined 
depends on the intent and extent. What is the intent of the tactic being used, 
and to what extent is it being used?
If you stuff all of your metadata (text added into the HTML of a page describ-
ing it for the search engine) full of keywords (words or phrases relating 
to your site content that search engines use to determine whether it’s 
relevant) with the sole intent of tricking the search engine so that you will 
receive a higher page rank on the results page, that’s spam. Also, if you 
do that all over your Web site, with your Alt attribute text (text used to 
describe an image for the search engine to read), your links, and keywords 
all over the site, trying to trick the search engine spider (the little programs 
that search engines use to read and rank Web sites) into giving you the high-
est rank possible, it’s a little harder to claim to the search engine that it was 
simply an accident and it was done out of ignorance.

76
Discorvering the Types of Spam
Most technologies that are used in the creation, rendering, and design of 
Web sites can be used to trick the search engines. When this happens, or is 
even so much as perceived to happen, it’s considered spam. Search engine 
companies do not like spam. Spam damages the reputation of the search 
engine. They’re working their hardest to bring you the most relevant results 
possible, and spam-filled pages are not what they want to give you. A user 
might not use the search engine again if they get spammy results, for start-
ers. So if someone’s caught spamming, their site could be penalized or 
removed entirely from the search engine’s index, (the list of Web sites that 
the search engine pulls from to recreate its results pages).
You can report spam if you run across it by contacting the search engines:

✦ Yahoo!: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/spam_
abuse.html
 
✦ Microsoft Live Search: http://feedback.search.msn.com
 
✦ Ask: information@ask.com
Discovering the Types of Spam
In this section, we talk a little about what types of spam there are in SEO-
land, and what not to do, in order to keep your site from getting penalized or 
even pulled out of the engines by accident.
Spam is any attempt to deceive the search engines into ranking a page when 
it does not deserve to be ranked. Note that in this section we describe spam 
that is known to be detected and punished by the search engines.
 
Do not attempt any of the discussed methods as they will result in your site 
being branded as a spammer. This chapter is not meant to cover every type 
of spam out there on the Web: just to give you the knowledge you need to 
recognize when a tactic might be venturing down the wrong path. Spammers 
use other advanced techniques that may also be detectable by the search 
engines so avoid any attempt to deceive the search engines.
Hidden text/links
One of the more obvious ways to spam a Web site is inserting hidden text and 
links in the content of the Web page (content of a Web site being anything that 
the user can see). All text has to be visible to the user on the Web site. Hidden 
content can be defined as text that appears within the rendered HTML code 
that is not visible on the page to the user without requiring user-interaction 

Book I
Chapter 6
Spam Issues: When 
Search Engines Get 
Fooled
77
Discorvering the Types of Spam
in order to see it. Hidden text can simply be a long list of keywords, and the 
hidden links increase the Web site’s popularity. Examples of using hidden text 
and links are
 
✦ White text/links on a white background: Putting white text and links 
on a white background renders it invisible to the user unless the text is 
highlighted by right-clicking on the mouse. Spammers can then insert 
keywords or hyperlinks that the spiders read and count as relevant.
 
✦ Text, links, or content that is hidden by covering with a layer so it is 
not visible: This is a trick that people use with CSS. They hide spider-
able content under the page that can’t be seen with the naked eye or by 
highlighting the page.
 
✦ Positioning content off the page’s view with CSS: Another program-
ming trick spammers use.
 
✦ Links that are not clickable by the user: Creating a link that only has a 
single one by one pixel as its anchor or using the period on a sentence 
or no anchor at all. There’s nothing for a user to click on but the engine 
can still follow the link.
Using invisible or hidden text is a surefire way to get your site banned so it 
no longer shows up in the engines. The reasoning behind this is that you 
would want all of your content visible to the user, and any hidden text is 
being used for nefarious purposes.
Figure 6-1 shows what we mean by hidden text on a background. Usually, 
you’ll find this as white text on a white background, but it could be any color 
so long as it’s not visible to a user (black on black, gray on gray, and so on.) 
This is spam, and will get your site banned.
Doorway pages
A doorway page is a Web page submitted to search engine spiders that has 
been designed to satisfy the specific algorithms for various search engines, 
but is not intended to be viewed by visitors. Basically they do not earn the 
rankings but instead deceive the search engines into rankings by design and 
keyword stuffing tricks that you’d never want to put on a page for a user to 
see. Doorway pages are there to spam the search engine index (the database 
of information from which search engines draw their primary results) by 
cramming it full of relevant keywords and phrases so that it appears high 
on the results page for a particular keyword, but when the user clicks on it, 
they are automatically redirected to another site or page within the same 
site that doesn’t rank on its own.

78
Discorvering the Types of Spam

background.
 
Hidden text
Doorway pages are only there for the purpose of being indexed and there is 
no intention to have anyone use it. Sometimes more sophisticated spammers 
build a doorway page with viewable, relevant content in order to avoid being 
caught by the search engine, but most of the time, a doorway page is made 
to be viewed only by a spider. Doorway pages are often used in tandem with 
deceptive misdirection, which we discuss a couple of sections later.
Deceptive redirection
Has this ever happened to you? You do a search for a cartoon you used 
to love as a kid, and you click on one of the links on the results page. But 
instead of the page you were expecting, you get an entirely different Web 
site, with some very questionable content. What just happened here? Behold 
the headache that is deceptive redirection. Deceptive redirection is a type of 
coded command that redirects the user to a different location than what was 
expected via the link that was clicked upon.
Spammers create shadow page/domains that have content that ranks for a 
particular search query (the words or phrase you type into the search box), 
yet when you attempt to access the content on the domain you are then 
redirected to an often shady site that is commonly for porn, gambling, or 
drugs, that has nothing to do with your original query.
The most common perpetrators of deceptive redirects are also a spam 
method: doorway pages. Most doorway pages redirect through a Meta 
refresh command (a method of instructing a Web browser to automatically 
refresh the current Web page after a given time interval). Search engines are 
now issuing penalties for using meta refresh commands, other sites will trick 

Book I
Chapter 6

79
Discorvering the Types of Spam
you into clicking a link or using JavaScript (another computer programming 
language) to redirect you. Google now considers any Web site that uses a 
meta refresh or any other sneaky redirect (such as through JavaScript) to 
be spam.
Not all redirects are evil. The intent of the redirect has to be determined 
before a spam determination can be made. If the page that is redirected to is 
nothing like the page expected, then it is probably spam. If you get exactly 
what you expect after a redirect, then it probably isn’t spam. We discuss a 
lot more about redirects in Book VII, Chapter 3.
Cloaking
Another nefarious form of spam is a method called cloaking. Cloaking is a 
technique in which the content presented to the search engine spider is dif-
ferent than that presented to the users’ browser, meaning that the spiders 
see one page, while you see something entirely different. Spammers can do 
this by delivering content based on the IP addresses (information used to tell 
where your computer or server is located) or the User-Agent HTTP header 
(information describing whether you’re a person or a search engine robot) 
of the user requesting the page. When a user is identified as a search engine 
spider, a server-side script delivers a different version of the Web page, one 
that contains content different than the visible page. The purpose of cloak-
ing is to deceive search engines so they display the page when it would not 
otherwise be displayed. 
Like redirects, cloaking is a matter of intent rather than always being evil. 
There are many appropriate uses for this technique. News sites use cloaking 
to allow search engines to spider their content while users are presented 
with a registration page. Site selling alcohol require users to verify their age 
before allowing them to view the rest of the content, while search engines 
pass unchallenged.
Unrelated keywords
Unrelated keywords are a form of spam that involves using a keyword that 
is not related to the image, video, or other content that it is supposed to be 
describing in the hopes of driving up traffic. Examples include putting unre-
lated keywords into the Alt attribute text of an image, placing them in the 
metadata of a video, or in the Meta tags of a page, and any time an unrelated 
keyword is used. Not only is it useless, but it also gets your site pulled if you 
try it.
Keyword stuffing
Keyword stuffing occurs when people overuse keywords on a page in the 
hopes of making the page seem more relevant for a term through a higher 
keyword frequency or density. Keyword stuffing can happen in the metadata,

Avioding Being Evil: Ethical Search Marketing
Alt attribute text, and within the content of the page itself. Basically, going 
to your Alt attribute text and typing porsche porsche porsche porsche over 
and over again is not going to increase your ranking, and the page will likely 
be yanked due to spam.
 
There’s also a much sneakier method of using keyword stuffing, using hidden 
text in the page, or hiding large groups of repeated keywords on the page 
(usually at the bottom far below the view of the average visitor) or using 
HTML commands that cause blocks of text to be hidden from user sight.
Link farms
You might envision a “link farm” as a pastoral retreat where docile links 
graze in rolling green pastures, but alas, you would be wrong. A link farm 
is any group of Web sites that hyperlink (a link to another part of the Web 
site) to all the other sites in the group. Remember how Google loves links 
and hyperlinks and uses them in their algorithm to figure out a Web site’s 
popularity? Most link farms are created through automated programs and 
services. Search engines have combated link farms by identifying specific 
attributes that link farms use and filtering them from the index and search 
results, including removing entire domains to keep them from influencing 
the results page.
 
Not all link exchange programs are considered spam, however. Link 
exchange programs that allow individual Web sites to selectively exchange 
links with other relevant Web sites are not considered spam. The difference 
between these and link farms is the fact that the Web site is selecting rel-
evant links to its content, rather than just getting as many links as it can get 
to itself.
Avoiding Being Evil: Ethical Search Marketing
We didn’t spend this chapter describing spam just so that unscrupulous 
users could run out and use it. Sure, the spam might bump their page rank 
for a little while, but they will be caught, and their site will be pulled from 
the index. So why use it?
For too long, many SEO practitioners were involved in an arms race of sorts, 
inventing technology and techniques in order to achieve the best rankings 
and get the most clients. Unfortunately, some developed more and more 
devious technology to trick the search engines and beat the competition. 
Thus we have two types of techniques used in SEO:
 
✦ White hat: This is all SEO techniques that fall into the ethical realm. 
White hat techniques involve using relevant keywords, Alt attribute 
text, simple and clear metadata, and so on. White hat techniques clearly 
comply with the published intent of the various search engine quality 
guidelines.

Book I
Chapter 6
Spam Issues: When 
Search Engines Get 
Fooled
81
Realizing That There Are No Promises or Guarantees
 
✦ Black hat: These are the SEO techniques we’ve spent describing in this 
chapter (among others that we haven’t covered.) Black hat techniques 
are sneaky, devious, and attempt to game the engines to promote con-
tent not relevant to the user. These techniques are deceptive and gener-
ally break (or at least stretch) the search guidelines, commonly leading 
to spam penalties that are painful at best and devastating at worst.
 
With the search engines implementing aggressive anti-spam programs, 
the news is out: If you want to get rankings, you have to play well within 
the rules. And those rules are absolutely “No deception or tricks allowed.” 
Simply put, honest relevancy wins at the end of the day. All other 
approaches fade away.
Generally, the search engines all adhere to a code of conduct. Little things 
do vary from search engine to search engine, but the general principle is 
the same:
 
✦ Keywords should be relevant, applicable, and clearly associated with 
page body content.
 
✦ Keywords should be used as allowed and accepted by the search 
engines (placement, color, and so on).
 
✦ Keywords should not be utilized too many times on a page (frequency, 
density, distribution, and so on). The use should be natural for the 
subject.
 
✦ Redirection technology (if used) should facilitate and improve the user 
experience. But understand that this is almost always considered a trick 
and is frequently a cause for removal from an index.
 
✦ Redirection technology (if used) should always display a page where the 
body content contains the appropriate keywords (no bait and switch).
You can get back into a search engine’s good graces after getting caught 
spamming and yanked out of the index. It involves going through your page 
and cleaning it up, removing all of the spam issues that caused it to get 
yanked in the first place, and re-submitting your page for placement into the 
index. Don’t expect an immediate resubmission, though. You have to wait in 
line with everyone else.
Realizing That There Are No Promises or Guarantees
Say that you know that you won’t use spam in order to increase your page 
ranking in the search engines. You understand that it’s unethical and is more 
trouble than it’s worth. But at the same time, you need to increase your page 
rank. The simple solution is to hire an SEO organization to do the optimiz-
ing for you. But beware: Although you might not use spam, there’s a chance 
than an unscrupulous SEO will.

82
Following the SEO Code of Ethics
A code of ethics applies to people in the search engine optimization indus-
try. Beware of those who promise or guarantee results to their clients, or 
allege a special relationship with a search engine or advertise the ability 
to get priority consideration when they submit. People who do so are usu-
ally lying. Remember, there is no way to pay your way into the top of the 
search results page. Yahoo! does have a program called Search Submit Pro 
where, for a fee, you can submit your page and be guaranteed that you’ll be 
spidered frequently, but they do not guarantee rankings, and they are the 
only large engine with this sort of program (see Book I, Chapter 2 for more 
details). Also avoid those that promise link popularity schemes, or to submit 
your site to thousands of search engines. These do not increase your rank-
ing, and even if they do, it’s not in a way that would be considered positive 
and the benefits, if any, are usually short-lived.
Unfortunately, you are responsible for the actions of any company you hire. 
If an SEO creates a Web page for you using black hat tactics, you are respon-
sible and your site could be pulled entirely from the search engine’s index. 
If you’re not sure that what your SEO is doing, ask for clarification. And 
remember, like in all things, caveat emptor. Buyer beware.
Following the SEO Code of Ethics
The discussion of any SEO Code of Ethics is like a discussion on politics or 
religion: There are more than two sides, all sides are strongly opinionated, 
and seldom do they choose the same path to the same end. Most Search 
Engine Optimization (SEO) practitioners understand these ethics, but not 
all practitioners practice safe-SEO. Too many SEO practitioners claim a bias 
towards surfers, or the search engines, or their clients (all are appropri-
ate in the correct balance), and it is common for the SEO pros to use the 
“Whatever it takes” excuse to bend some of the ethical rules to fit their 
needs. This does not pass judgment; it simply states the obvious.
Although the industry as a whole has not adopted an official code of ethics, 
the authors of this book have drafted a specific code that we pledge to 
adhere to with respect to our clients. We have paraphrased this code here 
but you can read the original at http://www.bruceclay.com/web_
ethics.htm
 
✦ Do not intentionally do harm to a client. Be honest with the client and 
do not willfully use technologies and methods that are known to cause a 
Web site’s removal from a search engine index.
 
✦ Do not intentionally violate any specifically published and enforced 
rules of search engines or directories. This also means keeping track 
of when policies change and checking with the search engine if you’re 
unsure of whether the method or technology is acceptable.

Book I
Chapter 6
Spam Issues: When 
Search Engines Get

83
Following the SEO Code of Ethics
 
✦ Protect the user visiting the site. The content must not mislead, no 
“bait and switch” tactics (where the content does not match the search 
phrase) are used, and the content is not offensive to the targeted visitors.
 
✦ Do not use the continued violation of copyright, trademark, service-
mark, or laws related to spamming as they may exist at the state, fed-
eral, or international level.
 
✦ All pages presented to the search engine must match the visible content 
of the page.
 
✦ Don’t steal other people’s work and present it as your own.
 
✦ Don’t present false qualifications or deliberately lie about your skills. 
Also, don’t make guarantees or claim special relationships with the 
search engine.
 
✦ Treat all clients equally and don’t play favorites.
 
✦ Don’t make false promises or guarantees. There is no such thing as a 
guaranteed method of reaching the top of the results page.
 
✦ Always offer ways for your clients to settle internal and external dis-
putes. There will be competition among your clients. Make sure there’s a 
way to mediate conflict if it ever comes up.
 
✦ Protect the confidentiality and anonymity of your clients with regard to 
privileged information and supplying testimonials.
 
✦ Work to the best of your ability to honestly increase and retain the rank-
ings of your client sites.
In a nutshell? Don’t be evil. Spammers never win and winners never spam. 
What works in the short term won’t work forever, and living in fear of getting 
caught is no way to run a business.

Research Techniques and Tools
In This Chapter
✓ Discovering your site theme
✓ Brainstorming for keywords
✓ Creating a keyword-based outline
✓ Choosing related keywords
✓ Researching keywords by niche
✓ Evaluating keywords
I
n this chapter, we talk about picking and choosing your keywords. This 
is an extremely important step. You might say the mantra of search 
engines should be “keywords, keywords, keywords.” Search engine spiders 
(the bots that go through your page gathering Web page data) are looking 
for keywords that match or closely relate to the search query. A keyword is 
a specific word or phrase a search engine looks for in its index (the list of 
Web sites it looks at during a search), based on what the user typed as the 
search query. For example, cars is a keyword.
It seems simple enough: just figure out a couple of great keywords and go! 
Unfortunately, there’s more to picking keywords than that. Say you’ve got 
a Web site that specializes in selling custom-made classic automobiles. But 
the site isn’t receiving the traffic (number of visitors) it should. Here’s a tip: 
Think about what kind of keywords you used in your Web site. You might be 
using general words like [automobiles] and [vehicles], but how many people 
actually type in a search query of [classic automobiles]? Nine times out of 
ten people are going to be looking for [classic cars]. Little distinctions like 
this can make a big difference in the traffic you’re receiving.
In this chapter, we talk about how to pick good, solid, relevant keywords. 
You discover that one of the first things you must do is to identify the theme 
of your Web site. Secondly, you sit down and brainstorm all the keywords 
you think fit your theme. And we’re not talking five or ten keywords here: 
We’re talking dozens or hundreds or thousands. Then we talk about creat-
ing a good outline for those keywords and researching your market to find 
out what the competition is doing and what your potential customers are 
searching for. We also discuss culling unproductive keywords so you can 
focus on the most relevant ones.

Discovering Your Site Theme
 
Remember, relevancy = higher ranking = more traffic for you.
Discovering Your Site Theme
The first thing you need to figure out is your Web site’s theme. The theme is 
the main thing that your site is about. It’s the central concept of whatever 
your site is doing on the Web. Again, it seems simple enough, but it’s very 
important to know exactly what it is that you’re about. If you are a Web site 
that specializes in selling customized classic cars, you need to figure exactly 
what that means, narrowing down the kinds of cars you consider to be clas-
sic, the types of customization you do, and so forth. Also consider where it 
is that you’ll be going with this Web site. Think about whether you only want 
to handle classic cars, or if you might also want to broaden your scope and 
include newer models. Be thinking about whether there’s a broad enough 
market out there for customized classic cars, decide whether you might 
include both domestic and foreign cars, newer cars, and so on.
You also need to think about your service area. Are you a local-only busi-
ness, or could you take things to a national or international level? Try to 
break it down in very specific terms.
 
Write down the things that you feel your Web site is about, and all of the 
things that you are not about. So, if you’re creating a site about customized 
classic cars, you would write things like
 
✦ We work on only classic cars built from 1950–1970
 
✦ The cars we work on are American-made; no foreign vehicles
 
✦ Customization means we do paint, chrome, and upholstery
 
✦ We do engine work or can install an entirely new engine if necessary
 
✦ We do not install “banging” stereos; that’s the guy down the road
 
✦ We are a local business, but are willing to accept clients from out-of-
town and out-of-state.
Brainstorming for keywords
After your theme is clear in your mind and you’ve clarified what your 
business is really about, you have a good starting point for your keyword 
brainstorming sessions.

Discovering Your Site Theme
Brainstorming is an appropriate first step for choosing good keywords. At 
this point, there are no bad keywords; you just want to compile a big list of 
possibilities. Here are some possible viewpoints to consider and questions 
you can ask yourself:
 
✦ Natural language: What would I search for to try to find my product?
 
✦ Other perspectives: What would someone else call what I have to sell?
 
✦ Customer mindset: How do “normal” people talk about the products or 
services I offer?
 
✦ Industry jargon: What do the “experts” call my products or services?
Write down whatever you think would be the major keywords you will be 
using. Ask your friends, ask your relatives, ask your associates, ask your 
employees and coworkers. It’s a matter of throwing things at the wall to see 
what sticks and what doesn’t. Figure 1-1 shows a simple mind map. Tools 
like this can help you come up with new topics and concepts that might 
relate to your site.

Building a subject outline
After you have a large list of keywords that you might want to use, your next 
step is to create an outline using those keywords. Start with the broadest 
ones at the top level and break the list into categories and subcategories, 
getting more specific as you go deeper.

A keyword outline for our customized classic cars Web site could look 
something like this list. Notice how the keywords build on each other as you 
delve deeper into the subject:

You can see how the breakdown goes from very broad terms to more 
specific terms. These all represent things that people might search for when 
they are looking up classic cars, or customization, or both, and can all be 
used as keywords. This is a very small, simple outline. You can go into even 
more breakdowns and come up with even more specific keywords as 
appropriate for your site.
 
Remember to list as many keywords that relate to your theme as you can. 
The broader base you have to work with, the better chances you have of 
identifying good, solid, relevant keywords.

Discovering Your Site Theme
Choosing theme-related keywords
Now, take your nice, long list of hundreds of potential keywords and go 
through and match them to your theme. Figure out whether you will be 
doing custom work for a Ford Anglia as opposed to Ford Mustangs, and 
whether you want to include Dodge at all. Also start thinking about keyword 
phrases, like [Ford Mustang convertible] or [1960s Ford Mustang hardtops]. 
Qualifiers such as convertible or 1960s thrown in at the beginning and end of 
a main keyword turn it into a keyword phrase, and they help you figure out 
how narrow you want the search to be. This is especially important if you 
have a local business because you want to rank for the local search query, 
such as [Poughkeepsie classic car customization]. When you feel like you 
have some good usable keywords, drag out your thesaurus and look up syn-
onyms for those words. Anything that relates to your keyword or has the 
same meaning is another good keyword.
Don’t forget to use the search engines to discover synonyms. As shown in 
Figure 1-2, the tilde character (~) before any word in a query triggers a syn-
onym search in Google. In the query [~classic cars], classic is the word that 
we’re looking for synonyms for. In the search engine results pages (SERPs), 
words like antique and muscle are bolded in addition to the searched words 
classic and cars.

Doing Your Industry and Competitor Research
Doing Your Industry and Competitor Research
Now it’s time to check out the competition. With any business, it’s an impor-
tant step in feeling out the market. With industry research, you need to know 
what keyword your competitors are using in their content and what kind 
of traffic they’re getting. One of the easiest ways is to look them up on the 
search engines. Use the keywords you came up with during your brainstorm-
ing session and plug them into the query window. Google bolds your search 
terms in the search results, so pay attention to those words and the text sur-
rounding them. Google also provides you with disambiguation options when 
appropriate, as in a “Did you mean ___?” phrase. In Figure 1-3, the search 
for [classic car customization] returns 115,000 results. The top ten results 
returned are worth mining for keyword ideas.

Check out the highest listings and make note of the keywords they use on 
their pages. The guys who have the highest rank are your competition for 
those keywords, and to have such a high listing on the search engine, they’re 
obviously doing something right. For a really in-depth look at how to do 
research on your competition, check out Book III.

93
Checking Out Seasonal Keyword Trends
After you’ve identified who your competitors are, it’s time to do some 
research. Look at any print materials they’ve put out, along with what’s 
on their Web site. Pay attention to how they market themselves, and what 
words they use to describe themselves. This is important especially if you’re 
looking to draw industry traffic to yourself or obtain links from other indus-
try sites. Look at their site’s navigation, check out their metadata, and read 
their content and press.
Researching Client Niche Keywords
After you know what keywords your competition is using, it’s time to start 
thinking about what your targeted visitors are using to search for your 
product or services. The language the industry uses and the language the 
customer uses are often two entirely different things. For example, people 
in the auto industry use the words auto or vehicle, but the guy on the street 
is not going to refer to his Ford as his auto: He’s going to call it his car. The 
same goes for search queries. Most people are not looking for [classic auto-
mobiles]; they’re going to be looking for [classic cars]. 
You can find out what the man on the street is saying by actually going to 
the man on the street. Check out Internet forums, interest groups, and news-
groups that relate to your business and make note of what people are writing 
in their posts. What words do they use when referring to your type of busi-
ness or the product that you sell? Those can be used as keywords. Talk to 
your clients. Communication is key to figuring out what they’re looking for.
Also, pay attention when people call your business and ask questions. Those 
are the kinds of questions that people are asking the search engine. One 
person’s slightly questionable phrasing can be another person’s usable 
keyword.
Checking Out Seasonal Keyword Trends
Some keywords retain their popularity and relevance throughout the year, 
like [Ford Mustang] or [California]. Others see rises and spikes throughout 
the year due to seasonal trends. Holidays are a good example. More people 
buy Christmas tree ornaments in December than in July, and the majority of 
costume sales happen before Halloween. The same is true of the actual sea-
sons themselves because people look for things at certain times of the year. 
More people look for bathing suits in the months before summer and for 
snowboards in the winter (see Figure 1-4).

94
Checking Out Seasonal Keyword Trends

You can use tools provided by the search engines to see keyword spikes and 
trends. End of the year reports such as Yahoo!’s Top Trends report, 
http://buzzlog.buzz.yahoo.com/toptrends2007/, and Google 
Zeitgeist, www.google.com/intl/en/press/zeitgeist2007/, along 
with Google Trends, www.google.com/trends, which measures how often 
a keyword is used during a given day, providing the most popular examples 
and measuring when the spikes happen.
You may find it important to note spikes and trends in your keywords: While 
certain things immediately come to mind during a given holiday (for exam-
ple, flowers and chocolate for Valentine’s Day), other keywords and keyword 
phrases that are much more loosely connected might spike during that time 
period as well. Around February 14th, you might notice a rise in searches for 
engagement rings, vacation listings for second honeymoons, and wedding-
related searches. Restaurant searches and hotel listings also probably spike, 
along with clothing, shoes, and jewelry. As you saw when you did keyword 
brainstorming, one broad high-traffic term can be broken down into smaller 
traffic, specific terms. These more specific terms are every bit as relevant 
as the broad term, and they generally have less competition. Remember the 
Long Tail when considering possible keywords.

Evaluating Keyword Research
Seasonal keywords are important to keep track of because you can use them 
to tailor your site to draw in that seasonal traffic. Many stores receive the 
bulk of their revenue from seasonal purchases, so it’s a good thing to keep in 
mind when building your Web site.
Evaluating Keyword Research
After you’ve done your research and your brainstorming, you hopefully 
have acquired a good long list of keywords that can be used. Now it’s time to 
figure out which ones you’ll actually be using.
In figuring out how often your keywords are searched for, you can use a 
variety of tools for keyword evaluation. Using some of these tools, you can 
monitor how often a certain keyword is searched, what the click-through 
rates are, and whether it would be a good, usable keyword to keep. Some 
tools you have to pay for, but there are free ones out there. A couple of 
examples:
 
✦ Google AdWords: Google has its own keyword tracker, shown in Figure 
1-5. You used to have to be a member of Google AdWords to access the 
keyword tracking tool, but now it’s a free service located at https://
adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal. (Yahoo and 
Microsoft both have keyword tools as well.)
 
✦ Search Engine Optimization/KSP: Bruce Clay, Inc. provides a free 
keyword tool at www.bruceclay.com/web_rank.htm#seoksp. 
Simply type your keywords into the Keyword Activity search box. You’ll 
get keyword counts, plus demographic information.
The following services are paid services, so you have to cough up a little bit 
of cash for them. They actually do research and check out your competi-
tion for you, so they might be something you want to invest in. That doesn’t 
mean you get out of doing the brainstorming and researching yourself; they 
just make it easier.
 
✦ SEOToolSet: In addition to the free tools offered by Bruce Clay, Inc, you 
can also subscribe to a full suite of fully integrated SEO tools. Far more 
robust than the free versions, the SEOToolSet is available for $39.95 a 
month.
 
✦ Wordtracker: A keyword tracking service that you have to pay for, but 
they do offer free trials. Theirs is an annual subscription of $369 US a 
year (www.wordtracker.com/).
 
✦ Keyword Discovery: Made by Trellian, this is another paid keyword 
tracking tool. You can subscribe for $49.95 a month at (www.keyword
discovery.com/).

You need to cull the least relevant keywords off the list right away. If your 
business is customizing only American cars as opposed to foreign ones, you 
can do away with words like [foreign], [Anglia], and [Volkswagen]. Don’t 
worry: You’ve still got a pretty big list to choose from. You’re just narrow-
ing the focus a bit. When you’re clipping out keywords, remember that 
keywords that are supportive of a strong branding exercise, that result in 
sales more often than other keywords, or that have very high profit margins 
should all be retained.
Using the tools and brainstorming methods we describe in this chapter, you 
can come up with a pretty sizable list of keywords. Also using the keyword 
tracking tools, you can also get rid of a bunch of irrelevant, low-traffic 
keywords right away and pick a good list to focus on. Remember, you’re 
not looking for five or ten keywords: You’re looking for hundreds of good 
keywords, depending on the size of your site.
Although it might seem like a good idea to concentrate on the broadest, 
most general keywords out there, it’s actually not. What you want are 
keywords that give you conversion. A keyword that brings 60 visitors to 
your site, 10 of whom make a purchase, is much more desirable than a 
generic keyword that brings in thousands of visitors who only come in, 
blink, and then hit Back on their browser. Statisticians attribute this to the 
fact that people use generic keywords when gathering information, and more 
specific keywords when they’re ready to open their wallets. We explain this 
phenomenon more in the next chapter of this minibook.

I
n this chapter, we take that nice long list of keywords you put together in 
the previous chapter and actually go through and select the best of the 
bunch. (If you haven’t yet put together such a list, what are you waiting for? 
Go back and do it now!) In this chapter, you discover what makes a good 
keyword phrase, especially in terms of a search query (the words you type 
into the search engine window). You also discover the deal with subject cat-
egories and how they help you when choosing your keywords. Also, we talk 
about high traffic keywords and high conversion keywords, and what the 
difference between the two is.
Selecting the Proper Keyword Phrases
When you’re doing a search, you must have the proper phrase to use as a 
search query. Just like a keyword is a single word used as a search query, a 
keyword phrase is two or more words typed as a search query. For example, 
[Poughkeepsie classic car customization] is a good example of a keyword 
phrase.
Search engine users find what they are looking for by searching for specific 
keywords or keyword phrases and choosing the most relevant result. You 
want your site to have as many opportunities to be included in those search 
results as possible. In other words, you should try to use every keyword 
phrase that you think someone might search for in order to find your site.
Usually when people do a search, they type in a keyword phrase instead of 
just a single keyword. Fifty-eight percent of search queries are three words 
or longer. So having keyword phrases on your site increases your chance 
of appearing higher on the page rank (because more keywords match the 
search query). The click-through rate (how many people click your listing 
to go to your site) also increases, due to more words matching the search 

98
Selecting the Proper Keyword Phrases
query. Your conversion rate (how many visitors actually purchase some-
thing, sign up, or take whatever action is appropriate on your site) also 
increases because you’re more likely to have what the user is looking for.
Search engine users are becoming more savvy as time goes on, and they 
have learned that a single keyword is probably going to be too broad of 
a search to return the results they’re looking for. A good example is what 
happens when you do a search for [security]. You might be in need of a 
security guard service, but doing a quick search on Google with the keyword 
[security] gives you results as varied as the Wikipedia article on security, 
the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, 
and many listings for computer security software. Using the keyword 
phrase [security guard service Poughkeepsie], on the other hand, turns 
up map results listing local businesses, two local business sites for hiring 
security guards, and a couple of news articles about security services in 
Poughkeepsie.
 
You can see why it’s a good idea to have proper keyword phrases, and 
not just single keywords, on your Web pages. Your keyword phrase 
[Poughkeepsie classic car customization] could be used as a heading for 
your paragraphs, placed in the Heading tags (HTML tags used for para-
graph headings) or as the title of your Web page (using the Title tag in the 
HTML code).
It is best to use simple, everyday language that searchers are likely to type 
in. As a general rule, we recommend including multiple uses of each keyword 
phrase, enough to be prominent on the page without forcing your keywords 
into your content. You want it to mention each keyword a couple of times 
while making sure that it still sounds natural. Additionally, you should avoid 
using only general phrases; be sure to include detailed descriptive words as 
well. If your keywords are too general, they are likely to be up against too 
much competition from others targeting the same keywords. However, if 
your keywords are too specific, fewer people search for those terms, result-
ing in fewer potential visitors. It’s a balancing act, and the rules aren’t hard 
and fast. You need to find the right mix for your site by finding the keywords 
that bring traffic that actually converts — in other words, you want to put 
out the bait that brings in the right catch.
When putting keywords in the content of your site, make sure the words sur-
rounding them are also good, searchable keywords. For example
 
✦ Classic car customization in Poughkeepsie
 
✦ Reupholstery for classic Mustangs
 
✦ Chrome, wheels, and paint for classic automobiles
 
✦ New York State classic cars

Reinforcing versus Diluting Your Theme
These can all be used as headings for paragraphs or as links to their own 
pages. Remember, search engines also look for keywords in hypertext links 
(where clicking a word or phrase takes you to another page within the Web 
site) within the page, and using a search phrase within the hyperlink leads to 
a higher search rank for that phrase.
You should also still include stop words (very common words such as the, 
a, to, if, who, and so forth, which serve to connect ideas but don’t add much 
in the way of meaning to your content) in your search phrases. Google had 
removed stop words from its indexes for several years, but they now use them 
to perform much more precise searches. Plus, you don’t want your Web site 
text to sound like machine language — “Come shop Classic Cars customiza-
tion all your needs Poughkeepsie.” Instead, you want your Web site to sound 
like English: Your true readers are real people, after all. You also don’t want 
to give the search engines the impression that you’re keyword stuffing; they’re 
expecting natural-sounding text, which means full sentences.
Reinforcing versus Diluting Your Theme
Hopefully, you’ve already done your brainstorming and have a list of thou-
sands of keywords you can use for your Web site. Unfortunately, you probably 
can’t use all of those keywords, not unless you have a site that has hundreds 
or thousands of pages anyway. And even if you do, it’s best to reduce the list 
somewhat: There is such a thing as too many keywords. What you want are 
keywords that are going to enhance your site theme and not dilute it.
Imagine that your Web site is a jar full of black marbles. That’s a very 
focused theme with very focused keywords, so your site ranks high for 
searches for [black marbles]. Because you never talk about anything but 
black marbles, it’s inherently obvious to search engines and visitors that 
your site is an expert on black marbles. Imagine that the jar of black marbles 
in Figure 2-1 is your site.
Perhaps you also sell white marbles on your site. If you just add the marbles in, 
with no order or emphasis, it becomes harder to say that your site is focused 
on black marbles. You are starting to dilute your focus. The search engine still 
ranks it pretty high for [black marbles] because this theme is still very obvious. 
You might even rank for [white and black marbles], but your rank for [black 
marbles] might drop because your focus is now not explicitly clear. Figure 2-2 
shows how a mixed-up jar of marbles doesn’t seem to be about either black or 
white marbles in particular, although it’s still clearly about marbles.
Similarly, if you were to add gray marbles to the mix, you would further 
dilute the “theme” of the jar. The search engines might still rank you for 
[marbles], but your rankings for [black marbles], [white marbles], [gray 
marbles] would be much lower or be gone entirely. You aren’t about just 

100
Reinforcing versus Diluting Your Theme
black marbles anymore. The more colors that you add — blue, green, 
red, pink, tiger’s eye, clear, silver — the more diluted your theme of black 
marbles becomes. Figure 2-3 shows how adding more colors makes black 
marbles less of an obvious focus.

By picking a clear site theme (in this case, black marbles) and removing 
all of the other unnecessary marbles, you bump up your Web site’s search 
ranking because the search engine can clearly deduce that you are all 
about black marbles. (Note: You can rank well for lots of different themes

103
Reinforcing versus Diluting Your Theme
Keeping in mind that you want a clearly defined theme, take your nice, long 
list of keywords and choose the ones that represent your site’s theme the 
best. Say your site theme is Classic Car Customization. Keywords that you 
would definitely need to use would be classic, car, and customization. But 
don’t forget the industry standard words. When experts are looking to link to 
other resources, they use industry jargon to do their searches. This is why 
it’s important to research both your industry and the people on the street, 
so you can attract both kinds of traffic. It’s a good idea to include auto, auto-
mobile, and vehicle into your keywords because those are industry terms, 
even though users are more likely to search for [cars] than [automobiles].
 
Focusing only on keywords that are very broad, high traffic terms can lead 
to you not achieving a high ranking in the search engines and not getting 
good conversions from what traffic you do get. People tend to look for broad 
search terms only when they’re first doing information gathering, and use 
much more specialized terms or phrases when they’re getting ready to make 
a purchase. Broad search terms are good to have to bring people in, but 
make sure you also have much more specific keywords that go along with 
them as well.
Make sure that the specific keywords match your site theme and don’t dilute 
it. For example, going back to the classic car customization business in 
Poughkeepsie, tossing in keywords like Anglia, Ferrari, Italian, and so forth 
could actually do more harm than good because the business doesn’t deal 
with foreign cars. There’s a difference between drawing traffic for traffic’s 
sake and having people actually stay and visit your site. Unless your Web 
site makes money simply by the number of visitors (like sites that make their 
money from selling ads based on page views), you want to attract people 
who won’t immediately hit the Back button on their browser.
Here are some things to remember when you’re picking keywords:
 
✦ Clarity: Are they clear and concise?
 
✦ Relevance: Are they what you’re actually offering on your Web site? 
(False advertising is never a good idea.)
 
✦ Categorized: Can they be grouped into understandable keyword 
phrases?
 
✦ Audience appropriate: Are they a good mix of both industry standards 
and what your clients use in their searches?
 
✦ Targeted: Are they specific to your product? Three, four, even five word 
phrases are best.
Start weeding out what won’t work for you using the above criteria and 
taking into account the traffic and return on investment the keyword brings. 
This can be a pretty time-consuming process, but there are steps to take 
during the brainstorming process to make this as painless as possible.

104
Picking Keywords Based on Subject Categories
Picking Keywords Based on Subject Categories
Having a clear site theme, plus many relevant keywords, is a good start. But 
now you’re going to have to break it down into smaller categories in order 
to best organize your Web site and all those keywords you picked out. In 
Chapter 1 of Book II, we told you to make an outline of your list of keywords, 
grouping them into categories and subcategories.
The high-level terms represent broad keywords, and then they’re broken 
into longer, much more specific keywords as you go down the outline. Using 
this detailed outline, you can arrange your subject categories for your Web 
site. You want to have distinct subject categories because it helps you when 
siloing (or theming) your Web site. Having a Web site that has grouped or 
related keywords and links allows a search engine to return a faster result, 
which in turn equals a higher page ranking.
High traffic keywords
The next step you want to take with your keywords list is to determine 
which ones generate a high amount of traffic and which ones have a high 
conversion rate. High traffic keywords are the keywords that bring the most 
people to your site.
With a high traffic keyword, the goal is not only to bring people to your 
Web site, but also to keep them there. If your word brings in a lot of traf-
fic, but there’s also a high bounce rate (people who stay at the landing page 
only briefly, and then hit Back on the browser), you have a problem. A high 
bounce rate indicates one or more of the following issues:
 
✦ The keyword is not relevant for your Web page.
 
✦ The text on the Web page is not relevant enough to the keyword.
 
✦ The content or layout of the Web page doesn’t hold a user’s interest.
 
✦ The page loads too slowly and users lose patience and abandon the 
page before it fully renders.
In any case, you want to look closely at the page with the particular keyword 
in mind and make appropriate improvements. Keywords that have a high 
bounce rate do not yield many conversions, and therefore do not generate 
any revenue (unless you have a Web site where you make money based 
on page views alone). If anything, high bounce rate keywords can cost you 
money by requiring a lot of site hardware and bandwidth (the speed data 
moves to and from your Web site) to support all the extraneous traffic.
 
What we recommend to help you analyze your keywords is to use a spread-
sheet program like Microsoft Excel. Excel comes along with most Microsoft

have Excel. Microsoft Excel allows you to arrange and compare data in rows

and columns, similar to a paper ledger or accounts book. We’re going to talk 
about Microsoft Excel, but there are other spreadsheet programs out there 
like Google Docs and PlanMaker.
We suggest you copy your entire keyword list and paste it into column A of 
an Excel spreadsheet, so you end up with a simple list of keywords, one per 
row. Depending on how big your list is, you may want to create a new tab 
for each subject category, separating their keywords into more manageable 
spreadsheets. Setting up a keywords spreadsheet comes in handy when 
you’re keeping track of what keywords are working and which ones aren’t. 
(Not an Excel whiz? Check out Excel 2007 For Dummies, by Greg Harvey, and 
published by Wiley.)
Now you can use the remaining columns (B, C, and so on) to store data 
about each keyword. The first piece of data you need to find is an estimate 
of how many times people search for the keyword each day.
You can use free tools like Bruce Clay, Inc.’s Search Engine Optimization/KSP 
tool to measure daily search activity for specific keyword phrases on the 
Internet across the major search engines. It’s not just guesswork; you can 
see actual counts! 
The following tools are available online for checking search activity by key-
word (and many other search engine optimization-related tasks). We list 
them in no particular order, with the prices accurate as of this writing:
 
✦ Bruce Clay, Inc. offers a free keyword activity tool on its Web site. Use 
the Search Engine Optimization/KSP tool (www.bruceclay.com/web_
rank.htm#seoksp) to find search activity counts, category informa-
tion, and demographic data. The full toolset is also available for $39.95 
per month and features more robust versions of the free tools.
 
✦ Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com) is a paid tool that measures 
keyword traffic. Wordtracker offers both annual plans and monthly 
plans. The annual plan runs about $329 a year, and the monthly play 
costs $59 per month. They also offer a free trial version.
 
✦ Keyword Discovery (www.keyworddiscovery.com) offers a subscrip-
tion service that runs about $49.95 a month.
Keep in mind that the figures are only estimates and should be taken as gen-
eral guidelines. However, they give you a general indication of activity levels. 
For instance, if the keyword research tools say that keyword A supposedly 
has 20,000 searches a day and keyword B only 200, you can look at the num-
bers proportionally and trust that while the actual counts may vary, relatively 
speaking, keyword A is searched 100 times more frequently than keyword B.
On your spreadsheet, make column B Searches or Activity. Using one of the 
tools we mention above, enter your keywords and fill in the daily search 
activity count in column B for each keyword (shown in Figure 2-4). You 

106

may find it tedious to try out each keyword and copy the resulting activity 
number into your spreadsheet, but this data will be extremely useful for you 
in evaluating your keywords and improving your search engine optimization. 
You need benchmarks and figures, not just guesses, to make sure you’re 
optimizing your site for the right keywords.

High conversion keywords
You want to understand what keywords are going to result in buyers versus 
just window shoppers. It’s nice to get a lot of traffic, but it’s better to get 
conversions, and it’s best to have both ROI (return on investment) and high 
traffic. A high conversion keyword means you have a keyword that brings 
you a lot of sales, sign-ups, entrants, or whatever action your site considers 
a conversion. A high conversion keyword could be a high traffic keyword as 
well, but not necessarily so.
A low traffic keyword may be okay if it is also a high conversion keyword. 
For example, if you have a keyword that brings only ten visitors a year, but 
one of those visitors becomes a sale that equals half a million dollars, that’s 
a good keyword. You wouldn’t want to remove that keyword from your site 
for a minute! Sometimes these types of keywords are called elephant words — 
big words that are so laborious to type and so obscure in usage that only 
a very serious searcher would think of entering it in a query. One elephant 
word is mesothelioma, which is the type of cancer that results from asbestos 
poisoning. Law firms love mesothelioma as a keyword, because even though

it doesn’t bring them a huge amount of traffic, people searching for the term 
usually mean business, and even one legal case can generate a huge amount 
of revenue. On the other hand, if you optimize for a keyword that brings you 
a million visitors and only one conversion that isn’t worth much money, it’s 
time to consider dropping that keyword phrase unless that term is a brand-
ing term for you and you want to keep it for the name recognition.
Choosing keywords and optimizing for them requires a certain amount of 
guesswork, science, finesse, and practice. There are few hard and fast rules — 
for each item, you must weigh the pros and cons and make lots of decisions. 
Over time, you develop a feel for search engine optimization and it becomes 
easier. However, it’s extremely important to both track and test your key-
words as you go along with your Web site. This process is ongoing, so be 
patient and let yourself go through the learning curve. And remember that 
the kinds of tools and analytics you’ve begun to use in this chapter are an 
SEO’s best friend.

uying pay per click ads can be a useful part of your overall search 
engine optimization strategy. Pay per click (which are paid ads, show-
ing up under “sponsored links” on a search results page, that site owners 
have negotiated with the search engine to display when certain keywords 
are searched) can complement the work you’re doing to move your listing 
up in the organic results (the normal search results). And because it’s rela-
tively fast to set up pay per click ads, they can be an easy way to jumpstart 
your Web site’s performance in search results.
To buy a pay per click ad, you go to the chosen search engine’s paid search 
Web site (listed in Book I, Chapter 4 under “Paid Search Results”) and bid 
on a particular keyword phrase that you would like your ad to display for. 
From then on, the search engine tracks how many times people click your 
ad, and bills you monthly for the total clicks. Generally, the highest bidders 
are awarded the top positions on the search results (though with Google, 
some relevance factors do affect the order). For more information on buying 
pay per click ads, you could pick up a copy of Pay Per Click Search Engine 
Marketing for Dummies by Peter Kent (published by Wiley). In this chapter, 
you’ll learn why these ads are useful to your search engine optimization 
efforts and how to use them to build your brand and reduce your cost of 
conversion.

Analyzing Your Pay Per Click Campaigns 
for Clues About Your Site
You can use pay per click (PPC) ads to provide clues that help you optimize 
your Web site for organic results, such as:
 
✦ What keywords produce traffic (lots of visitors) to your site
 
✦ What keywords don’t produce traffic to your site
 
✦ What keywords bring the right kind of visitors to your site (i.e., ones 
that convert to customers)
 
✦ Some real traffic volume numbers from that search engine for a particular 
keyword
What’s nice about using PPC for this kind of research is that you can test ads 
scientifically. (Note: It’s difficult to set up scientific tests of keywords in the 
natural search rankings because the search engine’s methods are largely a 
secret, and their algorithms are constantly in flux.) With PPC, you can con-
trol which ads display for which keywords, and set up comparison tests. For 
example, you could test:
 
✦ Two different versions of an ad to see which wording draws more people
 
✦ An ad placed on two different keywords to find out which keyword is 
more effective
The various statistics and analytical tools offered by Google AdWords, 
Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Microsoft adCenter are a nice benefit to pur-
chasing paid ads through these search engines. The data you collect through 
them helps you refine your Web site’s theme(s) and keywords. In turn, this 
knowledge helps you to improve your site’s ranking in organic search results 
as well as paid results by targeting better keywords for your pages.
 
Keep in mind that pay per click campaigns require constant monitoring and 
revision. Bid prices can fluctuate, and you have to make adjustments based 
on the performance of your ads. Over time, you must change your listings, 
removing the under-performers and adding new ones. You want to identify 
keywords that are costing far more than the profits they generate and dis-
continue them, while keeping track of these lessons learned to apply them 
to your natural search engine optimization as well. For these reasons, it is 
important to use the search engines’ analytics tools mentioned previously 
to measure the effectiveness of your ads and to harvest data that helps you 
optimize your campaign.
Be aware that pay per click data does not necessarily represent how the 
same keywords would behave in natural search results; it only provides 
clues. However, it’s a start in the right direction. Organic search engine op

timization can take months of trial and error to produce results. By compari-
son, a pay per click campaign benefits you immediately with listings placed 
on the first page of search results, an increase in traffic, and some useful 
data. These benefits can help start your SEO efforts off quickly and give you 
some good indications of what might be the best keywords for your site.
Brand building
You want your company name to be seen and recognized in your industry 
without becoming generic — that’s branding. When you think Nike, you 
think of a lifestyle, not merely a pair of running shoes. When your company 
is branded, it becomes a search keyword all by itself. Successful branding 
associates you with your particular industry so tightly that you’re nearly 
synonymous. The key word here is nearly, of course. You don’t want to have 
your brand name become so watered down that you lose control of how 
people use it. For instance, when you sneeze, do you reach for a tissue or a 
Kleenex? When you need a paper copied, do you photocopy it or Xerox it? A 
recent brand struggling with this problem is Google. They’ve been fighting to 
remind people that you’re not “googling your blind date,” you’re “performing 
a search on your blind date using Google.” Walking that line is probably a 
long way down the road for most businesses, however.
You can build awareness of your brand instantly by purchasing pay per click 
ads. Every time your company name shows up visibly in search results for a 
particular search query, it helps to build your brand. If your business is sell-
ing classic custom cars, you can make your name appear on search results 
for [classic custom cars] simply by bidding for that keyword phrase with the 
search engines. Although it might take months of search engine optimization 
work to bring your listing up to the first page in the natural search results, 
pay per click gives you a way to increase your branding right away.
 
We usually recommend that clients buy ads for their own company names. 
You’d be amazed how many companies do not show up in natural search 
results even for searches on their own name. This is brand nonexistence, at 
least on the Web. If you want to generate brand awareness, taking out PPC 
ads on your branded terms is a quick fix that should be on your to-do list. 
And if your company already does rank well in the natural search results 
for your branded terms, including a PPC ad as well, only strengthens your 
branding. According to studies done by Microsoft, companies with the top 
organic spot and the top paid listing receive a greater brand lift than those 
appearing in either location alone.
When you’re building your brand name, make sure your brand goes first in 
the Title tags on your Web site. For example, a page on our company site 
could have a Title tag that looks like this:
<title>Bruce Clay Inc. - Search Engine Optimization 
Services</title>.

112
Analyzing Your Pay Per Cleck Campaigns for Clues About Your Site
 
When you put your brand name first, it shows up first in your search results 
listing (as well as at the top of the browser window when someone is on 
your Web site). This exposure helps to give your brand a sense of authority. 
Be aware, however, that this does sacrifice some relevancy in the mind of 
the user when searching on non-branded terms.
Identifying keywords with low click-through rates
Pay per click ads let you easily test different keywords for your ads. Ads 
should be written with good marketing copy that is highly relevant to the 
keyword phrase you’re bidding on. After you’ve accomplished that, you can 
find out which keywords yield the most click-throughs (people clicking the 
link) and conversions (people who not only visit your site, but also buy what 
you offer). You can conversely weed out those keywords that have low click-
through and low conversion rates.
After all, just being listed on a search results page is of little value if people 
don’t click through to your site. With pay per click ads, you can find out 
which search terms work best at generating the kind of traffic you need. 
Broad search terms such as cars are probably not a good place to put your 
ad money. First of all, these types of broad terms are heavily searched, 
which makes the bidding for them more competitive. The per-click cost for 
a broad term would be very high (measured by price per click times traf-
fic) and might not be worth it. Also, although cars is searched frequently, 
the click-through rate is very low. Even if someone does click your listing 
and visit your site, broad search queries tend to have low conversion rates 
because the people usually are just seeking general information and not 
ready to take action such as making a purchase.
 
As a best practice, bid on everything that has a positive ROI and test, test, 
test — always test . . . never stop.
What you want are keywords that specifically draw people to your site and 
result in conversions. Here are a few facts you can keep in mind:
 
✦ Approximately 58 percent of search queries contain at least three 
words.
 
✦ Short, one- or two-word search queries tend to be used for information 
gathering; those searches usually don’t convert well into customers.
 
✦ When users refine their search by using longer queries, they tend to be 
more seriously looking for a product or service.
 
✦ In general, users are getting more sophisticated and using more refined 
searches (that is, typing in longer search queries).

When choosing good keywords for your site, keep in mind the Long Tail 
effect we covered in Book I, Chapter 5. The Long Tail is a statistical concept 
that says that items that are in comparatively low demand can nonethe-
less add up to quite large volumes. The idea is that longer, more specific 
keyword phrases may not get a lot of traffic, but when people do search for 
them, the likelihood of click-through and conversion is quite high. Take our 
classic custom cars Web site example. A long-tail keyword phrase such as 
1965 Ford Mustang GT might make an excellent keyword phrase for a pay 
per click ad linked right to the Ford Mustang page on the Web site. Although 
the phrase might not get searched very often, someone typing in this search 
query would probably be a serious shopper — or at the very least, will find 
exactly what he’s looking for on your Web page.
You want to purchase long-tail keyword phrases for pay per click ads for 
several reasons:
 
✦ They are relatively cheap to buy because fewer sites bid on them.
 
✦ The bounce rate (percentage of people who click a listing but then bounce 
right back to the search results by clicking the Back button) tends to be 
low because your Web page closely relates to the search query.
 
✦ Fewer searches mean fewer clicks, so your costs remain low.
 
✦ The pay per click ads let you test different keyword phrases and find out 
what people search for that leads them to your site.
 
✦ You can apply what you learn with your pay per click ads directly to 
optimize your Web site for effective keywords, which can help you to 
rank in organic search results. Your ranking may go up fairly easily for 
these long-tail keywords because they’re less competitive.
 
✦ Long-tail traffic adds up, and that makes it attractive.
If you have ads that people aren’t clicking on, the keyword might not be the 
problem. A low click-through rate could be due to a number of factors:
 
✦ Your ad copy may not be written well.
 
✦ Your ad may not be relevant to the search term.
 
✦ The audience your ad is targeting is not the same as the people who are 
searching for that term.
Because there are several variables, it may be difficult to pinpoint exactly 
why a given ad has a low click-through rate. You can actually learn more 
from ads with high click-through rates than you can from those that under-
perform. If you’ve found a winning combination of ad copy and relevant key-
word terms and it’s bringing the right kind of traffic to your Web site, you’ve 
found marketing gold. By all means, apply the same types of keywords to 
your Web site to improve your organic search engine optimization, as well.

Overlapping Pay Per Click with Natural Keyword Rankings
Reducing Costs by Overlapping Pay Per Click 
with Natural Keyword Rankings
Pairing your search engine optimization work with a pay per click campaign 
often yields the best results. Don’t just do one or the other. If you have the 
budget, doing both organic SEO and pay per click together is the best strategy.
Research supports the use of PPC ads in addition to organic search results 
ranking for your targeted keywords. If your company name appears in two 
places on the results page, you get higher impact and brand awareness — 
and more clicks on both the ad and the listing than you would if only one 
displayed. Studies have shown that when your company listing appears 
in the organic results and in a paid ad on the first results page, people get 
the impression that your company is an expert. As a result, they click your 
organic listing far more often than they would if no pay per click ad dis-
played. See Figure 3-1 for an example of a search ad paired with an organic 
ranking.

Overlapping Pay Per Click with Natural Keyword Rankings
 
You benefit when your pay per click ads work in conjunction with a high 
page ranking in the organic results. It’s interesting to note that when both 
display, although click patterns depend upon the keyword, some studies 
have shown that clicks go up for both the listing and the ad. Nevertheless, 
most people click the organic listing rather than the paid ad. Either way, 
you’re still generating more traffic to your site by having both an ad and a 
good ranking.
In addition to perceived expertise and more click-throughs, your company 
earns better brand recognition by displaying in two places on the search 
results page. And on a practical level, your site also controls more real 
estate on the page — leaving less room for competitors.

I
f you’ve read Chapters 1 through 3 of this minibook, you’ve already done 
a lot of the prep work for assigning keywords to pages. In this chapter, 
you use all of that research and prep work as we explain how you can assign 
keywords in a way that helps make your Web site most accessible to search 
engines. You want to make it as easy as possible for the search engines to 
find out what your site is about because the more relevant your site is to a 
user’s search query, the higher your site is likely to show up in the search 
results.
Understanding What a Search Engine 
Sees as Keywords
In this section, we take a step back first and talk about what search engines 
really see as keywords. When someone enters a search query, the search 
engine looks for those words in its index. Here are some general things the 
search engine looks for:
 
✦ Web pages that contain the exact phrase.
 
✦ Web pages that have all the words of the phrase in close proximity to 
each other.
 
✦ Web pages that contain all the words, although not close together.
 
✦ Web pages that contain other forms of the words (such as customize 
instead of customization). This is called stemming.
 
✦ Web pages that have links pointing to them from other pages, in which 
the link text contains the exact phrase or all of the words in a different 
sequence.

118
Planning Subject Theme Categories
 
✦ External Web pages that link to this site from a page that is considered 
to be about the same keyword.
 
✦ Web pages that contain the words in special formatting (bold, italics, 
larger font size, bullets, or with heading tags).
The preceding items are some of the clues a search engine would use to 
determine your site’s keywords. They are not listed in order of priority, nor 
do they represent an exhaustive list because the search engines keep their 
methods a secret. All mystery aside, the search engine’s main goal is to give 
users the most relevant results. If a search engine cannot clearly connect a 
user’s query to keywords on your Web page, it won’t return your site in the 
search results.
You should also put each page’s keywords into its Meta keywords tag (part 
of the HTML coding for your Web page). Opinions are divided within the SEO 
industry on this point, however. Around 2005, the search engines said they 
would no longer weigh the keywords tag heavily, if at all, because so many 
Webmasters had abused it by cramming it full of words that didn’t pertain 
to their site. Although this obviously lessened the overall importance of the 
keywords tag, it has been our experience that a keywords tag containing 
appropriate phrases that are also used in the page content definitely helps 
your Web page to rank highly. In addition, Google recently recommended 
that sites use the keywords tag to list common misspellings of their com-
pany name or products. This confirms that Google does indeed consider the 
keywords tag in some searches.
Planning Subject Theme Categories
Search engines rank individual pages but they do look for overall site-wide 
themes in determining how relevant your Web page is to a search query. As 
a general rule, the home page should use more broad range terms, and the 
supporting pages should use more specific and targeted terms that help sup-
port the home page. By using this method, you enable the search engines to 
understand and index your site’s contents because this is the organization 
they’re expecting. And better indexing means better inclusion on search 
results.
 
Here’s a general guideline about keywords, topics, and themes: A Web page’s 
first paragraph should introduce its keywords. If a keyword is repeated in 
every paragraph, it’s a topic. If the Web site has multiple (we recommend 
six or more) interconnected pages related to the topic, we consider that a 
theme. Search engines consider a site with multiple pages of unique, infor-
mative content on a theme to be highly relevant.

Book II
Chapter 4

119
Planning Subject Theme Categories
You need to choose a main theme for your Web site. What is your whole 
Web site about? For instance, our classic custom cars Web site might have a 
main site theme of custom cars or of classic cars. Which one makes the most 
sense depends on two things: which theme most accurately fits the business 
and vision of the Web site, and which theme is searched for the most. To 
find out which phrase gets the most number of searches, you need to use 
a keyword research tool such as those covered in Book II, Chapter 2. Here, 
we suffice to say that the phrase [classic cars] receives about four times the 
number of searches that [custom cars] does, so we use classic cars as our 
main site theme.
 
The preceding example points out an important principle: You should not 
plan your site theme and structure based solely on what makes sense to 
you. Instead, do research to find out how people search and lay out your 
Web site accordingly. This is essential to your design.
Assuming that you want your site to rank in searches for its major theme, 
you want to
 
✦ Make sure your site theme is included in your home page’s title tag and 
Meta tags (HTML code located at the top of a Web page — we show you 
how this is done in Book IV).
 
✦ Use your site theme in your page content, so that the search engines 
interpret the theme as keywords for your Web page. Making your theme 
part of the keywords helps a Web page come up in searches for those 
keywords. (You learn more about keyword strategy in Chapter 5 of this 
minibook.)
After you’ve got your main site theme, you need to organize the site content. 
If you already have a Web site, try to view it with fresh eyes because the 
current organizational structure might not be the most conducive to good 
search engine ranking. In our experience, many Web sites are disjointed 
arrays of unrelated information with no central theme. Yours may not be 
that bad, but as you read through the recommendations in this chapter, you 
may find that you’re light on content, have too much of the wrong type of 
content, or need to do some major reorganization. As Figure 4-1 shows, you 
need to figure out how best to divide your site into subject categories.

Look at all of the content, products, services, and so on, that your Web site 
offers. Is all of the stuff on your site well-organized into categories and sub-
categories? Do those breakdowns match the way people search for what 
you offer? Depending on the size of your Web site and the diversity of its 
subject matter, you could have a single site-wide theme, or a structure with 
hundreds of subject theme categories and subcategories. Some keyword 
research is in order here as well to make sure you’re dividing up the infor-
mation according to how people search. For instance, the classic cars Web 
site could separate its content either by body type (sedans, coupes, convert-
ibles, vans, and so on), by make (Chevrolet, Ford, Oldsmobile, and so on), by 
year of manufacture (1950, 1951, 1952, and so on), or by some other method. 
It turns out that people don’t usually search for cars by body type, such as 
[sedan cars], or by year [1959 Oldsmobiles]. Instead, most people looking 
for cars search by make and model, like [Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight]. For maxi-
mum ranking in search engines, therefore, this Web site ought to organize 
its contents by make, and then by model. Of course, based on how people 
search in your industry, your subcategories will vary.

Organizing Your Primary and Secondary Subjects
Choosing Landing Pages for Subject Categories
You should organize your Web site into categories not just because it’s 
neater that way, but also so that your site can rank well for any of its subject 
themes. Rather than having all inbound links point to your home page only, 
you should create an array of highly targeted pages representing all of your 
categories. For each subject category in your Web site, you want to choose a 
landing page.
A landing page acts as the primary information page for a subject category. 
It’s the page where all hypertext links (text that can be clicked to take the 
user to another Web page) related to that subject should point. Your Web 
site’s landing pages present the all-important first impression to site visitors. 
You want to make sure your landing pages not only put your best foot 
forward, but also interest visitors enough to entice them to go further, and 
hopefully convert to customers. They have to look good to users and search 
engines.
The primary subjects for our classic cars Web site are the different makes 
of cars, and each one needs a landing page. The Ford landing page needs to 
contain some general information about Ford cars; a separate Oldsmobile 
landing page should contain some information about Olds cars; and so on. 
Your landing pages need to have enough content so that people reach-
ing them from a search engine feel satisfied that they’ve come to the right 
place. You want the content to engage visitors enough so that they want to 
stay. You also need your landing pages to link to other pages on your site 
that offer more detailed information within the subject category and lead to 
opportunities to buy, sign up, or take whatever action your site considers a 
conversion.
Organizing Your Primary and Secondary Subjects
Search engines look for depth of content. Your landing pages should each 
have at least three or four pages of supporting information that they link 
to. These sub-pages need to be within the same theme as the landing page 
that they support. Having several sub-pages linked from each landing page 
that all talk about the same subject theme reinforces your theme and boosts 
your landing page’s perceived expertise on the subject.
Now that you’ve decided on primary subjects for your Web site, each with 
its own landing page, you need to decide whether further stratification is 
needed. Do you have natural sub-categories under your primary subject 
categories? If so, you probably want to create landing pages for this second 
tier, as well. For our classic cars Web site, the secondary subjects under 

122
Understanding Siloing “Under the Hood”
each car manufacturer would be the different models of cars, and we’d 
create a landing page for each model. So the Ford landing page could link to 
individual landing pages for Ford Mustang, Ford Falcon, Ford Thunderbird, 
and so on.
The concept of organizing a Web site’s content into distinct subject categories, 
each with its own landing page and supporting pages, is called siloing. Refer 
back to the diagram in Figure 4-1 to see how our classic cars Web site could 
be arranged into silos.
Here are a few recommendations for building landing pages:
 
✦ Keep each landing page’s content focused on its particular subject 
category.
 
✦ Make the content engaging — consider including video, audio, images, 
or dynamic elements along with highly relevant text (not in place of it!).
 
✦ Customize the keywords on each landing page to reflect that page’s 
subject theme.
 
✦ Be sure to include the keywords in the page content as well as in the 
Meta tags.
 
✦ Include links to secondary pages in the same category.
 
✦ Don’t include links to secondary pages under different subject categories.
A note about links: Hypertext links that lead to each landing page should 
contain your page’s keywords. You want the linked text that the user clicks 
(the anchor text) to be meaningful. Google keeps track of links to determine 
the relevancy of each of your Web pages. The link Ford Mustang Information 
and Pricing gains you a lot more points than Click Here because your page is 
not really about Click Here — it’s about Ford Mustangs. You definitely want 
to use good, keyword-rich anchor text for links going to landing pages in 
your Web site. You don’t have as much control over the links that other Web 
sites use to link to your pages, but as much as possible, try to have those 
links also show descriptive anchor text.
Understanding Siloing “Under the Hood”
Now that you understand the importance of grouping content on your site, 
you might be wondering how to accomplish it. If you have a gigantic Web 
site with thousands of pages that need to be reorganized, don’t panic. You 
can do your siloing in two ways. Either can be successful, but you get the 
most bang from your buck by doing both.

Understanding Siloing “Under the Hood”
 
✦ Physical silos: Ideally, the physical structure of your site — the directories 
or folders — should reflect your silo organization. This is the simplest, 
cleanest way to do it, and keeps everything nicely organized as your 
Web site grows. With this organization, you want the top level folders to 
be your primary subject categories, the next-level folders to contain the 
secondary subject categories, and so forth. So a directory structure for 
our classic cars site might look something like Figure 4-2:
 
Figure 4-2: 
The 
Windows 
Explorer 
view of 
a siloed 
physical 
directory 
structure.
 
 
 Arranging the physical directories to match your siloing scheme is 
fine if you have the luxury of starting a site from scratch, or if your 
site is small enough to move things around without too much pain and 
effort. However, if you have a very large site or a very stubborn Content 
Management System (CMS) (software that helps you create, edit, and 
manage a Web site), you need a more flexible solution.

124
Consolidating Themes to Help Search Engines See Your Relevance
 
✦ Virtual silos: Web sites that cannot adjust their directory structures can 
accomplish siloing by creating virtual silos. Instead of moving related 
Web pages into new directories, virtual silos connect related pages 
using links. You still need to have a landing page per subject, and links 
on each landing page identify the sublevel pages within that subject silo. 
So no matter how the directories are set up for our classic cars Web site, 
the Ford landing page would have links to Ford Falcon, Ford Mustang, 
and Ford Thunderbird pages. Because search engine spiders follow the 
links as they move through a Web site, this virtual silo organization does 
not confuse the spiders, no matter how your underlying files and folders 
are set up.
 
✦ Doing both: Incorporating virtual and physical silos can be very powerful 
for a site that has pages that should exist in more than one silo or cat-
egory. For a complete view of siloing and architecture, refer to Book IV.
Consolidating Themes to Help Search Engines 
See Your Relevance
In order to rank well in search results for a particular keyword phrase, your 
Web site must provide related information that is organized in clear lan-
guage that search engines understand. When your textual information has 
been stripped away from its design and layout, does it measure up to be the 
most relevant aggregate information compared to that of other sites? If so, 
you have a high likelihood of achieving high rankings and attracting site 
visitors who are researching and shopping for products and services.
As we mentioned in Chapter 2 of this book, we often explain the importance 
of creating subject silos by using the analogy that most Web sites are like a 
jar of marbles. A search engine can only decipher meaning when the 
subjects are clear and distinct. Take a look at the picture of the jar of marbles 
in Figure 4-3.
In this jar are black marbles, white marbles, and gray marbles all mixed 
together with no apparent order or emphasis. It would be reasonable to 
assume that search engines would only classify the subject as marbles.
If you separated out each group of marbles into its own jar (or Web site), 
they would be classified as a jar of black marbles, a jar of white marbles, and 
a jar of gray marbles (Figure 4-4).

Figure 4-4: 
Each jar 
(or site) 
is clearly 
about one 
color of 
marbles: 
black, white, 
and gray. 
There is no 
opportunity 
for 
confusion.
 
However, if you wanted to combine all three marble colors into a single jar, 
you could create distinct silos within the site that would allow the subject 
themes to be black marbles, white marbles, gray marbles, and finally the 
generic term marbles. (See Figure 4-5.) Most Web sites never clarify the main 
subjects they want their site to become relevant for. Instead, they try to be 
all things to all people. 
 
Your goal, if you want your site to rank for more than a single generic term, 
is to selectively decide what your site is and is not about. Rankings are often 
damaged in three major ways:
 
✦ By having too little content for a subject on your Web site
 
✦ By including irrelevant content that dilutes and blurs your theme
 
✦ By choosing keywords that are not well matched to your theme
Do you have your themes poorly defined, spread out in pieces over a 
number of different pages? Or are you mixing dissimilar items together on a 
page, so that no central theme emerges (similar to the first jar of marbles in 
Figure 4-3)? Both of these cases may be preventing the search engines from 
seeing your Web pages as relevant to your keywords. If your Web site is not 
currently ranking well for a keyword phrase, consider both possible causes. 
You may have too little content for a theme, in which case you need to 
increase the number of pages that contain keyword-rich content on that sub-
ject. Conversely, if you have irrelevant or disorganized content, you might 
need to consolidate your subject themes by separating and concentrating 
them into silos, like the marbles in Figure 4-5.

f you’ve been doing what we suggest as you read the past four chapters, 
you’ve brainstormed, you’ve done your research, you’ve categorized 
your keywords, and created landing pages (the Web page the user comes 
to when clicking a link) for your subject categories. So now what? Now you 
actually get to add keywords.
There is an art to placing keywords on your Web site. You can’t simply type 
car, car, car, car, car, car again and again. For one thing, that’s considered 
spam and will get your site pulled from the search engine index. (For our 
purposes, spam is any type of deceptive Web technique meant to trick a 
search engine into offering inappropriate, redundant, or poor-quality search 
results. For more details, see Book I, Chapter 6.) For another thing, a user 
who sees “car, car, car, car ...” would immediately hit Back on the browser 
window. Remember, you want to keep people so that they will stick around 
and be converted from a visitor to a customer (or however your Web site 
defines converted). To do that, you have to create searchable, readable 
content for your Web site.
But what do you do with those keywords we made you gather? In this chap-
ter, we talk about how to distribute them on your pages, and how to deter-
mine the number of times you need to use them. We also discuss how to 
maintain your keywords. Unfortunately, the Internet is ever-changing and so 
is the market. In order to maintain your relevancy, you’re also going to have 
to adjust and update your keywords regularly. But not to worry: There are 
tools out there that help you measure your keywords’ performance and 
analyze your competition’s keywords, and we show you how to use them.

Understanding Keyword Densities, Frequency, and Prominence
Understanding Keyword Densities, Frequency, and 
Prominence
Keyword density is a term we use in SEO-land. It’s the measurement of the 
number of times a keyword or keyword phrase appears on a Web page, 
compared to the total number of words on the page. To determine density, 
you take the number of words on the page (say, 1,000 for a long page) and 
the number of times that the word appears on that page (maybe 23 times). 
Divide 23 by 1,000 to get a density of about 2.3 percent. Keyword density is 
one of the factors a search engine spider looks at when determining whether 
a Web page is relevant to that search. Frequency is another factor that SEOs 
look at: It’s simply how many times a word appears on the page; in this case, 
23 times. The combination of frequency and density is the prominence — 
higher density and more instances lead to greater prominence of the term.
These factors collectively are why it’s important to have searchable text on 
your Web page, and especially on each landing page. That doesn’t mean you 
have to write a novel on your landing pages. Search engine spiders generally 
put more weight on the first 200 words on a Web site, including words in 
your navigation, headings, and so on. It’s important to make sure that your 
keywords appear throughout the page but especially right up front so that 
search engines and your visitor know what you’re all about from the get go. 
You can elaborate further from there on, of course.
With keywords, the spiders are looking at these three things:
 
✦ Frequency: How often a keyword is used on a Web page. Any word (or 
phrase) is considered a keyword if it’s used at least twice in the page. 
(Note that search engines do not include stop words such as and, the, 
a, and so forth as keywords, although they may be part of keyword 
phrases.)
 
✦ Density: Keyword density is like frequency, but it measures what per-
centage of the total page content the keyword appears. You’re going to 
want to have each keyword comprise no more than five percent of the 
total page content.
 
✦ Distribution: This measures whether the keyword is evenly distributed 
throughout the page and the site. There is some debate over whether 
placing keywords higher on the page gives a boost to your rankings. In 
general, it’s better to sprinkle the keywords evenly through the page in 
a normal writing fashion. Natural-sounding text is easier to read, and 
scores better with search engines.
You can visualize keyword distribution if you imagine all the content of a 
Web page arranged horizontally in a box, so that the beginning of the page
is at the far left and the last words on the page are at the right edge.

Understanding Keyword Densities, Frequency, and Prominence
Figure 5-1 shows the distribution of a keyword on a given page. The chart 
shows that the keyword phrase peanut butter occurs once near the beginning 
of the page, a couple of times near the middle of the page, and not at all near 
the end. Although a more even distribution would be better, search engines 
could tell from this distribution that the word peanut butter is an important 
keyword for this Web page.
 
Figure 5-1:

distribution 
chart for a 
keyword

Web page.
 
In order to have proper keyword distribution, you can’t clutter up your page 
with keywords or just dump them on the page. When writing your text, form 
sentences that use those keywords. Remember what we said about keyword 
phrases as well. Search engine users are getting more sophisticated these 
days and entering search queries that contain three to four words instead of 
just two or three. If you’re a good writer, you’re going to have to tame some 
of those habits you learned while writing papers. Good writers are encour-
aged to use synonyms and rephrase things to keep from being too repetitive. 
This makes a document easier to read, surely, but it won’t help with your 
site rankings. Because your search engine ranking is going to be measured 
using a math equation, it’s better to think of your site in terms of supplying 
the equation with numbers.

132
Understanding Keyword Densities, Frequency, and Prominence
For instance, if you want to rank high for a query like [classic cars], you’re 
going to have to keep using the words classic cars in your page instead of 
using these and them and so forth. Use discretion when doing this; other-
wise, your page could become unpleasant to read. A good example of how 
to properly spread keywords is this book. Notice how many times we say a 
particular word, like keyword, and how we distribute it through the text. We 
don’t say “Choose your keywords during your keyword research for key-
word optimization purposes using keyword tools.” That level of repetition 
is unnatural-sounding. Instead, we mention keywords every now and then, 
when it’s appropriate. On the other hand, we don’t just say keyword once 
and then spend the rest of our time trying to find flowery ways to refer to 
keywords. Your competition is a good way to get an idea of what looks natu-
ral to search engines. For more on how to analyze your competition’s pages, 
read Book III, Chapter 1.
 
Remember that search engines count every instance of a word on a Web 
page (except if it’s showing in a graphic — computers can’t “read” images). 
This includes all words in the article text plus that in headings, navigation 
elements, links, and HTML tags. Here’s an example, and remember this is 
just a recommended guideline, of how you might evenly distribute a main 
keyword throughout a page that had 750 words divided into five paragraphs:
 
✦ Once in the Title tag
 
✦ Once or twice in the description Meta tag (in the HTML code)
 
✦ Once or twice in the keywords Meta tag (in the HTML code)
 
✦ Once in the first sentence of on-page (user visible) text
 
✦ Twice in the first 200 words (including the first sentence)
 
✦ Once each in paragraphs two, three, and four
 
✦ Once or twice in the last paragraph
On the flip side, there is such a thing as using too many keywords — that’s 
how you venture into the realm of spam through keyword stuffing. (Refer 
back to spam definitions in Book I, Chapter 6.) Remember our sample sen-
tence about keywords from a few paragraphs ago? That’s a stuffed sentence. 
There’s no guaranteed magic number for keyword frequency or density, 
but it’s a good rule of thumb to keep your keyword below five percent of 
the total number of words on the page. The better way to do it is to make it 
sound natural as compared to your competition. Use a keyword too often, 
and you could trip an alarm on a keyword stuffing filter. Keywords repeated 
too often also work against user retention and could bring down the conver-
sion rate. For a commercial Web site, you want to keep customers around 
so they’ll make purchases, and you risk driving them away with too much 
repetition. For an informational or reference Web site, the goal is to have as 
many visitors as possible stick around and read the information available. 
Badly written text does not make someone want to stay on your Web site. 
Figure 5-2 shows a made-up example of a Web page with keyword stuffing.

There is a question of whether the Big Three search engines (Yahoo!, 
Microsoft Live Search, and Google) measure keyword densities differently. 
As with all areas of SEO, there’s some argument over this issue. Generally, 
however, there’s agreement that Google is less tolerant of heavy keyword 
usage than Yahoo! or Microsoft. And because all search engines continu-
ously try to refine and improve their spam filters, you don’t want to get too 
close to the line of what might be unacceptable.
Want to make sure a search engine doesn’t miss your keywords? You can 
draw more attention to keywords by applying special formatting, such as 
strong strong or emphasis em, changing the font size, or using Heading tags. 
Putting them in the page titles (in the HTML Title tags) and the description 
and keywords Meta tags (also in the HTML code) is also recommended.
Adjusting Keywords
After you optimize your Web site for your selected keywords, be aware that 
your job is not done. Search engine optimization involves continual monitoring,
testing, and tracking. You need to keep track of how your keywords are 
performing as you go along. If a keyword is not drawing in as much traffic as 
you think it should be, or it’s drawing in the wrong kind of traffic (visitors who 
don’t convert), it’s time to go in and change it. (This is why you do a bunch of 
research into your competition, and to look up synonyms while you’re at it.)

134
Updating Keywords
If a keyword is not working out, sitting around and hoping it eventually will 
is not going to increase your rank. SEO is not an exact science; it requires 
tweaking, fixing, and adjusting things. If one keyword is not working for you, 
perhaps its synonym might. If you find that you’re getting traffic but no con-
versions, that’s a sign that you need to look deeper into whether this is a 
useful keyword or if you’re just wasting time trying to fight that battle.
It’s more than okay to go in and adjust your keywords as needed. Do some 
testing between different keywords and compare the results to find your 
best performers. If a word’s not working for you, stop using it! There are 
words out there that will bring your targeted audience, and all you need to 
do is make the proper adjustments to find them.
Updating Keywords
The thing about keyword maintenance is that it’s not an exact science. There 
is no one guaranteed keyword out there that will always bring you a ton 
of traffic today and into the future. For one thing, no one knows what the 
Internet will look like two years from now, let alone five or ten. Vernacular 
changes very rapidly. In 2000, Google was a small upstart search engine; 
today, Google so dominates the industry that it’s become a word in the dic-
tionary and is often used as a verb. You can’t stay still in the online world. 
Things that are common sense to us today might not stay that way.
For example, in the late nineties, you used a cellular telephone. Nowadays, 
it’s a cell phone. If you’re abroad, you don’t use a cell phone, you use a 
mobile. A term that made sense as a keyword five years ago might not 
make sense today. The moral of the story is that you can’t do your keyword 
research once and then say you’re done. You have to keep researching as 
you go along, especially if you’re making plans for the long term.
Using Tools to Aid Keyword Placement
Like tools for measuring how often a keyword is searched (which we cov-
ered in Book II, Chapter 4), there are also tools out there that aid you in 
researching keyword densities of a certain page. You want to use these tools 
to check out the competition. Not only do you need to know what keywords 
your competitors are using, but also in what frequency and density.
There’s a couple of ways you can go about this. You can count the keywords 
by hand and probably drive yourself nuts. Or you can use a helpful tool 
called Page Analyzer. Page Analyzer measures as a percentage how much 
your keyword is used compared to the total number of words on your Web 
page. Our Page Analyzer measures frequency and prominence and graphs 
the density. Figure 5-3 shows a screenshot of the free Page Analyzer from the 
SEOToolset.

Using a page analyzer allows you to keep track of your competition in order 
to see what the search engines prefer and why. We also advise you to keep 
track of the results by using an Excel spreadsheet (see Book II, Chapter 2 for 
more details on that). This is something you should do periodically in order 
to keep track of the progress of your competition.
You can find many page analyzers out there, but the one we’re going to dis-
cuss is available for free at www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.
html. As of this writing, it was the fourth tool down. To use it, simply type 
in your Web site’s URL into the query window and click the Check Keyword 
Densities button. After a minute, you see a results page like the one in Figure 
5-4 for our training site, www.peanutbutterville.com.
As you look down the report, the items in red indicate that your keyword 
density may be too low to rank across all engines. The items in blue indicate 
that your keyword density may be too high to rank across all engines.
The first thing you’re going to see after you’ve placed your Web page into 
the Page Analyzer is your Google PageRank (the algorithm Google uses to 
measure and assign importance and weight to the links in your page and the 
links to you). Peanutbutterville.com has a PageRank of zero because of a 
lack of inbound links.

In Figure 5-5, you can see that you’re next given a list of common words on 
your site. These are the keywords the Page Analyzer found on your Web 
page. A Page Analyzer (and a search engine) considers a word a keyword if 
it is used more than twice, including keyword phrases. In a full version of the 
toolset, you can actually enter in the keywords from your list and the Page 
Analyzer measures them and provides you their stats.

In Figure 5-6, under the headings “Title Tag,” “Meta Description Tag” and 
“Meta Keywords Tag,” you can see all of the text the Page Analyzer found in 
your Title tag and Meta tags for this page. Title tags are what you name 
your Web pages in the HTML coding of the site. It’s very important to place 
a keyword or keywords in your page titles. The Meta description and key-
words tags are other items in the HTML code at the top of each page. These 
are not visible to the user, but search engine spiders read them and measure 
them as part of your keyword density.

The Page Analyzer can let you know if a title is too long or too short, 
whether too many keywords are used or not enough, and whether you’re in 
danger of a spam violation. Figure 5-7 shows the stats page. This lists every 
word or phrase that’s used at least twice on your Web page. The columns 
also indicate where your keywords appear in your page, and how many 
times the keyword is used in that particular section. For instance, in Figure 
5-7, the word butter is used once in the Title tag and ten times in the body 
text of the page. It also tells you what percentage out of the total amount of 
words the keyword accounts for.
The Page Analyzer also tells you by one, two, three, and four-word phrases 
how your keywords are spread across your page. Figure 5-8 shows the Page 
Analyzer report for your keyword multi-word phrases. Densities on multi-
word phrases are usually significantly lower than single words. Although 
a density of four or five percent might make sense for a single word, your 
multi-word phrases should be quite a bit lower than that (depending on your 
industry — more on that in Book III).

There are no guarantees when it comes to SEO. The tools we’ve described in 
this chapter are just that, tools — they can only help you do a task more 
easily, not tell you what to do. Search engine optimization is not only about 
keywords, either. If you only adjust your keywords, you only upgrade your 
page to an okay page instead of an excellent page. Competitor research 
(Book III), site design (Book IV), content (Book V), linking (Book VI), site 
environment (Book VII), and analysis are all vital components to succeeding.
The more practice you have with researching, updating, and maintaining 
keywords, the less you need tools like the Page Analyzer. When you have 
more experience, you can look at a page and see if the keyword density 
needs tweaking, but it takes practice and patience to get to that point!
 
Maintaining keywords is only one part of search engine optimization. The 
gold standard of a Web site is to achieve algorithmic immunity. Algorithmic 
immunity means that your page is the least imperfect it can be, across the 
board. So if the search engines’ algorithms were to change (as they do fre-
quently), like, say, lessening the importance of links and stressing the impor-
tance of on-page factors again, your Web site won’t be affected because it’s 
optimized across the board. Keywords are important, certainly, but there 
are also many other factors to consider before your page is the least imper-
fect it can be.

Similar to the Page Analyzer is a multi-page 
analyzer, which measures the keyword 
density of multiple Web pages, so you can 
check out what your competition does and 
compare them with your own Web site. Reading 
a multiple page analyzer is a lot like a single 
page analyzer, so we’re not going to break that 
one down separately for you. Unfortunately, 
multiple page analyzers are generally only 
available as a paid option, but they are dead 
useful. We cover how to mimic the multi-page 
analyzer in Book III, Chapter 2.

L
ike any business, you need to know what you’re up against. Knowing 
who your competition is and figuring out how to beat them are the 
hallmarks of good business planning. Online businesses are like any business 
in that regard, but online and traditional businesses have some slight 
differences in how you build a competitive strategy, especially when it 
comes to search engine optimization.
In this chapter, we discuss how to figure out who your competition is and 
how to make their strengths and weaknesses work for you. You figure out 
how to research who your competitors are for the coveted top search 
engine rankings. Also, your competition in the brick-and-mortar world might 
not be the same as your competitors online. Finally, it’s one thing to know 
your competition; it’s another to put that information to use. Not to worry: 
We’ve got you covered in this chapter.
Getting to Know the Competition
With any business, you want to feel out the market. Who are you competing 
with, and how are they doing? This is important because it gives you an idea 
of how to run your own business. If somebody’s succeeding in your space, 
they’re doing something right. You also need to know what other people are 
doing wrong so you can capitalize on that and avoid their mistakes.

Getting to Know the Competition
Say your business is customizing classic cars. You restore, repaint, and rev 
up any old model American car. To figure out your competition, sit down 
and think about the kind of competitors you think would be in your market. 
Who is your competition? Other classic car customization places. Other 
people who do paint and body work. Other businesses that offer simple 
customization services. Write them all down, even ones you think would 
only be loosely connected. Figure 1-1 is a brainstorming graph of your 
business and what you do that links your competition to you.

Taking this list, now go and research all of these other companies, while 
asking yourself some questions about these areas of their business:
 
✦ Tactics: How do they advertise?
 
✦ Similarities: What services do they offer that are similar to yours?
 
✦ Differences: What services do they offer that are different?
 
✦ Success rate: Do they get more or less business than you?
 
✦ Opportunities: What are some of the things they are doing that you 
could be doing, too?
 
This approach is a good way to start market research. You also need to 
remember to continue doing this, as businesses, and especially Internet 
businesses, are subject to changing their tactics and offerings. Every market 
differs, but you probably want to do a review of your competitors four to six 
times a year.

Figuring Out the Real Competition
The other important thing to keep in mind about doing research for your 
competition in the search engines is just how much their results can differ 
in a day. And because different search engines use different algorithms, 
the page Google ranks number one — say, [classic car customization] — 
could be in an entirely different position over on Yahoo! and yet another for 
Microsoft Live Search. You have no guarantee that all three engines even 
have the same page indexed.
 
Another problem is that sometimes a spider has not crawled a page in the 
index for more than two weeks (or longer). Although two weeks is not a long 
time to us, in those two weeks, that Web site could have been taken offline, 
been completely redone to reflect changes in the business, or had screwy 
code attached to attain a higher rank for the site. Search engines are not 
infallible, so it’s best to continue to research the competition often to main-
tain the most up-to-date information possible.
Also, the playing field changes between the brick-and-mortar world and 
the online business world, so make a list and check it multiple times. Just 
because you have a cross-town rival for your business doesn’t mean that 
he’s online, or that you won’t have other competitors to worry about. In the 
real world, you see competitors coming. Online, they appear from nowhere. 
You have to be vigilant.
Figuring Out the Real Competition
Part of knowing who you’re competing against is knowing who is actually 
drawing the customers you want, and who is just limping along, especially 
when it comes to search engine optimization. Who you think your competi-
tion should be and who actually pops up on those search results pages are 
sometimes two completely different things.
Doing a quick search on Google for your business’s keywords (the words 
people use when doing a search) might turn up those that you think of as 
your competition, as well as others that are completely out of the blue. Book 
II teaches you how to pull together a keyword list that gives you a good 
starting point for finding your competition. Take a typical search, like in 
Figure 1-2, which shows the SERP (search engine results page) for [classic 
car customization].

146
Figuring Out the Real Competition
 
Figure 1-2: 
A Google 
search 
result for 
[classic car 
customiz-
ation].
 
The search page yields a mixture of listings for Web sites related to the 
search term:
 
✦ Classic car sales
 
✦ Customization businesses
 
✦ Auto parts dealers
 
✦ Stereo dealers
 
✦ Articles on classic car customization
 
✦ Auto club memberships for car restorers
Note the different types of businesses. Are they what you’d thought they’d 
be? These sites represent the true competition in the search engine world 
for [classic car customization] because they’re ranking high for those key-
words. Try out other, more specialized keywords as well, and make note of 
who’s ranking for them. Are they actual businesses like our example? Or are 
they something that’s only tangentially related to classic car customization?
 
Another good idea is to do a search for your actual business name to see if 
your brand is ranking. If you don’t occupy the number one position for your 
business name, find who does and what they’re doing to rank higher. 
Because if they’ve got the spot you want, with your name, they’re obviously 
doing something right.

Knowing Thyself: Recognizing Your Business Advantages
For example, going back to your car customization business, your biggest 
competitor in your hometown is Bob’s Customized Classics. Bob is every-
where you look. He’s got print ads, he’s got billboards, and he’s got a really 
annoying commercial. He markets himself very well. But when you go online 
and do an online search for your keywords [classic car customization], Bob 
is nowhere to be found. In fact, you find out Bob doesn’t even have a Web 
site! What you see ranking number one for your most important keyword 
phrase is Motormouth Mabel’s Classic Car Boutique down in Boca Raton.
Mabel’s Web site is gorgeous. It’s SEO-friendly, full of spiderable content, no 
Flash, and plenty of links. Mabel, not Bob, is your real competition when it 
comes to the Internet. Because when people do a search in the search engines, 
they’re going to go to her instead of Bob. So although Bob is your competition in 
the brick-and-mortar world of your hometown, Mabel’s the one you need to be 
studying if you want to get anywhere with your online presence.
 
Your other competitors might not even be related to classic car customiza-
tion, but because they rank high for your keywords, you should study them 
to understand their online methodology. After you know their tactics, you 
can figure out how to beat them. If you’re doing searches for a keyword and 
none of the competitors are even in the same ballpark in terms of your busi-
ness, you might have a keyword that isn’t appropriate to your business, and 
you should reconsider optimizing for it.
Knowing Thyself: Recognizing Your 
Business Advantages
Part of being able to market yourself is actually understanding yourself and 
your niche. This might seem like common sense, but the truth is a lot of 
businesses out there can’t decide exactly who they are and what they’re 
selling. Knowing what your strengths and weaknesses are gives you a 
huge advantage because you can work on reducing your weaknesses while 
emphasizing your strengths.
The first part of knowing yourself is figuring out what you do best. In this 
example, you customize classic cars, certainly. But maybe what you do best 
is repair work. You can take a rusted-out hunk of a Comet and have it up 
and running within weeks, with a shiny new paint job to boot. So one of the 
strengths you would play to on your Web site is restoration. Emphasize that 
on your Web site. Have a section devoted entirely to car restoration, with 
subsections linking to that.
Think about what makes you different than Bob or Mabel. Bob does restoration
as well, but he doesn’t have an Internet presence like you do. That’s a point 
for you and gives you an advantage over Bob. Mabel has a gorgeous, SEO-
friendly Web site, but she doesn’t have much on there about actual car 
restoration, so there’s an advantage point for you to build on.

148
Looking at Conversion as a Competitive Measure
Knowing what your weaknesses are is also very important. Mabel’s got a 
great Web site. Your Web site is not as good (yet). She’s also a national 
business, while you still are fairly local. Those might be points you want to 
build on in order to make yourself equal with your competition. Streamline 
your Web site and filter out or downplay your weaknesses. If necessary, 
completely take your site down and rebuild it from scratch.
 
Be aware of what makes you different. If you offer a service that many other 
people are offering, what makes you stick out from the rest of the pack? Do 
you offer other services that the competition doesn’t? Are you quicker or 
more efficient? Make sure to keep a note of this when researching the 
competition. What are they doing, and how do you do it better? Or how will 
you do it better? Make yourself valuable to the customer.
Compare your Web site to your competition’s: You have to make yourself 
equal before you can set yourself apart. Make sure you match what your 
competition offers in your own way and then provide content that explains 
why you’re unique, more trustworthy, and better overall: in other words, 
make it obvious that you’re the first choice to fit the visitor’s needs. You 
know that you are made of awesome; now you just have to convince 
everyone else.
Looking at Conversion as a Competitive Measure
When you go through your competitors’ sites, you’re essentially looking for 
anything they have that gives them an advantage — any special content that 
appeals only to a certain sector or that is attracting links. Obviously, you’re 
not using their site as a blueprint to copy, but there’s something about ven-
turing off your own Web site and seeing things from a visitor’s eye that can 
alert you to holes you would have missed otherwise.
Doing competitive research can also be a 
good way to think up new tools, tricks, or toys 
to add to your Web site to attract users. You 
may discover that your competitors are writ-
ing confusing “How-To” articles that would 
be much clearer as instructional videos. Or 
they may have an article listing the latest baby 
names, which could easily be turned into a fun 
tool — take the initiative and create it. Users 
love interactive content. Be continuously 
looking for creative ways to make your site 
more interesting and more useful to your 
visitors.

Recognizing the Difference Between Traffic and Conversion
 
If you are bringing your business online, you’re going to want a return on 
your investment. If you are a shopping site, you want sales. If you are an 
information site, you want people to hang out and read your content. If 
you’re advertising a newsletter, you want people to sign up for it. These are 
examples of conversions (the actions that a Web site wants visitors to take). 
Getting conversions, not just visitors, is your goal if you have a Web site.
Your keywords are an important part of this. A good, relevant keyword that 
you rank well for brings people to your site, and if your bottom line depends 
on the number of page views you’re getting (how many people are viewing 
your Web site), you’re pretty much set. However, if your keywords aren’t 
providing you with conversions, they could be actually doing you more 
harm than good. Keywords that aren’t generating conversions won’t pay for 
the time, labor, or the bandwidth they take up.
Here is a conversion checklist to help you decide whether your keywords 
are effective:
 
✦ Is your keyword bringing in traffic?
 
✦ Is that traffic bringing you conversions?
 
✦ Are you able to sustain yourself based on those conversions? For 
example, say you have a keyword that brings only one or two conversions 
a year, but those conversions are worth two million dollars each. That 
keyword is a keeper.
 
✦ Is this a great keyword for branding or for an emerging product area? 
The only reason to keep a keyword that isn’t earning you money is if 
that keyword has value as a brand or future investment.
Conversions also depend on your competition. You want to do better than 
the other guy. It’s a simple fact of marketing. But you want higher conversions 
versus high traffic. A Web site that pulls in twelve hundred visitors a month 
but only has three conversions is less of a threat than a Web site that has 
maybe ten visitors a month, but six conversions.
Recognizing the Difference Between 
Traffic and Conversion
While you’re looking at your competitors, make sure that you’re also looking 
at which keywords are making sales versus drawing lots of window shop-
pers. Take note of how specialized they are. People search for broader terms 
when they’re still doing their research and more specialized terms when 
they’re getting ready to make a purchase. Your competitor who is ranked 

150
Recognizing the Difference Between Traffic and Conversion
high for a general keyword might not be raking in the sales like the 
competitor dominating all the niche terms. Sometimes it takes users a lot 
of time and research to decide, so conversions may be slow to happen on 
broad terms.
Mabel’s Classic Car Boutique might have a fantastic, high-ranking Web site, 
but if she has very few conversions, she’s not really someone you should be 
looking at when trying to set the bar for yourself in the competitive market. 
High traffic does not always equal a high conversion rate.
Although a Web site may be high-ranking and well-designed for prime search 
engine optimization, it’s pretty much moot if the site does not provide what 
the user is looking for. If your site’s revenue depends entirely on traffic, you 
want a lot of traffic. But even in that scenario, you also want that traffic to 
stay around and visit the other pages within your site. Web pages with a lot 
of traffic and a high bounce back rate (which means they didn’t check out 
more than one page on the site, or look at the main site for longer than a few 
seconds) aren’t Web pages with a high conversion rate.
On the flip side, you might have a Web site that provides a newsletter, and 
the only way to get conversions is to convince people to sign up for your 
newsletter. A lot of traffic is good, yes, but it only matters if the people who 
are coming to your site do what you want them to do. If no one signs up for 
your newsletter, you get no conversions.
 
Along the same lines, if you have a keyword that draws in a lot of traffic, but 
doesn’t provide you with very many conversions, the keyword could be 
more trouble than it’s worth. It’s using up bandwidth and server space to 
handle all of the traffic, not to mention all the time and effort you spent 
doing your SEO, but not providing you with any income.
A good example of the difference between a lot of traffic and actual conver-
sions is a company we know that needed some optimizing. This company 
did well for itself in the mail-order business, but not so well online. Their 
Web site was not at all search-engine-friendly. After determining that chang-
ing the site’s technology was not an option, they created a research or con-
tent site, as a sister site to the original, that was designed to draw in traffic 
and then send people to the actual, not-optimized Web site where they could 
make purchases. For a while, this worked well, with increased traffic and 
sales, until the company decided to pull down the sister site because they 
felt it was drawing traffic away from their original site! Never mind that the 
sister site was designed to bring in traffic in order to create conversions for 
their original site.

Book III
Chapter 1
Identifying Your 
Competitors
151
Determining True Competitors by Their Measures
The lesson here is that the company shot themselves in the foot by confusing 
traffic with conversions. The sister site increased their sales by drawing in 
the window shoppers and funneling the true customers to the original Web 
site. Keep this in mind while checking your server logs (records that measure 
the amount of traffic your site receives), and don’t freak out if you’re not 
getting insanely huge numbers. If you’re making a lot of sales, it really 
doesn’t matter.
Determining True Competitors by Their Measures
Knowing your competition is very important. In terms of competition, you 
have three basic types: the local brick-and-mortar business, the online 
powerhouse, and the large corporate brand name. These are all different 
markets and need to be treated differently in terms of competing with 
them. What you need to do after doing the research on your competition is 
to figure out who you’re really competing against. Look at all the information 
you’ve gathered. Is Bob, your local business competitor, your main 
competition, or is it Mabel’s online Web site? Or are you competing against 
the big kids on the block, like Ford and Chevy? It all depends on who you are 
and what you’re trying to sell. Bob is not your competition online because 
he doesn’t even have a Web site! Mabel pops up first in the search engine 
results, but she doesn’t do quite what you do. And as for the large 
corporations, it’s probably not even worth trying to compete with them for 
their broad terms.
Consider another example. Say that your brother owns his own car customi-
zation business, but he restores only Volkswagen vans. He doesn’t want to 
rank for the term [Volkswagen] because his is a specialized business and 
Volkswagen is too broad a term. Most people searching for [Volkswagen] 
alone would probably not be looking to restore a Volkswagen van. If he were 
to focus solely on the keyword [Volkswagen], it would do him more harm 
than good because the term is too broad and is already a brand name. What 
he would want to do is rank for the keyword phrase [Volkswagen van resto-
ration] or [Volkswagen bus restoration].
 
Brands are something to watch out for. Most people doing a search for 
[Nike], for example, are not actually looking for running shoes. They’re look-
ing for the brand itself. Trying to rank for the keyword Nike is probably not 
in your best interest because Nike markets a brand more than it does a sin-
gular product. If you were trying to sell running shoes while also trying to 
rank for the keyword [Nike], it’s probably not going to work very well. You 
are much better off concentrating on your niche market than trying to tackle 
the big brands.

152
Sweating the Small Stuff
So assume that you’ve crossed out the big corporations and the smaller 
businesses that aren’t really relevant to what you’re doing. You’ve got a list 
of Web pages that are your true competition. They’re the ones that custom-
ize classic cars just like you do, and rank high on the search engine results 
page. So how are they doing it?
There are tools out there to help with determining how your competition is 
doing. Comscore, Compete, and Hitwise are three such Web sites that offer 
tools designed for online marketers, giving them statistics and a competi-
tive advantage. Comscore (www.comscore.com), Compete (www.compete.
com), and Hitwise (www.hitwise.com) provide tools that measure or gauge 
Internet traffic to Web sites. They collect Internet usage data from panels, 
toolbars, and ISP log panels. Essentially, they can measure who’s coming in 
to your Web site and from where. They also can gauge your competition. 
They can tell you how much your competition is bidding for a certain key-
word, how much they spent on that keyword, and more. They can also track 
your brand name. They’re a statistical tool that online advertisers and site 
owners use to rank sites in various categories on estimated traffic.
 
Unfortunately, all of these services charge a fee for their services, although 
Compete does offer a limited free service called MyCompete. They actually 
cost a pretty penny: ComScore does not publish their pricing, Compete 
starts at $199 a month for an individual plan, and Hitwise starts at $695 per 
report, so if you think it’s worth the investment, look into them. They’re 
useful tools for measuring the traffic to your site and where that traffic came 
from, along with the traffic on your competitor’s Web sites.
Sweating the Small Stuff
Take advantage of what you can control. Every little piece counts, whether 
it’s market research, knowing what kind of traffic your competition is get-
ting, what keywords they’re using, or something else. Do sweat the small 
stuff: It really counts in search engine optimization.
But don’t get discouraged because of all the competition out there: Many 
companies out there don’t know anything about search engine optimization. 
Most major companies don’t even bother with it. Your competition probably 
doesn’t know as much as you know at this point, and you can use that to 
your advantage.

f you read the previous chapter and followed our suggestions, you spent 
some time finding out who your real competitors are on the Web, and you 
might have discovered that they are quite different from your real-world, 
brick-and-mortar competitors. You also found out that for each of your main 
keyword phrases, you probably have a different set of competitors. If you’re 
starting to feel overwhelmed that you’ll never be able to compete in such a 
busy, complicated marketplace, take heart! In this chapter, we show you 
how to get “under the hood” of your competitors’ sites and find out why they 
rank so well.
Realizing That High Rankings Are Achievable
No matter what type of market your business competes in — whether broad-
based or niche, large or small, national or local, corporate or home-based — 
you can achieve high rankings for your Internet pages by applying a little 
diligence and proper search engine optimization (SEO) techniques.
Your site may not be coming up at the top of search engine results for a spe-
cific keyword (yet), but someone else’s is. The Web sites that do rank well 
for your keywords are there for a reason: The search engines find them the 
most relevant. So in the online world, those pages are your competitors, and 
you need to find out what you must do to compete with them. What is the 
barrier to entry into their league? You need a model for what to change, and 
analyzing the pages that do rank well can start to fill in that model.

154
Getting All the Facts on Your Competitors
 
The top-ranking Web pages are not doing things perfectly. That would 
require that they know and understand every single one of Google’s more 
than 200 ranking signals and are targeting them perfectly, which is highly 
improbable. However, they’re working successfully with the search engines 
for the keyword you want. The Web pages listed may not be perfect, but if 
they rank at the top, they are the least imperfect of all the possible sites 
indexed for that keyword. They represent a model that you can emulate so 
that you can join their ranks. To do that, you need to examine them closely.
Getting All the Facts on Your Competitors
Identifying your competition on the Web can be as easy as typing your main 
keywords into Google and seeing which pages rank above your own. (Note: 
If you know that your audience uses another search engine heavily, run your 
search there as well. But with a market share at more than 60 percent and 
climbing, we think Google offers the most efficient research tool.)
You want to know which Web pages make it to the first search engine results 
page. After you weed out the Wikipedia articles and other non-competitive 
results, what are the top four or five Web pages listed? Write down their 
Web addresses (such as www.wiley.com) and keep them handy. Or, if you 
did more in-depth competition gathering in the last chapter, bring those 
results along. We’re going to take you on a research trip to find out what 
makes those sites rank so well for your keywords.
 
You need to know as much as you can about the Web pages that rank well 
for your keywords. The types of things you need to know about your com-
petitors’ Web sites can be divided into three categories:
 
✦ On-page elements (such as content and Title tags and metadata)
 
✦ Links (incoming links to the page from other Web pages, which are 
called backlinks, as well as outbound links to other pages)
 
✦ Site architecture
One basic strategy of SEO is this: Make yourself equal before you set your-
self apart. But you want to analyze the sites that rank well because they are 
the least imperfect. You can work to make your site equal to them in all of 
the ranking factors you know about first. When your page can play on a level 
field with the least imperfect sites, you’ll see your own rankings moving up. 
After that, you can play with different factors and try to become better than 
your competition and outrank them. That’s when the fun of SEO really starts! 
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
As you look at your keyword competitors, you need to figure out what it 
takes to play in their league. What is the bare minimum of effort required 
in order to rank in the top ten results for this keyword? In some cases, you 
might decide the effort required is not worth it. However, figuring out what 
kind of effort is required takes research. You can look at each of their Web 
pages and see them as a human does, to get an overall impression. But 
search engines are your true audience (for SEO, anyway), and they are deaf, 
dumb, and blind. They can’t experience the images, videos, music, tricks, 
games, bells, and whistles that may be on a site. They can only read what’s 
there, count everything that can be boiled down to numbers, and analyze it. 
To understand what makes a site rank in a search engine, you need research 
tools that help you think like a search engine.
Table 2-1 outlines the different research tools and procedures we cover in 
this chapter for doing competitor research. Although SEO tools abound, you 
can generally categorize them into four basic types of information-gathering: 
on-page factors, Web server factors, relevancy, and site architecture. For 
each category of information gathering, we’ve picked out one or two tools 
and procedures to show you.

Of the three types of information you want to know about your competitors’ 
Web pages — their on-page elements, links, and architecture — a good place 
to start is the on-page elements. You want to find out what keywords your 
competitors use and how they’re using them, look at their content, and ana-
lyze their other on-page factors.

156
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
Behind every Web page’s pretty face is a plain skeleton of black-and-white 
HTML called source code. You can see a Web page’s source code easily by 
choosing Source or Page Source from your browser’s View menu. If you 
understand HTML, you can look under the hood of a competitor’s Web page. 
However, you don’t have to understand HTML for this book, or even to do 
search engine optimization. We’re going to show you a tool that can read 
and digest a page’s source code for you, and then spit out some statistics 
that you’ll find very useful.
We do recommend that you know at least some HTML or learn it in the 
future: Your search engine optimization campaign will be a great deal easier 
for you to manage if you can make the changes to your site on your own. 
You can check out HTML 4 For Dummies, 5th Edition by Ed Tittel and Mary 
Burmeister, published by Wiley, if you need a primer on HTML.
 
Cleaning up the on-page elements of your Web site alone may give you a lot 
of bang for your SEO buck. Because they’re on your own Web site, you have 
a lot of control, and changes such as modifying your Meta tags should take 
little effort. Often sites see major leaps in their search engine ranking just by 
fixing what’s out of whack in their Web pages.
 
You may be tempted, in the early stages of your research, to conclude that 
a competitor’s site doesn’t deserve its high rankings. But don’t. As you con-
tinue to collect data, you will discover why they rank well. Gathering accu-
rate data and plenty of it can mean the difference between drawing brash 
conclusions and forming an effective strategy.
Grasping the tools for competitive 
research: The Page Analyzer
The Page Analyzer tool tells you what a Web page’s keywords are (by identi-
fying every word and phrase that’s used at least twice) and computes their 
density. Keyword density is a percentage indicating the number of times the 
keyword occurs compared to the total number of words in the page. We also 
cover the Page Analyzer in Book II, Chapter 5, as it applies to analyzing your 
own Web site. When you run a competitor’s page through the Page Analyzer, 
it lets you analyze the on-page factors that help the Web page rank well in 
search engines. Subscribers to the SEOToolSet can simply run the Multi-Page 
Analyzer, but for those just using the free version of the Page Analyzer, we’ve 
included a step-by-step process to building a comparison tool for yourself.
Because you’re going to run the Page Analyzer report for several of your 
competitors’ sites and work with some figures, it’s time to grab a pencil and 
paper. Better yet, open a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, 
which is an SEO’s best friend. Excel comes with most Microsoft Office pack-
ages, so if you have Word, chances are you already have it. Microsoft Excel 
allows you to arrange and compare data in rows and columns, similar to a

paper ledger or accounts book. (We’re going to talk about Microsoft Excel, 
but you might have another spreadsheet program such as Google Docs and 
PlanMaker, and those are fine, too.)
Here’s how to set up your spreadsheet:
 
1. In Excel, open a new spreadsheet and call it Competitors.
 
2. Type a heading for column A that says URL or something that makes 
sense to you.
 
 In this first column, you’re going to list your competitors’ Web pages, 
one per row.
 
3. Under column A’s heading, type the URL (the Web page address, such 
as www.bruceclay.com) for each competing Web page (the pages 
that are ranking well in search results).
 
 You can just copy and paste the URLs individually from the search 
results page if that’s easier than typing them in.
Now you’re ready to run the Page Analyzer report for each competitor. You 
can use the free version of this tool available through our Web site. Here’s 
how to run the Page Analyzer:
 
1. Go to www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html.
 
2. In the Page Analyzer section (the fourth tool down), enter a competi-
tor’s URL (such as www.competitor.com) in the URL to Check text box.
 
3. Click the Check Keyword Densities button and wait while the report is 
prepared.
While you run this report for one of your own competitors, we’re going to 
use a Page Analyzer report we ran on a competitor for our classic custom 
cars Web site. The whole Page Analyzer report contains a lot of useful infor-
mation (including ideas for keywords you might want to use on your own 
site), but what we’re trying to gather now are some basic counts of the com-
petitor’s on-page content. So we want you to zero in on a row of data that’s 
about halfway down the report shown in Figure 2-1, which shows a quick 
summary of some important page content counts.
Next, you’re going to record these summary counts in your spreadsheet. We 
suggest you create some more column headings in your spreadsheet, one for 
each of the following eight bold items (which we also explain here):
 
✦ Meta Title: This count shows how many words are in the page’s Title 
tag (which is part of the HTML code that gets read by the search 
engines).
 
✦ Meta Description: Shows how many words are in the Description Meta 
tag (also part of the page’s HTML code).

158
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
 
✦ Meta Keywords: Shows how many words are in the Keywords Meta tag 
(ditto).
 
✦ Heads: The number of headings in the text (using HTML Heading tags).
 
✦ Alt Codes: The number of Alt attributes (descriptive text placed in the 
HTML for an image file) assigned to images on the page.
 
✦ Hyperlinks: The number of links on the page.
 
✦ All Body Words: The number of words in the page text that’s readable 
by humans.
 
✦ All Words: The total number of words in the page content, including on-
screen text plus HTML tags, navigation, and other.
Now that you have the first several columns labeled, start typing in the 
counts from the report for this competitor. So far, your Excel spreadsheet 
should look similar to Figure 2-2, which shows data from the first competitor 
filled in.

data easier.
 
Next, run the Page Analyzer report for each of your other competitors’ URLs. 
You’re just gathering data at this point, so let yourself get into the rhythm of 
running the report, filling in the data, and then doing it all over again. After 
you’ve run the Page Analyzer for all of your competitors, you should have a 
spreadsheet that looks something like Figure 2-3.
After you’ve gathered some raw numbers, what can you do with them? 
You’re trying to find out what’s “normal” for the sites that are ranking well 
for your keyword. So far you’ve gathered data on eight different factors that 
are part of the search engines’ ranking systems. Now it’s just simple math 
to calculate an average for each factor. You can do it the old-fashioned way, 
but Excel makes this super-easy if you use the AutoSum feature in the tool-
bar. As Figure 2-4 shows, just click to highlight a cell below the column you 
want to average, click the triangle next to the AutoSum tool, and then select 
Average from the small menu that appears.
When you select Average, Excel automatically selects the column of num-
bers above, so press Enter to approve the selection. Your average appears 
in the highlighted field.

You can create an average for each of the remaining columns in literally one 
step. (You can see why we like Excel!) In Figure 2-4, if you look at the black-
outlined cell next to the word Averages, notice the slightly enlarged black 
square in the lower right-hand corner. Click and drag that little square to 
the right, all the way across all the columns that have data, and then let go. 
Averages should now display for each column because you just copied the 
AutoSum Average function across all the columns where you have data.
Figure 2-5 shows what your finished spreadsheet might look like, with the 
Page Analyzer data from all of your top competitors and an average for each 
of the eight ranking factors.
You can next run a Page Analyzer on your own Web site and compare these 
averages to your own figures to see how far you’re off from your target. For 
now, just keep this spreadsheet handy and know that you’ve taken some 
good strides down the SEO path of information gathering. In the next chap-
ter, we go into depth, showing you how to use the data you gathered here, 
and begin to plan the changes to your Web site to raise your search engine 
rankings.

The Multi-Page Analyzer makes short work of analyzing all your competitors’ 
Web pages at once. Unfortunately, we don’t know of any free versions of this 
tool, but you can subscribe to a number of different SEO tool vendors online 
who provide this and many other worthwhile tools for a fee, including the 
SEOToolSet. Fees for these vary based on the product, but the SEOToolSet is 
$39.95 per month.
Discovering more tools for competitive research
Beyond the Page Analyzer, there are some other tricks that you can use 
to size up your competition. Some of this may seem a little technical, but 
we introduce each tool and trick as we come to it. We even explain what 
you need to look for. Don’t worry: We won’t turn you loose with a bunch 
of techie reports and expect you to figure out how to read them. In each 
case, there are specific items you need to look for (and you can pretty much 
ignore the rest).

Mining the source code
Have you ever looked at the underside of a car? Even if it’s a shiny new 
luxury model fresh off the dealer’s lot, the underbelly just isn’t very pretty. 
Yet the car’s real value is hidden there, in its inner workings. And to a 
trained mechanic’s eye, it can be downright beautiful.
You’re going to look at the underside of your competitors’ Web sites, their 
source code, and identify some important elements. Remember that we’re 
just gathering facts at this point. You want to get a feel for how this Web 
page is put together and notice any oddities. You may find that the page 
seems to be breaking all the best-practice rules, but ranking well anyway 
somehow — in a case like that, they’re obviously doing something else very 
right (such as having tons of backlinks pointing to the page). On the other 
hand, you might discover that this is a very SEO-savvy competitor that could 
be hard to beat.
To look at the source code, do the following:
 
1. View a competitor’s Web page (the particular page that ranks well 
in searches for your keyword, which may or may not be their home 
page) in your browser.

Book III
Chapter 2
Competitive 
Research Techniques 
and Tools
163
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
 
2. From the View menu, choose Source or Page Source (depending on 
the browser).
 
As you look at the source code, keep in mind that the more extra stuff it con-
tains, the more diluted the real content becomes. For good search engine 
ranking, a Web page needs content that’s as clean as possible. Too much 
HTML, script, and coding can slow down page loading time, bog down the 
search engine spiders, and, most importantly, dilute your keyword content 
and reduce your ranking. Webmasters may not agree with this principle, but 
from an SEO perspective, a Web page should be a lean, mean, content-rich 
machine. Want to see if your competitor is doing things right? Look for these 
types of best practices:
 
✦ Use an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file to control formatting of 
text and images. Using style sheets eliminates font tags that clutter up 
the text. Using a CSS that’s in an external file gets rid of a whole block of 
HTML code that could otherwise clog the top section of your Web page 
and slow everything down (search engines especially).
 
✦ JavaScript code should also be off the page in an external JS file (for the 
same clutter-busting reasons).
 
✦ Get to the meat in the first hundred lines. The actual text content (the 
part users read in the Body section) shouldn’t be too far down in the 
page code. We recommend limiting the code above the first line of user-
viewable text overall.
You want to get a feel for how this Web page is put together. Pay attention to 
issues such as
 
✦ Doctype: Does it show a Doctype at the top? If so, does the Doctype vali-
date with W3C standards? (Note: We explain this in Book IV, Chapter 3 in 
our recommendations for your own Web site.)
 
✦ Title, description, keywords: Look closely at the Head section (between 
the opening and closing Head tags). Does it contain the Title, Meta 
Description, and Meta Keywords tags? If you ran the Page Analyzer for 
this page earlier in the chapter, you already know these answers, but 
now notice how the tags are arranged. The best practice for SEO puts 
them in this order: Title, Description, Keywords. Does the competitor’s 
page do that?
 
✦ Other Meta tags: Also notice any additional Meta tags (“revisit after” is 
a popular and perfectly useless one) in the Head section. Webmasters 
can make up all sorts of creative Meta tags, sometimes with good rea-
sons that may outweigh the cost of expanding the page code. However, 
if you see that a competitor’s page has a hundred different Meta tags, 
you can be pretty sure they don’t know much about SEO.

164
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
 
✦ Heading tags: Search engines look for heading tags such as H1, H2, H3, 
and so forth to confirm what the page is about. It’s logical to assume 
that a site will make its most important concepts look like headings, so 
these heading tags help search engines determine the page’s keywords. 
See whether and how your competitor uses these tags. (We explain the 
best practices for heading tags in Book IV, Chapter 1, where we cover 
good SEO site design.)
 
✦ Font tags, JavaScript, CSS: As we mentioned in the previous set of bul-
lets, if these things show up in the code, the page is weighted down and 
not very SEO-friendly. Outranking it might end up being easier than you 
thought.
Seeing why server setup makes a difference
Even after you’ve checked out the source code for your competitor’s pages, 
you’re still in information-gathering mode, sizing up everything you can 
about your biggest competitors for your chosen keywords. The next step 
isn’t really an on-page element; it’s more the foundation of the site. We’re 
looking beyond the page now at the actual process that displays the page, 
which is on the server level. In this step, you find out how a competitor’s 
server looks to a search engine by running a Site Checker utility.
Generally, an SEO-friendly site should be free of server problems such as 
improper redirects (a command that detours you from one page to another 
that the search engine either can’t follow or is confused by) and other 
obstacles that can stop a search spider in its tracks. When you run the Site 
Checker utility, it attempts to crawl the site the same way a search engine 
spider does and then spits out a report. In the case of our tool (available as 
part of the SEOToolSet for free on www.seotoolset.com), the report lists 
any indexing obstacles it encounters, such as improper redirects, robot dis-
allows, cloaking, virtual IPs, block lists, and more. Even if a page’s content is 
perfect, a bad server can keep it from reaching its full potential in the search 
engine rankings.
You can use any Site Checker tool you have access to, but we’re going to rec-
ommend ours because we know it works, returns all the information we just 
mentioned, and it’s free. Here’s how you can run the free Site Checker:
 
1. Go to www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html.
 
2. Under the heading Site Checker, enter the URL of the site you want 
to check in the Web Page text box, and then click the Site Checker 
button.
 
The SEOToolSet Site Checker tool reads the robots text (.txt) file on a Web 
site, which contains instructions for the search spiders when they come to 
index the site. Because you don’t want the first thing a search engine finds 
to be a File Not Found error, you definitely want to have a robots text file on 

Book III
Chapter 2

and Tools
165
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
your own Web site. Even an empty file is preferable to having no file at all. 
Search engines always check for one, and if no file exists, your server returns 
a File Not Found error. (More on robots text files in Book VII, Chapter 1.)
When we ran the Site Checker report for our classic cars site’s top competi-
tor, it looked like Figure 2-6.
In the report shown in Figure 2-6, you can see that they have a Sitemap.
xml file which serves to direct incoming bots. The more important item to 
notice, however, is the number 200 that displays in the Header Info section. 
This is the site’s server status code, and 200 means their server is A-okay 
and is able to properly return the page requested.
The chart in Table 2-2 explains the most common server status codes. 
These server statuses are standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C), so they mean the same thing to everyone. The official definitions can 
be found on their site at www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-
sec10.html if you want to research further. We go into server code stan-
dards in greater depth in Book IV. Here, we boil down the technical language 
into understandable English to show you what each server status code really 
means to you.

200
OK
The Web page 
appears as 
expected.
The server and Web page have 
the welcome mat out for the 
search engine spiders (and 
users too). This is not-so-good 
news for you, but it isn’t sur-
prising either because this site 
ranks well.
301
Moved 
Permanently
The Web page 
has been 
redirected 
permanently to 
another Web 
page URL.
When a search engine spider 
sees this status code, it simply 
moves to the appropriate other 
page.
302
Found (Moved 
Temporarily)
The Web page 
has been 
moved tempo-
rarily to a dif-
ferent URL.
This status should raise a red 
flag. Although there are sup-
posedly legitimate uses for a 
302 Redirect code, they can 
cause serious problems with 
search engines and could even 
indicate something malicious 
is going on. Spammers fre-
quently use 302 Redirects.
400
Bad Request
The server 
could not 
understand 
the request 
because of bad 
syntax.
This could be caused by a 
typo in the URL. Whatever the 
cause, it means the search 
engine spider is blocked from 
reaching the content pages.
401
Unauthorized
The request 
requires user 
authentication.
The server requires a login 
in order to enter the page 
requested.
403
Forbidden
The server 
understood 
the request, 
but refuses to 
fulfill it.
Indicates a technical problem 
that would cause a roadblock 
for a search engine spider. (This 
is all the better for you, although 
it may only be temporary).

The 500–505 status codes indi-

The other thing you want to glean from the Site Checker report is whether 
the page is cloaked. The Cloak Check runs through the site identifying itself 
as five different services — Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Googlebot, 
Slurp, and MSNbot — to ensure that they all match (Figure 2-7).
 
Figure 2-7:

report.
 
To manually detect whether a competitor’s site uses cloaking (showing one 
version of a page’s content to users, but a different version to the spiders), 
you need to compare the spiderable version to the version that you are 
viewing as a user. So do a search that you know includes that Web page in 
the results set, and click the Cached link under that URL when it appears. 
This shows you the Web page as it looked to the search engine the last time it 
was spidered. Keeping in mind that the current page may have been changed 
a little in the meantime, compare the two versions. If you see entirely differ-
ent content, you’re probably looking at cloaking.

168
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
Tracking down competitor links
So far, we’ve been showing you how to examine your competitors’ on-page 
elements and their server issues. It’s time to look at another major category 
that determines search engine relevance: backlinks.
 
Backlinks are the hypertext links that a user clicks to jump from one Web 
page to another. You can have backlinks on your own site, such as when you 
include navigation links to your main landing pages in the footer throughout 
your site, or they can be links on third-party Web sites.
Why do search engines care so much about backlinks? Well, it boils down 
to the search engines’ eternal quest to find the most relevant sites for their 
users. They reason that if another Web page thinks your Web page is worthy 
of a link, it must have value. Every backlink to a Web page acts as a vote of 
confidence in that page.
The search engines literally count these “votes.” It’s similar in some ways to 
an election, but with one major exception: not every backlink has an equal 
vote. For one thing, the anchor text of the link itself makes a big difference. 
Anchor text refers to the actual words that can be clicked, and backlinks 
must contain your keywords in their anchor text to tell the search engine 
what your site is about. If the link is simply Click Here or the URL, the search 
engine won’t actually count it as a vote. (We cover the other factors that 
make inbound and outbound links count towards your search engine ranking 
in Book IV, Chapter 4.)
In the search engines’ eyes, the number of backlinks to a Web page increases 
its expertness factor (and yes, that is a word, because we say so). Lots of 
backlinks indicate the page’s popularity and make it appear more trustwor-
thy as a relevant source of information on a subject. This alone can cause a 
page to rank much higher in search engine results when the links come from 
related sites and use meaningful, keyword-rich anchor text.
You can find out how many backlinks your competitors have using tools that 
the search engines themselves provide:
 
✦ Using Google: In the regular search box, type the query [“domain.
com” -site:domain.com], substituting the competing page’s URL for 
domain.com. This returns all pages that mention your site, usually as a 
link (and if it isn’t, you can ask them to make it a link!) You can also use 
[link:domain.com] but the numbers are less accurate.
 
✦ Using Yahoo!: Go to http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com and 
enter the competing URL in the Explore URL box.

Chapter 2
Competitive 
Research Techniques 
and Tools
169
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
 
You may want to run these tests for both the www.domain.com and 
domain.com (the second time, without the www. in front). Sites may have 
these URLs as separate Web pages. Searching with the non-www version 
produces results from www and non-www, plus any other sub-domains the 
site may be using.
You may notice that there’s a huge disparity between the counts that Google 
and Yahoo! return. (For example, when running our classic custom cars com-
petitors through both tools, Google link: command returned 175 links versus 
Yahoo! returning 12,102 links. Like we said, the disparity is huge.) That’s 
normal. Google’s link: operator shows you only a sample set of the link 
data, not an exhaustive list (no matter what they say). Yahoo!’s results, on 
the other hand, show you everything — they include not only every hyper-
text link that they are aware of, but also image links, every time the URL is 
used in text somewhere (even if it’s not linked), and even redirects. So you 
either get too little or too much, but that’s okay for SEO purposes.
 
You can look at the numbers to get an idea, proportionately, of how many 
inbound links each Web page has that’s outranking yours. The numbers 
aren’t really accurate in themselves, but they give you a gauge for compari-
son. For instance, if you’re trying to optimize your classic custom cars Web 
page for the same keyword as a page that has 12,000 backlinks to it, and 
your page only has 50, you know it’s going to be an uphill battle. In fact, you 
might decide that optimizing that page for that keyword isn’t where you 
want to spend your energy . . . but we cover making those kinds of decisions 
in the next chapter.
You want to track your competitors’ backlink counts; this is very useful raw 
data. We suggest adding more columns to your competitor-data spreadsheet 
and record both the Google and Yahoo! numbers there so you can compare 
them to your own.
 
The link results display in pretty much random order. If you want to work 
with them, you can export the Yahoo! link results using the Export Results 
to: TSV link. This dumps all the link data into a TSV (tab-separated value) file 
that you can import into an Excel spreadsheet (each value in its own cell), 
and then re-sort as desired.
Sizing up your opponent
If you walk onto a battlefield, you want to know how big your opponent is. 
Are you facing a small band of soldiers, or an entire army with battalions of 
troops and air support? This brings us to the discussion of the Web site as a 
whole, and what you can learn about it.

170
Calculating the Requirements for Rankings
So far we’ve focused a lot on the individual Web pages that rank well against 
yours. But each individual page is also part of a Web site containing many 
pages of potentially highly relevant supporting content. If it’s an army, you 
need to know.
To find out how big a Web site is, you can use a simple Google search with 
the site: operator in front of the domain, as follows:
 
1. At Google.com, enter [site:domain.com] in the search box (leaving 
out the square brackets, and using the competitor’s domain) and then 
click Search.
 
2. When the results page comes up, scroll to the bottom and click the 
highest page number that shows up (usually 10).
 
 Doing this causes the total number of pages to recalculate at the top of 
the page.
 
3. Notice the total number of pages shown at the top of the page (in 
Results 91 - 100 of about ###).
 
 The “of about ###” number represents the approximate number of 
indexed pages in the site. (Google never tells anyone everything they 
know.)
 
4. Now navigate to the very last page of the results by changing the 
“start=” value in the URL to 999 and press enter.
 
 The count shown there represents the filtered results. Google doesn’t 
actually show you as many pages as it claimed to find at first. A very 
large disparity between the two counts most likely indicates that there 
are lots of pages with duplicate content in this Web site.
 
For performance reasons, Google doesn’t display all of the indexed pages, 
but omits the ones that seem most like duplicates. If you truly want to see 
all of the indexed listings for a site, you can navigate to the very last results 
page of your [site:] query and click the option to Repeat the Search with 
the Omitted Results Included. (Even then, Google only shows up to a maxi-
mum of 1,000 listings.) Pull out your competitor-data spreadsheet again and 
record the total number of indexed pages (filtered and total) for each site in 
new columns.
If you want to check the number of indexed pages in Yahoo! and Microsoft 
Live Search, we recommend you try the free Search Engine Saturation tool 
available from Marketleap (www.marketleap.com).
Comparing your content
You’ve been pulling in lots of data, but data does not equal analysis. Now it’s 
time to run research tools on your own Web page and find out how you com-
pare to your competition.

Penetrating the Veil of Search Engine Secrecy
Run a Page Analyzer report for your Web page, and compare your on-page 
elements to the figures you collected in your competitor-data spreadsheet 
(earlier in this chapter). Next, check your own backlink counts using Google 
and Yahoo! (see the previous section for details on how to do this). Record 
all the numbers with today’s date so that you have a benchmark measure-
ment of the “before” picture before you start doing your SEO.
After you have metrics for the well-ranked pages and your own page, you 
can tell at a glance how far off your page is from its competitors. The factors 
in your spreadsheet are all known to be important to search engine ranking, 
but they aren’t the only factors, not by a long shot. Google has more than 
200 factors in its algorithm, and they change constantly. However, having 
a few that you can measure and act on gives you a starting place for your 
search engine optimization project.
Penetrating the Veil of Search Engine Secrecy
The search engines tell you a lot, but not the whole story. Search engines 
claim that the secrecy surrounding their algorithms is necessary because 
of malicious spammers, who would alter their sites deceptively for the sole 
purpose of higher rankings. It’s in the search engines’ best interests to keep 
their methods a secret; after all, if they published a list of dos and don’ts and 
just what their limits and boundaries are, then the spammers would know 
the limits of the search engines’ spam catching techniques. Also, secrecy 
leaves the search engines free to modify things any time they need to. Google 
changes their algorithm frequently. For instance, in just six months in 2007, 
Google’s algorithm changed 450 times. No one knows what changed, how big 
the changes were, or when exactly they occurred. Instead of giving out the 
algorithm, search engines merely provide guidelines as to their preferences. 
This is why we say that SEO is an art, not just a science: Too many unknown 
factors are out of your control, so a lot of finesse and intuition is involved.
Other factors can complicate rankings as well. Here’s a brief list of factors 
that have nothing to do with changes on the Web sites themselves that can 
cause search engine rankings to fluctuate:
 
✦ The search engine changed its algorithm and now weighs factors 
differently.
 
✦ The search engine may be testing something new (a temporary change).
 
✦ The index being queried is coming from a different data center. (Google, 
for instance, has more than 100 data centers in different locations, 
which may have different versions of the index.)
 
✦ The search engine had a technical problem and restored data temporar-
ily from cache or a backup version.
 
✦ Data may not be up-to-date (depending on when the search engine last 
crawled the Web sites).

172
Diving into SERP Research
If it seems like playing on the search engine field is too unpredictable, 
remember that at least you’re in good company. Your competitors can’t 
control the game any more than you can. You don’t know what the search 
engine is looking for exactly, and you don’t know all the parts of the algo-
rithm; however, you do know some of the ranking factors. So do sweat the 
small stuff when it comes to SEO — work on everything you can. The excit-
ing thing is that your competitors may know less than you do, or may be 
completely ignorant when it comes to optimizing their sites.
Within the broad field of marketing, Internet marketing represents a narrow 
specialty. In that narrow field is the narrower field of search marketing and 
within that is search engine optimization. As Figure 2-8 shows, SEO is an 
extremely specialized field. All marketers don’t know Internet marketing, all 
Internet marketers do not know search marketing, and all search marketers 
don’t know SEO. Search engine optimization is really the technical end of 
Internet marketing, and it takes a somewhat technical mind to grasp it.

Diving into SERP Research
You can use the search engines to help you analyze your competitors in 
many ways. You’re going to switch roles now and pretend for a moment that 
the high-ranking site is yours. This helps you better understand the site that 
is a model for what yours can become.
Start with a competitor’s site that’s ranking high for your keyword in the 
search engine results pages (SERPs). You want to find out why this Web page 
ranks so well. It may be due to one of the following.

Diving into SERP Research
 
✦ Backlinks: Find out how many backlinks the Web page has. Run a search 
at Google for [“www.domain.com/page.htm” =site:domain.com], 
substituting the competitor’s Web page URL. The number of results is 
an indicator of the site’s popularity with other Web pages. If it’s high, 
and especially if the links come from related, industry sites with good 
PageRank themselves, backlinks alone could be why the page tops the list.
 
✦ Different URL: Run a search for your keyword on Google to see the 
results page. Notice the URL that displays for the competitor’s list-
ing. Keeping that in mind, click the link to go to the active page. In the 
address bar, compare the URL showing to the one you remembered. 
Are they the same? Are they different? If they’re different, how different? 
Although an automatic redirect from http://domain.com to http://
www.domain.com (or vice versa) is normal, other types of swaps may 
indicate that something fishy is going on. Do the cache check in the next 
bullet to find out whether the page the search engine sees is entirely dif-
ferent than the one live visitors are shown.
 
✦ Cached version: If you’ve looked at the Web page and can’t figure out 
why it would rank well, the search engine may have a different ver-
sion of the page in its cache (its saved archive version of the page). 
Whenever the search engine indexes a Web site, it stores the data in its 
cache. Note that some Web sites are not cached, such as the first time a 
site is crawled or if the spider is being told not to cache the page (using 
the Meta robots noarchive instruction), or if there is an error in the 
search engine’s database.
 
 To see the cached version of a page:
 
1. Run a search on Google for your keyword.
 
2. Locate the competitor’s listing in the results. Click Cached in the last 
line of the listing.
 
3. View the cached version of the Web page. At the top of the page, you 
can read the date and time it was last spidered. You can also easily 
view how your keywords distribute throughout the page in high-
lighted colors.
 
A good way to look at Web pages the way a search engine spider sees them 
is to use the text-only Lynx browser. Google actually recommends (in their 
Webmaster Guidelines at www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/
answer.py?answer=35769) that you use a text browser such as Lynx 
to examine your site, which helps you see your site exactly how a search 
engine sees it without the benefit of video, images, audio, or any other 
Engagement Object. You can install the Lynx browser for free, so if you’re 
interested, go for it. If you don’t want to install an entirely new browser, we 
recommend installing the SEMToolBar (www.bruceclay.com/web_rank.
htm#semtoolbar), which has a View Text mode that accomplishes the 
same thing without requiring you to leave your IE or Firefox browser.

Doing More SERP Research, Yahoo! and Microsoft Style
Doing More SERP Research, Yahoo! 
and Microsoft Style
There is a difference between SERP research with Google and SERP research 
with Yahoo! and Microsoft Live Search. For one thing, you might find the 
rankings quite different; the competitor you’ve been analyzing may not 
even show up in the top-ranking Web pages for these other search engines. 
Because Google has the lion’s share of traffic, many sites focus their opti-
mization efforts there exclusively. Whether you want to examine your com-
petitor’s pages as seen through Yahoo! or Microsoft’s eyes depends on how 
much your target audience tends to use those search engines. Do you get 
enough potential traffic to warrant SEO efforts on multiple fronts? That’s up 
to you, but here’s how you can do it.
To check backlinks:
 
✦ Using Yahoo!, go to http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com to 
check how many backlinks a Web page has. Enter the URL for the com-
peting Web page in the Explore URL text box. At the top of the Results 
page, the number of Inlinks represents Yahoo!’s backlink count.
 
✦ Microsoft hasn’t actually built a tool to check backlinks in their 
search engine. We suggest using a third-party free tool called the Link 
Popularity Check, available at www.marketleap.com. This gives you 
figures for Google, MSN (Microsoft Live Search), and Yahoo!, so you can 
pull out the MSN ones.
To check for URL differences:
Follow the same procedure that we discuss in the “Different URL” bullet of 
the previous section “Diving into SERP Research,” but this time, run your 
searches in Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and in Microsoft Live Search (www.
msn.com).
To check the cached pages:
 
✦ In the Yahoo! search results, click Cached beneath the competitor’s 
listing to view the cached version of the page. You can see your search 
terms highlighted on the cached page, but Yahoo! doesn’t reveal the 
date and time it last crawled the site.
 
✦ For Microsoft Live Search, click Cached Page below the competitor’s list-
ing. The cached version of the page displays, showing the date the site 
was last indexed at the top (but with no highlighting on your keywords.).

Increasing your Web Savvy with the SEMToolBar
Increasing your Web Savvy with the SEMToolBar
As you’re running searches for your keywords to scan the competition, it’s 
helpful to have special intelligence about the results. There are many free 
browser plug-ins (software applications that enhance a Web browser’s exist-
ing features) available online that you can install to display extra information 
about each Web page at a glance. These plug-ins make your competitor and 
keyword research quicker and easier, necessitating less switching back and 
forth between tools. Our SEMToolBar (available free at www.bruceclay.
com/web_rank.htm#semtoolbar) is one such plug-in. The toolbar has 
some incredibly useful features that can help you with competitor research 
and optimizing your Web site. It also supports 20 different languages and has 
features that help if you’re trying to optimize a site for another geographical 
market, whether inside the U.S. or abroad.
You can install the toolbar for Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browsers. 
After it’s installed, it shows up at the top of the browser window with your 
other toolbars. The SEMToolBar gives you a big advantage for doing compet-
itive research, finding keywords, identifying your target demographic so you 
can cater your landing pages to them, looking for sites to request links from, 
or just checking out someone’s Web site.
Here’s how it changes search engine results pages (SERPs) so you can see 
more data on the fly:
 
✦ Keyword statistics: A box with important keyword data displays at the 
top of the SERP. The various results include approximately how many 
times the keyword is searched each day, the categories it’s considered 
to be part of, statistics related to paid search advertising for that key-
word, the demographics (age and gender) of people who search for that 
keyword, and the keyword’s search volume over the past 12 months, 
shown as a line graph.
 
✦ Search result info: SERPs look a little different because the toolbar num-
bers the results so that it’s easier to see ranking and also adds an extra 
line below each result. The extra line shows you when each domain was 
registered, how many backlinks the page has, its PageRank, and other 
facts that the average Web user doesn’t know. You can even highlight 
certain domains/pages so they stand out in search results, allowing you 
to easily spot your results every time you search. These features work 
in Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Live Search. (You can see a toolbar-
enhanced SERP in Figure 2-9. Clicking on the + box to the left of the 
annotation gives you additional data.)

SERPs with

and facts

Web page.
 
Enhanced SERP with the SEO toolbar
 
The toolbar also helps you when you’re browsing the Internet. You can look 
at the toolbar to see things about the current Web page, like its backlink 
count, PageRank, date the domain started, and other facts that help you 
determine how viable the Web page is. When you’re looking for good sites to 
request links from, for instance, the toolbar can really come in handy to give 
you the scoop on a potential candidate.
You can conveniently run searches from the toolbar directly and specify the 
search engine, keywords, and proxy location (where you want the search to 
run from). For instance, imagine you’re working on an Australian version of 
your Web site and you want to see how you’re ranking there. You could run 
a search as if you were in Sydney, even though you’re really in California. 
This feature is called proxy search, and it lets you run a search as if you were 
physically at a computer in another place.
Being able to run a search as if you’re in another place gives you a huge 
advantage when optimizing a site for local search somewhere else. Search 
engines increasingly personalize the results to each individual searcher 
and localize the results geographically, when it’s appropriate. So proxy 
search gives you a way to get around these obstacles and run searches from 
another place (without having to buy a plane ticket and go there).

Increasing your Web Savvy with the SEMToolBar
 
The SEMToolBar is free, but it is powered by the SEOToolSet, which is a sub-
scription-based service (available at $39.95 a month). If you are a subscriber 
to the SEOToolSet, the toolbar gets even more robust, with tie-ins to the full 
tool set. For instance, the extra line beneath search results also shows how 
much a particular page known to the SEOToolSet has gone up or down in 
rankings for a particular keyword. However, you don’t need to subscribe in 
order for the toolbar to be extremely useful to your optimization efforts. The 
SEMToolBar has other features geared to helping you do SEO beyond what 
we’ve covered here. We invite you to download it and try it out for yourself.

Y
our real competitors online are the sites that show up at the top of 
the results whenever someone searches for your keywords (words 
or phrases people enter as a search query), not necessarily the big name 
brand in your industry. So if you want your classic car customization busi-
ness to rank well in the search engines, for example, you can run searches 
for your main keywords to see who your competition is.
If you just finished the exercises in Chapters 1 and 2 of this minibook, you 
should have a spreadsheet full of data on your top competitors. Looking at 
the Web pages that the search engines find most relevant for your keywords 
is a crucial step in your search engine optimization (SEO). Looking at them, 
you can find out what’s “natural” for your competition. For example, you 
could find that all of the top-ranked Web pages have more than 1,000 words 
of text. You can be pretty sure that if you’re going to rank well for that 
keyword, you’re going to have to beef up your page’s content to match the 
competition.
Search engines include many different page factors in their algorithms (in 
this context, formulas for determining a Web page’s relevance to a key-
word), which they use to decide the order Web pages are listed in a search 
engine results page (SERP). For each ranking factor, it’s impossible to know 
exactly what the search engine considers to be a “perfect” score. But you 
can look at the top ranking sites for clues because they’re most consistently 
ranked for top keyword categories. Of the more than 200 different ranking 
signals in Google’s algorithm, some are known, but many remain a mystery. 
For all of the known ranking factors, the sites that rank well are the ones 
that are the “least imperfect” in the search engine’s eyes. So it’s a good idea 
to try to make yourself equal to them before you try to set yourself apart.

180
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
In this chapter, you take the data you’ve gathered on your top competitors 
and apply it to your own Web site. In other words, you’re going to figure 
out how to make yourself equal and then better than your competition. We 
talk about the best practices for some of these page elements, which help 
you make good decisions on how far to go in making yourself equivalent. 
You also look beyond page elements to other data about your competitors, 
including their backlinks (incoming links to a Web page), their content struc-
ture, and what kinds of images, videos, and other types of objects they have 
on their site to engage users. All of this helps you understand what you need 
to do to make your site compete in the search engines.
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
It’s time to look at your own Web site and see how it’s measuring up. 
Examine your main landing pages, which are the pages best suited for 
searchers looking for your main keywords. You generally need a minimum 
of one landing page with at least five secondary or supporting pages/articles 
dedicated to each of your main keywords so that users searching for them 
click your link and arrive at a page that delivers just what they’re looking for. 
You should also have secondary keywords on those pages, but the point is 
to have focused content that has the main keyword distributed throughout. 
(For more information, check out Book II, Chapter 3.)
Landing page construction
The way your landing pages are put together matters to search engines and 
helps them determine the relevance of each page. The engines count every-
thing that can be quantified, like the total number of words, how many times 
your keywords are repeated on the page (prominence), and so forth. It pays 
to make your page construction line up with what the search engines con-
sider to be optimal for each of these elements as much as possible.
In the previous chapter, we explained how to do research on your top com-
petitors using the Page Analyzer report (which compiles statistics about a 
Web page such as its keyword density, a percentage indicating the number 
of times the keyword occurs compared to the total number of words in the 
page). We recommended that you put your data in a spreadsheet like the 
one in Figure 3-1, which pulls together stats from four different competitor’s 
Web pages.
Notice that there are eight columns of data for each competitor, and the 
numbers they contain are straight off of the Page Analyzer report. Also 
notice the Averages row at the bottom, which is simply the mean of each 
column. It’s a pretty simple way to figure out what’s considered normal (or 
“natural”) for the top-ranking competitors for your keyword, in the search 
engines’ eyes. These eight categories represent on-page elements that you 
can compare to your own Web page.

showing

data from

report.
 
After you’ve studied your competitors, it’s time to run your own Web pages 
through the Page Analyzer to get your starting figures for comparison. 
Here’s how to run the Page Analyzer:
 
1. Go to www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html.
 
2. In the Page Analyzer (the fourth tool down), enter your page’s URL 
(such as www.yourdomain.com/pageinprogress.html).
 
3. Click the Check Keyword Densities button and wait until the report 
displays.
 
Keep in mind that for each item, the best practices just give you a starting 
point for your analysis. As we mentioned, the top sites are imperfect, so 
there is room to vary your analysis because your goal is first becoming equal 
to and then better than your competition. Your market may require certain 
page elements to be much shorter or longer than the guidelines recommend. 
Remember that your page construction should make you competitive for 
your keywords and make judgment calls backed up by real-world results. 
SEO requires ongoing monitoring and tweaking because the nature of rankings 
is transitory. Search engine rankings fluctuate, and you have to make tweaks 
to adapt. Your target number for each element can be changed over time as 
you get more of a feel for what the search engines consider most relevant.

182
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
After you have your data in hand, you can dig into your analysis. In this list, 
we cover what we consider to be the SEO best practice for each item and 
how it lines up with the competitors’ natural usage based on the averages 
in Figure 3-1. Knowing those two things, you can decide what to do on your 
own page (these numbers are examples only; your industry will be different):
 
✦ Title: The Title tag is a line of HTML you put in the Head, or top, 
section of a Web page’s HTML code.
 
 Best practice: 6 to 12 words in length
 
 Competitors’ average: 10.25
 
 Recommendation: Because the search engines are rewarding these 
sites with top rankings and their natural average falls within best 
practices, you should make your Title tag 10 words in length.
 
• Meta description: The Meta description is another HTML tag that 
goes in the Head section of a Web page.
 
 Best practice: 12 to 24 words in length
 
 Competitors’ average: 20.5
 
 Recommendation: The top-ranking sites seem to be following best 
practices here, so go ahead and match them by putting 20 or 21 
words in your Meta description tag.
 
✦ Meta keywords: The Meta keywords tag also goes in the Head section 
and gives you a place to list all your keywords for the page.
 
 Best practice: 24 to 48 words in length
 
 Competitors’ average: 31
 
 Recommendation: They’ve done it again, falling within best practice 
guidelines. You should make your Meta keywords tag about 31 
words long.
 
✦ Headings: This refers to the number of Heading tags on the page (which 
are h# formatting tags applied to headings and subheadings).
 
 Best practice: There’s no minimum/maximum guideline for Heading 
tags; however, you should have a single H1 tag at the top of the page 
for your main headline because search engines look for this. Use H2, 
H3, and so on through the page for subheadings that help break up 
the text in natural places.
 
 Competitors’ average: 10.25. However, notice that the competitors 
don’t agree on this: Their Heading counts are 1, 15, 0, and 25.
 
 Recommendation: Where you have one or two competitors that are 
completely out of range of the rest, you shouldn’t try to match the 
average. Follow the bulk of the sites or best practices instead.

Book III
Chapter 3
Applying Collected 
Data
183
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
 
✦ Alt codes: Alt attributes are alternate text attached to images that 
briefly describe the image to search engines (and users). In the Page 
Analyzer, the Alt codes figure represents the total number of words 
included in Alt attributes on the page.
 
 Best practice: For every image, you should include an Alt attribute 
(incorporating keywords, if appropriate). The length of the Alt 
attribute depends on the size of the image, but should not exceed 12 
words per image for the largest images. (See Book V, Chapter 2 for 
the mathematical rule of thumb for this.)
 
 Competitors’ average: 60.25
 
 Recommendation: There’s a wide disparity between the four sites 
(26, 104, 13, 98). You should probably follow the best practices 
rather than the average here.
 
✦ Hyperlinks: This figure represents the total number of words included 
in link anchor text (the text a user can click to follow a link) on the page.
 
 Best practice: There’s only a vague guideline for this: The number 
can vary widely. You do want some links on the page, but don’t be 
overly link-happy, or the search engines could suspect your page 
of spam (deceptively trying to manipulate the search engines). The 
anchor text for each link should contain meaningful text. Beyond 
that, best practice says to have between 12 and 172 words in anchor 
text. (See, that’s a big spread.)
 
 Competitors’ average: 405.5
 
 Recommendation: Whew! The average here is way above the best 
practice limit of 172, and most of the sites match it. This may be a 
case where what’s natural for your market trumps best practices. At 
least if you start with a high number, you’re in the ballpark of your 
competitors, and you can experiment with lowering it later after 
you’re ranking high.
 
✦ All Body words: This refers to the number of words in the Body section, 
which is the part between the beginning and ending Body tags, or the 
main page content that users see. The count excludes stop words (little 
words like a, an, but and others that the search engines disregard).
 
 Best practice: You should fall within the range of your competitors, 
but a landing page needs at least 400 to 500 words of readable con-
tent as a general rule to establish its relevance to a keyword.
 
 Competitors’ average: 408.5
 
 Recommendation: All the competitors’ pages have a similar count 
and it falls within best practices, so this average is probably a sweet 
spot you’ll want to match or slightly exceed.

184
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
 
✦ All words: This is the total number of words in the page minus stop 
words, so it includes the Body section as well as other sections that may 
or may not be visible to users.
 
 Best practice: There’s no minimum or maximum guideline here, so 
match your competitors as long as they’re in keeping with other SEO 
best practices (such as keeping the HTML code uncluttered, and so 
on.).
 
 Competitors’ average: 946.25
 
 Recommendation: Aim to have sufficient text in the Body section, 
and to keep your HTML clean. This number usually takes care of 
itself.
Want more info on page construction? See Book V, Chapter 3 for additional 
recommendations on building effective, SEO-friendly page elements.
Content
To make sure your landing pages have enough focused content to be consid-
ered relevant for their main keywords, you can look at two things: the search 
engine’s cache (stored version of a page) and a Page Analyzer report.
Google’s cached text-only version of a Web page is the best way to see how 
much content the search engines have actually indexed (included in their 
database of Web pages, from which they pull search results).
To view Google’s cached text version of a page:
 
1. Run a Google search to bring up the Web page.
 
 Try putting an excerpt in quotation marks to find an exact match.
 
2. Click the Cached link in the result for your Web page, which is next to 
the URL (Web address).
 
3. In the gray box at the top of the page, click Text-Only Version.
This text-only view is what Google sees, and your keywords are highlighted. 
This view is useful because
 
✦ You can find out how much text Google indexed.
 
✦ You can see visually how many times you used each keyword.
 
✦ You can tell how evenly you distributed the keyword through the page.

Book III
Chapter 3
Applying Collected 
Data
185
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
 
If you find that the page has very little textual content that can actually be 
read by the search engines, your design might be relying too much on non-
text elements like images or Flash. (Adobe Flash is a multimedia software 
program used for building animated and interactive elements for the Web.) 
Although these elements may be good for your users, they’re not very read-
able to a search engine. In general, landing pages need a lot of text-based 
content so search engines can figure out what they’re all about.
The Page Analyzer report further breaks down how keywords are used on 
a Web page. It identifies all of the single and multi-word keyword phrases. 
It also tells you whether the keywords are used in all the right places (for 
instance, any word used in the Title tag is expected to also be in the Meta 
description tag, the Meta keywords tag, and throughout the page).
For more help using the Page Analyzer to optimize your landing pages, see 
Book V, Chapter 3.
Engagement objects
Before leaving the subject of page construction, there’s a hot topic you need 
to know about: engagement objects™. These are non-text elements such 
as images, videos, audio, or interactive elements on a Web page that help 
engage users. Not only do they make your page more interesting to a user, 
but they are also now becoming increasingly important as a search engine 
ranking factor.
With the rise of blended search (also known as Universal Search in Google), 
search engine results pages (SERPs) are now able to show a combination 
of different types of files to a searcher. So a search for [1969 Ford Mustang] 
can return photos, videos, and so on, in addition to Web site links, all on the 
same SERP (as shown in Figure 3-2 below).
The search engines (particularly Google) want to provide the most relevant 
and engaging results to their users, so having engagement objects on your 
Web site can actually make you rank higher in search results than your 
competitors.

186
Sizing Up Your Page Construction
 
Figure 3-2: 
Blended 
search

different

Take a look at your top competitors’ Web pages as a user would and notice 
their engagement objects. Keep your own Web site in mind so you can make 
a list of things you might need to add. Besides getting an overall feel for how 
these sites engage their users, look to see how extensively they incorporate 
engagement objects such as
 
✦ Images: Notice the number of photos, illustrations, diagrams, charts, 
and so on. Also pay attention to size. Larger images with good Alt 
attribute text and good surrounding text can get indexed and actually 
returned as a search result itself, so notice whether the competitor has 
anything like this.
 
✦ Video: Video is extremely important these days for getting noticed on 
the Web. The best method is to embed the video right into your land-
ing page and also upload it or a portion of it to a video-sharing site like 
YouTube. Include a keyword-rich description and a link back to your 
site, and you’ll probably get traffic as a result. Consider this: YouTube’s 
internal search function now gets more total searches than Yahoo!. 
Depending on how you look at it, that means YouTube is the second 
most visited search engine in its own right. Obviously, YouTube’s site 
search isn’t a true search engine, but you better believe that the traffic 
is true traffic. If your competitors haven’t been savvy enough to upload

Learning from Your Competitors’ Links
videos to YouTube and embed videos on their sites yet, here’s a good 
way to one-up them. Being where people can find you is critical.
 
✦ Audio: Look for embedded audio files within the site, which is another 
type of element that’s good for user engagement. Audio files are 
expected on music-industry sites, but other sites might benefit from a 
creative use of audio, as well. Google can now parse soundtracks and 
generate a text of the words that can be subsequently indexed. This 
clearly shows that audio is a valid content form.
 
✦ Flash: Flash files (SWF) can also help a site rank, especially if there’s lots 
of explanatory text and if it’s something that attracts people’s interest 
enough to link to it. (Note that a site built completely in Flash, however, 
can’t be very competitive in searches because it lacks sufficient text 
content.) Check out your competitors’ use of Flash. If they all have some 
Flash elements that help engage users, you’re probably going to need to 
build some, too.
 
There are many other types of engagement objects, and lots more to say 
about the best ways to include them on your Web pages. Please see Book X, 
Chapter 2 to get more information.
Learning from Your Competitors’ Links
What else can you learn from your competitors? You can find out who’s link-
ing to them.
Besides your page construction, another big factor in your search engine 
ranking is your link equity, which is the value of all the backlinks coming 
to your Web pages. The search engines consider every link to your Web 
page to be a “vote” for that page. The more votes your page has, the more 
“expert” your page appears to be. Based on the links pointing to your site, 
the search engines either increase or decrease how relevant your site is for 
particular keyword searches. The quality of your backlinks also matters; 
one testimonial-grade link from an authoritative Web site in your field is an 
important endorsement and can be worth more than thousands of links from 
unrelated and inconsequential sites in terms of your link equity.
You want to have a natural variety of backlinks to your landing pages, from 
sites with a range of different link equity values themselves. However, it’s 
good to keep in mind what the gold standard is so that you can recognize 
a nugget when you see one and go after it. The most ideal backlinks come 
from a Web page that is
 
✦ Well-established (that is, an older site that’s become trusted) 
 
✦ An authority within your industry, with lots of backlinks coming to it 
from related sites, as well as some links out to other authority Web sites;

188
Learning from Your Competitors’ Links
 
✦ Focused on the same subject as your Web page, even using some of the 
same keywords;
 
✦ Using meaningful anchor text that contains your keywords in the link to 
your page.
You may have some of these “ideal” candidates in mind already: sites that 
are well-respected and established authorities in your field. It’s very likely, 
however, that you don’t have nearly enough backlink candidates in mind yet. 
That’s where looking at your top-ranking competitors comes in handy.
You can look at your competitors’ links primarily to find good backlink can-
didates for your own site. The top-ranking competitors for your keywords 
probably have vetted worthwhile links that you could benefit from, too. 
After all, your competitor deals with the same type of information and cus-
tomer that you do. If that third-party site finds it useful to link visitors to the 
competitor’s site, they might find your site equally useful for their visitors to 
know about.
You can see a list of all the indexed backlinks a competitor has by running a 
search engine query:
 
✦ In Google: In the regular search box, type the query [link:domain.
com], substituting the competing page’s URL for domain.com.
 
✦ In Yahoo!: Go to http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com and 
enter the competing URL.
The results come out in pretty much random order. You can go page by 
page and read through them, copying the ones that look promising as a pos-
sible backlink candidate into another document for follow-up. Be picky here: 
You don’t want any spammy links, and some may simply not be worth the 
time to pursue. If there are hundreds of link results, we suggest you export 
them from Yahoo! by clicking the Export Results to: TSV (Tab Separated 
Values) link. Then you can export the data into a spreadsheet program like 
Microsoft Excel and re-sort it as desired.
Suppose your competition has about 50 backlinks. How many do you really 
need to be competitive? In most cases, reasonably close is sufficient. Focus 
on developing links in a natural fashion — buying links en mass or devoting 
huge amounts of time to obtaining reciprocal links is not a good way to gain 
links as the search engines have ways to detect these links and they have 
very little, if any, SEO value.

Learning from Your Competitors’ Links
 
If you have the SEMToolBar installed, scanning the link results looking for 
good candidates gets much easier. (The SEMToolBar is free software that 
can be downloaded into your Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browser 
from www.bruceclay.com/web_rank.htm#semtoolbar.) For one thing, 
the results are numbered. More importantly, you’ll be able to see extra infor-
mation about each backlink, including its approximate PageRank. So at a 
glance you can tell which Web pages are the heavyweights with the search 
engines. However, be sure you’re choosing sites that are relevant to yours; 
otherwise, the sites won’t help your link equity very much. (See Chapter 2 of 
Book III for more information on the SEMToolBar.)
After you’ve decided which Web sites you’d like backlinks from, you can 
begin your link-building campaign. Spend a little time looking at the candi-
date’s Web page. You want to know what it’s about so that you can make 
sure your own Web page has something of value to those users. Another 
thing you might find is something amiss on the third-party site, like a broken 
link or missing image, which you can offer to them when you contact them 
with a request.
 
Never pay for a link to build your link equity. You can pay for advertising, if 
you want to attract more visitors or promote your site, but not to increase 
your link equity. Buying links that look deceptively like regular links can get 
you in trouble with the search engines, especially Google. According to Matt 
Cutts, who’s currently the head of Google’s Webspam team, link buying is 
being addressed by improvements to the search engine’s algorithm. When 
they detect a paid link, they typically give it no value. Selling links is even 
more of a gamble: If it’s a big problem, Google may drop your PageRank to 
let you know that they know about the purchased link, and you’ll wind up 
nowhere in the search engine results. Webmasters have the right to put any-
thing on their site, but Google also reserves the right to take action so that 
the best results are delivered to their users.
You can read about link-building strategies in depth and see a sample link 
solicitation letter that you can send to a Webmaster in hopes of getting a link 
in Book VI, Chapter 4.

Taking Cues from Your Competitors’ Content Structure
Taking Cues from Your Competitors’ Content Structure
You may have a lot of great content on your Web site, but if it’s jumbled 
and disorganized, the search engines might not figure out what searches it 
relates to. This is why you should consider content siloing, which is a way 
of organizing your Web site into subject themes by linking related pages 
together. Content siloing lets you funnel link equity to your landing pages, 
which reinforces to the search engines how relevant those pages are for 
their keywords. Linking is so important that it can override the actual con-
tent of the page. Siloing is comprised of two parts. One is internal linking and 
another relates to page and site architecture. Consider a good site map: one 
that, in a very detailed schematic, outlines the entire structure of a docu-
ment. Siloing means that all the links on the Web site follow that outline 
exactly without any straying from topic to topic. Literally, the anchor text 
links do more to inform Google than the content in those pages. (Siloing is 
a big subject, with its own chapter devoted to it. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for 
the full scoop.)
Looking at the top-ranking competitors’ Web sites, you can get some clues 
as to how they’ve organized their content. This can benefit you in two basic 
ways:
 
✦ You can tell how well organized the competitor’s content is. If they 
aren’t using siloing, that could be an advantage point for you.
 
✦ You can get ideas for beefing up your own content or for different ways 
you might organize your site.
Go to a competing Web page from a search results link. What can you learn 
from this landing page about how it fits into the entire site, and whether it 
uses siloing?
First, looking at the navigation structure may give clues. This navigation 
example shows a fairly clear directory structure — it looks to be organized 
first by car make (Ford), and then by model (Mustang). This site may have 
its content siloed:
www.autocustomizing.com/ford/mustang/customize-your-mustang.htm 
Now look at this URL, which contains codes and parameters (auto-generated 
URL characters that carry information to the receiving page about the user) 
that make it impossible to read:
www.pallatinacars.com/svcse/php?t=37481&_cthew=13%3A2

Taking Cues from Your Competitors’ Content Structure
Obviously, sometimes the URL structure is informative, and sometimes not. 
Because the URL is another piece of communication the search engines 
use to try to understand what a page is about, you want your pages to have 
meaningful keywords in your URLs. Although there is very little weight 
placed on keywords in the URL, don’t miss that opportunity. Human visitors 
appreciate the clarity even if the search engines don’t. And if the sites you’re 
competing against have gobbledygook in their URLs (like the second one we 
mentioned), you’ll have another advantage.
Second, you can tell if a site is well-organized into silos by looking at its 
internal links. We’re not talking about the main navigation menu so much, 
but about the related hyperlinks on the competitor’s landing page. See if 
there are links to pages full of supporting information on the same topic. 
Then as you click to view those supporting pages, look to see whether they 
contain links back to the landing page, but none to other pages outside of 
that topic. If so, that site is probably siloed.
If they don’t have a siloed linking strategy, you might see
 
✦ No links to related pages on the landing page, or
 
✦ The same set of links on every page you look at, or
 
✦ A haphazard assortment of links to various areas of the Web site, with 
no clear subject focus
Here are some questions you should answer about your competitors: 
 
✦ Does the competitor’s site organize the main content categories in a 
clear, readable hierarchical and empirical structure with clear indexable 
(spiderable) navigation?
 
✦ Does the competitor’s site have quality content on each major category 
section?
 
✦ How well does the site link to related articles and site guides?
If the competitor isn’t siloing, and the vast majority of sites are not, that 
could give you an advantage as you create a theme for your site contents 
and implement linking within silos.

192
Taking Cues from Your Competitors’ Content Structure
After you’ve figured out whether the competitor’s site is organized into silos, 
take a look around and see what tips you can take from them. First of all, you 
might discover they’ve covered something that you missed, like an article 
about how to preserve the original upholstery of a classic car so that it lasts 
for decades. Your site visitors probably want to know that, too, so make a 
note to write a new article to fill that hole.
A well-siloed Web site might also give you good ideas for organizing con-
tent. For instance, your silos might be set up by type of service (body work, 
reupholstering, complete restoration, and so on), whereas on a competitor’s 
site, you see siloing by car make and model. The test of a good silo structure 
is how much traffic you’re bringing in by being relevant to important key-
words. If your structure is bringing in visitors and giving you enough conver-
sions (sales, sign-ups, orders, or whatever action you want people to take on 
your site), you shouldn’t tear it down.
You might still learn something from another site’s silo structure, however, 
that you could apply as a horizontal silo within your current structure. A 
horizontal silo involves linking across silos very deliberately to create a sec-
ondary silo structure that can rank for other types of search queries. So if 
your silo structure is by services, you could consider linking together your 
page titled Reupholstering a Ford Mustang to your pages for Restoring a 
Ford Mustang and Ford Mustang Body Work, and so on. That would create 
a set of horizontal silos that might help you rank higher for searches that 
include [Ford Mustang] as a keyword.
For more help with siloing and overlaying a horizontal silo, check out Book VI, 
Chapter 3.
For the purposes of siloing, you only need to look 
at the links that are “followed” by the search 
engines. Links that have a rel=”nofollow” 
attribute attached to them in the HTML code 
don’t count for passing link equity. (By the way, 
the presence of a rel=”nofollow” attri-
bute on a Web site may itself provide a clue 
that there’s an SEO expert on staff, and the site 
may be siloed.)
To see “nofollow” links more easily, you 
can install a free plug-in for the Mozilla Firefox 
browser called Search Status (currently in 
version 1.27). If you install this plug-in, links with 
a “nofollow” attribute automatically show 
up highlighted in pink on any Web page. Here’s 
how you can get and use Search Status:
 1. In your Mozilla Firefox browser, go to www.
quirk.biz/searchstatus/.
 2. Click the big Download Search Status 
button, and then scroll down a bit and click 
the Firefox icon. Complete the installation 
procedure as directed.
 3. After it’s installed, you see some new icons 
in the lower-right corner of your browser 
window. Right-click on the Quirk icon to 
open the context menu for options and 
select Highlight Nofollow Links.

n this chapter, you discover the basics of site design with search engine 
optimization in mind. Building a Web site is like baking a cake in a lot 
of ways, and one of the first things you have to do is gather together your 
ingredients.
In this chapter, we first guide you to deciding on the content and the types 
of keywords that you want. Then we discuss H# or heading tags (HTML code 
applied to headings) and page headings, and the importance of using clean 
code for your site. You find out how to organize and name all of the assets 
on your page, including images, videos, and podcasts. After you have every-
thing organized, you discover how to actually construct your site.
We finish off the chapter by discussing keeping your page simple and neat, 
creating dynamic content for your site that is still seen as relevant by the 
search engines, and developing a design procedure so that everyone on the 
team is on the same page.

196
Deciding on the Type of Content for Your Site
 
We talk a lot about HTML in the upcoming pages; however, we don’t attempt 
to teach you HTML in this book. We strongly recommend that you learn at 
least the basics of HTML before you attempt SEO. Even if you aren’t going to 
be the one doing the optimization on your Web site, it’s a good idea to learn 
the basics. If you want to be good at search engine optimization (SEO), you 
need to understand both the marketing end and the technical end. If you 
know the basics of HTML, you can communicate with your IT guys in their 
own language, which prevents them from claiming something can’t be done 
if it actually can. It also allows you to be able to catch mistakes others might 
miss, helps you research your competition’s Web sites, and is just generally 
good to know.
Deciding on the Type of Content for Your Site
We have stated this time and time again throughout this book, and we’ll con-
tinue to do so because it’s important: You must know what your business is 
about. It colors how you choose your keywords and how you arrange your 
site. You need to know if you have a research or an e-commerce site, or if it’s 
both. How can you tell? Here are a few ways:
 
✦ Research: A research site’s keywords should lean towards how-to types 
of phrases. As in, [How do you fix a lawnmower?] or [How do you say 
where is the consulate, I lost my password? in Spanish?]. Or even more 
specific keywords like [Mustang] or [John Wilkes Booth]. These are 
keywords that people use when they do research. If you have a site that 
provides information, such as recipes, lists of dead historians, or classic 
auto club newsletters, you want your keywords to be research-based. 
Research Web sites typically use words like [research], [reviews], [how 
to], [information], and so on.
 
✦ E-commerce: If you have an e-commerce site, your site is designed to 
sell things. Your keywords are geared more towards users who want to 
make purchases. That could include the keyword [free] because who 
wouldn’t want free stuff? Also, you’d include much more specific key-
words like [Ford Mustang Convertible with leather interior] because 
people search for broader terms when doing research and more specific 
terms when they’re ready to make a purchase. E-commerce sites have 
calls to actions in their content, using terms like [buy now], [purchase], 
[shopping cart], and so on.
 
✦ Research and e-commerce: Some sites provide both information and 
purchasing opportunities. You can have a site that provides tons of 
information and recipes for the best barbecuing techniques, and have 
things like grills and barbecue sauces available on your Web site for 
purchase.

Choosing Keywords
Knowing what kind of a business you have (and what kind of Web site you 
want to build/redesign) helps you to pick out your keywords. Separate them 
into information-type keywords and transaction-type keywords. This means 
thinking about whether the keyword would draw someone doing research to 
your site, or someone ready to buy something.
 
You have to do research and continue to do it. SEO is not like doing research 
for a tenth-grade English essay, where you do it once and then never have to 
do it again. The market changes constantly and you have to be able to keep 
up with it. See Book II, Chapter 1 for more information on keyword research.
Choosing Keywords
After you’ve decided what kind of site you’re building and separated your 
lists of keywords for that site, you have to choose what keywords will go 
where. You need to know what keywords to assign to each page in order to
 
✦ Focus the page content
 
✦ Make it faster for the viewer to understand the content
 
✦ Make it easier for a search engine spider (or robot, referring to the search 
engine programs that come read your site and index its contents) to 
determine what each page is about.
Running a ranking monitor to discover what’s 
already working
If you have an existing Web site, you have to first establish a benchmark; that 
is, that you should find out what’s currently working before you begin rear-
ranging things. You need to find out which of your Web pages already rank 
well in the search engines, and for which keywords. For instance, if you have 
a page on your site that’s already ranking in the top five listings for one of 
your keywords, you should just designate that as the main page for that key-
word and leave it alone. Check on which keywords are working for you and 
which aren’t and don’t fix something that’s not broken. Conversely, if you 
have a page that is consistently not ranking for any keywords, it’s time to fix 
that page.
To help you evaluate your keywords, you can take advantage of a useful tool 
called a ranking monitor. This tool is extremely helpful for keyword research 
and keeping track of how your pages are ranking, both now and further on 
down the road as the market grows and changes.

198
Choosing Keywords
A ranking monitor tells you where your pages rank in the search engines for 
each keyword, or if they rank at all. At the time of this writing, we don’t know 
of any ranking monitor available for free; however, subscribing to a paid 
monitor is worth the cost. At the risk of sounding self-promotional, the moni-
tor available with our subscription SEOToolSet at www.seotoolset.com/ 
works and is fully integrated with many useful tools. The full suite of tools is 
available for $39.95 a month, but you can search online for others. No matter 
which you choose, you need to be looking for a ranking monitor that
 
✦ Checks multiple search engines (domestic and international)
 
✦ Includes historical data, so you can see trends over time
 
✦ Is “polite” to the search engines by automatically spacing queries over 
time, or allows you to customize the crawl rates to use time delays
 
✦ Supports proxy (remote location) queries
 
✦ Offers multiple languages
 
✦ Is schedulable
 
✦  Runs from a server and not from your desktop
 
✦ Integrates with other tools to allow for analysis
Figure 1-1 shows a typical ranking report from the SEOToolSet. For every 
one of the site’s keywords (which are pre-entered), the report shows if any 
page on the site ranks for that keyword, what number rank it has in each of 
the search engines, and the search activity (roughly the number of search 
queries per day). Clicking on the keyword reveals which URLs specifically 
are ranked.

Figure 1-2 is a chart showing your page rankings over time, giving you a his-
tory of how your site ranked overall over time and a handy bar graph to go 
along with it. It’s important that you be able to track your rankings over time 
so that you know whether your search engine optimization efforts are work-
ing. Keep good records of all your changes so that you’ll be able to relate it 
back to the rise and fall in your graph.

It’s important to choose a ranking monitor that won’t constantly hammer the 
search engines. (By hammer, we mean it won’t constantly query the search 
engines. You don’t want them to spider your site at full speed if it impacts 
your ability to do business by overloading your servers. We think it’s just 
polite to return the same courtesy to the search engines.) We recommend 
you choose an online ranking monitor instead of a desktop one to be sure 
you don’t get your personal IP banned: You don’t want to limit your ability 
to do your own Google searches. If your monitor hits the engines with too 
many searches too fast, the search engine may identify your monitor as a 
machine and require you to prove you’re a human user every time you try to 
run the application.
Choose a ranking monitor that either auto-spaces its queries or lets you 
request delays between searches because scraping at the search engines 
constantly gets you into trouble and will produce inconsistent data. The 
SEOToolSet ranking monitor waits several seconds between each query, just 
to be polite.
You should rerun a ranking monitor at regular intervals, storing up a history 
of biweekly or monthly ranking reports that you can compare to each other. 
There’s no real benefit to running monitors more often as search engines 
change algorithms regularly, and less frequent monitors give better history 
and don’t take up so much data. (Not to mention that you need to wait to see 
if your SEO edits on your Web pages were picked up by the engines in the 
first place.)

200
Choosing Keywords
 
Having an archive of dated reports allows you to see your progress over 
time because each one is like a snapshot of your current SEO work. 
Especially as you begin implementing search engine optimization through-
out your Web site, you want to run a ranking monitor regularly. You will defi-
nitely appreciate the trending reports in the long run.
Matching Meta tags and keywords to page content
After you’ve run the ranking monitor, you can identify the pages that rank 
well for particular keywords. Consider those ranking keywords as being 
assigned to those pages. Remove other unrelated keywords so that your 
page stays focused very clearly on its main keyword. You want to follow 
some SEO best practices for how you assign keywords to a page. We go into 
depth on this throughout this book, but here’s a brief list to start with.
When assigning keywords to your Web pages, select one to five main related 
keywords (or keyword phrases) for each individual page. Allow two or three 
supporting keywords (or keyword phrases) per page. Supporting keywords 
may be suitable for developing pages around, as well, increasing your depth 
of content.
Make sure all keywords on the page relate to one another: Too many unre-
lated (but well-ranking) keywords can dilute the theme and bring your rank-
ings down. If the page is about painting a classic Mustang, make sure the 
keywords all relate to painting a classic Mustang. Your page content should 
also include synonyms and clarifying words that a user would be looking 
for. Slang terms are excellent clarifying words because they mimic the way 
people actually speak: [stang] or [pony car] for Mustang wouldn’t be consid-
ered secondary keywords, but they’re important to proving your expertise 
to your visitors.
If you already have a Web site and need to tweak it for ranking, take a look at 
the page you have and think about where you can enhance it. Going back to 
the classic car customization example: If you have a page on your site that’s 
mostly about tires but it also has a paragraph about rims and a line or two 
about wheel axels, that page is a little disjointed. Because the page is primar-
ily about tires, make it all about tires and create a separate page for rims 
and another page for axels. Then pick two or three really good supporting 
keywords for your tires page.
After you choose your main and supporting keywords for each page, you are 
going to arrange them strategically. You should put keywords in
 
✦ The page’s Title tag.
 
✦ The Meta description and Meta keywords tags (metadata appears in the 
Head section of the HTML code and defines the page content).

Book IV
Chapter 1
The Basics of SEO

201
Using Keywords in the Heading Tags
 
✦ In the headings on the page, especially in your H1 tag.
 
✦ In the page content.
Search engines look at the Title, Meta description, and Meta keywords 
tags not only to understand what your page is about, but also to grab text 
to display in your search results listing. Search engines pull the descriptive 
text that displays on their results pages from any of several different sources 
depending on the search query and the engine itself: from the Meta descrip-
tion tag, from the page content, occasionally from the Open Directory 
Project (DMOZ), and Yahoo! often uses the description from a site’s listing in 
the Yahoo! Directory.
See Book VI, Chapter 3 for more help creating Title and Meta tags.
Using Keywords in the Heading Tags
When you’re structuring the HTML coding for a Web page, it can look a little 
like an outline, with main headings and subheadings. An important place to 
have keywords is in those headings, placed within Heading tags.
Heading tags are part of the HTML coding for a Web page. Headings are 
defined with H1 to H6 tags. The H1 tag defines the most important head-
ing on the page (usually the largest or boldest, too), whereas H6 indicates 
the lowest-level heading. You want to avoid thinking of headings as simply 
formatting for your pages: Headings carry a lot of weight with the search 
engines because they’re for categorization, not cosmetics. You can control 
what each heading looks like consistently through your site using a CSS 
style sheet that specifies the font, size, color, and other attributes for each 
Heading tag. Here’s an example of what various heading tags can look like:
<H1>This is a heading</H1>
<H2>This is subheading A</H2>
<H2>This is subheading B</H2>
<H3>This is a lower subheading</H3>
Search engines pay special attention to the words in your headings because 
they expect headings to include clues to the page’s main topics. You defi-
nitely want to include the page’s keywords inside Heading tags.
Heading tags also provide your pages with an outline, with the heading 
defining the paragraph that follows. They outline how your page is struc-
tured and organize the information. The H1 tag indicates your most impor-
tant topic, and the other H# tags create subtopics.

202
Using Keywords in the Heading Tags
You should follow several SEO best practices for applying Heading tags. 
First, you want to have only one H1 tag per page because it’s basically the 
subject of your page. Think of your H1 tag like the headline of a newspaper 
article: It wouldn’t make sense to have more than one. You can have multiple 
lesser tags if the page covers several subsections. In feature articles in news-
letters, you occasionally see sub-headlines that are styled differently than 
the headline: Those would be the equivalent of an H2.
Say that you have a page that describes how you can customize classic 
Mustang convertibles. Your very first heading for your page should be some-
thing like this:
<H1>Customizing Classic Mustangs</H1>
Your second paragraph is about customizing the paint job for the convert-
ible. So it should have a heading that reads:
<H2>Customizing Paint for Mustangs</H2>
When you view the code of your page (which you should most definitely do 
even if you have someone else create it for you), it should look something 
like this:
<H1> Customizing Classic Mustangs s</H1>
<p>200 words of content about Customizing Classic Mustangs 
using the keywords.</p> 
<H2> Customizing Paint for Mustangs </H2>
<p>200 words of content about Customizing Paint for Mustangs 
using the keywords</p>
<H2> Customizing Upholstery for Mustangs </H2>
<p>200 words of content about Customizing Upholstery for 
Mustangs using the keywords.</p>
When assigning Heading tags, keep them in sequence in the HTML, which 
is how the search engines can most easily read them. Heading tags should 
follow the outline structure you used in school for an outline or a technical 
paper. If you wanted to add an H3 tag, it would have to follow an H2 in the 
code. Similarly, if you had an H4 tag, it could only follow an H3 tag and not 
an H2.
Heading structure is a relatively simple concept, but you would be surprised 
at how many Web sites use the same type of heading for every paragraph, 
or just use their Headings tags to stuff keywords into the HTML code. In 
reality, many sites do not even use Heading tags, so it should a quick win to 
place appropriate headings on your site. Absolutely avoid any headings that 
look like this:
<H1>Mustang Mustang Mustang Ford Mustang</H1>

Keeping the Code Clean
 
This tag is unacceptable to search engines (to say nothing of your visitors), 
and is considered spam. See Book I, Chapter 6 for more on what may be 
considered spam.
The words in each Heading tag should be unique and targeted to the page 
they’re on. Unique and targeted means that your Heading tag’s content 
shouldn’t be duplicated anywhere across the site. If the heading on your 
tires page is “Classic Mustang tires,” “Classic Mustang tires” shouldn’t be the 
H1 on any other page in your site.
Search engines look for uniqueness on your page. For example, if you have 
an H1 heading of Ford Mustang Convertible at the top of two different 
pages, the search engine might read one of the pages as redundant and not 
count it. Having unique Heading tags allows the search engine to assign 
more weight to a heading, and headings are one of the most important 
things on the page besides the Title tag (which is discussed in Book IV, 
Chapter 3).
If you want to have any of the elements on your Web site (Title tags, 
Heading tags, Alt attributes, and so on) help your pages rank in a search 
engine, they all need to be unique. It may take a little more time to go 
through and think up unique, relevant, keyword-rich tags for everything, but 
it’s worth the effort. The little things count when it comes to SEO.
Keeping the Code Clean
Another part of building a search engine-friendly Web site is keeping your 
code clean and simple. When we talk about code, we’re talking about lan-
guages like HTML, XHTML, AJAX, JavaScript, and the like. Coding supplies 
the building blocks of your Web site. If we were talking about building a 
house, the code would basically define the walls, floors, insulation, light fix-
tures, kitchen sink, and everything right down to the color of the paint in the 
bathroom.
We assume that you already know a little bit about HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript code and what it looks like. In this chapter, we assume that you’re 
at the planning stage of your SEO campaign, gathering your assets and start-
ing to visualize a big-picture plan for your Web site. In the next chapters, we 
cover how to apply what you’ve visualized to make an SEO-friendly site. But 
first, there are a few more concepts to grasp.
You want to streamline your site’s code so that it’s an easy read for the 
search engine spiders. Keeping the code as clean as possible, as it relates to 
SEO, means some specific things:

204
Keeping the Code Clean
 
✦ Get to each page’s content as soon as possible in the HTML view. You 
want your keywords to start showing up early in the search engine 
spider’s crawl.
 
✦ Code using as little on-the-page markup (formatting and other types of 
on-the-fly HTML codes, such as Font tags, which could be controlled in 
a CSS style sheet instead) as possible. If you have useless tags in your 
code, get rid of them.
These are great goals, but how can you achieve them? These best practices 
can slash the code clutter right out of your Web pages:
 
✦ Use an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file to define the look of 
your Web site, rather than relying on inline formatting.
 
✦ Move any JavaScript code into an external .JS file when possible. 
Include simple calls to the JavaScript file from your pages, which keeps 
the on-page code short and sweet.
You may also have extraneous tags lying around in the HTML. Code gunk 
buildup can happen if you’ve cut and pasted content from another source 
(like an old Web page of yours, or from Microsoft Word or other programs 
that add a ton of unnecessary HTML code to your text). Or you may have 
been working on a particular page for so long that it’s acquired excess tags 
like barnacles on a ship’s hull. Go through and remove all of the extraneous 
tags and code from your pages including extra carriage returns. Simplifying 
your code streamlines the site and makes it easier to read for the search 
engine spiders. If they read too much redundancy or if your page code 
appears too complex, they’re less likely to assign a lot of weight or rel-
evancy to your page. Just as two drops of dye in a small glass of water has 
a lot more impact than two drops of dye in a barrel of water, effectively, the 
messy code could be “diluting” the strength of your keywords.
 
A couple of programs are available to clean up your code if you’ve got a 
bunch of gunk hanging out in the HTML. The cheapest is your friendly neigh-
borhood text editor, Notepad. If you’re used to reading HTML, just opening it 
up and looking at the raw code can help you tidy up pages one at a time. If 
you’re using a UNIX/LINUX server, save your work in UNIX format.
For those who aren’t able to read HTML like it’s English, there are other 
tools out there that can help. Adobe Dreamweaver (a Web design and pro-
gramming application) allows you to create Web pages in a WYSIWYG view 
(“What you see is what you get,” or the way the page looks to visitors). It 
can actually write the HTML code for you as you type text and move things 
around. This helpful program can also help you clean up cluttered code. It 
contains an option to review an .HTM file for unnecessary code and offers to 
clean it up for you, as you can see in Figure 1-3.

Dreamweaver can correct bad coding syntax and remove code that doesn’t 
need to be there. It even can help you convert all of your Font tags to CSS 
and reorganize the HTML in a format that the search engine spiders will be 
more easily able to follow, which streamlines your code for you.
Organizing Your Assets
Making a Web site is kind of like baking a cake. You have to have all of your 
ingredients together and the recipe before you get started; otherwise, you 
could be in the middle of mixing only to find out that you have no eggs. It’s 
why we have you go through all of these steps first in order to make sure 
you have everything ready before you begin.
If you’re just starting a Web site, it’s important to organize your assets. 
What’s going to go on your Web site? Sift through everything that you have. 
Remember, users love dynamic content, so in addition to that must-have 
readable, well-written text, include images and video to enhance user inter-
est and engagement.

206
Naming Your Files
Go through all of your print materials, if you have any, and choose images 
that you can use on your Web site. Do you have a commercial? How about 
an interview that you did for radio or television? Gather all of these things 
together and go through them. If something is useless, chuck it because 
clutter will always be clutter. But if you find an image or a video you think 
will work with your site, use it!
Besides text, you might want to consider putting the following types of 
engagement objects on your Web site:
 
✦ Files: First things first, organize your files into proper categories. And by 
files we mean everything. Your pages, your data, your images, videos, 
and podcasts, if your have any. Main subjects go first, and then go down 
the line into subcategories.
 
✦ Images: If you have print materials, you probably have images. Use 
those images to enhance your Web site (and make sure you have the 
copyrights to use those images). Adding images can also help your page 
rank because of the ability to use keywords in the Alt attribute text (the 
HTML coding of the image), plus the ability to rank in image-centric 
vertical search engines (search engines that look for a specific type of file 
or location).
 
✦ Videos: If you have any commercials or videos lying around, consider 
uploading them and using them on your site. Especially upload it to 
YouTube, which allows you to add to your outside links. Search engines 
can’t see a video, but videos can still enhance your rank by containing 
keywords in the text surrounding the video (such as if you put the video 
in a table cell with keyword-rich text above or below it), and by appearing 
in their own vertical results.
 
✦ Podcasts: If you have a radio show, it’s not that hard to stream it online 
and create podcasts that are downloadable.
If you have any of these engagement objects, gather them together and keep 
them organized. Engagement objects don’t stop there, consider also blogs, 
news, books, maps — anything that could catch the eye and engage a user 
with your site that isn’t just a standard text-based Web page. You’ll thank 
yourself later when you’re actually building your Web site and have lots of 
content choices handy.
Naming Your Files
After you’ve gathered your assets together and separated the wheat from 
the chaff, you need to name them as you’re uploading them. How you name 
your files is important because a search engine looks at the filename as an 
indication of what’s in the file, so this is another good place to have keywords.

Book IV
Chapter 1
The Basics of SEO 
Web Design
207
Naming Your Files
Instead of naming your image of a red Ford Mustang like this:
*0035001.jpg
Rename the file as you’re uploading it to describe it, something like:
*ford-mustang-1967.jpg
Not only is the file now easier for you to identify when building your pages 
down the line, but it also now contains three keywords that search engines 
can read and add to their algorithms for ranking.
 
Use filenames that make sense to both the search engine and the user. You 
might understand the gibberish you just used as a filename, but someone 
else who doesn’t know you or your sense of humor might not. Also, use full 
words instead of abbreviations. Searchers generally don’t use abbreviations 
in their search queries unless they’re very common.
The same advice is true for naming video and podcast files. Make sure that 
the filename is descriptive and simple: It helps you and the search engine in 
the long run.
When naming your files with phrases, don’t leave spaces between words. 
Nor should you use an underscore (_) to separate words. Search engines 
interpret the underscore as its own character, so it’s like naming your file 
fordxmustang, which misses an opportunity to use your keywords when a 
search engine spiders it. It’s possible that search engines can figure it out, 
but better to name your files properly than take the chance of a misread.
Instead, if you have to use spaces (remember, search engines can parse 
words from Web pages filenames without any help), use periods or hyphens. 
They won’t be read as a separate character. That way, you can have files 
that look like this:
ford.mustang.1967.good.condition.jpg
or
ford-mustang-1967-good-condition.jpg
Even without spaces, periods, or hyphens in your filenames, a search engine 
can actually parse out up to 500 words that are concatenated (run together 
without spaces). You might want to use a hyphen in places where there 
could be confusion in the parsing, either for a search engine or for a user. In 
those cases, you might want to throw in a dash or some periods in order to 
make it legible. For example, the distinction between mensexchange.jpg and 
mens-exchange.jpg is an important one, after all.

208
Keeping Design Simple
 
Eyetracking studies done by Enquiro research have found that users are not 
likely to click on a long URL in the results page. They tend to click the result 
below the hideously long URL instead. So when you’re naming the pages and 
files in your Web site, keep the length down to a reasonable level.
As descriptive as it is, you wouldn’t want something like this as your base 
domain name:
www.reallycoolclassiccustomcarsatareasonableprice.com
Also follow a standard of using either all lowercase or all uppercase in 
naming files. Apache servers are case-sensitive: Lower- or uppercase makes 
a difference to them. The pages /FordMustang.html and /fordmustang.html 
are not considered the same to a case-sensitive server. Also, do not use 
more than two hyphens in a page URL, and avoid having more than one 
hyphen in the domain name. Filenames (like our ford-mustang-1967-good-
condition.jpg example) are mostly exempt from this rule (we’ve found exam-
ples with 14 hyphens in the filename), but we still recommend economy in 
your naming conventions.
Keeping Design Simple
When it comes to designing your site, the old adage KISS is good advice: 
“Keep It Simple, Sweetie.” Make your Web site as straightforward and easy 
to navigate as possible. Make sure the links and instructions are clear and 
not horribly complicated. Also, be aware of how much Flash you are using. 
Adobe Flash is a multimedia program that allows you to place animation on 
your Web site. There are many major companies out there with big shiny 
Web sites that contain lots of complicated and cool-looking Flash. But here’s 
a secret about those sites: a search engine can’t read them.
A search engine is basically deaf, dumb, and blind. It cannot see what the 
viewer sees; it can only read the code. It can’t read a page like a person 
reads it (yet). The search engines are trying to emulate what a person will 
see and react to, but technology isn’t there yet, and they have to make do 
with reading the code.
Web sites built entirely in Flash generally don’t have searchable content. A 
search engine, being blind, deaf, and dumb, can’t see the Flash animations 
that describe all the cool things the Web site has to offer because all they 
can see is the Flash plug-in in the HTML code. See Figure 1-4, for example. 
It’s got some well-designed Flash, but a search spider can’t see any of it, so 
it can’t read any of the keywords or follow any of the links on the site. The 
capabilities of the search engines and of this technology are evolving rap-
idly. We may one day see Flash become as spiderable as text, but that day 
hasn’t arrived yet.

Figure 1-4:

That’s not to say that your Web site can’t contain Flash, but make sure 
there’s readable content that goes along with it. A few Flash movies on the 
page is a good thing for user experience, provided they are relevant and are 
accompanied by a reasonable amount of companion text. Also, make sure 
that the Flash is not too complicated for the page, or for the user. Some sites 
create mini applications using Flash and include them on their Web sites. 
If that’s your site, don’t miss an opportunity to pull good text content out 
of the application to include on your pages, as well. For instance, if your 
Flash contains instructions on how to use it within the Flash itself, grab that 
text and make it part of the text on the page. Also, if you use Flash, place a 
description of the Flash content in the actual text of the page. That makes it 
easier for the user to understand, and a search engine spider can read it and 
use it in your ranking. It’s a win/win situation.
 
Also, many Web sites include a Flash animation as the splash page (sort of 
like a site’s welcome mat), and users have to sit and wait for it to load and 
play before going on to the actual site. In general, these pages are usually 
skipped. Most people want to go to the content right away instead of having 
to sit through a minute of pretty, but useless, animation. If your site has one, 
you should probably remove the Flash intro.

210
Keeping Design Simple
Here’s another hint for your Web site. Some people out there think it’s a cool 
idea to include some music that plays when a user visits their Web site. We 
can tell you right now that many people do not enjoy this. There is nothing 
more annoying than visiting a site and being unable to find the music player 
to turn off the background music. The only people who enjoy having music 
playing on the page are the ones who put it there in the first place and the 
ones who pay to have it there. We would recommend that unless you have a 
site that actually sells music, don’t include background music on your site. 
And if you really must, make sure it defaults to off.
Keeping the content on your page simple and easy to navigate not only helps 
you get better rankings, but it also means that your user has a much better 
experience and will return to your site again. Follow this general rule: If it 
looks cool but is a pain in the rear to use, users won’t use it. Figure 1-5 is a 
great example of a simple, easy-to-use Web site.

Making a Site Dynamic
Google’s home page is clean, simple, doesn’t have any extraneous clutter, 
and is pretty self-explanatory when it comes to what the page does. The less 
you have to explain to your users, the better. Of course, Google doesn’t have 
to worry about ranking for anything, but that doesn’t mean their simple and 
clean design ethic can’t work for you, too. Ask yourself if you are putting 
only what you need onto a page and avoid the tendency to cram in just one 
more thing.
Making a Site Dynamic
A dynamic Web site is a site that is built using a template and a CMS (content 
management system) that gives you control of how to define your Web page 
that pulls information from a database. This means that the pages don’t exist 
until someone asks for them. If you have 10,000 products, you’re not going 
to build 10,000 individual pages by hand. Instead, you use a content manage-
ment system to build it dynamically on the fly. A CMS actually generates the 
page that a search engine spiders by taking the information in your database 
and plugging it into a template Web page, so the CMS is responsible for cre-
ating all of the tags, content, and code that search engines see.
The most important thing you need in order to have a dynamic site, and we 
really cannot stress this enough, is to have an SEO-friendly CMS. Any CMS 
that supports SEO completely allows you to access and edit these tags as 
well as to set rules for generating tags that are SEO friendly. That means that 
you can focus on the content on your Web site. That content is what builds 
the page that the user sees. You need to be able to make changes to the H# 
tags and control the metadata on each page separately. Every element must 
be customizable.
 
If you cannot customize your current CMS, get a new one. End of story. If you 
can’t write a Title tag individually, you’re out of luck when it comes to SEO. 
If you can’t control your H1 tag, you’re out of luck. Chuck your inflexible 
CMS and get one that allows you to control page tags and content; other-
wise, you can’t do any of the SEO we’ve been talking about. PixelSilk from 
Smart Solutions is a low-cost CMS that was designed from the ground up to 
be SEO-friendly. For simple Web sites, you could use a blogging software like 
the highly customizable WordPress, which is a free and open source.
Keep this list in mind when searching for a good CMS. They must be able to
 
✦ Customize HTML templates
 
✦ Produce unique Title tags
 
✦ Produce unique Meta description/keywords tags

212
Develop a Design Procedure
 
✦ Produce unique Heading tags (H#)
 
✦ Categorize content by groups
Develop a Design Procedure
Developing a design procedure for your Web site is also important. Keeping 
a procedure the same through all parts of the design process helps you 
if something goes wrong. If your design procedure is a set procedure, it’s 
easier to pinpoint where the goof-up happened and fix it.
When developing a design procedure, create a style guide for your Web site 
conventions and best practices. If you use a template style guide, all images 
are named the same way, like with periods for spaces, and they are all saved 
under the same file. All videos are named in a standard way and go in their 
own folder, and so on. This prevents confusion down the line.
If you have a design team, make sure they’re all on board with the style 
guide and that any newbies you bring in are trained to follow it. Also make 
sure it’s a procedure that everyone can follow. Sure, it may all make sense in 
your head, but it needs to make sense to everyone else, too. (Besides, don’t 
be too sure that what makes sense to you now will make sense to you in six 
months.) Document every last bit of your procedure, and if you have the 
resources, hire a technical writer to take it all down and rework it so that it’s 
understandable for everyone else.
Here’s a handy checklist for things you should be keeping in mind when 
you’re coming up with the standard design procedure for your Web site:
 
✦ Know what your site is about
 
✦ Know your page themes
 
✦ Know the major categories/silos
 
✦ Know the subcategories
 
✦ Know your keywords and how you research and choose them
 
✦ Know whether or not your site is e-commerce, research-oriented, 
or both
 
✦ Know how you arrange your files
 
✦ Have a set standard for naming files
 
✦ Have a set standard for naming Title tags

cess as quick as possible and results in the least amount of headaches for 
everyone involved. It also makes doing your SEO much easier because you 
don’t have to waste time redefining your goal with every single page edit.

n this chapter, you find out how to design Web sites with search engine 
marketing in mind. For many sites, search engine ranking is viewed as 
a part of the launch, but not as a part of the design. If you are fortunate 
enough to be newly building your Web site, you can construct it with search 
engine friendliness from the ground up. It’s more likely, however, that your 
site already resides on the Web. Search engine optimization (SEO) is a new 
phase of your site’s development, but it’s better late than never. This chap-
ter contains many rules of thumb that can help you design — or retrofit — a 
site to be SEO friendly.
Preplanning and Organizing your Site
As we covered in the last chapter, you should start your SEO planning by 
inventorying your assets. What do you have that can possibly enhance your 
Web site? List all of your potential assets, not just those that are already 
online. Be creative and very open-minded at this point. Take stock of all of 
the following:
 
✦ Written materials you or your company has produced — brochures, 
catalogs, articles, user manuals, tutorials, online help, customer corre-
spondence, and so on.
 
✦ Videos of interviews, television spots, commercials, award acceptances, 
speeches, company events, or other.

216
Designing Spider-Friendly Code
 
✦ Audio recordings of radio interviews, original music, or other.
 
✦ Photos of products, people, events, buildings, properties, or other.
 
✦ Images that go along with your products and services, such as logos, 
statistical charts, diagrams, illustrations, and so on.
The items you gather may become site assets, but for now they’re just ingre-
dients waiting to be used. Looking to the materials your business produces 
outside your current Web site, you can probably find a lot of original content 
that, with a small amount of reformatting or updating, could enrich your 
online site.
To help you decide which elements to put on what pages, you need a 
combination of research and planning. The research half involves keyword 
research (covered in Book II) and competitor research (covered in 
Book III) — activities that give you lots of guidelines for your SEO work. 
The types of guidelines you may come up with through research include
 
✦ Your site’s main purpose (research, e-commerce, or a mix of both)
 
✦ Your site’s main keywords
 
✦ How much content you need to be competitive
 
✦ What kinds of content you need
 
✦ Which existing pages already rank well (so you don’t want to change 
them)
 
✦ How your site should be organized to best compete in your Internet 
market
Armed with this research, you are ready to enter the planning stage. Based 
on the guidelines you developed, you can determine what areas of your Web 
site need work. Or if you’re building your site from scratch, you can lay out a 
big-picture site plan like a storyboard or a flow chart. Put your ideas for each 
page on paper. This organized approach lets you pair up items from your 
inventory of available content with your site’s needs and move through the 
planning stage.
Designing Spider-Friendly Code
Whether you’re writing your own HTML or hiring a Webmaster to do it for 
you, you want to keep your site’s underlying code spider-friendly. Basically, 
you need to streamline your site’s code so that the search engine spiders 
have an easy time crawling your pages and figuring out what the pages are 
about. You do this by keeping the code as clean as possible. We covered this 
in the last chapter, but just as a reminder, for search engine optimization 
(SEO), here are some coding best practices:

Book IV
Chapter 2
Building an SEO-
Friendly Site
217
Designing Spider-Friendly Code
 
✦ Use an external Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file to define the look of 
your Web site.
 
✦ Use an external .JS file to hold any JavaScript code you plan to use.
 
✦ Use as little inline markup (formatting and other types of on-the-fly 
HTML codes, such as Font tags to define the font style, and so on) as 
possible.
Creating a CSS file gives you a source from which to control the look of your 
entire Web site. In your CSS file, you can define, for instance, that all H1 
headings should be Arial, size 3, bold, navy blue, and centered. Next week, 
if you change your mind and decide to make your headings purple instead, 
you can simply edit the definitions for your H1 style in your CSS file and 
viola — every H1 heading throughout your entire site is now purple. That’s 
a lot more efficient than going page by page through your site, manually 
updating every instance of an H1 tag, and it eliminates the risk that you’ll 
miss one.
Not only is an external CSS efficient, but it also provides a few other big 
advantages. Having a CSS file allows you to remove inline formatting such 
as font tags from your page content and instead insert a CSS tag identify-
ing what style to apply. The result is much less HTML code cluttering your 
pages and significantly less page complexity. Less code means smaller file 
sizes. Smaller file sizes mean your pages load faster for your site visitors, 
and the search engine spiders have less junk to wade through as they read 
your text. It’s a win/win/win for all involved!
If your site incorporates JavaScript, you want to externalize it as well, for 
similar reasons. Move the JavaScript off your individual Web pages and into 
a separate .JS file. Then your pages can include a single line of code that 
calls (that is, instructs the browser and spiders that the information in the 
file should be used in reference to the content on the page) to the JavaScript 
file, rather than tons of code on the page. Because JavaScript code can get 
really long and cumbersome, this decision alone may cut the size of a Web 
page in half. Less code makes for spider-friendly pages with uncluttered text 
and clear themes.
One online business implemented just these two best practices on their 
Web site, creating external files for their JavaScript and using CSS, and they 
reduced 20,000 lines of code to just 1,500. The keyword-rich content rose to 
the top of the page, and along with it their site’s rankings across their key-
word terms in the search results.

218
Creating a Theme and Style
Creating a Theme and Style
When it comes to design styles, people tend to have certain expectations 
about what’s appropriate. Elegant restaurants don’t seat people at tables 
with plastic chairs and red, yellow, and blue toy blocks for decoration. 
Neither do preschools decorate their rooms with Persian rugs and neutral 
colors. A typical business designs for their intended audience, so assessing 
who makes up their target audience is one of the first things they have to do. 
Online businesses should be no different, but many Web sites overlook this 
step in their zeal to just “attract visitors, lots of visitors!”
Knowing what kind of visitor you want to attract influences lots of style 
decisions. It helps you make these types of design decisions:
 
✦ A color palette for the site
 
✦ The kinds of photos and graphics to include
 
✦ An appropriate reading level for your audience, including the complexity 
of the words and sentence structures
 
✦ The best tone to use when writing
 
✦ Font and layout choices that appeal to your target audience
 
✦ The complexity (or simplicity) of information to include
 
✦ The number of fun or interactive elements your site needs
 
✦ How “flashy” your site needs to be to attract and hold your audience
If you know the type of visitor you want, you can design your Web site to 
attract and hold those people’s interest once they arrive. When we say 
design, we don’t just mean the cosmetic look and feel, but also the site’s 
voice and themes. Your site’s main theme should be a focused idea of what 
your site is all about, using terms and keywords that match how your audi-
ence searches. For instance, if you have a business that customizes people’s 
classic cars, your main site theme is classic car customization. We cover 
assigning keywords and themes more in Book II, Chapter 4, but basically, 
after you’ve determined your main site theme, you can organize your con-
tent into categories and subcategories (that is, subtopics under the main site 
theme) and choose a specific primary keyword for each one. Every category-
plus-keyword pair should have its own landing page within your Web site, 
so that people searching for those keywords can click your listing and arrive 
at a page that’s specifically relevant to their search query. (A landing page is 
the particular Web page a user comes to when clicking a link.)

Writing Rich Text Content
So far, we’ve talked about theme in reference to the keywords and informa-
tion your Web site provides. The site’s theme is what the whole site is about; 
each page’s theme is a subtopic and has content and keywords focused on 
that subtopic. Frequently, the word theme also applies to the design theme, 
or the look and feel of a Web site. Keep in mind that the design theme a Web 
designer creates must integrate with the site’s main content theme and be 
right for the target audience. They’re all interrelated.
 
A design theme for a Web site needs to support the site’s main theme. For 
example, if you have a Web site that offers dog kennel franchises, the design 
theme needs to include dog-related graphics in the same way the text talks 
about dogs. Similarly, the overall look needs to appeal to your target audi-
ence, just as the text should be tailored to dog-loving entrepreneurial adults. 
If you do market research to further narrow your target audience, you can 
make the site even better. Look at your current customers to determine 
what type of person tends to convert from a window-shopper to a customer. 
For instance, if it’s usually women who become dog kennel franchisees, you 
can modify your site theme to appeal more to women. If it’s usually married 
couples who go into the dog kennel business, by all means, include text ref-
erences to this as well as images of happy couples watching over lots of tail-
wagging pooches.
Writing Rich Text Content
People do read, especially online. “Content is king” is a frequently stated 
maxim of Internet marketing experts because it’s true. To have a success-
ful Web site, you need lots and lots of content on your pages. How much 
content do you need? The answer depends somewhat on what is normal for 
your industry. When you research the sites that rank well for your keywords, 
some of the things you want to find out are how many indexed pages they 
have, as well as the quantity, quality, and structure of the keyword content 
on the high-ranking pages competing with yours. (Note that Book III explains 
how to do competitive research in detail.) When you know what level of con-
tent is currently succeeding in the search results pages for your keywords as 
an average, you get an idea of how many pages and words you need in order 
to play in their league.
We recommend that you have a minimum of 450 words of text content per 
page. That’s a general rule, based on all of our experience helping compa-
nies do SEO. If that sounds like a lot to write per page, think about it this 
way: The page that you’re reading right now has about 450 words on it. 
Fewer than 450 words makes it hard to convince the engines that you’re a 
subject-matter expert. In fact, depending on the industry and keyword, 450 
might still be too few. The SEO industry averages around 1,000 words per 
page and this is true of other industries as well. Still, 450 is a good initial 
target number.

220
Planning Your Navigation Elements
Writing that much text for every page might sound like a daunting task, but 
keep in mind how it can help you:
 
✦ Expertise goes up: Search engines look for a site’s expertise about a 
subject, and having a greater amount of relevant text signals that your 
Web page is a subject-matter expert.
 
✦ Trust factor goes up: Users coming to your landing pages stay longer 
and trust it as more of an expert source if there’s more content for them 
to read that matches their query.
 
✦ Keyword relevancy goes up: Long pages give you more opportunities to 
use your keywords without overusing them and creating spam.
 
✦ Depth of content: Multiple pages built around the same theme allow you 
to capitalize on niche and Long-Tail keywords that support your main 
keywords.
The second main principle you should know about text content is this: In 
addition to needing lots of text on your site, you also want that text to be 
focused. Search engines (and users, for that matter) come to a Web page 
seeking something specific. You want the content of each page to be focused 
on its keyword theme. This makes the page relevant to the user’s search 
query.
Making each page’s content relevant and focused helps the page rise in the 
search engine rankings. This concept ties into siloing, which is the process of 
organizing your site themes and content into categories and subcategories, 
each with its own main keyword. (You can read a full explanation of siloing 
in Book IV, Chapter 4.) For example, in your dog kennel franchise Web site, 
you might have a page focused on how much expected revenue a franchise 
can generate. In your more than 450 words of content, you wouldn’t want to 
include a discussion of different dog food brands or grooming techniques. 
Including non-focused content like that would only dilute the content of 
your page. Instead, you want to have lots of information about kennel rates, 
expected monthly revenues, and revenue-related content.
For lots more in-depth recommendations, tips and guidelines on writing 
good content, see Book V.
Planning Your Navigation Elements
Navigation elements make up the roads and highways of your Web site. 
They’re the transportation system that can help people move smoothly from 
place to place, following clear signposts through well-marked paths. On the 
other hand, a Web site’s navigation can make people frustrated and hope-
lessly lost, causing them to press the first Back button and get out of town.

Planning Your Navigation Elements
If you create a good navigation plan right from the start, it’s easy for site 
visitors and search engine spiders alike to move around your site. In fact, if 
your site doesn’t have a good navigation system, it’s unlikely that the search 
engines can thoroughly index your site. Sites with a clear directory struc-
ture, siloed content, and easy-to-follow navigation are at an advantage over 
sites without these foundational elements.
 
For maximum readability to the search engines, you want to make your navi-
gation elements text links. That said, there are ways to help the search 
engines read non-text navigation elements (such as Flash or image mapping), 
which we get into in Book IV, Chapter 3. Nevertheless, you’re going to get 
the cleanest, best read from simple text link navigation.
Figure 2-1 shows a sketch of a typical Web page’s navigation plan: It has 
three basic areas for navigation links: top, bottom, and side (either right or 
left, with left being more common). We explain what the differences are at 
an initial design level, so you can evaluate what you’re currently doing for 
site navigation if your site is already in public use. If your site is still in the 
design phase, you can start planning how you’ll build your navigation. (Note 
that we go into depth on navigation in Chapter 4 of Book IV.)

Don’t be tempted to use frames to create your navigation, unless you don’t 
want the spiders following those links. When you put content inside a frame, 
spiders see it as its own separate page, so it can’t be indexed as part of the 
current page’s content. Frames split up a page and remove all the associa-
tion of your navigation to your content for the search engines.

222
Planning Your Navigation Elements
Top navigation
Top navigation simply refers to the links at the top of the page. Usually these 
are the “pretty” ones, the ones you want people to notice and use to get to 
the main sections of your site. Also called “global” navigation, top links often 
display site-wide, showing up conveniently on every page. Links commonly 
found in your top navigation include
 
✦ Home page: A link to the home page is required for good site navigation 
(though it shouldn’t be labeled Home — more on that in a second).
 
✦ About Us: You want to provide easy access to information on who owns/
operates the Web site. This gives credibility to your site both in a site 
visitor’s eyes and to a search engine. An About Us link usually goes at 
the far right end of your top navigation.
 
✦ Contact Us: A link to a contact information page also gives you credibil-
ity, not to mention customer service points! Some sites don’t have room 
for this in the top navigation, so alternatively you can include the con-
tact info on your About Us page.
 
✦ Category/theme-specific links: Include other links that give quick access 
to your main site categories.
Although these are common elements in the top navigation, they’re not 
necessarily items that you want to have dominate your top navigation — it 
depends on your business strategy. For example, the About Us page and 
Contact Us page don’t necessarily do anything to enhance your overall site 
theme.
Good labels are critical. Because your global navigation appears throughout 
your site, the anchor text of every link (which is the text label of the link, or 
what people click) carries a lot of weight. Internal links (links on your own 
site going to other pages within your site) still count with the search engines 
and contribute to your link equity.
 
Because anchor text must be relevant to count toward your link equity, 
you want to make sure that your navigation elements contain meaningful 
keywords so that you can profit from all those links. (Link equity refers to 
assigning expertise and authority to a Web page based on the number of 
links leading to it. We cover this in more detail in Book VI, but it’s an 
important ranking factor with all the search engines.)
 
Why shouldn’t your Home page be simply called Home? We know of a 
window blinds company that radically improved their search engine ranking 
simply by changing their global navigation link from Home to Window 
Blinds. Within days, their Web page jumped from the third to the first page 
of the search results for the keyword [window blinds] after this one simple 
change.

Planning Your Navigation Elements
Footer navigation
Footer navigation refers to the navigational links at the bottom of a Web 
page. Because search engines crawl all the way through a page, you can take 
advantage of another prime chance to show your keywords and increase 
your site’s navigation and usability. Sites that have top navigation elements 
in Flash or images should use this chance to restate all those links in search-
engine friendly text at the bottom of the page. Footer navigation usually 
appears in a less conspicuous font, not trying to attract attention and simply 
offering a service to anyone who goes looking for more links to global topics. 
The footer is not the place for a link to every single page on your site, nor is 
it the place for links to pages outside of your site: Those honors belong to 
your site map and resource page, respectively. The footer should include 
links to the pages linked in your top navigation as well as any additional user 
friendly pages that weren’t important enough to be in your main navigation, 
such as your privacy policy, your Contact Us page, and industry affiliations 
like the Better Business Bureau.
Your footer navigation generally should include
 
✦ Top navigation links (again): You want to repeat all the links that 
are in your top, global navigation if your top navigation is in Flash or 
JavaScript and therefore not spiderable. Consider using anchor text that 
is more descriptive.
 
✦ Contact Us: You definitely want a link here to your contact information 
(especially if you left it out of your top navigation). This is good business 
practice so that people can contact you, but it also makes tons of sense 
for SEO. Local businesses that let spiders freely crawl all over their 
physical business address could wind up in local search results, too.
 
✦ Physical address: Include your physical address and local telephone 
number in your footer, especially if you’re targeting local business. Both 
search engines and visitors use street addresses as a way to verify that 
you’re a real business and not merely a scammer.
 
✦ Legal stuff: We recommend you include a privacy policy, copyright, and 
terms of use (if appropriate). These can be separate links in your footer 
even if they all go to the same legal-content page. You definitely want 
a privacy policy and copyright for your site — search engines look for 
these links because they help confirm that you are a “real” company 
with accountability. Your trust factor increases, both with the public 
and the search engines, and because they can simply be inconspicu-
ously placed at the bottom of each page, there’s no reason not to do it.
 
✦ Site map: Include a link to your HTML site map to help the search 
engines and your users find their way to every bit of your content.

224
Implementing a Site Search
 
✦ Link magnets: If you have any piece of content that you’re particularly 
known for, or that people often come looking for on your site, providing 
a link there on every page of your site will satisfy users and ensure that 
search engines consider it a significant page.
Side navigation
Side navigation elements typically include category-specific links. Side navi-
gation is context-sensitive: The links vary from page to page. This helps with 
siloing because you can reinforce the landing page’s theme by including 
links to supporting pages. You can put these links in a table cell along the 
side of your page.
Implementing a Site Search
Many sites offer a Search box right on their Web pages that lets users search 
for information within the Web site (see the example in Figure 2-2).

Implementing a Site Search
Site searches are essential if your Web site has tons of pages, such as for 
a magazine with years of archived issues, a large store with thousands of 
products, or other extensive amounts of content. Smaller sites might also 
want a site search, but this decision should be made carefully. If you’re 
thinking of adding a site search, consider the benefits and the potential 
drawbacks and be sure to implement a site search that’s effectively custom-
ized for your site.
The two major benefits of implementing a site search are
 
✦ Improving usability: Ideally, a site search should improve usability and 
user retention. If your site search helps people find what they’re looking 
for after coming to your site, it’s doing good. For example, a site search 
is essential for a shopping site such as Target’s site (www.target.com), 
which tries to keep users within the store after they arrive. Say a user 
comes to the Target site after running a Google search for [snow shov-
els]. If the user next wants to find [tire chains], Target’s handy search 
function offers a quick way to find more products, add them to the same 
cart, and check out one time. The user gets better convenience, and the 
Web site keeps a customer and increases its revenue.
 
✦ Providing direct user feedback: A site search provides you with a cache 
of valuable information. Your visitors leave a trail that tells you what 
they want in their own words. It’s perfect as a feedback tool — users 
come to you and type in exactly what they’re looking for. By tracking 
all of these searches and the user experience following each one, you 
can identify weaknesses in your site processes, keywords you may have 
overlooked, pages of content you need to add, and also what’s working 
successfully or not working at all.
The main drawback of a site search occurs when it does not improve 
usability. Many site searches fail to provide what the user is looking for and 
become a side door where many visitors exit. You don’t want to confuse and 
lose your site visitors by giving them a technical tool that doesn’t perform as 
expected. So examine your Web site carefully in order to determine whether 
the risk is worth it. If you have clear navigation and well-organized content, 
you might be better off letting users find their way around rather than giving 
them a shortcut to nowhere.
 
If you do decide to implement a site search, be sure to do it right. You want 
your site search to control the selection and presentation of results to make 
sure you’ve maximized the opportunity to give users what they need. When 
done well, an effective site search can prevent site abandonment and elimi-
nate the multitude of brief, one-time visitors. It can guide users along the 
conversion path, getting them hooked along the way and encouraging them 
to explore. To make sure, watch your site analytics closely after you deploy 
a site search to see whether it’s routing people well or causing them to take 
the nearest exit.

226
Incorporating Engagement Objects into Your Site
To be effective, your site search must be paired with good navigation and a 
well-siloed site. This combination is key to giving the user a good experience 
and to developing the relationship between your brand and the customer. 
Here are some tips for maximizing your site search on an e-commerce site:
 
✦ List all major product categories and subcategories on your home page 
for easy navigation. If you have more than 99 categories, consider mul-
tiple pages so you stay within Google’s Quality guidelines of less than 
100 links per page.
 
✦ Put a free form site search box on every page with content that can lead 
to further searches. Like Google search, this is a box where anything can 
be typed and get a potential answer.
 
✦ Implement guided search queries, where a user selects from a rigid pre-
determined list to help narrow their search.
 
• Provide site search for items by brand, price, color, sale, and so on.
 
• Provide site search for featured products in every category.
 
• Include every brand in every category in your site search database.
 
• Include bestsellers in every category.
In some cases, your site may require separate search capabilities, or you 
may have to choose which kinds of search to offer. The same underlying 
principles apply to non-e-commerce sites. Allow the site search to find your 
information in a variety of ways, broken down by lots of different categories, 
subcategories, and cross-categories. You want to give users many ways to 
get results, and avoid search failure.
 
There are many free or inexpensive site search kits you can use to incorpo-
rate a vertical search into your Web site. Google offers a site search option 
at http://www.google.com/sitesearch/ that’s easy to get started with 
and fairly inexpensive. Another way to go is to buy a behavioral search 
engine that tracks user actions and customizes the results per individual. 
Collarity (www.collarity.com) is an example of this type of search engine. 
Paired with the free Google Analytics tool, any site search offers a good way 
to track user queries. Check out Book VIII for more on analytics in general, 
Book VIII, Chapter 3 covers Google Analytics in more detail.
Incorporating Engagement Objects into Your Site
It’s a good practice to include engagement objects on your Web site. By 
engagement objects, we mean any type of interactive media object that gets 
users excited and offers them a way to connect to the content. This section 
specifically covers video and audio files. Including these types of rich media 
makes your Web site appear technically advanced to both users and search 
engines and engages your visitors.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Building an SEO-
Friendly Site
227
Incorporating Engagement Objects into Your Site
Incorporating engagement objects into your Web site can also improve your 
search engine rankings. The reason is because of a concept called blended 
search, which is the mixing of different types of content in the search results. 
For instance, if you search on Google for [classic Ford Mustang], Google 
may include more than just Web page links in your results. You might see 
photographs of restored Ford Mustangs at the top of your results page. Also 
mingled into the listings you might find a video link to a recent classic car 
show featuring Ford Mustangs. You might find a news article about a clas-
sic Ford Mustang that was the getaway car in a recent heist. Or you might 
find listings of classic car shops and other local businesses in your city that 
specialize in Ford Mustangs. Mixed in with these you would also see the 
top-ranked Web pages for the keyword phrase that you entered. Now that 
there’s blended search, the search engines show whatever types of files they 
determine to be the most relevant results. (As a side note, Google calls their 
blended search product Universal Search, and many in the search engine 
marketing community use that name to refer to all engines’ blended search 
offerings.)
The concept of blending different types of files within a single search results 
set has raised the value of putting media on your Web site. Some ranking 
factors have to do with what interactive media you have on your site. You 
want your site to get in on this action! You may find that just by adding some 
engagement objects to your Web site, your rank increases, especially if your 
competitors aren’t currently using any on their sites. At the very least, you 
have an opportunity to satisfy the visitors better than your competition.
Embedding interactive files the SEO-friendly way
Some sites offer video or audio files by displaying them in a separate pop-up 
window with no text. This has some value for visitors, but because search 
engines can’t do much to understand the contents of a video or audio file, 
and because the pop-up window doesn’t provide the spiders with any con-
text that would help them understand the media’s contents, the site has 
missed a valuable opportunity to enhance its keyword relevance with this 
great content.
 
A better way to handle video and audio files is to embed them right into 
your Web pages. Let the video play from right on the Web page that also 
includes descriptive text about the video. Give users a hyperlink to let them 
hear an audio clip of a Ford Mustang engine on your Ford Mustang landing 
page, and let the anchor text and the sentences in the code surrounding the 
image help to support your page’s keyword relevance. Some files, like MP3 
that contain clean narrative, can be indexed by the searches, but this isn’t 
perfect. The key to including video and audio files effectively is to place 
them in proximity from a code view to on-topic text that the search engines 
can read.

228
Incorporating Engagement Objects into Your Site
Video
You can include videos on your Web pages if they’re relevant to your topic. 
Basically, anything that can be shown in a short video that is relevant to 
your Web page could be used: Just make sure it’s ethical and within accept-
able standards for your industry. If you can, you should always be hosting 
your videos on your site. You can upload them to YouTube as well, but it’s 
your content and you should have it on your site. The possibilities are end-
less, but here are some examples of videos you might include, just to give 
you some ideas:
 
✦ Product demo: Include a small video demonstrating your product or 
service’s features and benefits. You can do this in a straightforward way 
or comically. For example, the Blendtec blender company uses video 
extremely effectively by showing videos of its product pulverizing things 
you’d never think to put in a blender (a shoe, an iPhone, and so on). The 
engaging videos alone have attracted thousands of interested buyers to 
the site (www.willitblend.com/), and have become a viral Internet 
phenomenon in their own right.
 
✦ Speech: If you or someone notable from your company speaks in public, 
you could capture a digital video of an appropriate speech. Just a snip-
pet might be enough.
 
✦ Tour: A video can be a tremendously effective tour guide. Show off your 
company building, impressive equipment, state-of-the-art facilities, or 
beautiful location — just pick something that can be well shown through 
a short video.
 
✦ Interview: You could interview one of your own personnel to give site 
visitors a “face-to-face” greeting, introduce one of your executives, or 
just give a video update of something newsworthy for your business. 
Alternatively, you could do a brief customer interview and post a live 
testimonial about your product or service.
 
Compression rates on the Internet mean that to keep file sizes down, you 
often have to sacrifice video quality for speed. Put your money into making 
sure that the audio is crisp and clean. When it comes to quality, studies have 
shown that as long as the audio is decent, users will watch a video even if 
the picture quality is lacking. For more tips on the technical aspects of 
uploading videos to your site, see Book V, Chapter 2.

Audio
 
We confess that Web sites that greet their visitors with audio blaring really 
annoy us! From a usability perspective, making every person who comes to 
your site scramble to find their volume control buttons and do damage con-
trol with whomever may have heard their computer erupting in sound is a 
bad idea. You definitely want to avoid that. With that disclaimer made, we 
want to explain the appropriate use of sound files. Because in the world of 
SEO, embedding an audio file or offering a podcast carries weight with the 
search engines — not to mention users.
Consider what types of audio files you might offer in your site. Some ideas 
include
 
✦ Sounds: If your site has anything to do with nature, consider offering 
nature sounds (waterfall, mockingbird calls, hyenas whooping, and so 
on). You could demonstrate how quiet your product is by recording its 
noise compared to, say, a roomful of football fans after a touchdown 
play. Or, you could use on-topic recordings of bells ringing, trains whis-
tling, tires screeching . . . this list is going downhill fast, but you get the 
idea.
 
✦ Music: We suggest that you include music on your site only if your site is 
about music. (Background music for the sake of ambiance alone can be 
annoying, but as long as you default it to off and offer a volume control, 
it could be effective.) If you’re a recording artist, by all means, include 
lots of links to your music and make sure to include keyword-rich song 
titles in the anchor text.
 
✦ Speaking: You could include a recording of a presentation, speech, 
sermon, training, poetry reading, or other public speaking event that’s 
relevant to your page topic and keywords. This makes for excellent SEO-
friendly content.
 
✦ Interviews: A Q&A session with one of your own staff or a notable 
person in your industry could be recorded and offered on your Web site. 
If you hire a new executive, consider interviewing her talk-show–style as 
an introduction that you can post on your Web site.
 
✦ Podcasts: To make your site even more advanced, host a podcast that 
site visitors can subscribe to. With a podcast, users can download digi-
tal audio recordings of a radio show or other type of regular program 
and listen to it on an iPod or other device. These are great for lessons, 
weekly recaps, radio shows, or even mixes of your favorite music with 
some commentary sprinkled in.

Allowing for Expansion
 
From an SEO perspective, there’s a right way and a wrong way to add video 
and audio files to your Web site. You can read our specific recommenda-
tions for keeping your audio and video files SEO-compliant and user-friendly 
in Book V, Chapter 2.
Allowing for Expansion
When you’re building your Web site, remember to allow for future expan-
sion. A Web site is never “finished” any more than a business can ever set 
itself in stone. To be successful, especially in online marketing, you must 
stay flexible and allow room for growth — including on your Web site.
Database engineers have to think about future growth when they create 
a new database structure. They do not want to be in a position where the 
entire database needs to be torn apart and rebuilt simply because it cannot 
accommodate adding another layer of storage. Similarly, you don’t want to 
box yourself in when it comes to your site design. To some extent, you can 
foresee future needs and plan ahead logically. Think about
 
✦ New products or services: Try to predict what types of add-on product 
lines or services may come down the pike and need to be added to your 
site.
 
✦ Expanded content: You’ve read how important it is to have lots of 
content supporting your keywords, so try to identify where you have 
content holes that need to be filled with new pages of supporting 
information.
 
✦ Enhanced features: If you’d like to someday enrich your site by starting 
a blog or other interactive community feature, envision how this might 
fit into your site.
Despite your best efforts, however, you probably cannot predict all the 
changes coming in the future. For this reason, you want to keep your Web 
site design, navigation, structure, and even name somewhat open. For exam-
ple, a business called George’s Ford-Only Customization Shop has prevented 
itself right away from ever being able to expand to Chevrolets. Similarly, 
you wouldn’t want your Web site’s domain name to be restrictively specific. 
Today, your business might be all about repairing truck fenders, but if you 
choose the domain name www.truckfenderwork.com, you’d be stuck 
having to create a new URL if you want to expand your business to work on 
all-body work or on cars as well as trucks.

Developing an Update Procedure
Because constant growth is the rule, you want to make your Web site struc-
ture modular. We cover the concept of siloing in Chapter 4, which involves 
breaking your Web site content into categories based on keywords. A proper 
silo structure allows you to add new silos without breaking your site’s cur-
rent linking architecture or navigation system. You can simply snap on 
another silo adjacent to the existing ones at the same structural level.
Developing an Update Procedure
You may be a one-man shop now or the only person in your company’s 
Web development department, like the Lone Ranger working to save the 
day. Or you might be part of a large team developing a voluminous Web 
site. Whatever your situation is today, the fact is that it will change. People 
may leave the company, you could be transferred, and new people could be 
hired. To survive the personnel changes that inevitably happen, your Web 
site must have a documented update procedure.
In the previous chapter, we covered creating a design procedure that func-
tions as a style guide for your Web site. Here, we want to help you expand 
that document to cover an update procedure, as well. You’ve done the 
research to know what your site needs in terms of SEO. If you don’t write 
down guidelines related to search engine optimization and include them in 
a style guide that new Webmasters, IT staff, marketing directors, and others 
can refer to, all of your SEO progress could be lost. After all, without an edu-
cation in SEO best practices, and without knowing how to do site analysis 
and competitive research (as you find out how to do in this book), people 
can make Web site decisions that drop them right out of the search engine 
rankings. We’ve seen it happen.
 
Write down your update procedures, including your SEO dos and don’ts, to 
lay out the blueprint for others to follow. Make them as exhaustive as possi-
ble. To get you started, some items to cover in your style guide and site 
update procedure would be
 
✦ File naming: Specify how you name new pages, images, videos, audio 
files, and so on. You probably have developed syntax for these things, 
so you want to write down those standards. (We cover good file naming 
in Book IV, Chapter 1.)
 
✦ Directory structure: How you name and structure your file folders 
should also be documented so that when someone creates a new silo or 
wants to add a new picture, they know how to do it.

232
Balancing Usability and Conversion
 
✦ Redirects: Document what your procedure is for redirecting traffic away 
from a no-longer-needed page. Because there are several types of HTML 
redirect codes and only a 301 redirect is good practice for SEO, instruc-
tions could help prevent a costly mistake. (For more information on 
redirects, see Book VII, Chapter 3.)
 
✦ Linking: You want to be sure to cover your procedure for adding new 
links. Explain why anchor text must contain relevant keywords (never 
just Click Here) and give guidelines for linking within silos, not between 
them, as a general rule. You may want to cover linking very thoroughly 
because it’s so important to SEO — you can find lots more information 
on good linking strategies in Chapter 4, as well as the rest of Book VI.
 
✦ New pages: Your procedure for adding a new page to your site should 
ask some critical questions, such as: What goal does this page meet? 
Does it fit into the silo? What are its main keywords? Whoever sets up 
the new page should be able to write down answers to these questions. 
In addition, because there are a number of things that must be carefully 
reviewed before a new page goes live, a checklist is helpful. Your new-
page checklist should contain all the steps needed to make sure that the 
page is SEO-friendly and ready for the public. We suggest you start with 
the sample checklist we included in Book I, Chapter 1, and adapt it for 
your site.
Balancing Usability and Conversion
This chapter is all about building an SEO-friendly site. However, we aren’t 
recommending that you design a Web site just for the search engines. Your 
SEO goal must be balanced with the need to create a user-friendly site. 
Unless you balance SEO-friendliness (to help people find your site) with 
user-friendliness (to make people want to stay there), you won’t be able to 
achieve your true objective, which is conversion.
Conversion refers to whatever action you want your site visitors to take. 
That may be buying something, joining a group, signing up for a newsletter, 
registering for a seminar, filling out a survey, or just visiting more pages. 
Whatever your definition is for conversion, your real goal involves more 
than just generating traffic to your site’s front door. When those people 
arrive, you want them to do something.
Usability and SEO working together
Usability refers to the way a person uses, or experiences, your Web site. 
Every few months, a familiar discussion resurfaces in the SEO community’s 
forums, blogs, and newsgroups: When you are designing a Web site, who

Balancing Usability and Conversion
should you be targeting, the search engines or the humans? Which should 
take precedence in your site design, and how do you serve both? Luckily, 
balancing these complementary needs is not as complicated as it seems. 
Search engine optimization and usability can work hand in hand. In fact, 
many of the things that are good for search engines benefit human visitors 
as well.
Some marketers are adamant that usability take priority over SEO, arguing 
that an unusable Web site can be at the top of the search engine results 
pages and still never make money. The reverse is pointed out as well — 
search engine optimization has to come first because the most perfectly 
usable site in the world still has to have visitors who use it before it is worth 
anything.
The confusion arises because people commonly mistake what the goal of 
each approach really is and makes the assumption that the two are incom-
patible. In many people’s minds, SEO advocates a complicated set of rules 
to follow, games to play, pages to write, links to attract, and hoops to jump 
through. Usability has also grown to complex proportions, incorporating the 
use of personas, conversion funnels (the path that a visitor takes to get to a 
conversion, most commonly a purchase) and psychology degrees in human 
factors. But if you strip away all of the ways in which both are done, their 
goals are remarkably similar. Search engine optimization is the process of 
designing a Web strategy that gives search engine spiders the best picture 
of the Web site possible. Usability is the process of designing a Web strategy 
that gives visitors the most satisfactory experience possible.
Although some techniques very clearly support either usability or search 
engine optimization — users simply don’t care if your page is W3C-compliant 
(following HTML standards set by the W3C) as long as it loads properly in 
the browser, for example — the two objectives aren’t often going to come 
into conflict. As long as you recognize that the ultimate goal is to maximize 
the potential of your Web site, the conflict remains minimal.
You need to focus first on the things that SEO and usability have in common 
and then put the rest into balance. SEO is about more than simply ranking 
well in the search engines. The key is to rank well in the search engines for 
the keywords that are most relevant. If your site is the most expert and best 
for your human visitors, your SEO campaign should be working to dem-
onstrate that to the search engines. Table 2-1 lists a few examples of how 
improving the usability of your site often benefits your SEO campaign, as 
well.

So when you consider your visitors’ needs in order to boost your site’s 
usability, the nice part is that you also usually support your SEO efforts. But 
what if there are conflicts? If the best way to serve your visitors seems to go 
against SEO best practices, there probably is a way to compensate.
We’ve found that there is nearly always a technical solution for achieving 
SEO, no matter what the site owner is trying to accomplish. Here are two 
scenarios where the site’s usability objectives needed a technical solution 
for SEO:

Book IV
Chapter 2
Building an SEO-
Friendly Site
235
Balancing Usability and Conversion
 
✦ Basic example: A Web designer wants to use a single image as the entire 
home page of a site. Knowing that search engines need to find content in 
order for that page to rank, you as the SEO consultant can use HTML to 
put content into the page, remove any words from the graphic and reset 
them as text, and use a .CSS file to position the elements and give style 
to the page.
 
✦ A more complicated example: To provide the kind of content its users 
need, a site uses query strings to dynamically build the page from a 
database rather than the page being static. To help optimize that site for 
search engines, a technical solution could involve renaming directories 
so that the URL of each page contains meaningful keywords and a link 
structure is implemented to assure crawlability; as a result, the search 
engine spiders can see what the site is about based on its well-labeled 
physical directory structure.
So between usability and SEO, which is more important to your Web site’s 
success? The answer is that they’re both equally necessary and, thankfully, 
can work hand in hand. Build your site for all of your visitors, human and 
spider alike. Instead of taking the approach that one or the other is suffi-
cient, realize that by doing them in tandem, your Web site can be stronger, 
easier to navigate, more accessible to your target audience, and can gener-
ate more conversions.
 
Go for conversions as your main target. As you monitor your site traffic and 
conversions, you may notice a strange phenomenon: Sometimes being 
number three or four or five on the search results page is better than 
number one. Sure, you get far more traffic in position one, but consider a 
typical scenario. Say a woman wants to buy a pair of designer shoes. She 
searches for the designer name and [shoes] and then begins clicking 
through the results. At the first Web site, she looks around and finds a pair 
she likes, but she doesn’t purchase them because she isn’t sure she’s found 
the best style or the best price. She clicks the second, third, and fourth sites 
to continue her shopping and price comparisons. At the fourth site, she’s 
done with price comparisons and has discovered that every site sells the 
shoes for the same price. She’s now ready to buy, and clicks Add to Cart on 
site number four: Because she’s already on the site, it’s the most convenient 
place for her to make her purchase. So site number four wins the conver-
sion. You have two choices: Be site number four, or be one of the first three 
sites that didn’t secure the conversion and figure out why not. In this case, 
ranking number one might not get you the sale unless your site was a lean, 
mean, converting machine.

Balancing Usability and Conversion
Creating pages that sell/convert
Most people come to a Web page and decide whether to stay there within 
the first three seconds. That means that you have only three seconds to 
convince someone that your page offers what they’re looking for. For each of 
your landing pages, ask yourself questions such as
 
✦ Curb appeal: Is the site able to satisfy the intent of the query and is it 
appropriate to the visitor?
 
✦ Impressions: At first glance, what does my page seem to be about?
 
✦ Focus: Is it clear that this page is about the keyword?
 
✦ Ease of use: How easy is it to achieve the desired task?
 
✦ More details: Can a visitor easily access more detailed information if 
desired?
 
✦ Conversion: Can a visitor easily navigate to where a conversion can take 
place?
You also want to consider your goal for each page and see if you’re achiev-
ing it. This differs from deciding what the keyword is for each page. For 
instance, you may have a landing page on your classic car customization 
Web site centered on the keyword [Chevrolet Camaros]; your text may be 
all about restoring classic Chevy Camaros; your images might depict clas-
sic Chevy Camaros; and so far, that’s all good. But your goal for this page is 
a different issue. Your goal may be to get the user to click through to more 
pages on your Web site. Your goal may be to have the user download a 
coupon for a free tire rotation. Your goal may be to entice the user to set an 
appointment, make a phone call, order a service, make a purchase, or some-
thing else. In short, the page’s goal can be measured in terms of what you 
want visitors to do while on this page.
To help determine each page’s goal, ask yourself three questions about 
every page on your Web site that requires action (such as landing pages):
 
✦ What: What action is required?
 
✦ Who: Who must take that action?
 
✦ How: What information does the visitor need in order to know how to 
take the required action?
After you have each page’s goal firmly in mind, usability really comes into 
play. Think of yourself as a professional usability expert for your Web site. 
You want to design your pages in a way that helps your site visitors success-
fully reach the goal. Don’t just assume that you know what’s best. Someone

who knows the site and industry has a completely different opinion than a 
prospective user of the site. All the different needs and viewpoints of your 
potential audience should be explored. This is why if you have the budget 
for it, a professional usability expert can be worth her weight in gold.
For example, professional usability experts can help brick-and-mortar stores 
decide how to lay out their shelves for highest potential revenue. They can 
advise a bookstore owner that people tend to turn to the right when enter-
ing a store more often than they turn to the left, and the bookstore can apply 
this information by positioning a bestseller table to the right of the entry. 
Grocery stores are a great example of user psychology in action as well: 
You have to pass right through all the really tempting packaged goods, like 
doughnuts and chips, to get to the staple items, like milk and eggs, that are 
usually on your shopping list.
On your Web site, you want each of your landing pages to meet a particular 
goal. Often you want the landing page to work as a funnel, collecting visitors 
and sending them through to some other page on your site. For instance, 
an Add to Cart link near the product information is a fairly standard way to 
turn a window shopper into a customer, and if your site then displays a clear 
Proceed to Checkout or similar link, you can funnel the person to a page 
where they can make a purchase. If your site isn’t about e-commerce, you 
still want to have clear signposts that lead visitors from each landing page to 
a conversion page. (Note: We cover more about conversion funnels in Book 
VIII, Chapter 2.)
 
Engineering a Web site for human interaction does not always follow 
common sense. There’s a whole usability science about how to design Web 
pages for maximum return, and that’s outside the scope of this book. If you 
want to research it, we recommend starting with the Web site UsabilityEffect 
(www.usabilityeffect.com/). The site owner, Kim Krause Berg, began in 
the field of SEO and then moved to a career in usability consulting, so she 
understands both sides. You can discover a lot from the articles and other 
resources on her site.
Keep in mind that all usability theories remain just that — theories — until 
proven through user testing. You might add a button that says Free Tire 
Rotation Coupon on your Web site’s home page, but until you analyze how 
many times people click the button to download the coupon, you don’t 
really know if it’s an effective conversion device. You would also want to 
know whether adding the coupon link draws more traffic to your site, or 
alters your search engine ranking. To go a step further with your user test-
ing, you might also try a few different versions of the button, varying its look 
or placement, and gather comparison data. However you approach it, you’re 
going to want to prove your usability theories with some real-world testing.

238
Balancing Usability and Conversion
Creating a strong call to action
Do your Web pages have a clear “call to action,” enticing people to do what-
ever action the Web page requires? If not, this could explain a less-than-
satisfactory conversion rate.
 
You need an effective call to action on any page where you want the user to 
do something. This goes back to knowing what your goal is for each page, 
whether it’s to click through to another page, add an item to a shopping 
cart, or some other action. Because Web sites typically lose a percentage of 
people at every step along the way to conversion (known as conversion 
dropoff), you want their journey to be as direct and clear as possible.
The most effective calls to action make use of an imperative verb (like Add 
or Sign Up or Create) and a compelling benefit. Some of the very best calls to 
action are actually graphics or buttons that catch the visitor’s eye but don’t 
dilute your content with needless commercial language that could bias the 
search engines. If your site is research-oriented, you might want to obscure 
the words Buy Now by placing them into an image so that the search engines 
don’t think that you’re a retail site. This example could be from a business-to-
business site. It’s very motivating for an engineer seeking this type of solution:
Attend our Web cast “Process Excellence for Supply Chain 
Management” and learn how to reduce costs with our 
process-driven approach to align business practices within 
your organization.
 
Your call to action must tell visitors exactly what you want them to do. If you 
want them to buy your product, you could scatter multiple calls to action in 
strategic places within your copy, telling them how to do it (such as Click 
here to buy Brand X now). If you want them to contact you by phone, list 
your phone number and provide instructions (“Call us Monday–Friday from 
8–5 PST at 1-866-517-1900”). Repeat the number in bold text throughout your 
copy and again at the end. But be wary of spamming the page. Repeating your 
call to action only works if you don’t annoy the visitor.
You should use meaningful words in the anchor text of any call to action in 
order to reinforce why the user would want to do it. The anchor text can 
clarify why a user would click by incorporating keywords. For example, if 
you have links in your copy to sign up for your newsletter, include a brief 
description in every link like “Car Restoration Newsletter” rather than just 
“Sign up for our newsletter.” Descriptive anchor text on your calls to action 
adds value for users and also helps build link equity for your site with the 
search engines.

You want to make sure that you’re not inadvertently thwarting anyone from 
getting to the point of conversion with confusing messages, broken links, or 
other weaknesses in your site. This is where micro-management is appropri-
ate — gather lots of site analytics from your IT department and closely 
examine how effective your conversion path is every step of the way. You 
need this to help you identify problems, and then test and improve, test and 
improve again, and then again — it’s an ongoing process.
 
A strong call to action is critical, but it’s just one factor that helps you 
achieve conversions. In the end, your conversion rate reflects your ability to 
persuade visitors to complete their intended actions from A to Z. It is a mea-
sure of your effectiveness and of customer satisfaction overall.

n this chapter, you get down to the nitty-gritty stuff that makes your 
page stand on its own. In addition to worrying about links or content, 
you have to get the nuts and bolts right. Your SEO strategy is only as strong 
as its weakest link, so make sure that every part of the chain is forged as 
tough as you can make it. Attention to the small stuff pays off big-time in the 
long run.
Success with on-page optimization, the changing of the underlying code of a 
Web page for SEO reasons, isn’t something that you can just guess at or just 
hope that you luck into. You need to understand every element of a Web 
page and use it to the fullest potential. Knowing how spiders are going to 
see and react to your page is absolutely critical to your optimization efforts. 
For example, mistakes with JavaScript can lead to a spider trap, where a 
spider gets caught in an endless loop and is forced to abandon the page 
because it has no other alternative. In this chapter, we cover the things that 
make your page search engine–friendly and what the biggest pitfalls are. 
Getting these elements right is essential if you’re going to obtain and retain 
traffic and rankings in the long term.
In this chapter, we show you how to create clean, attractive HTML pages 
that properly render in the browser and give search engines a clear path to 
index the page and understand its value to their users. You discover how to 
write every part of your page, from your HTML code to your JavaScript and 
CSS, in a way that supports your ranking goals.

Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
At first, the Web was made up in great part by research papers posted by 
academics. They were formatted in a specific way and most of them were 
heavily text-based. These days, the Internet contains document types of 
every shape and size. Images, videos, Flash pages — you name it, someone’s 
built it — and they all serve their purposes in the construction of a suc-
cessful Web site. (You can find more about optimizing media content in the 
“Choosing the Right Navigation” section in this chapter and still more on 
video optimization in Book V, Chapter 2.) Nevertheless, when you get down 
to the basic structure for a Web page, you’re still looking at HTML.
HTML pages are the building blocks of your Web site, so it’s worth it to take 
the time to construct them well. Unlike humans, search engines evaluate 
pages based on the code. Because search engines cannot understand images 
or similar content forms, that content is invisible to them, leaving them to 
only see the content in the text of an HTML page. You want to write your 
code so that it will be very easy for spiders to understand. You don’t want 
to bury the content down in the code. This is intuitively obvious to Web 
designers and seasoned search engine optimizers, but many people don’t 
take the time to put it into practice. In this section, we break down, define, 
and explain how best you can optimize each of the so–called on-page 
elements of a successful Web page.
The Head section
The task of optimizing every HTML page begins in the head section. The 
Head section is where search engines are first introduced to your page and 
where they first discover what the page is all about. This section makes that 
infamous first impression that you only get one shot at. But the job of the 
Head section isn’t only to impress the search engine. Search engines like to 
share the wealth when it comes to information, so parts of your Head section 
get starring roles on the search engine results page. Time to get those parts 
camera-ready!
The four important tags in the Head section are the Title, Meta descrip-
tion, Meta keywords, and Meta robots tags. Metadata, is quite simply, data 
about data. It is descriptive of the rest of the page. Each of these help to 
define for the search engine what’s coming up in the page and how it relates 
to other pages: the first three by defining the content, and the last by defin-
ing how the search engine should handle the information and links on the 
page. You can find out more about how these first three tags can affect your 
site’s search engine rankings in the next few sections. For more on the Meta 
robots tag, jump to Book VII.

Optimizing Title tags for ranking and branding
The undisputed headliner of the head section is the Title tag. Although the 
various search engines out there don’t tell us how important any one ele-
ment is in their algorithms, most industry experts agree that the Title tag 
is one of the most critical. Because the Title tag not only shows up in your 
browser window but also in the search engine results, it’s easy to infer that 
this tag naturally has some impact in the search engine’s ranking algorithms. 
The following code (and Figure 3-1) show you how a Title tag appears in 
HTML.
<title>Good Titles Use Keywords like Ford Mustang 1967 
specs</title>
 
Figure 3-1:

Getting this tag right has many benefits — increased ranking, branding, and 
click-throughs. Getting it wrong severely hinders your page’s chances at 
ranking in the search engine — duplicate Title tags are considered spam 
and are filtered, poorly written ones won’t garner click-throughs, and your 
branding purposes won’t be served. Leaving out the keywords hurts your 
chances to rank for those words.

244
Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
The Title tag, although short, tells the search engine what your page is 
about. The maximum number of characters allotted for the Title tag is 62 
to 70, depending upon search engine. You have just a few words to inform, 
entice, and reinforce your brand to search engines and their users. In order 
to get your message through, you need to be specific with keywords. Entice 
searchers with calls to action and use “research” words like how to and 
information. Figure 3-1 displays a Title tag as seen in Google’s search 
engine results pages.
So what to do about this short, yet critically important piece of content? In 
order to maximize the effectiveness of your Title tag, you need to make 
some solid decisions first:
 
✦ Focus: Your page must have a single explicit subject. Put keywords 
related to that focus in the Title.
 
✦ Silo: Your page must support the theme of the page above it and be 
supported by the pages that link below it. Theme level keywords should 
appear in the Title.
 
✦ Branding: Some pages are critical to support branding; others are not. If 
branding is an issue, include branded keywords in the Title.
After you’ve decided on your focus, theme, and brand emphasis, you’re 
ready to start writing your tag. Even though the actual length of your Title 
tag varies depending on your industry standard, you can follow some basic 
guidelines to get started. The two most important terms to remember are 
unique and keyword-rich. You need to make sure that you’re writing unique, 
keyword-rich titles for your pages. The title of your page should belong only 
to that page, and not be used anywhere else on your site. If you’re following 
your focus, theme, and branding guidelines, you should already be using 
words in a combination that won’t be repeated somewhere else. Your title 
should not be sensational or contain keywords that you don’t expect to rank 
for. Be sure that you have only one Title tag per page. Duplicate Title 
tags are a severe issue that could lead to filtering of your pages by the 
search engines, denying them the ability to rank for key terms.
Your title should be fairly short. Google cuts your title off after 70 char-
acters, so you need to get your message right up front. Although Google 
indexes the whole tag, you want users to see your relevance immediately.

Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
 
Put the keywords up front, and make them enticing for people to click 
through. If branding is an issue, put your company name at the end unless 
that is the main thrust of your SEO strategy. For example, Nike doesn’t put 
running shoes at the front of their title: They put Nike first because their 
brand is their most important keyword. Notice that in Figure 3-1, the words 
search engine optimization are bolded wherever they appear. Google bolds 
search query words that appear in the title, which may lead to higher click-
throughs. Eye-tracking studies have shown that people are naturally drawn 
to bold-faced type.
Be aware that there is a difference between being keyword-rich and being 
spammy. Spam by excessive repetition of keywords only hurts, not helps, 
your Title tag. Always strive to play within acceptable boundaries when 
it comes to SEO. The margin of safety changes all the time and without any 
warning at all.
Writing a Meta description
Working your way through the tags in a typical Head section, the next stop 
is the Meta description tag. Search engines use the Meta description tag 
in their results, so this is an important tag to get right. Write your Meta 
description like a sentence, describing what visitors can expect to find 
on the page after they click through from the search engine. If you fail to 
provide a Meta description, search engines often select text off the page 
that may or may not be a good representation of your page’s real value. In 
Google, this extraction is called an autosnippet, and it contains the words 
found in the query whenever possible. It is in your best interest to craft a 
unique, targeted Meta description tag for every page. The following code 
displays a sample Meta description tag as it would appear in the raw HTML 
of a Web page:
<meta name=”description” content=”Your description tag should 
use keywords, describe the theme and purpose of the page 
and be fairly short. It is structured as a sentence.”>
The Meta description should be about twice as long as your Title tag. Like 
the title, words used in the search query that are also found in the descrip-
tion are bolded, giving your listing another opportunity to catch the eye of 
the searcher. Google displays up to 160 characters for the description, some-
times extracted from the page content. If the Meta description is used for 
search engine results, you must put your best information right up front. No 
one but the spider sees it if you don’t. Figure 3-2 shows a Meta description 
tag appearing in Google’s search results.

246
Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
 
Figure 3-2: 
A Meta

Meta description in Google search results
Your description should answer the question “What is this page about?”. 
Try not to repeat any word more than twice; any more than that may look 
unnatural to users and to the engines. Ask yourself what your target audi-
ence would be looking for when searching for you and write your metadata 
to address that person. Notice in Figure 3-2 that descriptions are in sentence 
form and give you a very clear idea about the content on the linked page.
 
Like your Title tag, your Meta description tag must be unique; that is, it 
has to be unlike any other on your site and targeted to the content of the 
page it’s on, or you run the risk of duplicate content (that is, content that 
appears elsewhere on your site or the Web) penalties. Duplicate content is 
commonly filtered out of the search results by the engines because it’s not 
in their users’ best interests to show the same or similar pages more than 
once. Even if everything else on your page is unique and useful, a duplicate 
tag in the head section can spell disaster for your rankings. The metadata 
must match your content, using the same words. Think of your metadata as 
the advertisement and the content as your product. Don’t be guilty of false 
advertising!

In the past, it used to be simple (well, okay, easier) to get ranked in the 
search engines. Use your keywords in the page’s metadata (including Title 
and Meta description as well as the keywords tag) and throughout the dis-
played body of the page, and within days or even hours, you could be on 
the top of any search engine you liked: Infoseek, AltaVista, Excite, or Yahoo!. 
But times have changed, and search engines have developed algorithms that 
are much more sophisticated, containing many more variables. The Meta 
keywords tag, which is basically a place to list all the relevant keywords 
for your page, is very easy to abuse because it’s not a user-visible tag and 
invites keyword stuffing — putting every word, not just relevant ones, into 
the content of the tag. As a result, the Meta keywords tag suffered a serious 
devaluation. To be frank, you are never, ever going to rank on the basis of 
your Meta keywords tag for any competitive term.
So why still use it? Although some engines claim that they don’t even bother 
to index the Meta keywords tag, they still usually read and store it. Although 
the Meta keywords tag is not a major factor in rankings, it’s still better to 
sweat the small stuff and do everything right from the get-go. It only takes 
a few minutes to do it right and you won’t be penalized for having them 
(unless you spam by keyword stuffing). You can never go wrong by using 
a Meta keywords tag, and you only hurt yourself if you don’t use this valid 
piece of HTML data. The following code shows you how to format a Meta 
keywords tag in HTML:
<meta name=”keywords” content=”First Keyword Phrase, Second 
Keyword Phrase, Repeated Keyword, Keyword”>
Optimizing a Meta keywords tag is simple. Essentially, the only thing this 
tag requires is that you list all the keywords and keyword phrases that are 
important to your page. A general rule is that if a keyword was important 
enough to be included in your title and Meta description, it’s important 
enough to include in your keywords tag. As a best practice, order your 
keyword phrases from longest to shortest (four-word phrases, and then 
three-word phrases, and then two-word phrases, and so on). This keeps you 
organized and gives the search engines the most targeted and usually the 
most valuable words right up front.
 
Don’t go overboard. Remember, excessive repetition could be considered 
spam. Try not to repeat any single keyword more than twice. If you stick to 
a keywords tag approximately twice the length of your Meta description tag, 
you’re playing on safe ground.

Body section
Other than the page title which appears at the very top of your browser 
window above the menu, all of the user-visible content is located in a page’s 
body section. As your site aims to satisfy the needs of users and search 
engines alike, dedicating ample time to producing high-quality body content 
is critical to creating a search-engine friendly site that serves the needs of 
your users.
After a search engine spider reads the summary-style information provided 
in a page’s head section, it should find that the content within the body sec-
tion also supports the established keywords. The vast majority of text con-
tent, links, and images are located in the body section. Having a significant 
amount of keyword-rich text content in the body section is absolutely neces-
sary to achieving a Web page optimized for search engines.
Headings
Within the body section, the heading acts like the headline of a newspaper, 
identifying the topic of sections or paragraphs of a Web page. As such, it 
plays an important role for search engines looking to classify the subject 
matter of the page. Because of this, search engines give heading text signifi-
cant weight in their ranking algorithms; thus, it’s very important that you 
optimize headings in line with your ranking goals.
As with a table of contents or outline, the heading is usually made up of 
short phrases, generally not complete sentences. Within the page, there are 
often sub-sections with their own sub-heading tag designations. Hence an H1 
tag may be followed by H2 tags. Figure 3-3 displays an H1 heading tag used 
in content.
 
When you’re writing an H1 tag, you must include the most important key-
words of that section of your Web page, which are likely to be the keywords 
also used in the Title and Meta tags. When seen together with the other 
keyword-optimized page elements discussed throughout this section, all of 
your page’s significant text work together to support the spiders’ recogni-
tion of your keywords as your site’s area of expertise. For this reason, we 
recommend that you always use at least one H# tag on every page of your 
site. Thanks to CSS and special CSS/Flash customization methods like scal-
able Inman Flash Replacement (sIFR), you can use H# tags throughout a page 
without ruining the design. You don’t need to use an image where you can 
place search engine and spider-friendly text instead.

Heading tag on page
You can use multiple headings as needed, but they should always be used 
in hierarchical order. An H1 tag is given more weight than an H2 tag. It’s rare 
that there would be more than one H1 on a page because pages generally 
only have one major subject. (There are exceptions to this rule; we have 
multiple H1 tags on our homepage at BruceClay.com because we have a very 
long page that is defining multiple top level topics.) All other subjects natu-
rally fall below that top level listing. Following an H1 tag, the next heading 
on the page can be represented by the H2 tag. In other words, heading tags 
should not be used out of order. The H1 tag should be followed by the H2 
tag, which can be followed by the H3 tag, if needed.
 
Don’t use excessive headings: Too many can actually dilute the theme of 
your page. Think of this structure as a table of contents and you can’t go 
wrong.

250
Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
Each heading throughout the page should be unique. Because the purpose 
of the heading is to summarize the unique content of the page or section, 
each heading should naturally be unique as well. However, the content 
within a heading tag should be similar to the content in the Title because 
both share the task of summarizing the page content and including signifi-
cant page keywords.
Try to keep headings from being too long. Because they are serving as a 
headline for the page, headings must be concise and to the point. Notice that 
the heading in Figure 3-3 acts as more of a title describing the subject of the 
page. A heading should usually be only a few targeted words and never more 
than a single sentence. Including an entire paragraph in a heading tag would 
likely be considered spam by the search engines. Here are a few points to 
remember about headings:
 
✦ Use heading tags as a headline for your page.
 
✦ Use heading tags in hierarchical order, following an H1 with an H2, and 
then H3, and so on.
 
✦ Keep headings short and unique.
 
✦ Don’t use headings for styling text. Use CSS instead.
Content
Search marketers often say that content is king. Regardless of its relation-
ship to royalty, tests show that content weighs heavily in search engine 
rankings. Although search engines are rapidly developing the capabilities 
to index other types of media, in most cases, you’re dealing with a search 
engine spider that is deaf, dumb, and blind. Spiders cannot see images, 
watch videos, listen to podcasts, fill out forms, or use any other advanced 
features of your Web site although they can detect that those engagement 
objects are present and are expanding their ability to index that content. For 
this reason, it’s imperative that you have enough sentence-structured text 
content on your page for a search engine to adequately determine what your 
page is about. The amount of content necessary to be competitive varies by 
industry, but the trend is that the amount of content has steadily increased 
over time for all industries. Discover how much content is right for your 
industry by doing competitive research (as described in Book II, Chapter 1).
If you’re just starting out and haven’t done competitive research, plan for a 
minimum of 450 or more words of good, relevant, useful text content on your 
important pages. Your content should always be unique to the page it’s on 
and should naturally incorporate the keywords found in your title, descrip-
tion, and headings. The reason for this is simple: The first three tags define 
what the page is about; therefore, it is only logical that those words are 
repeated again in the text content on your site. Don’t fall into the trap of

discussing something without ever naming what it is or relying on the 
images on the page to provide context. Remember that the search engines 
aren’t able to look at the picture and understand what you’re talking about. 
If your page is about Ford Mustangs, you need more than a picture of the car 
to let the search engines know that. Say what you mean.
 
Use synonyms and related words in order to reinforce your keywords. When 
discussing shoes, you should also be using words that help define what sort 
of shoes. Are the related words heel, leather, instep, size, and designer? Or 
are they horse, anvil, iron, and mare? You can see that many very different 
mental pictures are painted by placing the keyword shoes in context.
There’s practically no maximum number of words you can put on a page: 
A search engine just keeps reading. (Your visitors might not, though! If you 
don’t have anything interesting to say, stop talking.) You should have all 
the words discuss the same subject matter for SEO, but long pages are not 
frowned upon by search engines. There used to be upper limits on how large 
of a page that the search engines would index, but those have gone out the 
window. 
While the search engines might be happy to read your 50,000 word opus, 
you need to keep in mind user fatigue. If you find yourself discussing several 
topics on a very long page, you might consider breaking it up into two or 
more pages. This adds depth to your site by expanding the number of pages 
you have on a keyword phrase and also allows you to manage the site’s 
themes.
 
When it comes to formatting the text on your page, remember, people tend 
to scan text on the Internet. Keep paragraphs short and direct. Give the facts 
as concisely as possible. Customers don’t want to spend a long time reading 
if the Web page isn’t going to satisfy their requirements. Tell your customers 
who you are, what your product is, and why they should choose you over 
your competitors. Use lists, bold, and italicized text to direct your visitors’ 
eyes to important words and concepts.
If you are writing content for your own Web site, your first response might 
be to feel frustrated. What on earth are you going to write about? Everyone 
knows everything that you could possibly tell them and you’re not a writer 
anyway. But that’s just the thing: They don’t know everything, and you are an 
expert on the topic even if you’re not the world’s best writer.
For most people, the hardest part of adding content to their Web sites is 
the writing of the content in the first place, but it doesn’t have to be. There 
are lots of themes for you to write on and many topics available for you to 
write about. For e-commerce sites, this might include a well-written product 
description, user reviews, tips and tricks, or the inclusion of some frequently 
asked questions.

252
Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
Remembering that most people on the Web are there to do research. You 
should address the concerns that your visitors may have and give them 
a reason to buy whatever you are selling (literally or figuratively). Search 
engines look for research words, like how to and tips as markers that indicate 
that page will satisfy a user doing research.
Suppose for example that you’re in the business of selling cowboy boots. 
You are an expert in your area. Brainstorm everything you can think of 
that relates to cowboy boots, even if it’s only somewhat related. After you 
have all your ideas down, pick a few of the best. For example, you probably 
want to focus a section of your site on the keywords [buy cowboy boots]. 
Everyone, you think, knows about how to buy boots. It’s just a matter of 
finding the right fit and style. You don’t need to explain it to your site’s visi-
tors. But it’s one of your keywords, so you sit down and write all the obvious 
information.
Of course, you know how to check the fit of your boots and which styles 
work best for which people. It’s obvious to you that your jeans should be 
tucked inside your boots if you’re working outside and that you should take 
certain steps to care for your boots.
But most people don’t know these things. That’s why they’re coming to your 
site in the first place. Your expertise is a valuable resource for the develop-
ment of content. Explaining something that is obvious to you is probably the 
best way to introduce new customers to your products. If a visitor who is 
an expert comes into your site, having correct and informative content rein-
forces to them that your site is worthwhile.
Write your first draft with the page’s keywords in mind. Use your keywords 
as a guide for the content. Tape them to the side of your monitor or put 
them at the very top of the document so they’re on your mind as you write. 
Don’t worry about keyword densities or forcing the words in. If it doesn’t 
sound natural to use the keyword, don’t use it. The first draft is just to get 
the information out.
Take a look at the tone of your piece: 
 
✦ Match your audience: Are you writing to the right audience? Baby 
boomers and teenagers have very different ways of expressing them-
selves, not to mention widely different cultural touchstones, and writing 
the same way to each of them is probably not going to work. You have 
to speak their language.
 
✦ Engage the reader: Your content should get the user involved and offer 
them ways to connect to the material.

✦ Solve a problem: Does your content solve a problem or help the cus-
tomer make a decision? Fighting fear, doubt, and uncertainty increase 
your conversions as visitors learn to trust you.
 
✦ Educate: If you’re in a highly technical area where your customer isn’t 
likely to know enough to ask intelligent questions, have you educated 
them enough to feel comfortable in making their decision?
Revise your draft with these ideas in mind. Knowing your audience means 
putting in the kinds of words that they will be looking for: the same kinds 
of words that help them understand what the best choice of products is for 
them.
 
After your next draft, ask someone else to read it over for you. The best 
person for this task is someone who fits the profile of a site visitor. Have 
them read it aloud to see if it is easily readable and answers their questions 
in an easy to understand way. If not, revise the content to meet their under-
standing. You might even find that you’re going to need another page of con-
tent in order to answer their questions.
After you have a final draft, incorporate your final product into the destina-
tion page, and use a page rating tool to determine the validity and strength 
of the document. Tweak it if necessary. Keep in mind how the content sup-
ports the Web site theme as a whole. This ties into the linking strategies dis-
cussed in all of Book VI.)
The final thing to remember about writing for search engines is that there is 
no magical formula for writing the perfect copy. You’re going to have to put 
in hard work and attention to detail to meet the needs of both the search 
engines and your human visitors. Start writing and go from there.
Links
Links within the body section provide anchor text, which is the text that 
the user clicks on in order to follow the link to a new page (see the follow-
ing code). When they are measuring the relevance of the Web page, search 
engine spiders consider the anchor text of links pointing that page. The 
keyword used within the anchor text of the hyperlink is not added to the 
keyword frequency of your Web site (how many times a keyword is used and 
how far apart in the text), but it does add to the relevance of the target page 
Web page in the search engine.
<a href=”http://www.mydomain.com/bikerboots.html”>Motorcycle 
Boots</a>

254
Optimizing HTML Constructs for Search Engines
Links have a lot of power when it comes to a Web site appearing high in the 
search engine results page. How many links a particular page or site has is 
part of the algorithms search engines use, simply because it’s saying that 
your page or site has meaning and carries a certain amount of expertise. It’s 
like being the most popular kid in school because everyone says you have all 
of the answers.
With anchor text, you’re basically describing to the search engine what the 
page you’re linking to is about. So if you provided a link with the words the 
world’s greatest page as the anchor text, the engine reads that and 
adds it to the relevance of the page. So if all of the hyperlinks to that page 
within your Web site say the same thing, that it’s the world’s greatest page, 
the engine’s going to pick up on that like a giant blinking neon arrow and 
say that your page is the world’s greatest page when someone enters that 
search query.
Two types of links can be used in the body section: relative links and abso-
lute links. An absolute link is a link that contains the whole file path, so when 
it appears in code, it begins with http://, as shown here:
<a href=”http://www.classiccarcustomization.com/fords/
mustangs/tireoptions.html”>
That’s the whole file directory in the link itself. A relative link references a 
file located in a physical directory relative to the current page or the root 
of all directories, so it can simply start with the page name and leave off 
the http:// and domain. If you’re on the page www.classiccar
customization.com/mustangs/paintoptions.html, you could use 
<a href=”tireoptions.html”> to reach http://www.classiccar
customization.com/mustangs/tireoptions.html.
You can use two periods before the filename to indicate that the page is 
located one directory up (closer to the root) from the directory the page is 
located in. For example, the HTML on the same page — <a href=”../tire
options.html”> — indicates that the link goes to a page located at www.
classiccarcustomization.com/tireoptions.html.
Relative links are a bit of a shortcut, and on the whole we recommend that 
you don’t use them, especially if you’re building your site from the ground 
up. When you use a relative link, it works only in relation to the page that the 
link is contained on. So tireoptions.html is only going to work if there’s 
a mustangs/tireoptions.html for it to link to.
If the directories were to get switched around or taken out for whatever 
reason, the relative link would no longer work: Where it linked to no longer 
exists. So if the page with the link on it (in this case, paintoptions.html) 
was moved to the /mustangconvertible directory, the relative link of <a 

Book IV

href=”tireoptions”> would not work anymore because there’s no tire
options.html page located in the /mustangconvertible directory. A link 
to /tireoptions.html and an absolute link would still work. Without the 
leading slash (/), the link only goes to the current directory.
An absolute link is easier to maintain than a relative one because it is very 
clear what you’re linking to and why, and there will be no confusion if the 
location of a page changes. Although fixing one or two broken links isn’t a 
big deal, if every link on your site is relative, you’ll have a huge repair proj-
ect every time you decide to reorganize your page. And forget about reus-
ing snippets of code from page to page. Relative links, unlike absolute links, 
rarely still take you to the page you intended if you happen to reuse the 
code on another page.
Bottom line: The absolute link <a href=”http://www.classiccar
customization.com/mustangs/tireoptions.html”> always gets you 
to the Tire Options page. A relative link like <a href=”tireoptions.
html”> gets you there only if you’re starting from the same directory. In the 
long run, absolute links are less of a hassle.
Images
Images in the body of your site are also pretty important. Not only do they 
add to the overall aesthetic of your Web site and provide a visual of the 
product if you’re trying to sell something, they also add weight and rel-
evance to your ranking. Images aid users and they provide search engines 
with additional clues about the page. Images can also appear in vertical 
search engines (search engines that look for a specific file type only).
Images should contain keywords in their filenames (when they’re named 
properly; see Book 4, Chapter 1 for more info). A search engine can read 
the filename and add it to the overall relevancy of the page. Also, although 
search engines cannot see images, they can read Alt attribute text. Alt 
attribute text is the HTML code that describes the image. The Alt attribute 
is designed to be an alternative text description for an image. The Alt attri-
bute displays before the image is loaded (if it’s loaded at all) in the major 
browsers, and instead of the image in text-based browsers such as Lynx. Alt 
is a required element for images in order to help vision-impaired people and 
can only be used for image tags because its specific purpose is to describe 
images. Stuffing many keywords into the Alt attribute text is considered 
spam and can get you pulled from a search engine’s index (list of Web sites 
they crawl during a search). Instead, Alt attribute text should be a short 
descriptive phrase that clearly describes the content of the image. In the 
sample code, “1967 Ford Mustang with dented rear fender” is the Alt text 
for the image named ford.dented.fender.jpg.
<img src=”ford.dented.fender.jpg” alt=”1967 Ford Mustang with 
dented rear fender”>

256
Using Clean Code
Make your images relevant to the overall content of the page. You can’t have 
a picture of a duck on a page about classic cars, for instance — not unless 
the duck is driving a classic car. Another way a search engine can “see” an 
image is by the descriptive text around the image, so the image had better 
be relevant to the text describing it. As we mentioned previously, the image 
name, if it contains keywords, also helps to identify the image to the search 
engines. The identification of the image related to the keywords of the page 
it’s on allows the image to contribute to the page as content. This helps your 
relevancy.
Using Clean Code
When designing or building your Web site, it’s important to keep the code as 
clean as possible. If you have useless tags in your code, get rid of them, and 
code in as little markup as possible. That means no extraneous tags lying 
around in the HTML. You want to streamline your site’s code so it’s an easy 
read for the search engine spiders. If you can define something in 200 tags 
instead of 400, cut out all of the tags you do not need.
Code gunk buildup can happen if you’ve cut and pasted code from another 
source (like an outdated Web page of yours) or if you’ve been working on 
a particular page for so long that it’s acquired excess tags. Go through and 
remove all of the extraneous tags and code from your page. Simplifying your 
code streamlines the site and makes it easier to read for the search engine 
spiders. If spiders read too much redundant stuff, they’re less likely to 
assign a lot of weight or relevancy to your page, and are likely to throw out 
one of the pages.
With clean code, the goal is to have a high amount of content with the least 
amount of markup. This means there’s more content going on than HTML 
coding. Figure 3-4 shows two different pages’ HTML code side by side. On 
the left is a messily coded image of a table, and on the right is the clean 
version of the same table. Note the difference between the messy code and 
the clean code: The clean code has a higher content to code ratio. The less 
code a search engine has to read, the faster it can spider your page, and the 
sooner it gets to the content of your Web site, the better. The first 200 words 
of a page carry the most weight, so it’s important to get the spider to the 
actual content as soon as you can.

Making Your Site WC3–Compliant
One of the ways to get your code nice and clean is to validate it. Validating 
code means making your Web site WC3 compliant. The World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium where member organiza-
tions, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web stan-
dards. Their mission statement is “to lead the World Wide Web to its full 
potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term 
growth for the Web.”
W3C goes about achieving this by creating Web standards and guidelines. 
It’s basically like health code guidelines for a restaurant. A Web site needs 
to meet certain standards in order to be as least imperfect as possible. 
Since 1994, W3C has published more than 110 such standards, called W3C 
Recommendations.

258
Making Your Site WC3–Compliant
A compliant page is known to be spiderable and the links crawlable, so 
although the search engines do not require W3C compliance, it’s not a bad 
idea. If you have complex or just plain ugly Web page code, or you’re having 
issues getting your pages crawled and indexed, validating your code to W3C 
standards might help.
 
On the front page of the W3C’s Web site (www.w3.org) is a sidebar called 
W3 A to Z, which contains all sorts of links. Bookmark this page: These links 
are a great reference to help you understand the standards that the Web is 
built on.
Here’s something about search engines: The harder they have to work to 
read your site, the less often and less thoroughly the search engines index 
your site. Because more content tends to mean more authority, you are less 
likely to receive top ranking. In fact, if a search engine has to work too long 
at reading your page, it might just abandon it all together.
So it’s a good idea to follow the W3C standards, simply because they make 
for a faster, more efficient page that is set up the way a search engine 
expects to find things. It’s like having your house swept clean and in order 
when the spiders come to visit: It makes them like what they see. (Internet 
spiders, that is. It doesn’t work that way for the arachnid variety.) If your 
site doesn’t comply with the W3C standards, the search engines might not 
crawl all of your pages on your site. Because you can’t rank pages the search 
engines don’t know about, that’s a big problem.
To comply with W3C, every page should declare a doc type (document type) 
and validate itself. To declare your doc type, include a line at the very top 
of your of HTML code, which declares the document as an HTML docu-
ment and identifies the type of HTML you are following. Because HTML 
has changed since the early days, some versions are different than others. 
Declaring a doc type is telling the search engine what it’s going to be read-
ing. It’s important to comply with your declared doc type. If you don’t, you 
confuse the search engine spider, and it takes longer to crawl your pages.
To validate your page, go to www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators on the 
W3C Web site and use the free tools on that page, as seen in Figure 3-5.
These are tools that you can use to basically “proofread” your site in order 
to make sure they comply with the W3C standards.
The first tool on the site is the MarkUp Validation Service, shown in Figure 
3-6. Also known as the HTML validator, it helps check Web documents in 
formats like HTML, XHTML, SVG, or MathML. Plugging your site’s URL into 
the box allows the tool to check your Web site to see if the code matches the 
declared doc type.

The second tool is the Link Checker (see Figure 3-7). It checks anchors 
(hyperlinks) in a HTML/XHTML document. It’s useful for finding broken 
links, redirected pages, server errors, and so on. There are some options for 
your search, like ignoring redirects and the ability to check the links on the 
pages linked to from the original page, as you can see in the figure below, 
and you can also save the options you set in a cookie, to make it quick to 
run it again in the future. If you don’t select summary only, you can watch 
it go through each link on the page. Most of the time, you just need to run 
the tools without making any adjustments so don’t stress about the options. 
Many other link checkers are also available out there. This tool is great for 
checking one page (if you were putting up a single new page with a lot of 
links, for example), but for spidering a whole site, we prefer Xenu’s Link 
Sleuth, which is a great (and free!) link-checking tool that makes sure all 
of your links work. It’s available at http://home.snafu.de/tilman/
xenulink.html.
The third tool on W3C’s site is the CSS Validation Service, which validates 
CSS stylesheets or documents using CSS stylesheets. As shown in Figure 3-8, 
it works a lot like the Markup Validation Service. Just put in the URL of the 
site you wish to have validated.

Typically, HTML pages allow the use of standard browser fonts (Arial, 
Verdana, Times New Roman, and so on) only, or you must use a graphic in 
place of the text as an alternative in order to keep the type of typography 
you want. The downside of using graphics in place of text is that you lose 
accessibility and the image is not as strongly weighted as equivalent text 
content would be. Some audiences, like the visually impaired and colorblind, 
and all search engines, cannot read graphics, and therefore, they can’t see 
what text is showing within your images. Using images also uses more band-
width and slows down your Web page’s load time.
Scalable Inman Flash Replacement (sIFR), developed by Mike Davidson and 
others, is a powerful technology that enables you to use just about any font 
you want on Web pages without sacrificing search-engine friendliness or 
accessibility. You or your Webmaster must have some knowledge of HTML 
and CSS in order to make this work.

You can download the official sIFR 2.0.2 release (full) from Mike Davidson. 
This is a free tool and is available at www.mikeindustries.com/blog/
files/sifr/2.0/sIFR2.0.2.zip.
In this section, we walk you through how to use sIFR, so you need the follow-
ing things to get started:
 
✦ sIFR 2.0.2 release from Mike Davidson
 
✦ sIFR tutorial files (available for free download at www.bruceclay.com/
sIFR_tutorial_bruceclay.zip)
 
✦ Adobe Flash MX or newer
 
✦ A HTML/CSS editor (HTML Kit, BBedit, and so on) or a text editor 
(Notepad, TextEdit, and so on)
After you’ve gathered these together, you’re ready to begin your sIFR tuto-
rial. To use your choice of font with sIFR, you need to first generate a Flash 
file that contains the font data.
 
1. In Abobe Flash MX, open the file named font.fla, which is contained in 
the tutorial download.
  
Open this file.

2. Double-click on the movie clip called holder from the library palette.
  
The holder movie clip
 
 Inside the holder movie clip is a text field called txtF.
 
3. Set the font of text field txtF to another font you like and then go 
back to Scene 1. Save (File➪Save) and publish (File➪Publish) the 
Shockwave (font.swf) file.
 
4. Next, from the downloaded .zip file, open the file style.css in your 
HTML/CSS or text editor.
 
 As shown in the following figure, you have set font definitions for H1 and 
P tags, which apply to the sIFR fonts. You may change them or add more 
definitions as needed.
 
5. Next, open font.js.
 
 Here is where you specify which Shockwave (.swf) file sIFR should use — 
the file that contains the font data. Also, this is where you set the text 
color, text background color, padding, and alignment for the sIFR fonts. 
In this case, you are using the font file font.swf, which you just gener-
ated, and have declared two sets for H1 and P tags corresponding to the 
definitions declared in style.css.

6. Next, create a new HTML document similar to the one shown in the 
following figure. In the head section, link to the three CSS files (style.
css, sIFR-screen.css, and sIFR-print.css) and the two JavaScript files 
(sIFR.js and sIFR-addons.js).
 
 These files are required for sIFR to work.
 
7. Now you can start inserting your page contents, applying the CSS defi-
nitions you set up in style.css. Insert an open/close <p> tag containing 
some page content text.
 
8. Finally, right before the closing Body tag, you should link to the font.js 
JavaScript file.

9. Preview your HTML document in a Web browser.
 
 The result should look something like the following image. If you’ve 
done it correctly, you now have fonts that are readable by both the user 
and the search engine.
Using sIFR allows you to use whatever font your heart desires, without 
it dragging down your page load time or making it invisible to a search 
engine spider. For the sIFR fonts to be seen, the user must have Flash and 
JavaScript turned on in their browser; otherwise, the text reverts to a stan-
dard substitute. Most users will have no trouble viewing the content in sIFR. 
It’s handy, and best of all, it’s free.

Externalizing the Code
  
Externalizing the Code
When you’re working with CSS and JavaScript, it’s important to externalize 
the code. Externalizing the code is basically putting all your definitions in a 
file, putting that file on your site, and using a single line of code within your 
actual pages to tell the browser (and engines) where to find it. Because the 
code represents the building blocks of your Web site, there’s going to be a 
lot of it. Just the JavaScript for your analytics alone can take up dozens of 
lines of code, maybe even hundreds. Externalizing your code is streamlining 
your process.
Not only does it reduce the size of your page to externalize CSS and 
JavaScript, giving your browser less to load, but if you want to go in and 
change all of your headings to blue, all you need to do is go to the glossary 
page where all the terms are defined, change that particular code to blue, 
and the change appears throughout your Web site. You don’t have to go 
through every single page and do it by hand. The advantage for SEO is that 
externalizing your code makes the page code much cleaner, thus making the 
content to code ratio much higher overall.

Choosing the Right Navigation
Choosing the Right Navigation
You can allow a user to navigate your site in several different ways. There’s 
text-based navigation, which means all of the navigation info (links, informa-
tion about those links, any cool little widgets you have, and so on) is listed 
in the text. There’s image-based, which means you click an image linked 
to another page or a section of an image map (the image is on a layer that 
allows for attaching links and other goodies) and navigate via that. Then 
there’s navigation using scripts such as JavaScript or technology such as 
Flash to build your navigation. For search engine optimization, we recom-
mend that you use text-based navigation. You can, if you really want to, use 
any of the other ways to build a navigation system for your site, but they all 
have significant drawbacks when it comes to search engine optimization.
Image maps
Using an image map for your site navigation doesn’t help with SEO because 
you don’t have any anchor text to take advantage of. Your anchor text is 
important because it tells the search engine what that page you are linking 
to is about. When a page is linked to the anchor text classic cars, search 
engines tend to think “Hmm, this must be about classic cars.” The more links 
you have with that anchor text pointing into that page from other pages, the 
more it’s like a giant blinking neon sign telling the search engine that this 
page is about classic cars. The search engine then assigns more weight to 
the link and increases the perceived relevance of the linked page.
Because an image map does not contain any readable text, any text that is 
contained within the image is not going to be seen by a search engine spider. 
A spider is deaf, dumb, and blind and can only understand the code on the 
page, not what a human user sees. Any text within the navigation is not 
counted toward your overall page rank. The only text it’s going to read is 
the Alt attribute text. And because you have one image for the navigation, 
that’s only going to be one Alt attribute tag. Some designers break up a big 
image into several smaller images so that they can use multiple Alt attri-
bute tags, but Alt attribute tags still do not carry as much weight as hyper-
linked text, especially because it’s very easy to deceive a search engine with 
spam in the Alt attribute tags.
 
You also must consider the possibility that users do not have images turned 
on in their browser, usually because they’re still on a dial-up connection and 
they want pages to load sometime this century. (They are still out there.) 

270
Choosing the Right Navigation
Flash
Another type of navigation system is Flash. There have been some advances 
when it comes to Flash: Newer versions of the program have made non-
animated Flash file text readable by a search engine, but this is only for the 
latest versions, and search engines still won’t be able to read any of the links 
or anchor text. 
Also, some search engines see Flash files as files separate from the page 
they’re attached to, and do not count the Flash content towards that over-
all Web page. Flash can also be annoying because it can break, slow down 
load time, or start playing unwanted music or videos. Many people choose 
to turn Flash off on their browsers in order to avoid Flash-based advertise-
ments, and they wind up stranded on your page if your navigation is Flash-
based because they won’t even be able to see it.
JavaScript
If Flash is not very usable, JavaScript is even less so. JavaScript is a program 
similar to Flash, but very little of it is readable at all by search engines, often 
the spiders can’t follow any of the links contained therein, and it’s a bad 
idea to use a navigation system that’s pure JavaScript, like AJAX. JavaScript 
is hard to spider and hard for some visitors with dated technology to use. 
Users browsing with JavaScript turned off find your site completely unusable 
if it relies solely on JavaScript navigation.
Text-based navigation
Text-based navigation is the navigation you should rely on when designing 
your page. Search engines can read the content of your text and can use the 
anchor text in the links to assign weight and relevance to those pages. Text 
is also clean, simple, and easy-to-use, and you don’t run the risk of users 
being unable to see it in their browsers because all browsers can read text.
Not only is text easy to both read and use, but it’s also highly controllable 
and customizable. You can add Flash elements and JavaScript to the text 
using CSS and still have it be understandable to a search engine.
A word about using frames
 
Frames have fallen by the wayside as site design has advanced in the past 
several years, but a few sites out there still choose to use them. Our advice 
is to not be one of them. Search engines read a frame as a completely sepa-
rate page, so if your navigation is in a different frame than your page con-
tent, they’re being read as two separate pages. Splitting up the relationship 
between your content is a bad idea. Just don’t do it.

271
Making Use of HTML Content Stacking
 
If you decide to use images, Flash, or JavaScript for your navigation, at least 
use a text-based footer on the page that offers alternative text links to your 
pages and to your site map, so that search engines can follow that and can 
do a read-through of your site.
Making Use of HTML Content Stacking
Content stacking is writing the HTML in such a way that the page content is 
delivered to the spiders before any scripts or navigation elements. A search 
engine puts the most weight on the first 200 words of a Web page, and then 
less weight on the remaining words that are left. If the first 200 words on 
your Web page are all HTML code setting up your navigation and you don’t 
start with your actual content until about word 580, you might end up with a 
low rank. That doesn’t mean you have to chuck your navigation system and 
start afresh; we here in SEO-land can suggest a couple of tricks to ensure 
that the spider reads the content of your page first. One is called the table 
trick and the other is divtag positioning.
Implementing the table trick
Your Web page is developed in tables, and by the time the search engines 
encounter your “main content,” it is too far down the page for the spider to 
consider it important. Generally, the text at the top of the page is the more 
important text, and sometimes site design pushes the main body content 
hundreds of lines from the top of the page’s source code.
A normal Web page usually has a header, a navigation bar that is usually 
on the left side of the page, and the main content on the right. The search 
engines usually look at many page attributes, for example, title, descrip-
tion, and at least the first 200 words of your content. The engines spider 
your whole page, but if your navigation bar lists many products, the search 
engine may not encounter your main body within the first 200 words.
Most of the search engines read a table a certain way. They find the opening 
Table tag and look for the first “table row” <tr>. They begin to read 
each “data set” <td>”data”</td> inside the “table row” from left to 
right until they find the closing </tr> tag. They try to keep going until they 
find the closing Table tag. They continue until they have crawled the entire 
page. Your main body content is usually where you would have most of your 
keyword phrases and the relevant body text that you want the search engine 
to index. Knowing that the spider tries to figure out your theme within the 
first 200 words of your site, you want it to see the relevant text as soon as 
possible. The best way to do this is using CSS positioning, but if you’ve got 
to stick with tables, we SEO types rely on something we call the table trick.

272
Making Use of HTML Content Stacking
A search engine normally reads a page in this order: first, the top naviga-
tion; second, left navigation; third, page content; and fourth, footer. That 
puts two cells of content before your page’s nice keyword rich content. 
The table trick pushes your left-side navigation bar down below your body 
content and pulls up your body content so that it usually is within the first 
200 words. The trick is to insert a blank cell after the first cell. The order is 
now as follows: first, top navigation; second, the blank cell; third, the page 
content, fourth, your left navigation; and fifth, the footer. You can see how 
the table trick works in the before (left) and after (right) examples shown in 
Figure 3-9.

trick results

Div tag positioning
Unfortunately, using a table trick can cause the left navigation to appear 
slightly lower on the page than it did before the table trick was implemented. 
The gap between the global site header and the left navigation becomes just 
a bit larger. This problem is generally not even noticeable. However, the 
height of the empty data cell changes depending on the length of the main 
page content. The left navigation may appear to jump up and down ever so 
slightly when you go from a longer page to a shorter page, or vice versa.
There is an alternative solution that does not create the same style prob-
lems as a table trick. It involves using CSS positioning to reorder the content 
in the code. The easiest implementation involves putting the left navigation 
content within one Div tag and all of the main body content within another 
Div tag. Then, using CSS, you would float the left navigation Div tag to the 
left and the body content Div tag to the right.

Making Use of HTML Content Stacking
Using an inline style, the parsed HTML would be as follows at its most basic 
level:
<Html>
<Head>Head Section</Head>
<body>
  Global Header Content
  <div style=”float: right;”>Body Content</div>
  <div style=”float: left;”>Left Navigation  Content</div>
  Global Footer Content
</body>
</Html>
By using the Float property in CSS, the page renders the same no matter 
how you order the Div tags. Obviously, the whole reason for restructuring 
the code is to get the body content higher up in the source code. Thus, you 
would opt to put the content Div before the left navigation Div tag.
You can take this recommendation one step further. You can also place 
the header (or top navigation) of the site and reposition it in the code 
using CSS. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the float attribute that 
we used above to reposition the site header. There is no float:top or 
float:bottom in Cascading Style Sheets. However, CSS allows you to place 
Div or Table tags in absolute positions on the page. By using absolute 
positioning, the page’s main content can be read before anything else on the 
page.
 
If you use absolute positioning for your Div tags, be sure to avoid using neg-
ative numbers as a position because this puts the content outside of the 
user viewable frame. Spammers have been known to use CSS positioning to 
place keyword-stuffed content outside of the viewable browser window (for 
example, style=position:absolute; top:-1000px, which places the 
content 1,000 pixels above the top of the page). Because of past abuse, 
search engines routinely look for this type of spam.

I
n this chapter, we talk about how to physically structure your site in the 
most efficient way possible with siloing. Siloing is the process of catego-
rizing your Web pages into subject themes in order to group related con-
tent. In this way, you present clear and straightforward subject relevancy 
that increases your site’s perceived expertise to the search engines.
Search engines award keyword rankings to the site that proves that it is 
least “imperfect” for the relevancy of a subject or theme. That means that 
the more clearly on-topic a site is for a user’s search query, the more rel-
evant it is, and the more likely it is to appear near the top of search results. 
Search engines try to dissect a site into distinct subjects that add up to 
an overall theme that represents a straightforward subject relevancy. If a 
search engine can clearly understand what you’re talking about, they’re 
going to consider you more of an expert on the subject and award you a 
higher rank than the other guy who’s diluted his theme and cluttered his 
page with junk that’s not relevant to his site. More often than not, a Web site 
is a disjointed array of unrelated information with no central theme and suf-
fers in search engines for keyword rankings. If you visit a Web site and you 
wind up not being exactly sure whether it’s about electric shavers or rubber 
pants, odds are a search engine isn’t going to know either. Siloing a Web site 
helps to clarify your Web site’s subject relevance.
In this chapter, we discuss how to physically arrange a site for siloing. We 
go much more in depth on siloing in Book VI, but this chapter gets you 
started. The first thing we talk about is formulating a linking structure and 
landing pages: what they are and why they’re important. Next we revisit 
absolute versus relative linking. Finally, we discuss the types of navigation 
to use when building a silo, and finish off with the naming of links.

276
Formulating a Category Structure
Formulating a Category Structure
Formulating a category structure is basically grouping your site content 
to put all of your categories together into related directories. In Book IV, 
Chapters 1 and 2, we talk about picking major categories and smaller subcat-
egories to go with them. If you’ve already done this, formulating a category 
structure shouldn’t be so bad.
First you need to figure out which page is the most important, and then have 
all of your other pages point to it. What page do you think represents you 
best? What page do you want your visitors to first see when they visit your 
Web site? This is the first step in figuring out your linking structure because 
you need to decide your categories and what you want to link to where. This 
is important to keep from diluting your theme.
Going back to the jar of marbles analogy we discussed in previous chapters: 
If you have black, gray, and white marbles all bunched together in a jar, it’s 
hard to figure out what the “subject” of the jar is. Is it a jar of black marbles 
with some white and gray mixed in, or a jar of white marbles with black and 
gray marbles mixed in, or a jar of gray marbles, or something else? Search 
engines function much the same way when they index a page or a site. 
Search engines can only decipher the meaning of a page when the subjects 
are clear and distinct. Take a look at the picture of the jar of marbles in 
Figure 4-1. How would search engines classify it?
In the jar, you can see black marbles, gray marbles, and white marbles all 
mixed together with seemingly no order or emphasis. It would be reasonable 
to assume that search engines would classify the subject as a jar of marbles.
If we then separate out each group of colored marbles into separate jars (or 
Web sites) as in Figure 4-2, they would be classified as a jar of black marbles, 
a jar of white marbles, and a jar of gray marbles.
However, if you wanted to put all three marbles (categories) into a single 
jar (Web site) as in Figure 4-3, you would create distinct silos or categories 
within the site that would allow the subject themes to be black marbles, 
white marbles, gray marbles, and finally the generic term marbles. Most Web 
sites never clarify the main subjects they want their site to become relevant 
for. Instead, they try to be all things to all people.
Categorizing your Web site makes it easier for a search engine to read and 
understand the page’s content, and it also helps the user navigate the page.

After you have your categories and subcategories picked out, now it’s time to 
upload them and set up your site’s directories for easy navigation and siloing. 
When building a directory structure, it’s important to not go too deep. The 
directory structure refers to where your files physically exist within the folders 
on the site. For example, take a look at the following URL of a Web page. The 
full address identifies the directory where the page physically resides:
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/mustangs/index.html
The URL lets you know where the page is. Notice that there are only two 
subdirectories under the main domain. Having too many levels of subdirec-
tories does the following things:
 
✦ The farther the file is from the root directory, the less important it 
seems to the search engines.
 
✦ Long directory paths make long URLs, and studies have proven that 
users avoid clicking long URLs on a search results page.
 
✦ Long URLs are more apt to cause typos. This could cause broken links 
within your Web site (if Webmasters use absolute linking); also, users 
could make mistakes typing in your URL.
Therefore, don’t get category-happy. Making your directory structure ten 
directories deep is bad; having five deep is bad too. Having three levels of 
directories is not as bad, but it’s not great either. We recommend going no 
more than two directories deep.

Figure 4-3:

Formulating a Category Structure
For example, your classic car Web site only has one main category (the car’s 
make) and two subcategories (model and year). If you have enough content 
to support multiple sublevels (a minimum of five pages for each category), 
you could set up the directory structure with two levels. The top level fold-
ers would be labeled with the make; the subfolders would be named by the 
model. Each page within the subfolder could represent a particular year. So 
the directory structure would look something like this:
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/delrio/1957.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/fairlane/1958.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/mustang/1965.html
Note how shallow the directory structure is.
The grouping of content on the site is very significant. One of the ways to 
think about it is to think of a Web site as compared to a book: The table of 
contents describes the overall subject in the introduction and then breaks 
down into different chapters that support that major subject. The different 
chapters are the different top level folders, whereas each chapter is made 
up of HTML pages that may be compared to the individual files within that 
folder.
The folder or directory is the physical organization of the files (pages) in 
that root directory. Because a spider cannot physically read the files on the 
server or in a database (it takes a content management system to format 
pages), you can use several strategies for dynamically organizing data, 
making even the most ornery Content Management Systems (CMS) flex-
ible for implementing directory structures. There are two separate ways to 
understand how a directory structure looks visually — by the URL structure 
and by folder view:
http://www.classiccars.org/index.shtml
http://www.classiccars.org/Ford/index.shtml
http://www.classiccars.org/Business_Partnerships/Support_
Other_Businesses.shtml
http://www.classiccars.org/Business_Partnerships/Value-Added_
Partnerships.shtml
http://www.classiccars.org/Chevy/index.shtml 
http://www.classiccars.org/Chevy/Comet.shtml 
Notice how none of the URLs are longer than one main category and two 
subjects long. Knowing how to group related subject files on your Web site 
provides greater primary and supporting subject relevancy while also lend-
ing a strategy for identifying which sections of your site require greater 
amounts of content.

Selecting Landing Pages
Three major subjects define what impact link structure has on implementing 
silos on your site:
 
✦ Internal site linking is how the pages are linked within the span of your 
site, whether it be linking between major silos or cross-linking related 
subject pages.
 
✦ Outbound, or external, linking represents the offsite links to other sites 
that are subject-relevant and provide resources to users that your site 
can’t offer.
 
✦ Finally, backlinks are the format by which other Web sites link to the 
pages on your Web site. You should understand the difference between 
links from sites that support your theme and links from sites that have 
no subject matter relevance. The first are good, but the second kind may 
dilute your subject relevancy.
 
Having sites with unrelated subject matter link to your site causes the rel-
evancy to be diluted. The purpose of inbound links is to reinforce subject 
relevance. This is a major issue for sites that purchase links because the 
links often originate from a completely irrelevant site.
Selecting Landing Pages
When you’re ready to choose your subject categories, go through and pick 
what you think would be the most important pages, the ones you want the 
users to see in the search results and ultimately land on. These are the aptly 
named landing pages. A landing page can be any or all of three things. One, 
it can be the first page a user lands on when clicking the link to your site 
during their search query. Two, it’s the page a user lands on after clicking a 
paid ad. Or three, it’s the page at the top level of a silo.
When choosing a page on your site to be a landing page, keep in mind that it 
should be a big topic with lots of pages there to support it. If you have less 
than five pages of support for this page, it’s probably not a landing page. See 
Figure 4-4 for an example of a landing page with its supporting pages.
Figuring out your landing page depends on what keywords you chose for the 
page. You want it to be a gateway page to the rest of your site. It should con-
tain the broad keywords you need to draw in the query, and then funnel the 
user to the other pages with the more specific information they need.

282
Selecting Landing Pages
 
Figure 4-4: 
The landing 
page is 
supported 
by at 
least five 
subpages 
of related 
content.
 
You should be thinking about these questions: Does the landing page con-
tent answer the search query? Does it contain enough information on that 
page or on its subpages that provide information for a search query? If a 
user doesn’t find what they’re looking for on your Web site, they’re not 
going to stick around and explore the rest of your site. Remember, you want 
people to explore your site, and having a well-crafted silo not only helps 
your search engine rankings, but it also enhances the user experience.
One thing to keep in mind is that every page on your Web site has the poten-
tial to be a landing page. One of your subpages could be drawing all of the 
traffic because it contains more relevant information than the actual landing 
page. This is not a bad thing; it just means one page ended up being a better 
landing page than the one you thought of. So it’s important to optimize every 
page just in case. Make sure it reads naturally and is not too forced or obvi-
ous. A search engine robot can’t read a Web page, but a human user knows 
when things on a page seem stilted or forced. When linking your pages, 
you can link as much as you like within a silo, but if you have to change the 
subject, always try to link to the landing page of the other subject, not to 
any subpage. If you must link to a non-theme–related, non-landing page, you 
need to use a rel=”nofollow” parameter on the link.
It’s also important to link only to landing pages in the silo. A normal silo 
looks like Figure 4-5, where the subpages link either to other subpages in 
the same silo or the landing page. Notice that they don’t link across to other 
subpages. A good comparison of siloing is to think of it like a pyramid, where 
the top tier is supported by the level below it, and so on, throughout the 
pyramid.

Absolute versus relative linking
In a Web page’s HTML code, there are two ways you can include a link: 
relative links and absolute links. An absolute link is a link that contains the 
whole URL of the file you’re linking to. When it appears in code, it looks the 
same as when it appears in the browser’s address bar:
<a href=”http://www.classiccars.com/fords/mustangs/
tireoptions.html”>Anchor Text</a>
That’s the whole file directory in the link itself. A relative link looks like only 
part of a full path URL:
<a href=”tireoptions.html”> Anchor Text</a>
<a href=”../tireoptions.html”> Anchor Text</a>
When designing your Web site, we recommend that you don’t use rela-
tive links, especially if you’re building your site from the ground up, so 
you won’t have the added headache of having to go and clean them up 
later. When you use a relative link, it only works in relation to the next 
directory up. For example, a link from mustangs/paintoptions.html to <a 
href=“tireoptions.html”> is only going to work if there’s a mustangs/
tireoptions.html for it to link to.
If the pages that were linking out were to get moved somewhere else, 
the relative link would no longer work because where it linked to would 
no longer be valid. So if the page was moved from the /mustangs direc-
tory to the /mustangconvertible directory, the relative link of <a 
href=”tireoptions,html”> would break because there is no tire
options.html page in the /mustangconvertible directory.

Dealing with Less-Than-Ideal Types of Navigation
An absolute link is easier to maintain in situations like this because it’s very 
clear what you’re linking to. There’s no confusion if the pages move because 
absolute links outbound from it still work.
Use the full qualified URL (that is, the link target that begins http://
domain.com) every time you create a link. Not only is it easier for the 
engines to understand, but there are also fewer mistakes in the coding of the 
Web site, and any mistakes can easily be caught and corrected.
Dealing with Less-Than-Ideal Types of Navigation
In Book IV, Chapter 3, we describe the various types of navigation used in 
building Web sites and recommend what is best to use and what is best to 
avoid. For SEO, it’s important to use text-based navigation because it’s clean, 
simple, and can be seen by both the search engine and the user.
Unfortunately, you can’t always use text as your navigation system. 
Sometimes you have a boss who wants the bells and whistles, and you can’t 
convince them that text links work best. Sometimes your CMS (content 
management system) won’t allow you to use only text. And sometimes com-
peting in your industry demands those bells and whistles, and users won’t 
trust your site without them. For example, a movie site would require Flash 
animation and navigation in order to show movie trailers; a user would think 
something was terribly wrong with a movie site that’s entirely text-based.
Fear not, for there is a way around these problems in your navigation. You 
can work around the problems with using images, JavaScript, and Flash for 
your navigation in order to still rank in the search engines. There is a techni-
cal way of working around every problem. It may require a little more work, 
but if the bells and whistles are something you have to have, these tips help, 
especially in terms of keeping your silos neat and clean.
Images
To quickly recap the previous chapter, using images for your site naviga-
tion is not advisable. Because an image map does not contain any readable 
text, any text that is contained within the image is not going to be seen by 
a search engine spider. A spider can only understand the code on the page, 
not what a human user sees. So any text within the navigation is not counted 
towards your overall page rank. The only text it is going to read is the Alt 
attribute text. If you have only one image for the navigation, that’s only going 
to be one Alt attribute tag. Alt attribute tags do not hold a lot of weight 
with a search engine because they are easily stuffed with keywords and are 
spammable.

Chapter 4

Navigation and 
Linking Techniques
285
Dealing with Less-Than-Ideal Types of Navigation
When you’re building a silo, however, using image-based navigation can be 
useful. If you need to remove keywords that otherwise dilute your page’s 
target, you can place them in an image, rendering them unseen by a search 
engine, but still visible to a user.
For example, say you have a page you want to rank in the search engines for 
research-type search queries. To make this happen, you need to remove any 
call-to-action keywords such as purchase or buy now from your Web page. 
Having those keywords on your page enters it into ranking against e-commerce 
sites, and you run the risk of diluting your page theme and losing the rankings 
you really want, which are the ones for a research site.
The simple solution is to place all of the call-to-action keywords within an 
image, which renders them invisible to a search engine but still visible to the 
user. It’s important to keep keywords that do not pertain to your particular 
silo (remember, they run along a common theme, like a certain model of car 
or colors of paint) invisible to a search engine.
JavaScript
The problem with JavaScript when used in site navigation is that it can con-
fuse the search engine with too much or too little information, especially 
if the JavaScript navigation is the primary way of getting into a silo. Using 
JavaScript in the form of a drop-down menu as your site navigation might 
look pretty and keep navigation convenient, but the search engine reads 
all of this information in each page and attributes it to every single page, as 
Figure 4-6 shows. Every page on the site would have the unrelated link to the 
Contact and About pages, which don’t need a global link.
If your drop-down menu links to other unrelated pages, the search engine is 
going to read all of the unrelated keywords and include them when weighing 
relevancy. For example, your page is about black marbles, but the JavaScript 
navigation also links to all of your pages on white marbles, blue marbles, 
green marbles, and pink marbles. When every page on the site links to every 
other page on the site, it dilutes the page content and weakens the silo.
The solution is to pull the navigation off the page into its own separate 
JavaScript file. That way, the navigation isn’t read as part of the page but as 
its own separate page, and doesn’t dilute your landing pages and silos.

Flash
Flash content is generally not advisable when doing search engine optimiza-
tion, simply because a search engine can’t read it. There have been some 
advances with the latest version of Flash that make the text created in Flash 
readable by spiders, but because it’s so easily spammable, it does not carry 
as much weight as plain text would. Some companies’ Web sites require the 
usage of Flash in order to compete, or to look reliable. The Bruce Clay, Inc. 
Web site, for example, uses Flash navigation for the top of the page as in 
Figure 4-7.
However, putting your navigation in Flash also can be a problem for people 
who have Flash turned off in their browsers in order to avoid Flash-based 
ads or to keep their browsers from crashing because of a slow-loading 
modem. In those cases, when they arrive at your Web site, they’re not going 
to be able to see anything or navigate your site.

The easy way to fix this problem is to have a text-based version of the infor-
mation at the bottom of the page in the footer that the search engines can 
read and use it in their rankings. People who have Flash turned off can also 
see the text links on the page, as in Figure 4-8.

Text-based navigation
Naming Links
The naming of links, or writing the anchor text (the words that make up the 
actual link someone clicks) is one of the most important aspects of siloing. 
Providing anchor text for a link tells the search engine what the page that’s 
being linked to is about. If the page content talks about tires, and the anchor 
text says it’s about tires, and any other links to that page all contain the 
word tires, that’s a giant neon arrow to the search engine that that particular 
page is about tires.
The headings of the page should also match the anchor text that’s linking 
from outside the page. It’s positive reinforcement for the search engines. If 
the sign that says Pancakes is pointing to a building that advertises pancakes 
in the window, it’s a pretty safe assumption that the business sells pancakes. 
That goes double if there are multiple signs pointing to the building saying 
Pancakes.

Book IV
Chapter 4

Navigation and

289
Naming Links
Another way of working with anchor text is to vary the actual anchor text. In 
the case of the signs, it would be something like “Let’s go eat at the pancake 
place,” “This place makes great pancakes,” and “Let’s go here for pancakes.” 
You can expand this as well and say the page is about all types of pancakes, 
so you’d want to link back using synonyms for pancakes like flapjacks, hot-
cakes, and other types of pancakes. Using synonyms creates good varying 
anchor text, assuming there were no pages about those on your site. They 
all mean the same thing, but the different wording allows for the anchor text 
to match a greater variety of search queries.
Slight variations in your anchor text wording also sound more natural. 
That’s the way people talk. It’s important to keep your link names as natural-
sounding as possible. Not only is it uncomfortable for users to read things 
that seem stilted or forced, but also the search engines expect to find text 
that sounds natural, and may suspect spam otherwise.

T
he slogan “Content is king!” has been stated and restated in every blog, 
forum, conference, and seminar that has anything to do with search 
engine optimization (SEO) or Internet marketing. Content includes all the 
stuff inside your Web site: everything from the words you read, to the 
pictures and videos you view, to the audio you listen to. In this chapter, 
we teach you all about the most important content element for SEO — the 
words on the page. The text content draws people to your site, starting 
with the brief title that shows up on a search results page. Content holds 
a visitor’s interest long enough to read your page and, hopefully, move on 
to do more. Content is what gives your Web site credibility with both your 
visitors and other sites so that they want to endorse you with a link or 
purchase. Content tells the search engines what you’re all about. Content 
proves (or disproves) that you know what you’re talking about.
And content takes hours and hours and laborious days to create. If you feel 
overwhelmed by the need to write tons of new content, we understand. 
The prospect of writing page after page of content can make many people 
want to crawl under the nearest desk, but the truth is, your Web site really 
cannot do without it. Good content and plenty of it is needed if you want to 
rank well with the search engines and attract users who convert into cus-
tomers (however you define that conversion). For this reason, these chap-
ters on content creation may be the most valuable pages in this book.

294
Knowing Your Demographic
Good, relevant content is your single most SEO potent tool. It allows you to 
do the following:
 
✦ Differentiate your site from the masses.
 
✦ Attract expert links to your site.
 
✦ Develop a loyal site following and brand.
 
✦ Launch your site higher in the search engine rankings.
In this chapter, you think through how to create the best content for your 
site’s purposes and target audience. You first need to understand who your 
site needs to appeal to, so we begin by discussing what demographic infor-
mation you need to know about your target audience and how you can find it 
out. Next, you learn how to choose a dynamic tone and style that can effec-
tively communicate with your audience and yield conversions. Last, you find 
out how to create a persona (a profile that represents your target audience 
based on calculated averages of their buying processes and demographics) 
so that you can design appropriate content that satisfies a specific, highly 
targeted group.
Knowing Your Demographic
Before you communicate anything, asking “Who is my audience?” is a great 
first step. You might be an expert in your field, but unless you can explain 
what you know in a way that your target audience understands, you can’t 
communicate your expertise. With your Web site, your job is not only to 
communicate, but also to persuade because you want conversions (visitors 
who make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter, or whatever action your Web 
site requires). Understanding who your audience is becomes even more 
essential in order to better target your conversions.
Many new Web marketers make the mistake of thinking they don’t have a 
target audience: They see the Internet as a vast crowd of people and just 
want them to come to their site. But attracting visitors to your site who con-
vert requires specific targeted marketing. The Internet population includes 
many types of people, and the more precisely you can figure out who your 
target visitors are, the more effective you can be at attracting and holding 
their interest and making conversions.
Finding out customer goals
Beyond knowing who your target audience is, you also want to find out what 
they need. You know what your Web site offers. Now turn your chair around 
and look at your site from the other direction. Why would a person come to 
your site? What goal would they be trying to meet?

Book V
Chapter 1
Selecting a Style 
for Your Audience
295
Knowing Your Demographic
You want to be sure to meet your visitors’ needs first before trying to moti-
vate them to do anything else. Imagine you’ve spent two hours working and 
sweating in the hot sun to fix a broken sprinkler in your yard. You finally get 
it under control and walk toward the house for a cold drink. You have only 
one thing on your mind: your thirst. If another family member meets you at 
the door to show you something, how attentive will you be? You’re probably 
not going to give them much attention until your need for cold refreshment 
is satisfied.
Similarly, your Web site visitors come to your site with a need in mind, and 
your first priority should be to meet that need. It may be to get information. 
It may be to research a product to buy. It may be to find a better price, free 
shipping, or some other special deal on a product they’ve already decided 
to buy. When you figure out what your site visitor’s goals are, you can make 
sure your Web pages deliver.
Meet your visitor’s goal in the easiest, quickest way possible. If your site sells 
choir robes, you want to help your visitor pick out the right styles, fabrics, 
sizes, and quantities as smoothly as possible. You can present lots of textual 
information to help them make the best choices, but you don’t want to dis-
tract them with cute videos of choir performances, mix in song lyric down-
loads, or clutter up your shopping cart page with Flash animations. Their 
goal is to purchase choir robes. Your goal is to help them do it as directly 
and pleasantly as possible. Do this by leaving clues in your copy for your 
visitors. Tell them how to accomplish their goal. Remember that the trigger 
words for shopping and research differ: buy, free, and sale appeal to different 
visitors than do how-to, step-by-step instructions, and more information.
 
The more you know about your target audience — who they are and what 
their goals are — the more effective your Web site can be.
Looking at current customer data
The best way to begin researching your target audience is to look at your 
existing customers. (We call them “customers” for ease of writing, but 
depending on your business model, you might call them subscribers, mem-
bers, clients, or another term.) What do you know about the people already 
on your customer list? You probably won’t succeed in gathering all of this 
information, but here are a few types of demographics to look for. These 
facts are helpful in profiling your target audience:
 
✦ Gender: Are most of your customers male, female, or are they evenly 
split?
 
✦ Age: Maybe your customers fall into a single age group, for example, 
tweens, teenagers, college students, young adults, 30-somethings, and 
so on.

296
Knowing Your Demographic
 
✦ Location: Do you know where your customers live? They may be con-
centrated within a given geographic area, in which case being included 
in local search engines and utilizing local ads might be part of your 
strategy.
 
✦ Marital status: Do you know whether your customers tend to be single, 
married, or divorced? You can cater differently to married couples and 
singles with your site design and style.
 
✦ Education: What level of education do your customers have? This ties 
into the age category, too, but if your audience is made up of adults, 
knowing whether they never attended college or hold master’s degrees 
definitely impacts how you can communicate with them. (Note: Book V, 
Chapter 4 explains writing for different grade levels.)
 
✦ Occupation: Do you know what field your customers are in specifically? 
If your Web site offers an industry-specific product, it’s obviously an 
important factor for your target audience. But even if you offer products 
to the general public, knowing customer occupations can help you with 
target marketing. If you know, for instance, that a lot of nurses like your 
product, one place you might want to develop links to your site (or run 
ads, and so on) could be on sites that are popular with nurses.
 
✦ Beliefs: What do you know about their religious, political, or philosophi-
cal beliefs? For instance, if your site collects signatures for various peti-
tions, knowing how your typical petition signer leans politically helps 
you target the right audience for your site.
 
✦ Lifestyle/situational: What do you know about their lifestyles? You 
may find a trend among your customers to be single parents or married 
couples with children; apartment renters or homeowners; city dwell-
ers, suburbanites, or farmers; boat owners or horse owners or other. 
Whatever extra information like this you can gather gives you useful 
clues about your target audience.
 
✦ Much more: Customize this list with other types of pertinent informa-
tion for your Web site marketing. You probably won’t be able to get all 
the information you want, but having a wish list is a good start. Income 
level, ethnicity, and hobbies are all excellent things to know about your 
customers. Much of this information is easily obtained just by asking for 
it. The registration process on many sites often asks for these facts. If 
your registration process includes the ability to do so, turn it on and see 
what you learn.
Researching to find out more
In addition to examining the customer data you have, you can look at indus-
try statistics. Find out what data is available out there. Do some homework 
online and track down information sources. If there’s a trade association for 

Book V
Chapter 1

for Your Audience
297
Knowing Your Demographic
your industry, see if they can provide statistics, member rosters, and other 
types of information. You might find news articles, court cases, studies, or 
who knows what else, but see what’s out there that gives you more informa-
tion about your typical customer.
Interviewing customers
Next, consider interviewing past and current members of your target audi-
ence to find out more about them. A typical method is to ask users to com-
plete a form on your Web site. It might be a sign-up form at the beginning of 
your conversion process, or a feedback form you pop up on the screen at 
the end of a process. Or you might prefer to interview the old-fashioned way 
and directly contact people by mail, phone, or e-mail. A survey can work 
great, although you may need to offer some incentive to the user for filling it 
out (a discount, a coupon, or some other prize).
 
You can e-mail people a link to complete a survey online. Sites like www.
questionpro.com make setting up an online survey very easy to do; you 
just need to plan the questions you want to ask (see Figure 1-1). The costs 
can be nominal, depending on what services you use.

298
Knowing Your Demographic
When interviewing people, try to gather some personal demographic infor-
mation (such as the items in the previous bulleted list) as well as some feed-
back about their experience on your Web site. It’s a golden opportunity for 
valuable feedback from past customers. Here are some good things to learn 
during your interview:
 
✦ How the person found your Web site
 
✦ What their impression was of the site
 
✦ Whether they had any difficulty getting around your site, or whether 
they found it easy to use
 
✦ Whether they were pleased with the service or response they received 
(if applicable)
 
✦ What type of product or service were they looking for
Include these two questions in your survey to get a technical picture of your 
customers’ awareness:
 
✦ How often do they go online and how long do they spend there?
 
✦ Which of your competitors’ sites do they visit?
You can also use your surveys in conjunction with the data your analytics 
tool gathers to discover information about their browsing habits that will 
help you understand your customers’ online habits. You can easily get this 
data with a simple server-side script that captures header data:
 
✦ The type of computer they use
 
✦ The ISP (Internet service provider) they use to access the Internet
 
✦ The speed or type of Internet connection they use (broadband, cable 
modem, dial-up, and so on)
 
✦ What Internet browser they prefer
 
The answers to these questions give you an idea of how tech-savvy your 
customer base is. For instance, the Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 
browser dominates with roughly 75 percent of total market share currently 
(because Windows comes with IE preinstalled). However, the Mozilla 
Firefox browser tends to be heavily used by people in Web technology 
fields (such as SEO). So if you find your users prefer Firefox, that might be 
a clue that they’re more technical than the average user, which can influ-
ence how you set up your Web site and write your content. On the other 
hand, if your users get to the Internet through their AOL interface and stay 
there throughout their Web session, you know you’re probably dealing 
with a less technical user base.

Creating a Dynamic Tone
 
If you have any professional associations in your industry (the SEO commu-
nity has SEMPO, for example), check with them to see if they’ve done any 
demographic research, which is likely more cost-effective than conducting 
your own research. This is a particularly good idea for a new site that might 
not yet have a large user base to interview.
Using server logs and analytics
Your Web site’s server logs contain valuable data about your visitor counts 
and their behavior. It’s also a good idea to have analytics embedded in your 
Web pages, which are program routines a Web site can use to track user 
behavior on the site. Talk to your IT department or Webmaster and see what 
they can tell you about your Web traffic and the user behavior on each page.
 
If you would like more analytics operating on your Web site or want to know 
all the choices out there, we cover Web analytics in detail in Book VIII. We 
also recommend you check out the following resources:
 
✦ The Web Analytics Association (www.webanalyticsassociation.
org): The trade association for Web analytics professionals is a good 
source for information.
 
✦ Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics/): Free analytics help 
and resources from Google.
 
✦ Omniture (www.omniture.com): One of the top vendors for analytics 
programs.
In addition, some tools can look at your recent Web site traffic and tell you 
where visitors came from and what search terms they used to find your Web 
site. These are extremely valuable for SEO. Knowing where your users come 
from can give you clues to their goals. For instance, if your site sells shoes 
and you find a lot of visitors coming from youth soccer sites, they’re likely 
looking for children’s soccer shoes and cleats. This information can help you 
style your site to help those visitors find exactly what they need.
Creating a Dynamic Tone
The writing for your Web site should
 
✦ Engage your target audience with an appropriate style and tone. For 
example, this book uses a conversational tone that wouldn’t be appro-
priate in a scholarly journal. A site targeting teens might rely more heav-
ily on modern slang than a site targeting baby boomers.
 
✦ Lead visitors to the goal you have for each Web page.
 
✦ Meet the visitor’s need with relevant content as directly and quickly as 
possible.

300
Creating a Dynamic Tone
You want to write engaging text that’s appropriate for your target audience 
and meets your site goals. As a general rule, effective Web site copy should 
be dynamic in the sense of being (as the Encarta dictionary defines it) “vig-
orous and purposeful, full of energy, enthusiasm and a sense of purpose.” 
As we discuss earlier in the chapter, each of your Web pages should have 
a goal that matches the perceived visitor’s goal, which may be to gather 
information, clarify a question, sign up for something, make a purchase, or 
something else. The text on each page should engage readers and lead them 
to fulfill the goal.
The tone of a written piece can make or break it. Tone refers to the writer’s 
attitude toward the subject matter and toward the reader. Tone creates an 
emotional response in readers. The wrong tone can turn off an audience 
within the first sentence or two.
When people talk about the way a piece “comes across,” they’re talking 
about its tone. In speaking, people call it the “tone of voice,” and it affects 
communication powerfully. Dogs, for example, can tell a lot by the sound 
of their master’s voice: They might come running or hide their tails based 
solely on their master’s tone. In written communication, an author’s tone 
comes through in more subtle ways. Word choice, sentence length, punctua-
tion, grammar, sentence structure — all of these and more convey the tone.
Your writing tone should support your site goal and be appropriate for your 
target audience. For example, if you’re a heavy metal band promoter, you 
wouldn’t want to greet your visitors with rainbows and ponies, and a jaunty 
message like, “You’ve arrived! Mr. Ponypants wants you to have a super fun 
day!” The bouncy, enthusiastic tone is all wrong for the target audience and 
would probably have visitors heading straight for their Back button. There’s 
nothing wrong with heavy metal or ponies, but typically fans of each aren’t 
found in the same company. Instead, you’d want the tone to come across 
as rebellious and rowdy, meeting your target audience in the same spirit 
they’re showing. Only then would you be able to achieve your site’s conver-
sion goal, which is to engage people and interest them in becoming clients.
 
Look at your current Web site and ask yourself how you feel when you read 
it, but don’t just stop there. Read it out loud to yourself or someone else to 
see if it flows nicely to the ear. This is usually an enlightening experience. 
Ask someone you know to read it with fresh eyes to give you this feedback. 
Ask them to tell you what attitude comes through the writing. How does it 
make them feel: happy, lighthearted, positive, hopeful, enlightened, or want-
ing more? Or does it make them feel uncomfortable, belittled, creepy, angry, 
annoyed, or frustrated?
Think about what response you would want your target audience to have 
when they read your Web site. The emotional response your tone evokes in 
your readers can make them want to stay or run away, so choose it carefully.

Using Personas to Define Your Audience
Choosing a Content Style
After you know who your target audience is, you can adjust your Web site to 
be appropriate for them. We talk in Book IV, Chapter 2 about tailoring your 
Web site design to your target audience. Now in Book V, we focus on tailor-
ing the content style to your target audience.
 
Listen to your customers. The words they use to talk about your industry 
and your products and services could be very different from how you 
describe the same things. Jargon that may be commonplace in your offices 
won’t necessarily be familiar to your potential clients. You want to incorpo-
rate their words into your Web site. Not only does this ensure that people 
understand what they’re reading on your site, but it also adds keywords that 
people search for when they to try to find you.
 
You also must listen to the way in which your customers talk: not just the 
words they’re using, but how they’re using them. If your target audience is 
children, you don’t want your Web site to read like a dry academic text, or 
you’ll just bore them. If your target audience is medical researchers, your 
Web site can be written in a more academic style with longer words and sen-
tences. You want to make visitors feel that they’ve come to the right place. 
You can do this when you support relevant content with a style and tone 
that feel natural and appropriate. So use a style that reaches your target 
audience and feels natural for the content.
Using Personas to Define Your Audience
To help you evaluate your Web site from your target customer’s perspec-
tive, you can create a fictional Web persona based on all the customer data 
you accumulated. A persona is like a role, and it includes how a person acts, 
talks, thinks, believes, and so on. The customer Web persona you create is 
a profile that represents your target audience based on calculated averages 
of your customer’s buying processes, goals, and demographics. Companies 
use personas as user archetypes to help guide their decisions concerning 
product launches, new features, customer interaction, and site design. It’s 
easier to evaluate things from a particular Jane Doe’s or John Doe’s perspec-
tive than just imagining a vague customer group. By understanding the goals 
and patterns of your audience, your company can create archetypes to help 
create services to satisfy a specific, highly targeted group.
Your goal is to create a persona that encompasses the most complete picture 
of your target audience. In fact, you may want to create several personas, 
depending on your Web site’s various goals and how varied your customers 
are. Linda the mother of two has different motivations for being on your site

than Debbie the high-powered sales exec or Fred the college student. Creating 
more than one persona allows you to produce the maximum amount of appeal 
to your real-life customers. Creating effective personas helps you
 
✦ Understand (and keep in mind) your target audience’s goals and beliefs.
 
✦ Develop the most effective voice for your company’s Web site.
 
✦ Determine what products/features are and are not accepted by your 
audience.
 
✦ Get to know your audience on a more personal level.
 
✦ Build a shared vocabulary between you and your audience to avoid 
confusion.
 
✦ Enable your company to make informed decisions.
Creating personas
Creating personas helps you identify your customers’ buying decision pro-
cesses to allow you to maximize your conversion rate. Acquiring and ana-
lyzing the type of data listed earlier in this chapter can help you develop a 
more complete picture of who your audience really is, how they spend their 
time, and what they value as being important. After looking at this informa-
tion, you can start to see patterns emerge. These patterns are the basis for 
the personas you create.
In looking for patterns, notice the similarities and differences between 
your customers through your research. Keep in mind that personas repre-
sent your audience’s behavior patterns, not job descriptions, locations, or 
occupations. Although it’s important to be aware of this information, these 
details should not be the basis of your archetypes. A properly defined per-
sona gives you a well-rounded picture of your customers’ attitudes, skills, 
and goals; it’s not just a résumé that only offers a surface view.
After you have your data, group the information in a way that makes the 
most complete picture of a person. This includes assembling key traits (such 
as behavior patterns, and similar buying processes) to try and form a cohe-
sive “person.” You should be able to use the collected information to form a 
small group of “people” that you feel represent your audience. Each persona 
(like your real audience) should be different, wanting and looking for differ-
ent things.
 
When you are creating your personas, do not model them after someone you 
know. This would alter how you work with them. A persona should be a 
purely fictional character that you feel best represents some segment of 
your audience. Keeping it fictional forces you to concentrate on your audi-
ence and address their needs.

Book V
Chapter 1
Selecting a Style

Using Personas to Define Your Audience
After you have your persona, don’t keep her (or him) to yourself. Share it 
with the other members of your company to get their insights. They may 
have valuable opinions that help you narrow down or fill out the personal-
ity of your customer. Use this time to fill in any blanks. Name your persona 
to differentiate her from the others: Don’t just call her Jane Doe. Choose a 
name that you can believe in, not one that’s just a stand-in.
Using personas
You now have your persona: You’ve named her, you know where she comes 
from, and you know what she’s looking for. But you’re not done. It is now 
time to put your persona into action. Use your persona to role-play:
 
✦ Case studies: Imagine your persona coming to your Web site for various 
purposes. Walk through the processes the persona would use.
 
✦ User testing: Using your persona, try out a feature of your Web site. You 
can also use your persona when running different keyword searches, 
starting at a search engine, and find out how quickly relevant informa-
tion can be found on your site.
 
✦ New feature evaluation: Try out any new pages or features of your Web 
site from your various personas’ points of view and see how easy they 
are to use.
 
✦ Product decisions: Coming from each of your personas’ perspectives, 
think through how useful a new product would be. You may be able to 
identify whether the product meets a typical user’s need as is, or needs 
some value-add-on to have better marketability.
 
✦ Design decisions: See your Web site design through a persona’s eyes to 
determine whether the colors, placement, layout, bells and whistles, and 
other design elements make it easier or harder for visitors to achieve 
their goals.
 
✦ Customer service: Use your personas to find out how easy it is to get 
help when using your Web site. Remember, your Web persona doesn’t 
know that you have an exhaustive Help system linked from the site map, 
or that clicking a tiny link somewhere in the footer launches a live chat 
window. The persona only knows what it can easily see during its pro-
cess, so this is a valuable way to find weaknesses in your Web site.
Here is an example of a persona and how you can put it to use:
Jane is a competitive personality. Social status is very important to her and 
she appreciates it in others. She tends to be impulsive and doesn’t mind the 
impersonality of doing things online as long as she is able to get what she 
needs quickly and efficiently. She is looking for verifiable results and quanti-
fiable bottom lines. Social interaction is not important to her. She is willing 
to pay more to get a little extra. She is unmarried and does not see marriage 
in her near future.

304
Using Personas to Define Your Audience
Jane is very Internet-savvy and uses the Internet for 10 or more hours per 
day. She has multiple e-mail accounts from various service providers and 
does all of her shopping and banking online. Jane works for an Internet com-
pany and has just purchased a modest condo in the suburbs outside a large 
metropolitan city.
By analyzing the profile of Jane, you can better target her needs. Based 
on this, you can see that her primary concern is for quick, expert informa-
tion. Jane is an impulsive buyer; the key to acquiring her conversion is to 
give her information in a quick, easy-to-read format while touching on her 
desire for prestige. You can guess that when she first visits your site, her 
eye quickly scans the content for keywords. If you lose her interest for a 
moment, she’s gone.
The profile also gives you an idea of Jane’s experience level with your 
product. This can help you decide how to target her. Here are two example 
scenarios:
Scenario A: Jane at a technology-related Web site: If you are a technology 
company, you know that Jane has a certain experience level with your breed 
of product. You can assume that Jane likely understands the basic workings 
of your merchandise without you having to break things down step-by-step. 
Based on her Internet savvy, you know she likely has little or no problem 
navigating through your site, but if she doesn’t find what she’s looking for 
immediately, she will likely take off and visit one of your competitor sites. At 
this stage in her life, brand loyalty comes second to quick service.
Scenario B: Jane at a non-technical Web site: If your product is home- and 
garden-related, you know that Jane needs a lot of detailed information to 
better understand how your product or service could benefit her. You need 
to make sure your information is presented upfront so that Jane doesn’t 
wander away from your site. You know that Jane just purchased her first 
home. It’s likely she is looking for easy ways to spruce it up. How can you 
gear your marketing campaign to address this? Perhaps there’s a way to 
market your product as a “timesaver” so that she can focus on other things. 
Is Jane likely to have a pet? Maybe your product can do a better job of keep-
ing her pet safe. By understanding Jane, it allows you to target her more 
efficiently.
Using Jane’s persona helps you identify the language that most likely 
appeals to her and satisfies her motivations and needs. When you’re testing 
out new features or campaign plans, make sure to keep Jane in mind. Ask 
yourself these types of questions for each of your personas:
 
✦ Benefits: Does this feature offer a clear benefit to this persona?
 
✦ Level of explanation: What, if anything, do I need to provide this per-
sona with to help her understand this benefit?

Book V
Chapter 1
Selecting a Style 
for Your Audience
305
Using Personas to Define Your Audience
 
✦ Wording: What kind of language should I use? Does this persona under-
stand industry jargon, or do I need to define terms in the page content 
for her?
 
✦ Style: How can my writing style fit this persona, and give her what she’s 
looking for most naturally and directly?
 
✦ Tone: What tone would seem most natural to this persona? Would a 
tone that’s friendly, professional, enthusiastic, subdued, energetic, calm, 
or other best suit her goals and influence her to stay on the site and 
move toward my Web page’s goal?
 
✦ Clarity: Does this persona realize the problem this feature is supposed 
to address? How much do I need to spell out?
Benefits of using personas
Personas provide many benefits. First, by speaking with your customers 
directly while gathering the data to create your personas, you have taken 
the first important steps to creating brand loyalty. Taking time to ask them 
about their needs and their interests shows them that you are interested 
in who they are, not just that you are out to make a sale. You want to learn 
about them, their goals, and what is important to them so that you can make 
your product better for them. Customers are likely to remember such a 
move and are more likely to do business with you in the future. By investing 
in them, you have made it easier for them to invest in you.
Secondly, your personas can alert you to problems you might not have 
known about. For example, while doing your research, you may discover 
that your customer base is larger and wider than you imagined. Knowing 
this shows you that there are two or more very different audiences that 
you must address. This could lead to creating a whole new product or set 
of instructions to fit more advanced users, while still catering to your more 
inexperienced ones. It could also lead to adding more pages to your Web 
site, or incorporating more appropriate text on each page.
Drawbacks of using personas
Many companies resist the idea of personas because they don’t understand 
how they work. They may design personas that are too vague to be efficient 
in helping with the direction of their company. If not done correctly, perso-
nas may cause companies to pigeonhole their audience, negating the basic 
purpose of creating personas.
Another drawback of using strict personas is that no matter how much 
research you do or how deeply you analyze it, you can never know 100 per-
cent for sure that your customers feel exactly the way that your fictional 
personas do. If you tailor your campaigns too closely to a persona, you risk 

306
Using Personas to Define Your Audience
alienating some of your other customers. This is why it’s important to create 
multiple personas: You have a better chance at targeting the largest number 
of users.
At the end of the day, despite your best efforts at analyzing your customers’ 
personalities, all you are left with is a best guess about what they’re looking 
for and who they really are. Using Web personas allows your guess to be an 
educated one and provides your company with an invaluable tool to help 
keep users’ interests in mind.

earch engines find out what your Web pages are about by reading them. 
They read everything they can find on your site — the text on your 
pages, the text in your HTML code, the names of your files and directories, 
and the anchor text in all your links (which is the text someone clicks in 
order to follow the link). They also read the anchor text of any inbound links 
to your site from other people’s Web sites to find out what they’ve written 
about you. Using all of this textual information along with a few other factors 
like links and engagement objects, search engines determine what your site 
is about, what search terms your Web pages are relevant for, and how much 
of an authority you are on your topics — and then rank you accordingly.
Because of this focus on written words, a successfully optimized Web site 
must have a lot of content. A home page with a single graphic and no textual 
content can’t rank well with the search engines, no matter how cool it looks. 
On the other hand, a page with a lot of words but no cohesive theme also 
won’t rank well, and for the same reason: The search engines can’t figure 
out what the page is about. The right balance is to have enough content and 
to have it focused on a theme. Then the search engines can index your site 
and know exactly what it’s about.
In this chapter, you find out how to develop content ideas, how to integrate 
various types of content for a blended approach, and all about the rules for 
optimizing images and video. You also discover the importance of format-
ting text so that it’s readable and how you can allow user input to build a 
stronger site. Finally, you find out how to create user engagement by writing 
effective calls to action.

308
Building Enough Content to Rank Well
Building Enough Content to Rank Well
How much content do you need in terms of words per page and pages per 
subject? Before we tell you our SEO best practices, we want to stress that 
the answer greatly depends on what is normal for your industry and key-
words. When you research your competitors’ sites that rank well for your 
keywords, some of the things you want to find out are how many indexed 
pages they have and how many words are on the pages that outrank yours. 
(Note that Book III explains how to do competitive research in detail.) 
Analyzing these figures among your competitors gives you an indication of 
what level of content is currently succeeding in the search engines for your 
keywords. This helps you know how many pages and words you need to 
play in their league.
Now for the best practices. We recommend that you have a minimum of 450 
words of text content per page. That’s a general rule, based on our experi-
ence across multiple niches. Again, this is a guideline. If all of the top-ranking 
pages for your keywords have more than 1,000 words each, you may want 
to consider 1,100 words on your page in order to compete. (Remember that 
there are many factors in the algorithm and amount of content is only one 
of them.) But if your research hasn’t indicated that you need an unusually 
high number of words for your industry, 450 words gives the search engines 
enough content to work with and gives users a satisfying amount of informa-
tion, as well. It’s a little less than one page of typed copy using a 12-point 
font and single line spacing. In fact, the page that you’re reading right now 
has more than 450 words on it, so you can get an idea of what that amount 
of content looks like. Also, the number of words you need on a page has 
been steadily increasing over the years. When we first started recommend-
ing adding content back in 1997, we set our minimum at merely 75 words. 
Today, the number of words on top-ranked pages in some competitive mar-
kets is actually closer to 1,000 words on a page. This variance is why analyz-
ing your competitors is so crucial.
As a general rule, you need at least five pages to support each theme. You 
should have at least five supporting pages for each theme landing page on 
your Web site. (A landing page is your primary page of information on a par-
ticular topic or subtopic, so it’s the page where you want users to land when 
they search for those keywords and click your listing.) Keep in mind that the 
required minimum number of pages varies depending on what your competi-
tors have. The search engines want to return the most relevant results to a 
user’s search query, and they want their users to be satisfied. It makes sense 
that the search engines would rank most highly the sites that seem to be the 
experts, or authorities, in the subject the user is interested in.
For instance, if you’re trying to rank for the keyword phrase [Ford Mustang], 
you’re going up against sites that have dozens of related pages about Ford 
Mustangs including facts, forums, customer reviews, multimedia, and so on.

309
Developing Ideas for Content
(A keyword phrase is a search query containing two or more words that your 
Web page content relates to.) That kind of competitive environment would 
require you to have a lot more than five pages of content on Ford Mustangs 
in order to be considered as much of an authority as the other sites are. 
You’d need to really beef up your site to make it into the top 10–20 search 
results.
If you’ve already worked on categorizing your Web site into subject themes, 
as we explain in Book II, Chapter 4 and elsewhere, you should have a good 
idea of what “holes” you need to fill in your Web site. As you go through this 
chapter, keep in mind your list of landing-page topics and what you need in 
terms of new content either on those pages or on supporting pages. Figure 
2-1 shows a sample Web site in the construction stage. As you can see, it 
looks like Topic A needs more pages.

Developing Ideas for Content
You may feel overwhelmed at the thought of writing pages and pages of 
content for your Web site that have at least 450 words each, but take heart. 
There are lots of ways to get ideas for content, and even some shortcuts for 
creating it.
In this section, we help get you started with four ways to find content ideas:
 
✦ Brainstorming: You want to tap into your own creative juices first. Get 
input from your employees and coworkers, too.
 
✦ Looking at competitors: Don’t copy them, but you can definitely get 
ideas from them.

310
Developing Ideas for Content
 
✦ Utilizing your offline materials: Repurpose what you’ve already written.
 
✦ Listening to customers: Find out what they want to know.
Brainstorming to get ideas
The best source of original content for your Web site may be yourself. You 
and the other people in your Web-site business are authorities in one thing: 
your own business. You know the most about your Web site’s goals, prod-
ucts, services, clientele, methods, expertise, history, personnel, and so forth. 
You might discover that a lot of that information would be interesting and 
useful for your site visitors. For example, you could ask the founder to write 
a three-paragraph history of how the company got started (or have someone 
interview him and write it up). Or you might write about your operations 
or your facilities like a tour guide, complete with pictures. When you write 
about your company, industry, and products, it’s easy and natural to include 
lots of keywords, which benefits your SEO efforts. You probably have a 
wealth of interesting information about your company and its products and 
services that could be turned into Web site content.
Brainstorm other kinds of content ideas, too — at this stage, accept any idea 
that could be useful and engaging to your target audience. Make a list of all 
possible articles, stories, topics, tidbits, quotes, and so on. Don’t stop at just 
what you’re able to create. Consider things that you could write as well as 
subjects you could find someone else to create. You’re just idea-gathering 
now, so be as creative as you can.
Looking at competitors for content ideas
One of the best ways to fill content holes on your Web site is to do some 
competitive research to see what others in your industry are writing about. 
You want to see what they’re doing right, where they’re missing the mark, 
and what you could add to your site that they haven’t even thought of yet.
Travel your competitors’ Web sites like a user and discover what they have 
to offer. In particular, look at the landing page that is competing with your 
own for the same keyword. Notice its content as well as the various sup-
porting pages linked from it. (Note: You also can do some serious analysis 
of these pages using the procedures we describe in Book III, Chapter 2, but 
right now you’re just trying to get some ideas for new content.)
When you go through your competitors’ sites, you’re essentially looking for 
anything they have that gives them an advantage — any special content that 
appeals only to a certain sector or that is attracting links. You are not using 
their site as a blueprint to copy, but venturing off your own Web site and 
seeing things from a visitor’s eye that can alert you to holes you would have 
missed otherwise. You can get ideas for original content that can be just as 
good as, or better than, your competitor’s.

Book V
Chapter 2
Establishing 
Content Depth and 
Page Length
311
Developing Ideas for Content
What you’re looking for depends on your content needs. If you’re looking 
to beef up the number of pages on your site, look at what your competitors 
offer and how they’re marketing themselves, and then find ways to differenti-
ate yourself. You want to make yourself equal to the competition before you 
can set yourself apart. Make sure you match what they offer in your own 
way and then provide content that explains why you’re unique, more trust-
worthy, and overall just better-suited to fit the visitor’s needs.
 
One thing you can notice is how they structure their information compared 
to how your site does it. For instance, if the two Web sites sell competing 
products, compare how they’re each presented. Your page might offer a 
description in paragraph form only, whereas your competitor includes a 
complete bulleted list of features with links to view a schematic diagram, 
product dimensions, installation instructions, and consumer reviews. In that 
situation, you know you have some writing to do in order to boost your con-
tent about that product.
You also could get ideas for how to present similar information better. For 
example, say your product is cowboy boots. A brief mention on a competi-
tor’s site about the importance of breaking in your boots before the begin-
ning of rodeo season could spark the idea to write a whole article about 
this on your site. Or your competitor’s site might have a chart showing 
boot sizes compared to normal shoe sizes. That’s useful information that 
could help the consumer make a purchase decision, so you want to add this 
feature to your Web site — but do it better. You might add a third column 
with the corresponding sock sizes. Or make it a neat, interactive tool rather 
than a static chart. Or enhance it with illustrations of different sized feet . . . 
you get the idea. Develop a page debating the eternal question: to tuck your 
jeans into your boots or not to tuck? Have customers respond and send in 
pictures with their explanations.
By looking at competitors, you can identify holes in your own site as well as 
ideas to set your site apart. You want to be continuously looking for creative 
ways to make yourself more interesting and more useful to your visitors. As 
much content as there is on the Web, a lot of it can be improved. It can be 
written to be clearer, updated to be more interesting, or tweaked to allow 
users to interact with it in a fresh way. Be on the lookout for these types of 
opportunities to make your site stand out.
Utilizing your offline materials
One shortcut to creating Web site content is to pull from what you already 
have. Review everything your business has ever written to see if it can be 
repurposed for your Web site. Brochures, flyers, catalogs, articles, manuals, 
tutorials, online help resources, and even customer correspondence may 
contain volumes of helpful content. Do you have a user manual or instruc-
tions to go with one of your products? Consider replicating it online in 

312
Using Various Types of Content
HTML. The same goes for marketing materials, text on packaging, or other 
printed collateral. The writing may need to be updated, but starting with 
content makes your job much easier than starting from a blank page.
 
Frequently asked questions (FAQs) can be a popular Web site feature, and 
they’re very useful in helping user find the information they need. If your 
company maintains a support staff for customer assistance, they may 
already have an FAQ list started that includes the right answers. If you work 
for a company, ask around to find out what your various departments 
already have documented that could be polished a bit and used on the Web.
Listening to customers
You want your Web site to serve your customers and target prospects, so 
try to address what they’d like to know. Talk to your customers. Ask some 
questions. Also talk to your support people to find out what customers ask 
about frequently. You may find great ideas for articles to add to the Web 
site (and help out your support department as a bonus). If you have a site 
search, you can mine those queries as well. What is of interest to one cus-
tomer might be valuable to more, particularly if variations on the same key-
word phrase keep popping up.
You might also check blog sites for your industry, your area, or your target 
demographic (whichever of those apply) to see what people are talking 
about related to your keywords. You can use Google’s blog search (http://
blogsearch.google.com) and type in your keyword phrases, your com-
pany name, or other pertinent search terms. You can get some excellent 
ideas for Web site content by listening to what’s being talked about. Just 
make sure that the ideas relate closely to your Web business so you don’t 
dilute your themes with unrelated content.
Using Various Types of Content
Search engines may be deaf, dumb, and blind, but users aren’t, and search 
engines understand that. So far in this chapter, we’ve focused on writing text 
that gives the search engines lots of content to rank you with. Now we want 
to turn to the other side of the equation: creating content to engage your 
users.
Pictures, movie clips, sounds — all these things help hold a visitor’s inter-
est on your Web site. Including other types of content besides text is a 
good idea for many reasons. The advent of blended search made these files 
important for search engine rankings, as well. (Blended search is the search 
engines’ method of combining different types of listings in a search results 
page, such as Web pages, news articles, pictures, videos, blog posts, and so

Optimizing Images
on.) Google and the other search engines consider these engagement objects 
among the factors that help a Web page rank well. If two pages are otherwise 
equal, it makes sense that the search engine would prefer to send its users 
to a page that has pictures, videos, or other types of content to make the 
experience more engaging.
Optimizing Images
When you include pictures, video, or other non-text elements in your Web 
site, you need to describe them in the surrounding text. This is the key to 
optimizing your multimedia elements so that search engines know what 
they’re about because the search engine spiders can’t watch a video or see a 
picture. You must explain the image or video or any other non-text element 
using words.
For images (including JPEG, GIF, and other types of picture files), you have 
several places where you can put descriptive text that the search engines 
can read. You can refer to what the image is about in the following locations:
 
✦ Text surrounding the element: Include descriptive text either above, 
below, or next to the picture, video, or other non-text element. A caption 
or a lead-in sentence that explains what the image shows works well. 
This gives search engine spiders text they can read and index, but it also 
helps communicate your intended meaning to users.
 
✦ Filename: The file names of your image, video, and other types of multi-
media files contain actual words.
 
✦ Alt attribute: You can also put brief descriptive text into the Alt attri-
bute attached to any image. For example, alt=”1968 Ford Mustang 
California Special Gas Cap”.
Naming images
Because both people and search engines are going to read your file names, 
make sure to use good, descriptive words in your image, video, and other 
types of multimedia files. Here is another opportunity to provide readable 
content (with keywords, if appropriate) to the spiders. Instead of naming 
your image A1234.jpg, call that photo of a skier falling on his face skier-face-
plant.jpg so the search engines know what it is, too.
To separate words, don’t use a space or an underscore (underscores are 
seen as an alpha character, rather than as punctuation). Instead, use a 
hyphen or a period to separate words in your filenames. But try not to over-
use them either — just because you can have many dashes in a URL doesn’t 
mean that you should.

314
Optimizing Images
Also, keep file names brief. Remember that long filenames cause URLs to get 
longer, too (such as if one of your images gets returned in an image search). 
Because people generally avoid clicking long URLs, keep your names to a 
reasonable length. Six words in a filename would generally be too much. 
Keep it simple: a picture of a Ford mustang with a dented fender shouldn’t 
be called fordmustang-with-a-dented-fender.jpg, just call it dented-ford-
mustang or mustang-dented-fender.jpg. You’ll have on-page text and Alt 
attributes to explain to the engines what the content of the image is.
Size matters
We’ve already said that you want to write descriptive text around images 
and in their Alt attributes. But how much text you use depends on the size 
of your image. For example, if you have a 50 x 70 pixel photo of a writer’s 
face next to an article, it’s enough to just put the person’s name in the cap-
tion. You could include a longer description of her credentials in the byline 
copy, but you wouldn’t need an entire paragraph of text captioning a small 
image like this. On the other hand, larger pictures should have longer text 
descriptions. If the image is important enough to take up a lot of screen 
space, it’s important enough to tell the search engines about. Explain the 
picture with at least a sentence of text.
If pictures help engage your users, big pictures can satisfy them even more. 
If you are offering very large images, you might want to put them on a sepa-
rate page so that only users who really want to see the full-size view have 
You want to help all types of visitors access 
your Web site, including people with disabili-
ties. It turns out that there’s an easy thing you 
can do to make your site easier to use for 
people with vision impairments, and that is to 
use Alt attributes on your images. Not only 
does that improve your site for visitors, but it’s 
also now the law.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
states that persons with disabilities may not 
be denied equal access to goods and services. 
In 2006, a court ruled that this applied to Web 
sites as well as physical retail establishments. 
The case, which was between the National 
Federation of the Blind and Target.com (www.
target.com), resulted in a ruling that Web 
sites must accommodate vision-impaired users 
by putting Alt attributes on every image. 
Vision-impaired people navigate the Web 
using screen-reading software. The software 
vocalizes the text and describes the graphics 
by reading their Alt attributes. If an Alt attri-
bute is missing, the screen reader actually says 
the image’s URL out loud! This doesn’t help 
anyone, and is definitely user-unfriendly!
Put Alt attributes on your images to communi-
cate what the image is about and include your 
keywords. It’s a win-win for you, the search 
engines, and your users.
Alt attributes and the law

to wait for them to display. However, you don’t want the search engines to 
miss the fact that that picture is part of your page’s content, and not some 
separate, unrelated page. To keep it related, you can show a thumbnail or 
small version of the image on your original page, with text description, Alt 
attributes, and the works. Then if a user clicks to view the full-size image in 
a separate window, consider including a text description there, too — but 
definitely give it an Alt attribute and filename that describes what’s in the 
image.
 
When writing Alt attributes for images, make the length proportionate to 
the image’s size on-screen. Create a brief Alt attribute for a small image, 
and longer ones for large images. As a general guideline, we believe the Alt 
content should not exceed 12 words.
Mixing in Video
Video enriches your Web site with rich media content that search engines 
are increasingly looking for. For quick reference, here’s a summary of the 
best practices for mixing in video, which we explain shortly:
 
✦ Placement: Embed the video on the page it relates to, rather than in a 
separate window.
 
✦ Descriptive text: Include an explanation of the video in the surrounding 
text.
 
✦ Saving: Save the video file inside the current silo directory, rather than 
in a central video directory. (Note: You can find out more about silos in 
Book VI.)
 
✦ Play: Don’t start playing a video automatically. Let users start it 
themselves.
 
✦ Size: Choose a viewing size that fits your audience. The standard video 
sizes are 320 x 240 pixels (small) and 640 x 480 pixels (larger).
 
✦ Quality: Render your video in a file size that fits your audience. Tech 
savvy audiences generally have faster connections and can handle 
larger file sizes. Likewise, urban areas are more likely to have broadband 
access than rural areas. A media-centric audience will put up with longer 
download times to get better quality than an audience that just wants an 
answer right now. Find the balance between good quality and fast down-
load speed.
 
✦ Length: Shorter videos obviously are easier to download and more 
convenient to watch. Although the content largely determines the 
length, short is better than long on the Web. Plan to make videos 
around two or three minutes long. Five minutes is an extremely long 
time on the Web and it’s rare for very long videos (anything more than 
ten minutes) to do well.

316
Mixing in Video
 
✦ Posting: In addition to posting your video on your site, to help your 
video get noticed, post it to a video-sharing site like YouTube (www.
youtube.com) or Metacafe (www.metacafe.com) and link it back to 
your Web site.
Placing videos where they count most
To include a video on your Web site, the SEO best practice is to embed it 
within the current page. Don’t show it in a pop-up window where it’s isolated 
from the text describing it because you want the spiders to see the video 
as part of the current page. Many sites move videos into separate windows 
with no title or text, but this is a lost opportunity from an SEO perspective. 
Unless you describe the video in words the spiders can read, more than 
likely it won’t be ranked with your content because the search engine cannot 
tell what it’s about.
 
If you’re worried that your page may load too slowly if you embed the video, 
here’s one possible solution. The video can be collapsed when the Web page 
initially loads, displaying only a link to it. Then if the user clicks the link to 
watch the video, it can expand and play within the page. This technique uses 
an expandable Div tag that works like a toggle switch, expanding or collaps-
ing the video at the user’s choice. You may find that this improves the 
usability of your page because the user stays in control.
Saving videos, and a word about formats
Where you save the video file matters, too. If your video shows the inside of 
a Ford Mustang and plays from your Ford Mustang page, save the file inside 
a directory in your Ford Mustang silo rather than, say, in a root/video direc-
tory that’s all about cars. That way, the search engines know for certain that 
it’s a video about Ford Mustangs.
Several different video formats are available (Flash, QuickTime, Windows 
Media, and so on). Currently the Flash format (SWF) seems to be the most 
popular and offers some advantages over the others. The first is usability — 
the Flash format may be the easiest for your visitors to use simply because 
so many browsers have the Flash Player plug-in installed. The second 
advantage relates more specifically to SEO. Using the most recent version 
of Adobe Flash, you can show static text right alongside the video that you 
created within Flash. Figure 2-2 shows a Flash design within a Web page that 
plays a video and has text above and beside it.
Because the major search engines can read stationary text within newer ver-
sions of Flash, adding text to the video file is a perfect way to get it indexed 
by the search engines. However, you should recall that because of the 
potential for spam, search engines may not give that Flash content the same 
weight that on-page text has.

Figure 2-2:

If you use another video format, the search engines can still pick it up. Your 
descriptive text needs to be in the page text near your embedded video link. 
You can also include text in the Title attribute of the video file (in the HTML 
code, it would look like Title=”Your text here”). Search engines may or 
may not look at the Title attributes, and it’s definitely not necessary.
Sizing videos appropriately for your audience
When you’re deciding how big to make your video, consider your audience 
first. If they tend to have the latest technology and fast Internet connections, 
you can feel free to upload large-display, good quality videos without too 
much concern for their big file size. But if your audience is varied, or not 
technically savvy, you may want to stick with smaller files that can easily 
stream over lower Internet connection speeds. There are two standard sizes 
for video play on the Web: 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high (small), and 
640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high (twice as big).
Choosing the “best” video quality
Quality in this sense refers to the resolution of the video image (how clear it 
looks compared to the original) and how clean the audio sounds. The higher 
the quality, the bigger the file. You might be tempted to put a full-size, full-
quality video on your site because it looks and sounds great on your desktop, 

318
Making the Text Readable
but after it’s online, it may be too large for anyone to download. Weigh what’s 
best for your audience. Studies have been done on video quality, and if you 
have to pick between decent picture quality and decent audio quality, go with 
audio quality. Most people are willing to put up with reduced picture qual-
ity as long as they can hear the audio clearly, but not the other way around. 
That said, you can probably keep the audio quality at 128 kbps (kilobytes per 
second) maximum and meet the dual objectives of good audio quality and 
good download speed.
Choosing the right video length
Shorter videos are easier to watch than longer ones, download faster, and 
don’t get “stuck” in the middle as often. People also prefer to watch a video 
that they know will take only a few minutes of their time, versus long ones. 
They may be reluctant to start a video that requires a lot of time to watch. A 
software company began creating Flash tutorials that were 15 to 20 minutes 
long for users to view online (modeling them after the step-by-step approach 
that had always worked in live trainings). The tutorials seemed like a big suc-
cess until someone examined the server logs. Of all the people who started 
watching the tutorials, only 3 percent watched them all the way through, 
with 90 percent exiting within the first two minutes. Needless to say, their 
next tutorials were two minutes or under in length.
Posting your videos to increase traffic
Videos can attract users to your site who wouldn’t otherwise find it. One 
strategy is to upload your videos to a video-sharing site like YouTube (www.
youtube.com) or Metacafe (www.metacafe.com) and link the videos back 
to your site. When people see them, they might be enticed to visit your site 
and explore your other content. This is a good practice, but the real advan-
tage of including video on your site comes from getting higher rankings in 
the search engines.
Making the Text Readable
Your text content needs to be plentiful and focused for the search engines, 
but it also needs to be readable for your users. Here are some tips for 
improving your text’s readability:
 
✦ Use a spelling checker: When your writing includes spelling errors and 
typos, what does that say about your company? It may communicate 
that you are unprofessional, that you have no quality control, or that 
you simply don’t care — none of which are good impressions to give 
your site visitors. Spelling checkers don’t catch everything, but they can 
point out things that aren’t even words. Then have someone proofread 
to catch any remaining problems.

Chapter 2

Content Depth and 
Page Length
319
Making the Text Readable
 
✦ Break your writing into smaller chunks: When we recommend a mini-
mum of 450 words per page, we aren’t suggesting you put it all into 
one gargantuan paragraph. It’s difficult to read large blocks of text on a 
screen. Short paragraphs of three to five lines are easier to track with 
your eyes. It’s also easier to hold your readers’ interest and keep them 
moving to the next thought when you separate a piece into short sec-
tions. You can use bullets, a Q&A (question and answer) format, lists, 
subheadings, and other techniques to make your text more digestible.
 
✦ Use bullets: Bullet points make for easy reading. They visually parse the 
text into small, digestible bits. Readers can see at a glance how many 
there are, what they relate to, and how long it’s going to take to read 
through the list. You don’t have to stick to the standard black dot style, 
either, but keep in mind that some kind of bullet created in text (rather 
than using a graphic bullet) also signals to search engines that these are 
bullet points, which helps them decipher what your content is about. 
For a good sample of how this works, look at a news story on CNN (www.
cnn.com), which summarizes the main points of the article in bullet 
points above the full text, making the article easy to skim while offering 
more information to an interested reader.
 
✦ Choose the best reading level for your audience: One of the metrics 
you should look for when you’re analyzing your competitor’s pages 
is the average reading level. Known as the Flesch-Kincaid readability 
score, it measures the corresponding U.S. grade level of written text. So 
for instance, a Flesch-Kincaid score of 8.0 would indicate an eighth-grade 
reading level; a score of 16.2 would mean it’s appropriate for people with 
four years of college education. The free version of the Page Analyzer 
in the SEOToolSet returns this number, as will Microsoft Word. To turn 
on the advanced page statistics in Word, go to Tools, Options, Spelling 
& Grammar, and then select the Show Readability Statistics check box. 
(See Figure 2-3.) Run a spell check on your document. After the check is 
complete, a box pops up with information related to the general ease of 
readability of your document.
 
 To come up with a number, the Page Analyzer and Word analyze the 
average number of syllables per word and words per sentence. For the 
Flesch-Kincaid score, a lower number is more difficult to read; higher 
is easier. The Flesch grade level corresponds roughly to the American 
school system. A grade of 9.6 would be about the reading level of a 
high school freshman midway through the year. If you find your pages 
scoring way too high or too low for what’s natural in your market, you 
should adjust your word length and sentence structure.
 
✦ Name your nouns: Don’t write about “the thing”; call it by name every 
time. Don’t overuse pronouns like “it,” “them,” “that,” or “those;” 
instead, spell out what you’re talking about. When you clarify what 
you’re writing about each time, you prevent reader confusion and give 
the search engines more uses of your keywords.

✦ Be careful with acronyms: Jargon alphabet soup — those three-letter 
acronyms that separate “us” from “them” and identify who’s in the know 
from outsiders who haven’t got a clue what everyone is talking about — 
doesn’t belong on your Web site without being clearly defined. Not only 
do you risk ostracizing site visitors who don’t know your acronyms, 
but also you risk keeping search engine spiders in the dark. Instead, 
use the good journalistic practice of writing out the phrase the first 
time it occurs on every page, followed by the acronym in parentheses. 
You might also consider spelling out your phrase in every usage if it 
improves your keyword density. If you must use acronyms exclusively, 
you can use the Acronym HTML tag — this helps users by allowing them 
to mouse over the word to get the full definition. There’s no SEO value in 
the tag because search engines ignore the tag as it can be spammed.
Example: <acronym title=”Search Engine 
Optimization”>SEO</acronym>
 
✦ Allow white space and margins: Empty space around text makes it 
easier to read, so don’t think of white space as wasted screen real 
estate. Use margins and spacing to avoid a cluttered look. Edge-to-edge 
text looks like too much to read, so people won’t try. Also consider 

Book V
Chapter 2
Establishing 
Content Depth and 
Page Length
321
Making the Text Readable
indenting paragraphs by wrapping the left or right edge of your text 
nicely alongside a graphic. This can add visual appeal as well as reduce 
the width of your paragraph and increase readability.
 
✦ Select readable fonts: You can specify typefaces that are serif fonts 
(fonts that include little strokes at the ends of characters, such as the 
feet on a capital A) or sans-serif fonts (fonts without serifs, such as Arial, 
Verdana, and others) for your body text. Although users may have their 
own opinions on this, sans-serif fonts are considered the king of Web 
text because serifs often make small letters less readable on a computer 
monitor. And to keep from cluttering your HTML with inline font tags, be 
sure to specify what typefaces to use on headings, captions, body text, 
and so on, using an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). (For more on 
that, see Book IV, Chapter 1.)
 
 It’s important to note that even if you specify what typeface you want to 
use, the font cannot show up if users do not have that typeface installed 
on their computers. For this reason, specify multiple fonts or end your 
font command with a generic command, such as serif. This way, if a 
user’s browser can’t find the exact font you wanted, it can at least sub-
stitute a similar font. (Note: You can use sIFR as a way to get around 
this and incorporate special fonts if you really want to — see Book IV, 
Chapter 4.)
 
✦ Choose backgrounds and colors for readability: The most readable 
text is black type on a white background. You can vary from that, but 
do so carefully. For your main body copy, do use dark fonts against a 
light background for maximum contrast and readability. Using reverse 
copy (light text against a dark background) should never be applied to 
an entire Web site. Not only is it harder to read, but also you risk letting 
your users print out blank pages when they choose File➪Print (white 
text tends to not show up on white paper).
 
 Also be careful of having too little contrast between your background 
and type colors. You’ve probably watched presentations where the 
slides were illegible because they had peach text on a beige background, 
or some similar combination. It’s the same principle on your Web site. 
Make the words stand out. In addition to usability, adequate contrast 
between text and background is an extremely important point for search 
engines: Text that is too similar in color to the background could be con-
sidered hidden text and marked as spam.
 
✦ Plan for printing: People may want to print out your Web pages, so 
be sure to create a print style sheet that defines how all of your site 
fonts should translate for printing, and how to lay out the content on 
an 8 1/2" x 11" piece of paper. You should also specify the images to 
print, removing unnecessary ones in order to save your users time, ink, 
and paper. Neglecting to create a print style sheet can cause printing 
nightmares, and people can waste tree-loads of paper in the process.

322
Allowing User Input
Allowing User Input
Letting users contribute content directly to your Web site meets at least 
two goals simultaneously: It adds more content to your site and stimulates 
higher user engagement. Although you might feel nervous about letting 
other people write text that appears on your Web site, the advantages make 
it definitely worth considering. And you can still hold the reins to make sure 
your site contains accurate and constructive information. The primary SEO 
motivation for allowing User Generated Content (UGC) is to add unique con-
tent to pages that would otherwise contain only duplicate content.
One of the best applications of user-generated content is reviews. Letting 
users write their own reviews of your products and services is a fantastic 
way to get content on your site. Users write about your products in their 
own words, which become natural language search terms. This might help 
you capture Long Tail queries (search queries for long, specific phrases that 
indicate a serious, conversion-ready searcher) if you make sure those pages 
can be crawled by the search engines.
 
It’s great for business, too. Facilitating online user reviews of your products 
or services can help you sell them. Consumers also trust user-generated con-
tent more than traditional sales copy. After reading reviews, people are often 
more likely to purchase because they have more faith in what they will 
receive. Educated consumers also make better customers, with less poten-
tial for returned merchandise.
Web site owners often fear that people will write bad things about their 
product or service and negatively impact their brand. However, statistics 
show that the majority of user reviews are positive. For instance, the online-
reviews Web site Yelp (www.yelp.com) says that 85 percent of reviews are 
positive. Similarly, the site Bazaarvoice (www.bazaarvoice.com) claims 
that 80 percent of all reviewers award four or five stars.
 
That being said, you can always expect a few people who write defaming, 
nonsensical, or offensive comments that don’t belong on your Web site. To 
take care of unwanted reviews, you should
 
✦ Monitor your user-generated content, either automatically using a ser-
vice, or manually, so that you can remove the offending entries.
 
✦ Consider tracking the IP addresses of reviewers, so that you can identify 
someone who leaves a truly malicious comment.
 
✦ Consider requiring an account logon for anyone who submits a review. 
The drawback is that your security gate may dissuade people from 
participating, but it would give you assurance that you’re dealing with 
customers only.

Book V
Chapter 2
Establishing 
Content Depth and 
Page Length
323
Creating User Engagement
 
✦ Allow users to comment on other people’s reviews (with a link such as 
“Was this helpful?”). Then the reviews can become self-regulating to a 
certain extent.
 
Negative feedback can often help a business, so don’t shun it entirely. Negative 
reviews help people understand the product’s limitations and further builds 
trust. (“It didn’t work for them, but their situation is different than mine.”) 
Online reviews can also alert you to cases where your products or services 
truly did fall short, so that you can address the problems. When a disgruntled 
user has a legitimate issue that you read about in the user-generated content, 
you can immediately contact the person to resolve it. After the person’s issue 
is resolved, she might be so happy that you end up getting another, com-
pletely positive review of your customer service.
Another interesting thing to note about negative review is that they can actu-
ally help build trust. Many people say that they don’t trust a product that 
doesn’t have anything but positive reviews. Negative reviews actually vali-
date the user’s sense that nobody’s perfect.
Besides reviews, you might consider adding these other types of user-
generated content to your Web site:
 
✦ User forums: These discussions can become free-for-alls, but they also 
allow significant user interaction and provide you with excellent feed-
back from your user group. You can decide whether to participate with 
“official” responses or not.
 
✦ Comments: News sites do this all the time. After an article, they put a 
Comments link and let people respond. The number of comments can 
even make the article appear more popular, relevant, or interesting.
 
✦ Blogs: If you want to post opinion-style content in the form of blog 
articles, or just let your site visitors do it, a blog (literally, Web log) may 
be right for you. You probably need to blog on a regular basis (weekly or 
other) in order to keep conversations going.
Creating User Engagement
A lot of what you learned in high school English class can help with your 
Web site writing and make it more engaging to read:
 
✦ Choose strong verbs that convey action. Avoid overusing the “forms of 
be” verbs (is, are, was, were, and so on) because they stick a sentence 
together with all the excitement of white glue. Instead, generate interest 
with active verbs like drive, soar, infuse, create, and so on.

324
Creating User Engagement
 
 Also avoid using the passive voice, which dulls down your writing and 
makes it sound like a dry treatise or a political science textbook. English 
teachers suggest asking, “Who kicked whom?” in order to find out what 
a passive-voice sentence really means. Here’s a passive sentence that 
lacks excitement: “Up to 20 pairs of skis can be stored in the MegaRack 
ski hauler.” You can rewrite it by identifying a subject (“you”) and 
making it active: “You can pack skis for a 20-person ski party into this 
trunktop MegaRack ski hauler.”
 
✦ Show, don’t tell. Your Web site needs to persuade people, interest 
them, and draw them in with good content. For this reason, you should 
write as if they’re there, not just reading about an event after the fact. 
Newspaper reporting tells what happened: “On Friday night, Racer Rick 
won the Indy 100 driving a bumper car.” But to engage your readers, you 
want to show them what you’re talking about. Describe the scene when 
the race began; what Racer Rick looked like; how his bumper car looked 
compared to all the formula ones on the track; what people said before, 
during, and after the race; the blow-by-blow of the race action; and the 
spectacular finish. Don’t just tell people about your product or service; 
make them feel it.
 
✦ Use sensory words. Your text needs to make readers feel, taste, touch, 
hear, and see what you’re talking about — experience it themselves — 
rather than just read a report about it. You achieve this using sensory 
words and good descriptors. For instance, “The XJ-7 ski pole improves 
your downhill speed” tells the facts. But “Wrap your fingers around 
the XJ-7’s form-fitted grips and hold on tight as you zip around curves, 
adjusting your descent with light touches of your diamond-tipped poles 
to the snow-packed ground racing beneath you,” makes your readers 
experience it. Not to mention that you can integrate your keywords 
more easily into a descriptive paragraph.
 
✦ Be specific and give details. As we stated earlier in this chapter, your 
writing needs to call things by name. Don’t be vague — it leads to ambi-
guity and confusion for your readers. Because you know exactly what 
you mean, you generalize or put together phrases that don’t make sense 
to someone unfamiliar with your business. To help you improve your 
text, you might ask someone who’s a complete novice to review your 
copy and point out anything that’s unclear.
 
✦ Also, try not to use pronouns like it and that, or generic words like stuff 
or thing, when you can use words packed with meaning instead. As a 
bonus, restating the proper name of the thing you’re talking about helps 
the search engine understand better that your page is about that thing, 
whether it be ski poles, cowboy boots, or search engine optimization.
 
Keep in mind that your Web site is never “done.” Good writing, if you 
remember your high school or college composition courses, involves contin-
uous revision. When you think you are finished and that the writing is good 
enough, you should put the pages away for a few days, do something else, 

Book V

325
Writing a Call to Action
and then come back and look at them again. More than likely you can find a 
few more things that can be made better. And as always, try to have fresh 
eyes look at what you’ve written. Someone who has not seen it before can 
usually see things that you could not see because of your familiarity with the 
subject.
Writing a Call to Action
You know the goal you have for your Web page visitors — to make a pur-
chase, sign up for your newsletter, subscribe to your RSS feed, sign a peti-
tion, become a member, or something else. Calls to action are the words that 
clearly give users that opportunity. “Buy your XJ-7 poles now,” and “Try out 
the new XJ-7 ski poles,” and “See the XJ-7’s new colors,” all represent calls to 
action that can be linked to a page where the user can purchase the XJ-7.
For search engine optimization, you should include descriptive words in 
your calls to action. Notice that every previous example mentions the name 
of the product (XJ-7) and something meaningful about it. If your call to 
action says only “Buy now,” or “Add to cart,” you’re missing an opportunity 
to clearly specify (to the search engines) that this is the page where the XJ-7 
can be purchased. Your Web site design may have a standard interface that 
includes generic options under every product listing, but you could consider 
also including a more specific text link under the product description. Or for 
another example, if you have links in your copy to sign up for your newslet-
ter, include a brief description in every link like “Car Restoration Newsletter” 
rather than just “Sign up for our newsletter.”
To be most effective, a call to action should use an imperative verb (like 
See or Try or Buy) and a compelling benefit. The following example could be 
from a business-to-business site. A call to action like this would be very moti-
vating for an engineer seeking this type of solution:
Attend our Webcast “Process Excellence for Supply Chain 
Management” and learn how to reduce costs with our 
process-driven approach to aligning business processes 
within the supply chain.
Your call to action should tell visitors exactly what you want them to do:
 
✦ If you want them to buy your product, you could scatter multiple calls 
to action in strategic places within your copy, telling them how to do it 
(such as “Click here to buy Brand X now”).
 
✦ If you want them to contact you by phone, state your phone number and 
instructions (“Call us Monday–Friday from 8–5 EST at 1-800-999-9999”). 
You could repeat the number in bold text throughout your copy and 
again at the end.

326
Writing a Call to Action
 
Be wary of spamming the page. Repeating your call to action only works if 
you don’t annoy the visitor. From an SEO perspective, it’s possible to config-
ure a page for a user, for a search engine, and for your conversion objective.
An effective call to action entices the user to click. It motivates the user to 
move further into the conversion process. Often, you won’t be able to know 
conclusively what phrasing works best until you’ve tried them. So if you’re 
debating between three different calls to action, you could set up a test alter-
nating between versions, tracking how many people clicked on each as well 
as the eventual conversion rate (how many of those clicks resulted in an 
actual sale). Then you would know which call to action is most effective for 
your current audience and Web site.

You may have a Web site already up and running, or you might be in the 
planning stages of a brand new site. Either way, you should be ready to 
identify where you have content holes that need to be filled. In this chapter, 
you hone your skills at creating content that can rank well with the search 
engines.
First, ask yourself: What is your Web site about? The answers to this ques-
tion give you a foundation for all your content planning and writing. Some 
sites try to be everything to everybody, but those sites don’t rank well 
in searches. When a site’s content is unfocused and too general, search 
engines can’t figure out what the site is about. The site doesn’t demonstrate 
expertise in any one thing, so the search engines don’t know what search 
queries the site is relevant for. The result? The site doesn’t rank well in 
search results.
You must clearly know your site’s main subject themes, or the primary cat-
egories of information in your site, as a first step to planning and writing 
effective content. In a nutshell, you need to identify your themes, categorize 
them into pages, and then create focused content on those subjects. This is 
what we cover in this chapter. (For more on how to theme a Web site, see 
Book II, Chapter 1.)
Creating Your Keyword List
After you know your Web site’s main subject themes, you can begin build-
ing a keyword list. A keyword is any word typed as a search query. Search 
engines try to give users what they’re looking for by searching for those 

328
Creating Your Keyword List
keywords among their indexes of Web sites, and then displaying the most 
relevant results. You want your Web site to be considered the most relevant 
for the keywords that match what your site is about. You need to choose 
your keywords so that you can proactively create focused content that can 
be considered most relevant.
Your first step in building a keyword list should be to brainstorm. At the 
brainstorming stage, write down every keyword word or phrase that comes 
to mind for your themes. You can filter them later; for now, you just want 
to amass the longest list you can of one-word, two-word, three-word, and 
longer potential keywords that relate to your Web site. (Note that the multi-
word phrases are important to plan for because people tend to search for 
more specific queries when they’re ready to make a decision, but shorter 
queries when they’re just doing research.) To get more input, ask other 
people what they would call the information, products, or services you offer. 
Ask people involved in your business or industry, but also ask your neigh-
bor, your niece, or others who are unfamiliar with your industry. You’re 
trying to find all the ways someone might try to find what you have to offer.
After you’ve brainstormed, the next step is to organize your long list of 
potential keywords into subject categories, broken down from the broadest 
to the most specific. If your Web site is about customized classic cars, an 
outline might look something like this:
Classic Cars
Classic Cars 1950s
Classic Cars 1960s
Classic Cars 1970s
Classic Cars American
Classic Cars Ford
Classic Cars Ford Mustang
Classic Cars Ford Mustang Convertibles
Classic Cars Ford Mustang Hard Tops
Classic Cars Ford Comet
Classic Cars Ford GTO
Classic Cars Chevrolet
Classic Cars Chevrolet Sedans
Classic Cars Chevrolet Trucks
Classic Cars Customization
Classic Cars Customization Paint 
Classic Cars Customization Upholstery
Classic Cars Customization Upholstery Leather
Classic Cars Customization Upholstery Vinyl
These are all terms people might search for when they are looking up 
classic cars, or customization, or both, and all of them can be used as key-
words on your Web site. You can go into even more breakdowns and come 
up with specific keywords into the hundreds or thousands, as appropriate 
for your site.

Book V
Chapter 3
Adding Keyword-
Specific Content
329
Developing Content Using Your Keywords
After you have your initial keyword list, you need to evaluate the keywords 
and identify which ones are your main subjects. Then organize the more 
specific subtopic keywords beneath them. You want to structure your Web 
site to assign each of your main keywords to a specific landing page (the 
page you want users to come to because it’s the best source of information 
for that topic on your site). For instance, you’d want to build a landing page 
for the keyword phrase [Classic Cars Ford Mustang] that has focused con-
tent on Ford Mustangs, and that links to subpages of supporting information 
about Ford Mustangs. Doing this makes it easier for search engines to know 
that the page is relevant to searches for [Ford Mustangs] or [classic Ford 
Mustangs] or [classic Mustang cars], and so on. We recommend that you 
include a minimum of five subpages supporting each of your landing pages 
in order to present depth of content to the search engines. Organizing your 
site into categories like this is called siloing (theming), and it’s covered at 
length in Book VI, Chapter 1.
 
Weed out keywords that don’t support your subject themes: Unrelated 
words that show up too frequently on a page dilute the page’s subject rel-
evance. For instance, if your Ford Mustangs page lists all the possible tire 
and wheel options and mentions “tires” too many times, the search engines 
might think it’s a page about Ford Mustang tires, and lower its ranking for 
the keyword [Ford Mustang].
For more help selecting good keywords, see Book II, Chapter 2.
Developing Content Using Your Keywords
After you have your categories and subcategories mapped out, look at your 
Web site content and choose (or plan) a landing page devoted to each one. 
For every landing page, you also want to assign a primary keyword or key-
word phrase. In other words, your site needs to have a focused page on each 
of your important keywords.
Your goal is to have the search engines recognize what each one of your 
landing pages is most relevant for, so that it can show up in search results 
for its keywords. And the better you can focus your content on those tar-
geted keywords, the higher your URL is likely to be in the list.
Your Web site’s landing pages present the all-important first impression to 
site visitors. You want to make sure your landing pages not only put your 
best foot forward, but also interest visitors enough to entice them to go 
further, and hopefully convert. The pages have to look good to users and 
search engines.
As a general guideline, the pages at the top of each silo (your landing or 
index pages) should have at least 450 words of text content, and be sup-
ported by at least five subpages (each with at least 450 words) within the 

330
Developing Content Using Your Keywords
same theme. Writing that much content may sound overwhelming, but you 
can tackle it as you would any big project. Develop a strategy for adding at 
least 450 words to each page. Setting a schedule and producing X number 
of pages every week eventually builds up a site that can serve as a subject 
matter expert in the areas that are important to your business. Focus not 
on gimmick pages, link bait (short-lived attention-getters) Top 10 lists or 
other flash-in-the-pan strategies, but on developing content that will satisfy 
researchers and convert them to buyers. (For more on link bait, see Book VI, 
Chapter 1.)
 
Your landing pages need to have enough content so that people reaching 
them from a search engine feel satisfied that they’ve come to the right place. 
You want the content to engage visitors enough so that they want to stay. 
You also need your landing pages to link to other pages that offer more 
detailed information within the subject category and lead to opportunities to 
buy, sign up, or take whatever action your site considers a conversion.
Beginning to write
When writing your Web content, it’s best to use simple, everyday language 
that searchers are likely to type in. As a general rule, we recommend includ-
ing a keyword or keyword phrase enough to be prominent so that someone 
who read the page would be able to pick out what the most important word 
was. Don’t force your keywords into your content. Let it sound natural.
Additionally, you should avoid using only general phrases; be sure to include 
detailed descriptive words as well. If your keywords are too general, they are 
likely to be up against too much competition from others targeting the same 
keywords. However, fewer people search for very specific terms, resulting 
in fewer potential visitors. It’s a balancing act, and the rules aren’t hard and 
fast. You need to find the right mix for your site by finding the keywords 
that bring traffic that actually converts: In other words, you want to put out 
the bait that brings in the right catch. Also keep in mind that the broader 
keywords go on the upper landing pages and more specific keywords on the 
subpages, and that you might need to focus on several more specific varia-
tions of a keyword phrase in order to rank for the broader term.
When you start to write a new page, stay focused on the page’s theme. Write 
as much as you can about that subject theme, even if the information seems 
totally obvious to you. What seems obvious to you probably would be new 
information to someone unfamiliar with your subject. After all, that’s why 
someone would come to your site: to read what a subject expert has to say. 
Begin by stating the obvious; it establishes your credibility when your visi-
tors find information they already know to be true on your pages and they’ll 
be more likely to trust your site to give them further information. 

Book V
Chapter 3
Adding Keyword-
Specific Content
331
Developing Content Using Your Keywords
As you write your first draft, don’t worry so much about keyword place-
ment. Do include your keywords, but let the language flow naturally around 
the topic. Later you can analyze what you’ve written and refine things like 
keyword density and distribution (but more on that under “Optimizing the 
Content,” later in this chapter).
To test whether your writing comes across as natural, try reading it out 
loud. Text that sounds like conversational language engages readers.
Keeping it relevant
Make sure that you don’t dilute the subject theme by including irrelevant 
information. Some pruning might be necessary if you’re working on an 
existing page rather than starting one from scratch. If the page is all about 
Chevrolet Camaros, keep the discussion focused on that car model, without 
a lengthy discussion of how it compared to the competing Pontiac Firebird 
back in the 1970s. Too many mentions of another type of car can dilute your 
Camaro theme and confuse the search engines, thereby reducing your sub-
ject relevance to [Chevrolet Camaros].
Including clarifying words
You want to include secondary words that help clarify what your keywords 
are about. For example, if you have the keyword [apple] for one of your 
pages, the search engines are going to look at all of the text near the word 
apple to figure out whether your page is about the fruit or the computer. 
If this was your Web page, you could use words like software, computer, or 
other related terms to clarify that you mean Apple as in computer.
 
You want to put your clarifying words close to your keywords in the text. 
The closer the proximity, the stronger the correlation.
Another reason to include clarifying words is to match more search queries, 
especially Long-Tail queries. Long-tail queries are longer, targeted search 
phrases that aren’t frequently used, but generally have a high conversion 
rate because searchers entering these queries know exactly what they’re 
looking for. Search engine users are becoming savvier as time goes on, and 
they know that a single keyword is probably going to be too broad. A good 
example is what happens when you do a search for [security]. You might 
be in need of a security guard service, but doing a quick search on Google 
with the keyword [security] gives you the Wikipedia article on security, 
the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, 
and many listings for computer security software. Using a Long-Tail search 
query like [security guard service Poughkeepsie], on the other hand, turns 
up map results listing local businesses, two local business sites for hiring 
security guards, and a couple of news articles about security services in 
Poughkeepsie.

332
Developing Content Using Your Keywords
You can see why it’s a good idea to include supplemental words and phrases 
on your Web pages. Search engines can match queries to words that can 
be found in close proximity to each other on your page, even if they never 
appear as a phrase. So for instance, if your Web page has the heading 
“Oldsmobile Ninety-Eights Make the Coolest Convertibles,” and the body 
copy contains all of these words in close proximity as well, your page would 
be found relevant to the search query [Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight convertible], 
even though you never used the exact phrase.
Including synonyms to widen your appeal
Synonyms of your keywords also need to show up on your Web pages, in 
your HTML tags, and in the anchor text of links to your pages. People don’t 
use the same words to describe things, so it appears more natural to search 
engines to find backlinks to your pages using a variety of different terms that 
all mean roughly the same thing.
Including keyword synonyms also helps you match more search queries. 
People search for things in their own words, not yours. For instance, if you 
have a page on your classic cars site all about Oldsmobile Ninety-Eights, you 
should make sure your keywords include both [Ninety-Eight] spelled out and 
the numeric [98], because people could search either way. In another exam-
ple, a Web page that sells ski boots would optimize that page for the key-
word phrase [ski boots]. But they’d also want their listing to display when 
people search for [ski footwear], [snow boots], or [winter apparel]. Unless 
they have synonyms like these within the page, the search engine won’t find 
it relevant and won’t include it in the search results.
Also, don’t forget nicknames! If your main subjects have common nicknames, 
these are important to include — possibly as keywords, but at least in your 
body content. For instance, on your classic cars site, your Chevrolet Camaro 
page should include the word [Chevy], your Ford Mustang page should 
include the nickname [Stang], and so forth.
 
Of course, your hunt for good synonyms could begin in a thesaurus. Even 
better, find out what words Google thinks are synonymous with your key-
words. Do this:
 
1. For a Google search, enter a tilde (~) character in front of a keyword, 
such as [~Mustang].
 
2. View the results page, and notice that synonyms appear in boldface 
type.
 
 Google formats the word Mustang in bold, and also any words Google 
considers closely related or synonymous with Mustang. So you can see 
ideas for additional words you should probably use in your page. You 

Book V
Chapter 3
Adding Keyword-
Specific Content
333
Developing Content Using Your Keywords
can run a synonym search for keyword phrases, as well — put tildes in 
front of every word, such as [~Ford ~Mustang ~trim], or just in front of 
selected words, like [Ford Mustang ~trim]. Doing this search bolds some 
additional words of interest: trimming, Ford, and so on.
Dealing with stop words
Stop words are words that the search engines typically ignore because they 
are so common. They don’t contribute to any meaningful content but they 
are absolutely essential in your writing. Words like a, the, at, to, will, this, 
and, and with are all stop words that make your text sound more natural. 
Here’s what Google says about stop words:
“Google ignores stop words when they’re placed in searches alongside less 
common words. For example, a search for [The Sound and the Fury] will only 
return results for the terms “Sound” and “Fury.” However, a search that only 
includes stop words — [The Who], for example — will be processed as is.”
 
Although the search engines typically do not count stop words, writing with-
out them would turn your pages to gibberish. Ranking well for your keyword 
is worthless if your potential customers don’t like your site well enough to 
buy your product or service. Remember the rule is always to write for your 
customers first and the search engines second.
As a final note about stop words, you can include them in your keyword 
phrases. For example, a search for [holiday on ice], which is the name of a 
touring ice show, does bring back slightly different results than a search for 
[holiday ice]. It looks like the algorithm is intelligent enough to recognize 
phrases that contain stop words, rather than discard them completely.
Freshness of the content
As a general rule, the more often your site has fresh changing content, the 
more often the search engines want to index it. News sites, for example, have 
to be crawled constantly because of how frequently they post new stories. 
On a lesser scale, if you have a blog on your Web site that has new activity 
every day, the spiders generally crawl your site more often than a site that 
updates once a month.
 
If your site content gets indexed in news searches or blog searches, you 
definitely need fresh content to stay near the top of those engines. Without 
frequent posts, your articles fade into the oblivion of the search results’ 
back pages.
Your ranking in normal search results does not change based on how 
frequently you’re spidered. Where you might suffer as a result of infrequent 
search engine indexing, however, is if you’ve made SEO-related changes to 

334
Optimizing the Content
your site. You might have an entire board of directors waiting to see the 
results of your latest SEO edit, and weeks could go by until the spider revisits 
your page.
Periodically, you should review your site content to make sure it stays fresh. 
See if anything has changed, and either update or add to the text that’s 
there. This is pretty much common sense, but it has the added benefit of 
providing fresh content to keep the spiders coming back to your site.
Dynamically adding content to a page
You may use a content management system (CMS) that takes your content 
and automatically builds your Web pages from it. If so, you’ll want to make 
sure it’s dynamically adding content properly, taking into consideration 
everything you know about SEO and good content writing. For instance, the 
text should sound natural, use your keywords in the appropriate amount 
and distribution, and make sense. Also, make sure that the Title and Meta 
tags in the page’s Heading section are being created properly emphasizing 
appropriate keywords, with every page unique.
 
You don’t want to ever lose control of your Web site by using a poor-quality 
CMS that is not configurable. Because search engines decide whether your 
pages are relevant for search queries based on having keyword-rich focused 
content, and unique headings and tags, you can’t afford to let an inflexible 
CMS limit how much you can customize each page.
Another thing to avoid is auto-generated text. Generally, machine-written 
content sounds unnatural and won’t do a good job representing you either 
to users or to the search engines. (For more discussion of content manage-
ment systems, see Book VII, Chapter 5.)
Optimizing the Content
When you have pages of content to work with, you can refine them for 
search engine optimization (SEO). If you haven’t already set up the text 
content in an HTML document, do so now because part of what you need to 
optimize is the HTML code behind the page.
Looking at your page in the HTML code view, your first step is to do what we 
call “getting the red out.” (In Page Analyzer, things that need to be corrected 
are displayed in red text, so it’s easy to figure out where to start.) You want 
to fix the blatant SEO issues, the ones that are the most obvious and often 
the easiest to fix. Here’s what to look for:

Book V
Chapter 3
Adding Keyword-
Specific Content
335
Optimizing the Content
 
✦ Title tag: The Title tag should appear first in your HTML code’s 
Head section. It should be unique and contain your page’s main keyword 
(with no word repeated). Normally the Title tag should be between six 
and twelve words in length (brief).
 
✦ Description Meta tag: The Meta description tag should appear second 
in your HTML Head section. It needs to contain all of the keywords used 
in the Title tag, and should be written like a sentence because this 
is often what search engines display within a result listing. Any word 
should not appear more than twice. The length guideline is 12 to 24 
words.
 
✦ Meta keywords tag: The Meta keywords tag should appear third in 
your HTML head section and should contain all of the words used in the 
Title and Description tags. It can be written as a list separated by 
commas, starting with the long phrases and ending with single words. 
No single word should be used more than four times, and the total 
length should not exceed 48 words.
 
✦ Heading tags: Heading tags (H#) set apart your on-page titles and sub-
headings, and search engines analyze them to determine your page’s 
main ideas, so make them meaningful. You want to use an H1 for the 
first and most important heading on the page only. Second-level head-
ings should be given H2, third-level headings H3, and so forth; also, they 
should never be placed out of order. Just think back to school term 
papers, outlines . . . When the search engines were built, their main pur-
pose was to index educational, technical, and professional papers, and 
very little else. The code hasn’t changed much since the engines were 
built: They still rely on the same basic principle they started with.
 
 A good heading length is from one to five words, but how many headings 
you should have on a page depends on the content of the page. Only use 
an H# tag when it defines a sub-change in the content structure, much 
like a table of contents outlines the structure of a book. You will almost 
never have multiple H1 tags (how many pages have more than one main 
topic, after all?), but could have multiple H2, H3, and so on, if the con-
tent supports it. 
 
 For example:
<h1>Ford Reviews</h1>
Content about Ford Reviews (200 words)
<h2>Mustang Reviews</h2>
Content about Mustang Reviews (200+ words)
<h2>Ford F-150 Reviews</h2> 
Content about Ford F-150 reviews 200+ words again.
 
 In the preceding example, the H1 and H2 tags are used properly. Think 
about it as a school or technical paper. It has to follow an outline format 
completely. You can have an H3 heading, but only if it’s below an H2 tag. 

336
Optimizing the Content
If you had a section for the engine specs of the Ford Mustang, for exam-
ple, that could be considered an H3.
 
 The usage of H4 and H5 tags would have to be, again, related sub-content 
to the H3 tag, and so on.
 
Remember that the spider reads the page from a code view, not the way the 
page is laid out for visual presentation. They do not yet have the capability 
of modern browser emulation.
Digging deeper by running Page Analyzer
After you’ve gotten the red out, you can work on optimizing the body con-
tent you wrote. We suggest you run the page through Page Analyzer:
 
1. Go to www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html.
 
2. In Page Analyzer, enter the page’s URL (such as www.yourdomain.
com/pageinprogress.html).
 
3. Click the Analyze Page button and wait until the report displays.
The Page Analyzer report compiles lots of useful information for you to ana-
lyze your page content and plan improvements, as we explain in a moment. 
We suggest you look at the following six areas to diagnose issues and 
improve your page: the Heading section, frequently used words, reading 
level, keyword density, keyword frequency, and keyword distribution.
 
✦ Head section problems: You can see at a glance if you overlooked any 
of the “getting the red out” steps we discussed previously because the 
report shows exceptions in bright red text. For instance, if you used a 
word in your Meta description tag but forgot to include it in the Meta 
keywords tag as well, under the heading “Meta Keywords Tag,” you 
would see this message:
META Keywords is MISSING a word that is in either the 
TITLE or META Description.
 
✦ Frequently used words: Figure 3-1 shows a table from the report that 
lists two-word phrases that are used at least twice in the page.
 
 Looking across the rows, you can also see what section of the page 
each phrase appears in, whether it’s in the Title, Description, Keywords, 
headings, image Alt codes, or something else. Because search engines 
look for repeated words to ascertain what your page is all about, look 
carefully at these tables. The most frequently used words appear at the 
top: These should be your keywords. You also want to make sure you 
don’t have frequently repeated words that might distract the search 
engines from understanding your main page theme. You can see how 
this report can save you hours of manual work counting instances and 
trying to make sure your keywords, synonyms, clarifying words, and so 
on are adequately used.

✦ Reading level: Above the word tables, the report shows you details 
about your text’s reading level. Because you want your site to be appro-
priate for your target audience, this is important. The row (not shown 
in the figure) labeled “Kincaid Grade Level” identifies the U.S. school 
grade level that your writing matches. If it says 16.0, that means your 
text is appropriate for someone with four years of college education. 
The Kincaid score is based on the average number of syllables per 
word and words per sentence. If you find your pages scoring way too 
high or too low for your target audience’s education level, you should 
adjust your word length and sentence structure. For instance, a Web 
site directed at tweens needs to have a low Kincaid score (around 5.0 to 
8.0), but that reading level would not be appropriate for a site targeting 
doctoral candidates.
 
 You can also check your documents Flesch-Kincaid score and Flesch 
grade level in Microsoft Word. Check out Chapter 2 in this minibook for 
instructions on how to turn on your readability statistics in Word.
 
✦ Keyword density: You also want to check the keyword density of your 
main keywords in the page, which is how much of the total text that key-
word represents. The report shows the density as a percentage in the 
ALL Words column for every keyword (see the far right column of Figure 
3-1). Keyword density is one of the factors a search engine spider looks 
at when determining whether a Web page is relevant to that search. The 

338
Finding Tools for Keyword Integration
ideal density for your important keywords depends on what’s consid-
ered normal for the high-ranking sites for that keyword. If all of your top-
ranking competitors have a 7 percent keyword density for the phrase 
[classic cars], 7 percent should be your starting target. Go below that 
and you risk being left out of the search engine rankings for that phrase. 
Go above that, and you could be considered spam.
 
 You can find out the typical keyword density for your competition by 
running Page Analyzer on their Web pages and calculating the average 
you receive. You may also subscribe to tools that produce this data in 
one step, such as the Multi-Page Analyzer from the SEOToolSet, which 
can be found at www.seotoolset.com. (For more help doing competi-
tive research, see Book III. Detailed instructions on how to approximate 
the results of the Multi-Page Analyzer are available in Book III, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Keyword frequency: Because the use of keywords is so crucial to your 
search engine optimization, also examine your keyword frequency (the 
number of times the keyword appears on the page). This number shows 
in parentheses in the All Words column of the Page Analyzer report. And 
as with keyword density, you need to size up your competitors to find 
out what number to shoot for.
 
✦ Keyword distribution: One last measurement that affects your search 
engine ranking for a particular keyword is the distribution, or placement 
throughout the page. Your site might use the keyword phrase [classic 
cars] the right number of times (frequency) and in the right proportion 
to the total amount of text (density), but it also needs to distribute the 
phrase regularly throughout the page. If it’s only used in the top quarter 
of the page, the search engines assume that your page as a whole is not 
as relevant to classic cars as it would be if the phrase appears through-
out the copy evenly.

In this section, we recap tools we’ve mentioned elsewhere to give you a 
handy list for your reference. These tools can help you analyze your Web 
page content to make sure you’ve set up your keywords effectively. They 
are shortcuts that show you some key factors that the search engines look 
for to determine relevance. Remember, in almost every case, the search 
engines themselves are going to be your best asset in terms of analyzing 
your market.
 
✦ Page Analyzer (www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html): 
The Page Analyzer is your primary keyword analysis tool. It lists all key-
words on the page (words used at least twice, minus “stop” words like 
the, and, but, and so on). It shows you each keyword’s density and fre-
quency. It also identifies problems in your Title tag and Meta tags and 
analyzes the reading level of your text.

✦ Copyscape (www.copyscape.com): This free tool lets you check for 
duplicates of your Web page copy elsewhere on the Web. You want to 
make sure you have original content on your site because duplications 
can cause your page to be filtered out of the search engine’s index. (We 
cover avoiding duplicate content in the next chapter.)
 
✦ Keyword Activity (www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.
html): Part of analyzing keywords is finding out how often people 
search for them. This free tool lets you check search activity by keyword 
(and do many other search engine optimization-related tasks). You can 
also do keyword research using the free Search Engine Optimization/
KSP, available at www.bruceclay.com/web_rank.htm#seoksp. 
Alternative recommended tools that give you robust reporting (for a 
fee) include
 
• Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com) is a for-pay tool that mea-
sures keyword traffic. Wordtracker offers both annual plans and 
monthly plans. The annual subscription runs about $329, and the 
monthly plan costs $59 per month. They also offer a free trial version.
 
• Keyword Discovery (www.keyworddiscovery.com) offers a sub-
scription service that runs about $49.95 a month.
 
✦ Keyword distribution using a browser: Mozilla Firefox (www.mozilla.
com/en-US/firefox/) and (www.google.com/chrome).
 
 Available as a free download, Mozilla’s Firefox browser is one of the 
most powerful SEO tools out there, with multiple add-ons that allow 
power users to slice and dice almost any aspect of a Web site. Right out 
of the box, Firefox lets you do a rough keyword distribution search on a 
page. Ctrl+F brings up a search box: Just type in your keyword, and then 
select Highlight All to see where the words fall on your page.
 
 Also available as a free download, Google’s new Chrome browser (still in 
beta as of this writing) has some nifty features. One of its best features 
is the ability to see how a word or phrase is distributed throughout a 
page visually. With any Web page open, simply press Ctrl+F to activate 
a drop-down search box. Then type in the word or phrase you want to 
find. Figure 3-2 shows how every instance is automatically highlighted 
in yellow, and colored bands appear in the vertical scroll bar represent-
ing each time the selected word or phrase is used in the page content. 
Seeing a keyword’s distribution at a glance like this can help you distrib-
ute it evenly throughout your page.
 
✦ Synonym search (www.google.com): Search using a tilde (~) character 
in front of one or more of your words, and Google displays those search 
terms and their synonyms, commonly associated and related words in bold 
on the results page. This can be an excellent way to discover additional 
words you can optimize for on your Web page.

Competitive analysis tools
It’s a competitive world, and ranking well has everything to do with what 
your keyword competitors are doing. The optimal keyword density, fre-
quency, and distribution are determined by analyzing the top-ranked sites. 
The search engines are clearly accepting the keyword density, frequency, 
and distribution of the top sites, so being better than these competitors is 
often simply a matter of careful page editing:
 
✦ Page Analyzer: You can run Page Analyzer on the top-ranked Web pages 
to analyze their keywords and page content, as well as using it on your 
own Web site.
 
✦ Multi-Page Analyzer (www.seotoolset.com): This is a paid tool, 
available through our SEOToolSet, which looks at multiple competi-
tors’ Web pages and analyzes them in one fell swoop for you. There 
are many similar products available online, so check your existing 
SEO tools subscription to see if you already have access to a similar 
report. You can do the comparisons by hand (see Book III, Chapter 2 
for instructions), but a tool like this one saves you time.

I
n this chapter, you find out how to avoid having duplicate content on 
your own Web site and why that’s important. We also explain how your 
content can become duplicated (copied) on other Web sites and the variety 
of causes for it, ranging from accidental to downright malicious. Because 
you want to protect your original Web site content and prevent duplication 
as much as possible, we list all of the various sources of duplicate content 
and give you some recommendations for how to deal with each type of 
situation.
There aren’t many hard and fast rules in search engine optimization (SEO), 
so when we get to state one, we like to do it with gusto:
 
You must avoid duplicate content at all times.
Duplicate content refers to text that is repeated on more than one Web 
page either on your site or on other sites. When a search engine’s indexing 
process (the software that crawls the Web, reading and indexing Web site 
content into a searchable database) detects that a page on your Web site 
is a copy of another page on your site or anywhere else on the Internet, the 
spider tries to make a determination of which page is the original, true ver-
sion, and it may or may not be accurate. Although there is no penalty for 
duplicate content, the filtering of duplicate content could hurt your rank-
ing in other ways. The perceived original page can be included in search 
results, but the other page won’t make the cut. It’s not that the copycat 
page is penalized in the search engine’s index (the searchable database of 
Web site content). The search engines filter it out of search results pages 
because they don’t want to give users redundant listings, and other Web 
sites link indiscriminately to whichever form of the duplicate content they 
like best, which dilutes your link equity. Therefore, having duplicate content 
can be a bad thing for your search engine rankings.

and How to Resolve Them
Content can become duplicated either intentionally or by accident. There’s 
a saying that “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” Well, you can do 
without this kind of flattery when it comes to your Web site. Whatever the 
copycat’s motivation is, you don’t want people copying your original content 
if you can help it.
There are two basic types of duplicate content:
 
✦ Outside-your-domain duplicate content. This type happens when two 
different Web sites have the same text (like we’ve been talking about 
so far).
 
✦ Within-your-domain duplicate content. This second type refers to Web 
sites that create duplicate content within their own domain (the root of 
the site’s unique URL, such as www.domain.com).
Sites can end up having within-your-domain duplicate content due to their 
own faulty internal linking procedures, and often Webmasters don’t even 
realize they have a problem. (We explain some of these in the next few sec-
tions.) If two or more pages within your own site duplicate each other, you 
inadvertently diminish the ability for one or the other being included in 
search results. In some cases, an unknowing Webmaster causes half or more 
of a site’s pages to be completely ignored by the search engines because of 
duplicate content issues.
You can end up with duplicate content within your own site for a variety 
of reasons, such as having multiple URLs all containing the same content; 
printer-friendly pages; pages that get built on the fly with session IDs in 
the URL; using or providing syndicated content; problems caused by using 
localization, minor content variations, or an unfriendly content management 
system; and archives.
Multiple URLs with the same content
Even with sites under your own control, you may have duplicate content 
resulting from any of the following sources:
 
✦ Similar pages in the same Web site (www.yourdomain.com)
 
✦ Similar pages in different domains that you own (www.yourdomain.
com and www.yourotherdomain.com)
 
✦ Similar pages in your www. prefixed site and the non-www version 
(www.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com)

Sources of Duplicate Content and How to Resolve Them
When search engines find two pages with nearly the same content, they 
may include both pages in their index. However, they only take one of these 
pages into consideration for search results. The search engines do this 
because they want to show users a variety of listings — not several that 
are the same. To make the entire body of your Web site count, you want to 
ensure that each of your Web pages is unique.
But here’s the rub: the search engines may consider two pages the same 
even if only part of the page is duplicated. Just the headings, the first para-
graph, the Title tag, or any other portion being the same can trigger “dupli-
cate” status. For instance, if you use the same Title tag on multiple pages, 
the search engines might see them as duplicate pages just because they 
share that single, but important, line of HTML code.
 
To avoid issues with duplicate content, you always need to write unique 
headings, tags, and content for each page in your Web site.
Finding out how many duplicates the 
search engine thinks you have
A good place to start looking at duplicate content is to find out how many of 
your Web pages are currently indexed, versus how many the search engines 
consider to be duplicates. Here’s how:
 
1. At Google, type [site:domain.com] in the search box (leaving out the 
square brackets and using your domain), and then click Search.
 
2. When the results page comes up, scroll to the bottom and click the 
highest page number that shows (usually 10).
 
 Doing this can cause the total number of pages to recalculate at the top 
of the page.
 
3. Notice the total number of pages shown in “Results 1 - 10 of about 
###” at the top of the page.
 
 The “of about ###” number represents the approximate total number of 
indexed pages in the site.
 
4. Now navigate to the very last page of the results.
 
 The count shown there represents the filtered results. The difference 
between these two numbers most likely represents the number of 
duplicates.
 
For performance reasons, Google doesn’t display all of the indexed pages 
and omits the ones that seem most like duplicates. If you truly want to see 
all of the indexed listings for a site, you can navigate to the very last results 
page of your [site:] query and click the option to Repeat the Search with the 
Omitted Results Included. (Even then, Google only shows up to a maximum 
of 1,000 listings.)

Avoiding duplicate content on your own site
When it comes to cleaning up duplicate pages on your own Web site, which 
you have control over, after all, don’t spend time wondering, “How similar 
can they be?” Just make the content different. Stick with the best practice 
of having unique, original content throughout your site. Stay away from the 
edges of what might be all right with the search engines and play within the 
safe harbor.
 
To keep your site in the safe harbor, here are some ways you can avoid or 
remove duplicate content from within your own Web site:
 
✦ Title, Description, Keywords tags: Make sure that every page has a 
unique Title tag, Meta description tag, and Meta keywords Meta tag in 
the HTML code.
 
✦ Heading tags: Make sure the heading tags (labeled H#) within the body 
copy differ from other pages’ headings. Keeping in mind that your 
headings should all use meaningful, non-generic words makes this a bit 
easier.
 
✦ Repeated text, such as a slogan: If you have to show a repeated sen-
tence or paragraph throughout your site, such as a company slogan, you 
should consider putting the slogan into an image on most pages. Pick 
the one Web page that you think should rank for that repeated content 
and leave it as text on that page so that the search engines can spider 
it. If anyone tries to search for that content, the search engines can find 
that unique content on the page you selected.
 
 For example, if your classic car customization Web site has the slogan, 
“We restore the rumble to your classic car,” you probably want to 
display that throughout your site. But you should prevent the search 
engines from seeing the repetition. Leave it as HTML text on just one 
page, like your home page or the About Us page. Then everywhere else, 
just create a nifty graphic that lets users see the slogan, but not search 
engines.
 
✦ Site map: Be sure that your site map (a page containing links to the 
pages in your site, like a table of contents) includes links to your pre-
ferred page’s URL, in cases where you have similar versions. The site 
map helps the search engines understand which page is your canonical 
(best or original) version. Matt Cutts, head of Google’s Web Spam team, 
defines canonicalization as “the process of picking the best URL when 
there are several choices.” The canonical URL is the one that is chosen 
at the end of the process, with all others being considered duplicates 
(non-canonical.)

✦ Consolidate similar pages: If you have whole pages that contain similar 
or identical text, decide which one you want to be the canonical page for 
that content. Then combine pages and edit the content as needed. 
 
 If you do need to consolidate pages to a single, canonical page, a few 
precautions are in order (see the upcoming numbered step list for 
details). You don’t want to accidentally wipe out any link equity you may 
have accumulated. Link equity refers to the perceived-expertise value 
of all the inbound links pointing to your Web page. You also don’t want 
to cause people’s links and bookmarks suddenly to break if they try to 
open your old page.
 
When consolidating two pages to make one your main, canonical version, 
take these precautions:
 
1. Check for inbound links.
 
 Do a [link:domain.com/yourpage.html] search in Google or use the back-
link checker in Yahoo Site Explorer to find out who’s already linked to 
your page. If one version has 15 links and the other version has 4,000, 
you know which one to keep: the one that 4,000 people access.
 
2. Update your internal links.
 
 Make sure that your site map and all other pages in your site no longer 
link to the page you decided to remove.
 
3. Set up a 301 redirect.
 
 When you take down the removed page’s content, put in its place a 301 
redirect, which is a type of HTML command that automatically reroutes 
any incoming link to the URL with the content that you want to retain. 
(Note: For help on this, see Book VII, Chapter 4.)
Avoiding duplications between 
your different domains
Most Web sites today operate both the domain that begins with www. and 
the domain without this prefix (such as www.yourdomain.com and your
domain.com). You do not want to duplicate your site content between these 
two domains. Instead, set up a 301 redirect from one root domain to the 
other and keep only one set of your Web documents in production. (Note: 
It doesn’t matter whether you redirect the www or the non-www version, 
although it may be more common to make the www. version the main site.) 
Users coming to either URL can get to the same content.
If you own multiple domains with the same content, you can solve the prob-
lem of duplicate content with the same technique. Decide which domain you 
want to rank well for your keywords and redirect the other domains to that 
one. Or if you truly need separate sites with duplicate content, know that 

346
Sources of Duplicate Content and How to Resolve Them
you’re going to pay a price when the search engines pick one page version 
that they decide is the authoritative one and ignore your others. (You can 
learn technical solutions to get around some of these issues, as well. See 
Book VII for more details.)
Printer-friendly pages
A common practice that inadvertently creates duplicate content within a 
Web site involves printer-friendly pages. Printer-friendly pages are separate 
pages designed for printing, without the heavy images and advertisements 
that eat up a lot of printer ink. Recipe sites are notorious for these, but many 
sites offer both an HTML version and a text-only version of each page so that 
their users can easily print them. The printer-friendly page has its own URL, 
so it’s actually a twin of the HTML page.
 
You don’t need to have separate text-only pages for printing. The best way 
to allow easy printing, keep your users happy, and follow SEO best practices 
is to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, an efficient way to control the look of 
your site by defining styles in one place). A print style sheet within your CSS 
can reformat your HTML pages on-the-fly so that they can be easily printed. 
Inside your CSS file, you can specify how a page should automatically change 
when a user chooses to print it. Your CSS can control print formatting such 
as page width, margins, font substitutions, and which images to print and 
which to omit. Creating a print style sheet within your CSS file is a much 
more elegant solution than duplicating your pages with printer-friendly 
versions.
If you do not want to use CSS for printable pages, you have to find ways to 
avoid several problems if you have twin versions of each content page, one 
for viewing and one for printing:
 
✦ Link equity gets reduced. This problem is common to all forms of 
duplicate content. People are going to link to both versions, so the link 
equity value for your content is effectively split between the two pages. 
Because link equity helps search engines determine how much author-
ity a Web page has for a relevant search query, a diminished link equity 
value means your page won’t rank as well in search results.
 
✦ If you decide to consolidate the pages down the line, inbound links 
could break. Because people are going to link to both versions, when 
you’re ready to do away with printer-friendly pages, existing links may 
break. (Note: You want to create 301 redirects for those pages, which 
would fix the links, but would cost you some initial work and ongoing 
vigilance to keep those codes in place forever.)
 
✦ Double the maintenance is a hassle. If you have printer-friendly dupli-
cate pages on your site, you already know that anytime you want to 
make a change to one, you have to remember to make the same change 
on the other. (We thought we’d mention that this is a pain, in case you 
didn’t know already.)

Chapter 4

Sources of Duplicate Content and How to Resolve Them
 
✦ Search engines pick just one page. Having two versions of a page on 
your site forces the search engines to pick the one they think is the origi-
nal and filter out the other one from their search results. And because 
the text-only version is probably much easier to spider than your beauti-
ful HTML version, they may choose the printer-friendly page particularly 
if your printer friendly page has received more backlinks than your 
HTML version. So basically, you lose control over which version greets 
first-time visitors coming from a search results page.
If you currently have printer-friendly versions of your pages as separate 
URLs, we suggest you convert to a print style sheet in an external CSS file. 
You won’t need the Printer Friendly Version hyperlinks on your pages 
anymore (unless you want to leave them for usability, maybe changing the 
wording) because whenever a user prints a page using File➪Print or Ctrl+P, 
your CSS automatically takes charge and delivers a printable version.
 
When getting rid of printer-friendly pages you no longer need, be careful. 
Check for inbound links, update any internal links you may have to those 
pages, and set up a 301 redirect on the removed page. You want to make 
sure not to hurt your link equity or cause your users any problems when 
you remove a page.
If you decide you still want to keep your printer-friendly text versions, cir-
cumvent the duplicate content problem by putting a noindex command in 
the HTML code to prevent search engines from crawling these pages. You’d 
probably lose some links, but at least the search engines wouldn’t confuse 
these pages with your main content.
Dynamic pages with session IDs
Many Web sites track the user’s session — the current time period the user 
is active on the Web site since logging on. Sometimes these sites add a ses-
sion ID code to each page’s URL as the user travels the site. This is a really 
bad way to handle passing a session ID from page to page because it cre-
ates what looks like duplicate content. Even though the page itself has not 
changed, the varying parameters showing at the end of each URL causes 
search engines to think they are separate pages. 
In fact, you don’t want to put any type of variables directly into your URL 
strings except for ones that actually correspond with changed page con-
tent. You need unique content for every URL. If your site passes session IDs 
through the URL string, here are two ways to fix it:
 
✦ Stop appending session IDs. Ideally, you should correct your Content 
Management System (CMS) or server application so that it no longer 
creates URLs with session IDs. Use cookies (small bits of code that the 
server assigns to a user’s browser that tracks the user from page to 
page) instead to serve pages.

348
Sources of Duplicate Content and How to Resolve Them
 
✦ Show spiders friendly URLs. This is a more advanced solution, but 
you could consider using “user agent sniffing” to detect search engine 
spiders. If the page detects it’s a search engine spider, it could deliver 
parameter-free URLs to them. This sniffing is invisible to the spider and, 
with a 301 on the old URL pointing to the rewritten URL, the spiders 
have a URL that they can index. 
 
 It’s very important to deliver exactly the same content to a search engine 
as to a user; delivering different content would be considered spam.
Content syndication
Content syndication simply means sending out your Web site content to 
others. The big upside of syndicating your content is having more people 
read your stuff, which in turn can lead to increased traffic coming back to 
your Web site. The potential downside of syndication is duplicating your 
content. In essence, you are trading potential search engine ranking for 
direct links and the traffic that your feed brings in.
An RSS feed is a typical example of content syndication. RSS is a method of 
distributing links to new content in your Web site, and the recipients are 
people who’ve subscribed to your RSS feed. Even though your RSS feed 
sends out lots of copies of the same text, you can avoid a duplicate content 
problem by only sending out a snippet of your article, not the whole thing. 
(You can read more details on RSS in Book VI, Chapter 2.)
 
Then there is the problem of press releases. Press releases are posted on 
wire services for the express purpose of being picked up and duplicated on 
as many sites as possible. If your company puts out press releases, don’t 
stop. Even though they do become duplicate content that may not bring any 
unique ranking to your Web site, they may generate traffic and backlinks. 
You distribute a press release for other reasons than search engine ranking, 
like branding, public relations, investor relations, and so on. These are legiti-
mate goals, too.
You might also use more traditional ways of syndicating your content, 
where you create the content and receive a fee from other sites who want 
to use it. For example, newspaper artists draw their cartoons and then use 
a syndicate to make them available to any news organization that cares to 
run them, in exchange for a fee. However, if you syndicate your Web site 
content, you are very likely to run into duplicate content problems. If an 
expert-level Web site takes your content, chances are they’ll become the 
canonical source for that information. For instance, if a big city news organi-
zation decides to fill one of its columns with your articles, chances are that 
the search engines will determine that the news site takes precedence over 
yours (because it’s the 800-pound gorilla), and they would outrank you for 

Book V
Chapter 4
Dealing with 
Duplicate Content
349
Sources of Duplicate Content and How to Resolve Them
that content if someone searched for it. If the sites are equal in every other 
way, however, the search engines look through their indexes to determine 
the original, or earliest, source of the content, and filter out the copies that 
came later as duplicates.
Localization
Many Web sites repurpose the same content for various locations. For exam-
ple, a large real estate company with brokerage offices through the state 
may offer the same template to all of their brokers, customized only with a 
different city name and local property listings. Or a national cosmetics com-
pany gives local representatives their “own” sites, but all of them have the 
same standard template and content.
For local searching, a site like one of these may do all right. For instance, 
if you search [real estate listings Poughkeepsie], you will probably find bro-
kerage sites that are located in Poughkeepsie, including the ones built with 
the same template and duplicated content. However, if the Poughkeepsie 
broker himself would like to rank for a broader search query like [New York 
properties,] he’s probably out of luck. His Web site won’t have enough 
unique content about that keyword phrase to rank in the search results. 
Doing a quick find and replace with a keyword to create “new” targeted 
pages (like changing Poughkeepsie to Albany) is not enough to create unique 
content and is in fact considered spam by the search engines. You must 
have unique content on unique pages in order to survive and thrive in the 
search engines.
 
You can use a template to create many Web sites, but here’s how to do it 
without creating duplicate content. You need to do more than just a Find 
and Replace for a few terms. Customize the content for each location, includ-
ing the headings, Title tags, Meta tags, body content, and so on. Unless 
you’re located in a highly competitive demographic market area such as 
Chicago or New York City, your template-based site may be sufficient if 
you’re only after local search business.
If you want to rank for non-local search queries, you absolutely need to 
customize your site content and make it unique. Depending on what kind of 
traffic you hope to attract through the search engines, you probably need 
to make changes to your content focused on improving both the quality and 
quantity.
Mirrors
On the Web, a mirror refers to a full copy of a Web page or site. The mir-
rored version is an exact replica of the original page. Yes, this is blatantly 
duplicate content, but there are a couple of legitimate reasons to mirror a 
Web page.

350
Sources of Duplicate Content and How to Resolve Them
One reason to mirror a Web page is user convenience, such as when mul-
tiple Web sites offer copies of a download file so that users can access it at 
each location. Another legitimate reason is to display a backup version of 
a page that’s temporarily down. For example, a site called Slashdot (www.
slashdot.org) posts reviews of tech-related articles with a link to view the 
full article on the original site. In its heyday, Slashdot was so popular that 
whenever they posted a new review, many thousands of people would try 
to follow the article link at once, instantly crashing more than one unsus-
pecting site server under this sudden flood of traffic (this was called “the 
Slashdot effect”). To solve the problem, Slashdot began setting up a mir-
rored version of each new article on its own server, redirecting its users to 
the mirrored version only if the original site was unavailable. The mirror 
page’s content is counted toward the original URL because it is a temporary 
redirect. 
 
Mirroring should never be done deceptively. Hackers and pornography sites 
are notorious for mirroring sites, having content in 20, 30, 40, or more loca-
tions because of how frequently their sites are discovered and taken down. 
You want to ensure that search engines consider you a legitimate company 
with original content. Unless you have a need to put up a temporary page 
such as the ones mentioned above, try to avoid using mirrors on the Web.
CMS duplication
Many sites use a content management system (CMS), which is a software 
program that helps create and maintain Web pages. Some CMSs, however, 
have a problem: They generate duplicate content. It’s just the way they’re 
programmed. Or is it?
Your CMS should allow you to customize all parts of your Web pages, from 
the body text to the Title tags to the anchor text of links. If your CMS cur-
rently doesn’t allow this, talk to your IT department and ask them to revise 
the settings. If that doesn’t work, we recommend scrapping your inflexible 
system and starting over with a CMS that allows you to make these changes. 
Seriously, it’s that important.
According to a September 2008 Google Webmaster Blog post, most site 
owners who ask about duplicate content are worried about issues like 
having multiple URLs on the same domain point to the same content. This is 
a situation that many CMSs create naturally. The example given in the blog 
post was
www.example.com/skates.asp?color=black&brand=riedell 
and
www.example.com/skates.asp?brand=riedell&color=black

Book V
Chapter 4
Dealing with 
Duplicate Content
351
Intentional Spam
Both of these URLs bring up the same Web page, but they’re different URLs 
because the CMS put the parameters for color and brand in a different order.
If that example looks like your site, you should realize that this can be 
prevented. Your CMS needs to facilitate ordering logic that controls the 
sequence of parameters in URLs. Where the page content remains unique, 
there should be no change to the URL.
Similarly, if your Web site lets users navigate to a page from various catego-
ries, be sure that there’s only one copy of each file, not multiple copies. For 
instance, an e-commerce site selling ladies shoes might have separate navi-
gation choices for dress, casual, sandals, pumps, open-toe, closed-toe, and 
so forth. One shoe could fall into many different categories, but no matter 
how the user navigates to find it, that unique shoe should have only one 
page at only one URL address.
Archives
After your Web site has been up for a while, you eventually need to trim 
some older content to keep the current information uncluttered. If the older 
pages are still useful, you can put them into an archive (storage area where 
older content is out of the way, but still accessible). Just be careful that your 
archive doesn’t create duplicate content problems with current informa-
tion on your site. (Without correction, duplicate content issues are almost 
always the case with blogging software and with news content.)
Keep one best practice in mind when you set up an archive: Do not change 
the archived page’s URL. It’s best to let pages stay in their original locations 
when you set up an archive, so that the URL stays golden through time. If 
you must change a URL, remember to do a 301 redirect to the new name.
Active blog sites tend to need archiving sooner than other content pages 
because they fill up with text and comments so quickly. Blog software pro-
grams generally include prior posts at the bottom of new posts and create 
copies of blog posts for appropriate categories or time periods, so duplicate 
content is sort of built-in. They also automatically move older posts into 
archive directories. If your blog is updated regularly and actively com-
mented on, you don’t really have to worry about this because the search 
engines are used to seeing this behavior. However, if you don’t publish a lot 
of new content to your blog, the search engines filter out pages that seem to 
duplicate each other.
Intentional Spam
Now we want to address the more serious issue of people taking your con-
tent on purpose. If you’ve got loads of useful and engaging information, there 
is a good chance that someday it will wind up being intentionally copied and 

352
Intentional Spam
republished on someone else’s site. This kind of duplicate content happens 
frequently, and it can damage your site’s reputation and authority with the 
search engines.
 
There is no excuse for taking someone else’s page intact, adding a different 
façade, making a few top-of-page cosmetic changes, and then uploading it to 
another site. Sometimes it even still contains the original displayed text and 
links! Unfortunately, there is no fool-proof defense against someone taking 
your content from the Web.
 
To deter others from copying your content, we recommend that you display 
a copyright notice on your Web site and register for a federal copyright. 
These two proactive steps can help you defend your Web site against inten-
tional spam. It’s a good idea for you to register for a federal copyright of 
your Web site as software. This is a low-cost and important step in your anti-
theft effort. Even though all content carries copyright naturally, you want to 
actually file for a copyright registration because only a federal copyright has 
enough teeth in it to help you fight violations of your copyrights legally, if it 
ever comes down to that. (See Chapter 5 of this minibook for instructions on 
how to go about filing for a federal copyright.)
 
With a federal copyright on file, you have legal recourse if things get ugly. 
You also carry a lot more weight when you tell people your work is copy-
righted with the U.S. government and then ask them to remove it from their 
site. The federal copyright can be enforced throughout the U.S. and interna-
tionally, so it has some real teeth in it. 
In the next few sections, we list different types of intentional spam, with tips 
for what you can do to protect your Web site.
Scrapers
Scrapers are people who send a robot to your Web site to copy (or “scrape”) 
the entire site and then republish it as their own. Sometimes they don’t even 
bother to replace your company name throughout the content. Scraping a 
site is a copyright violation, but it’s also more than that: It is theft, and, if the 
content is protected by a federal copyright, the thief can be sued in federal 
court.
 
If your Web site has been scraped, you need to decide what your objective 
is. Will you be satisfied simply to get the content pulled down? Or do you 
feel that the other party’s actions are so serious and malicious that you want 
to sue for damages? You need to decide how much money and effort you’re 
willing to spend, and what outcome you’re really after.

Dealing with 
Duplicate Content
353
Intentional Spam
If your site is scraped, your first step can be a simple e-mail requesting that 
the site stop using your content. Often this is enough to get it removed. 
You can also report them to the search engines or the ISP (Internet Service 
Provider) that hosts their site domain. If you notify them that the site has 
been scraped and provide some proof, they may shut the site down.
 
Because scraping is a crime, you may choose to file a police report for theft. 
You should have printouts and other evidence that the text is yours and that 
it has been stolen to back you up. You can even hire a lawyer and serve 
them a cease and desist order, demanding that they take down the offending 
Web pages or face legal action. As a last resort, you can file a lawsuit and 
fight it out in court.
Clueless newbies
Clueless newbies are what we call people who take someone else’s Web site 
content but don’t realize they’ve done anything wrong. They may be under 
the mistaken impression that everything on the Internet is fair game and free 
for the taking. They may not realize that intellectual property laws apply to 
the Internet just as they do everywhere else.
If your content has been stolen by a clueless newbie, we suggest you e-mail 
them. Tell them that it’s copyrighted material and kindly ask them to take 
it down. If you’re feeling generous, as an alternative, you might suggest that 
they only include an excerpt or summary of your content, link to your site 
instead, and put a Meta robots “noindex” tag on their page so that the 
search engine spiders won’t crawl it. The newbie site owner may comply, 
and you have taught him or her a lesson in Internet etiquette. But even if 
they don’t comply, the duplicated page is probably a low risk to you. A new 
site generally doesn’t have much authority in the search engine’s eyes, so 
their site may not hurt your rankings. They have no right to your content for 
their own commercial use, however, so you don’t have to let them use it.
Stolen content
When you work hard to create unique, engaging content for your own Web 
site, it can be frustrating for you or even damaging to your search engine 
rankings when that content gets stolen and duplicated on some other site.
We suggest that you regularly check to see if your Web site content has 
been copied and used somewhere else. To check this, use the free service at 
Copyscape (www.copyscape.com/). Figure 4-1 shows how straightforward 
Copyscape is to use; you just type in your site’s URL. If the site has been 
scraped, you see the offending URL in the results.

Copyscape 
lets you 
find copies

Web site 
anywhere

Internet.
 
When your content is stolen, you may see it appearing everywhere. Like 
playing the Whack-A-Mole arcade game, you might succeed in getting one 
site to remove your stolen content, only to find it popping up on another.
If you’re in the Whack-A-Mole situation and lots of other sites now have 
your content, hopefully you have a federal copyright and can follow some 
of the recommendations we give earlier in this chapter. If you don’t have a 
federal copyright, you may have only one recourse: changing your content. 
It’s unfair, it’s a pain, but if you don’t have a registered copyright, you can’t 
do much to stop people from stealing your stuff. Being unique on the Web is 
more important to your search engine rankings than playing whack-a-mole 
trying to stop thieves from taking your content, so rewrite your own text to 
be different than theirs. Enforce your copyright when you find people rip-
ping you off, but don’t think that it will solve your problem.

I
f you’ve applied the ideas laid out in the previous chapters of this book, 
you are well on your way to a successful Web site. Your Web site hope-
fully contains lots of engaging content that your users love, with pages 
focused on your keywords (specific words or phrases entered in a search 
query) so that search engines can clearly establish your site’s subject 
relevance.
In this chapter, you find out how to ensure that your site turns up in local 
searches, which are search queries intended to find businesses based on a 
specific location. You can do things to make sure that your business comes 
up when someone looks for “car customization in Poughkeepsie,” for exam-
ple, and we’re going to tell you about them.
In the previous chapter, we covered the evils of duplicate content in many 
of its forms (site scraping, duplicate pages within the same domain, printer-
friendly pages, dynamic pages with session IDs in the URLs, content syndi-
cation, localization, mirrors, archives, spam, and stolen content). Now we 
want to provide the remedy. Here, you discover what to do if your content 
is stolen by some other Web site. By the time you finish reading this chap-
ter, you’ll be well-armed to deal with this inevitable problem.

356
Optimizing for Local Searches
We also explain how you can incorporate content from other sites, if you 
should ever want to do that. After an entire chapter on how to avoid creating 
duplicate content, we figured it’s time to balance the subject with informa-
tion on how to use content from another site the right way: Sometimes, as 
with news sites, you’ll need to do it.
Optimizing for Local Searches
The search engines logically interpret some types of search queries as local, 
or location-based, searches. For example, you might search for any of the 
following:
 
✦ [dog groomers]
 
✦ [dry cleaners]
 
✦ [chimney sweep services]
The search engines know that these search queries most likely mean you 
are looking for someone in your local area who can provide a service. If you 
live in Poughkeepsie, New York, it’s unlikely that you’d be looking for a dry 
cleaner in Miami. It’s also unlikely that you’re interested in dry cleaning 
techniques, or the history of dry cleaning, or any other research-type infor-
mation. Because the search engines want to satisfy you with relevant results 
(they want you to keep coming back to them), they’re going to assume your 
intent is to find a local business and give you a list of dry cleaners in and 
around Poughkeepsie.
 
The search engines know where you’re located. They have two ways of figur-
ing this out: First, while doing a search at some point, you might have specified 
a city. Second, your computer’s IP address (the numeric “Internet Protocol” 
code assigned to your computer) identifies your approximate location.
You can do local searches in three ways:
 
✦ Logical local searches: Sometimes search queries just logically bring up 
local businesses or services (like [dry cleaners], and so on).
 
✦ Geographic search terms: Search queries can include a city or ZIP code, 
such as [dry cleaners Miami], [dog groomers in Sacramento CA] or 
[chimney sweep services 90210].
 
✦ Map searches: People can search directly on a physical map (using a 
map interface) to find local businesses in a selected area.

Optimizing for Local Searches
 
Keep in mind that your own home location may not be the only city where 
you’d like your Web site to rank in local search results. For instance, if you 
do classic car customization nationwide, and you know that Detroit, 
Michigan has a huge concentration of classic car buffs, you could make sure 
your content is optimized to rank for a Detroit local search with your key-
words (search terms relevant to your Web site). We explain how to optimize 
for local searches in the next sections, but consider that there may be sev-
eral “local” areas that you want to optimize for, not just your own physical 
location.
Creating region-specific content
You need to let search engines know where you do business, so that your 
Web pages get returned in local searches. You need to adapt your content 
for localized searches. You shouldn’t just copy pages and use a Find and 
Replace command to substitute different city names on each. That approach 
creates duplicate content (a bad thing because it damages your site’s ability 
to rank well in search results for having unique and relevant information). It 
also doesn’t satisfy your users or the search engines that you really do busi-
ness in those locations.
To optimize your content for local searches:
 
✦ Show your physical address. If you have a brick-and-mortar location, 
be sure to include the address and local telephone number prominently 
somewhere on your Web site, preferably on the home page. Make sure 
that the page containing this information is linked from your site map, 
so that search engines can easily find it. (A site map is a page containing 
links to the pages in your site, like a table of contents.) Showing your 
address and contact information to users also makes them feel more 
comfortable doing business with you because you’re not just a virtual 
company being operated from some post office box.
 
✦ Mention your location. In your Web site text, mention the name(s) 
of the city or cities where you do business. It depends on your site 
structure and goals, but consider devoting specific pages to locations 
and then talking about what you do in that location throughout the 
text. So you might have one page about your classic car services in 
Poughkeepsie, another about Yonkers, and so on.
 
✦ Talk about things related to the location. Don’t just give the city name. 
Also mention geographic terms related to it, as you would naturally in 
conversation. For instance, if you’re establishing that you do business 
in Los Angeles on a given page, you could also include “Hollywood” or 
“sunny Southern California” in the text.

Optimizing for Local Searches
Maximizing local visibility
If you run a local search in Google, the first thing that displays are local busi-
ness listings pinpointed on a handy map, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Business 
listings 
display at 
the top of a 
local search 
results 
page.
 
To be included in these local listings, the business owners of these sites at 
some point completed a business listing form with Google. If you haven’t 
done this yet, take a little time now and register your business with the local 
directories for all the major search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft 
Live Search). For detailed instructions, see the “Showing Up in Local Search 
Results,” section in Book I, Chapter 4.
 
In addition to getting your business into the search engines’ local directo-
ries, you don’t want to miss being included in other online local directories. 
Do some research to find out what’s out there for your specific industry and 
region. For example, in our local area, there’s a weekly publication called 
The Kitty Letter that lists available rental properties. Smart real estate agents 
here make sure to include their rental listings in this local directory.
For your classic car customization Web site, that’s a national business, so 
you could research and become a member of various local clubs or directo-
ries for classic car enthusiasts. Try to find out what kinds of publications or 
Web sites serve specific market areas and have your business listed in them.

Factoring in Intellectual Property Considerations
To find these types of sites, simply enter search queries into the search 
engines that include specific locations, such as [classic car directory New 
York], [classic car clubs Detroit], and so on.
Your goal is to be visible not just for the big keyword searches. You also 
want to be found by the people who are looking for you in their own home-
towns. Your site accomplishes this when you make it visible on a local level.
Factoring in Intellectual Property Considerations
Not everyone realizes that Web sites are the intellectual property of their 
owners. Your Web site content is your intellectual property, just as much as 
a book is the intellectual property of its author and publisher. And as intel-
lectual property, your Web site is governed by copyright laws that protect it, 
especially if you’ve obtained a federal copyright (we get to that shortly).
Nevertheless, Web site content is often stolen and republished. If you’ve cre-
ated lots of great content for your site, we almost guarantee that sometime, 
somewhere, you’ll see your content pop up on someone else’s site. It’s inevi-
table. 
 
This book is not intended to replace legal advice. You should seek a copy-
right lawyer in order to get the full picture regarding your legal rights and 
options.
What to do when your content is stolen
How can you respond when your Web site content is copied and posted on 
some other Web site? There are a number of things you can do if your con-
tent or entire site is stolen:
 
✦ E-mail a request: A good first step can be a simple e-mail request to the 
site’s Webmaster or contact person. Ask nicely for them to stop using 
your content. Often, this is enough to get it removed.
 
✦ Report it to the search engines: You can file a report of copyright 
infringement with the search engines to have the offending Web pages 
removed from their index. This procedure is allowed under the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act. For instructions, see www.google.com/
dmca.html.
 
✦ Report it to their ISP: You can also find out which Internet Service 
Provider (ISP) is hosting their site and contact the ISP. If you notify them 
that the site has been scraped and provide some proof, they may shut 
the site down. (You can use the WHOIS Lookup at www.whois.net 
to identify information about a site’s registered owners, including the 
domain servers that host the site, which is the same as the ISP.)

360
Factoring in Intellectual Property Considerations
 
✦ File a police report: Because theft is a crime, you can file a report with 
your local police or sheriff’s department. You should have undisputed 
evidence that the text is yours and that it has been stolen. Print the 
offending page as displayed, and then print the HTML code for that page 
so that you have it. Call a friend to have them witness the theft, as well. 
See if their site contains a references or clients page. If so, write down 
the names and URL of these sites so that you can notify them of the theft 
a little later. You might also run a search to discover the list of sites that 
link to the offending pages ([link:offendingdomain.com]), and later send 
them all e-mails informing them of inadvertently supporting a scraped 
site and inviting them to link to the “source” of the content instead.
 
✦ Send a cease and desist order: You can have a lawyer draft a cease and 
desist order, demanding that they take down the offending Web pages or 
face legal action. The downsides with this approach are that it’s costly 
and it gives the other party advance warning if you plan to file a lawsuit 
later. So before you do this, be sure to put together all the evidence rec-
ommended in the last paragraph.
 
✦ File a lawsuit: In serious cases where your business has been materially 
damaged, you can hire a lawyer and sue the other party. But make sure 
you have lots of evidence. Follow the recommended ideas for evidence 
gathering under the previous “File a police report” bullet.
 
The preceding list is not meant to be a step-by-step procedure. You can pick 
and choose from these suggestions based on your situation. But remember 
that you have options in case someone does steal your content.
Filing for copyright
To protect your Web site content, we recommend that you do two things:
 
✦ Display a copyright notice on your Web site.
 
✦ Register for a federal copyright.
These are two proactive, low-cost steps that can help you defend your Web 
site against theft. When you’ve registered for a federal copyright of your 
Web site as software, you have legal recourse if things get ugly. Only a fed-
eral copyright has enough teeth in it to help you fight violations of your 
copyrights legally. Your words also carry a lot more weight when you tell 
people your work is copyrighted with the U.S. government when you are 
asking them to remove your content from their site. The federal copyright 
can be enforced throughout the U.S. and internationally, so it has some real 
teeth in it.

Factoring in Intellectual Property Considerations
The U.S. Library of Congress manages the U.S. Copyright Office. The U.S. 
Copyright Office considers Internet pages to be software programs. To have 
a copyright simply requires that the work contain a valid copyright notice as 
follows: © year author name (such as © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Registering a copyright is not mandatory, but this is a time-proven effective 
step. After you register your site, the copyright stays in effect. Unless you 
completely replace your site with a new one, as “software,” your future Web 
site updates continue to be protected by your initial registration.
 
To register, you should refer to the filing procedures required by the U.S. 
Copyright Office. Registering a copyright is not mandatory, but it is a reason-
able step. You can handle the registration online — see their Web site at 
www.copyright.gov/.
On an international level, the U.S. government became a member of the 
Berne Convention in 1989 and fully supports the Universal Copyright 
Convention. Under this Convention, any work of an author who is a national 
of a Convention country automatically receives protection in all countries 
that are also members, provided the work makes use of a proper copyright 
symbol (©). The degree of protection may vary, but some minimal protec-
tion is defined and guaranteed in that agreement. Jurisdiction for prosecut-
ing violations lies exclusively with the federal government.
Using content from other sites
Now, what if you want to use other people’s content on your site? Perhaps 
you’ve seen a chart or image online that is relevant, useful, and perfect for 
your site users; or maybe you read an article in a magazine that says exactly 
what you want to tell your users. You also realize that reusing something 
that’s already written is undoubtedly the fastest way to add bulk to your 
site. So you believe your site simply must have these things. Can you — 
should you — use them?
 
Be careful! You don’t want to have duplicate content on your site, because 
that won’t help and could even harm your site rankings. You also don’t want 
to be deceptive and make it look as if it’s your original creation. Deceiving 
your users or the search engines usually backfires (your pages could be fil-
tered out of search results, you could damage your reputation with custom-
ers, and so on).
But say that you’ve found something you know would add tremendous value 
for your users. Here are some best practices for the times you need to use 
external content on your Web site:

362
Factoring in Intellectual Property Considerations
 
✦ Read the site. Often sites will have a copyright or legal page that details 
their use permissions. Starting with the legal page gives you guidelines 
on what you’ll be able to reasonably expect to be allowed to use.
 
✦ Get permission. If you want to republish something you saw on some-
one else’s site, ask for permission. It won’t work with every Web site 
owner, but it’s still a good idea. When you make your request, be sure to 
say you’ll give a link back to their site and give them credit.
 
✦ Do not use the whole thing. Whether it’s a full article, a full poem, a full 
page, or other, do not republish someone else’s content in its entirety 
(unless you have an agreement with the owner).
 
✦ Excerpt or summarize it. You can write a brief summary or review in 
your own words, rather than displaying the original text (give a link 
instead). Don’t use more than an excerpt if you’re posting the original 
words. For instance, if it’s a magazine article you wanted, you could 
write a review, rebuttal, or summary, and give a link to read the article 
on the original site. The most you should copy directly is a short excerpt 
in a quote.
 
✦ Set it apart with quotation marks or as a block quote. The idea is to 
make it clear to users that the excerpted text is quoted, not original to 
you. You can also make that clear to search engines by indenting the 
text with a Blockquote HTML tag.
 
Some people claim “fair use” when reusing other people’s content. The doc-
trine of fair use says that under some circumstances, it’s not a copyright vio-
lation to quote another’s work. This is a confusing part of copyright law, and 
the line between fair use and infringement is very fuzzy. One clear guideline 
is that you can’t use the borrowed content for profit in any way. If you have 
an ad or sell things anywhere on your site, it’s considered a “for profit” Web 
site. Basically, no business qualifies for fair use. In the area of copyright 
infringement, as in so many others, it’s best to keep your Web site in the safe 
harbor and follow the best practices listed here.
Crediting original authors
When you do use someone else’s content, give credit where credit is due. 
Attribute the work to its author or to the originating Web site. In addition 
to setting it apart with quotation marks or as a block quote, include a line 
that says something like: “Used by permission of . . .” or “Courtesy of . . .” 
or “Provided by . . .” and identify the name of the author. If you weren’t able 
to get permission, you still can mention where the information comes from. 
You may also want to include the cite attribute in a quote or blockquote tag. 
The cite attribute is used in the Quote Q and Blockquote tags to reference 
the source for material that originally appeared elsewhere.

The Q tag is used for short, inline quotes, such as
<P>According to a World Research Foundation article, <I><Q 
CITE=”http://www.wrf.org/news/news0017.htm”>In nine 
double-blind studies comparing placebos to aspirin, 
placebos proved to be 54 percent as effective as the 
actual analgesic</Q></I></P>
Note that you may want to include the quoted text in italics — as in the pre-
ceding example — or in quotes, since most browsers do not render the Q tag 
correctly by placing it in quotes or italicizing it.
The Blockquote tag is used for longer quotes, usually where an entire para-
graph or more is referenced. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE CITE=”http://www.wrf.org/news/news0017.htm “>
<P>I don’t believe that the use of placebos is immoral 
or unethical. In reality, it seems that the medical 
profession’s lack of understanding and utilization of the 
mechanism of the placebo in the healing process is tragic, 
shortsighted and cowardly. Cowardly in the aspect that 
it has been far easier for doctors to simply say that 
the placebo response is worthless, and nothing more than 
someone’s wishful thinking or trickery of the mind. The 
bottom line is the response; for whatever reason, placebos 
seem to work... patients get better.</P>
<P>An interesting statistic has shown that virtually all 
newly introduced surgical techniques show a decrease in 
success over time. Is this also a placebo response?</P></
BLOCKQUOTE>
Some browsers indent blockquote text on both the left and right side, 
but you should not count on this formatting to occur. Also note that 
Blockquote may contain block-level elements such as P (paragraphs) and 
Table (tables), but they may not be contained within inline elements (such 
as A, B, I, U, or Strong tags.
Also, be sure to link to the source. Give your users a link back to view the 
original article in context. This keeps your “borrowing” above board, boosts 
your credibility, and improves the users’ experience. Plus, by treating the 
originating author respectfully, you may just build a business relationship 
that yields long-term benefits.

I
n Book IV, Chapter 4, we briefly discuss siloing, which is a way of 
arranging your Web site according to themes that allows for prime 
search engine optimization. In this chapter, we go into the meat and bones 
of siloing.
Siloing your site is one of the most important things you can do for search 
engine optimization. It organizes your Web site so that a search engine (and 
a user) can get a good clear picture of who you are and what you’re about. 
A non-siloed site versus a siloed one is like the difference between having 
a bookshelf with books and DVDs and CDs and knickknacks all crammed 
into the same shelves versus a bookshelf with books on one shelf, CDs on 
another, DVDs on a third, and knickknacks on the fourth. It’s easier to figure 
out where things are on the organized bookshelf versus the messy bookshelf.
In this chapter, we discuss how to build categories and themes for yourself 
and how to incorporate those into your silos. We also discuss how to build 
those silos yourself and how to use link building.
Theming Your Site by Subject
You can do many things to your Web site to provide evidence of subject rel-
evance. One of these things is understanding what it means to theme a Web 
site. Theming is grouping Web site content in a manner that matches the 
way people search. One site can have many themes. Each theme can have 
sub-themes. In our classic car customization site, the main theme is custom-
izing classic cars; a sub-theme is restoration of classic Mustangs.

Theming Your Site by Subject
In order to rank for your keywords within Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft 
Live Search, your Web site has to provide information that is organized in 
clear language that the search engines can understand. When your informa-
tion has had all of its design and layout stripped away, is it still the most 
relevant information when compared to other sites? If so, you have a pretty 
good chance of achieving high rankings and in turn attracting users looking 
for those products and services. In order to do so, you have to be thinking 
about the following things:
 
✦ The subject themes your Web site is currently ranking for in the search 
engines.
 
✦ The subject themes your Web site can legitimately rank for. (False adver-
tising is always a bad idea.)
 
✦ How to go about properly implementing those subject themes.
As you may have seen throughout this book, we often explain the impor-
tance of creating silos for your subject themes by using the analogy that 
most Web sites are like a jar of marbles. Search engines can only decipher 
the meaning of a Web site when the subjects are clear and distinct. Take a 
look at the picture of the jar of marbles below in Figure 1-1 and think about 
how search engines would classify the theme(s) of the jar.
In the jar, you can see black marbles, gray marbles, and white marbles all 
mixed together with seemingly no order or emphasis. You can reasonably 
assume that search engines would classify the only theme as “marbles.”
If you then separate out each group of colored marbles into separate jars (or 
sites) as in Figure 1-2, they would be classified as a jar of black marbles, a jar 
of white marbles, and a jar of gray marbles. Now your site could rank for the 
narrow terms [black marbles,], [white marbles,] and [gray marbles,] but you 
would be lucky to rank for the generic term [marbles].
If you wanted to keep all three types of marbles together in a single jar (or 
Web site) and go after the very important generic term, you would go about 
creating distinct silos or categories within the jar (or site) that would allow 
the subject themes to be black marbles, white marbles, gray marbles, and 
finally the generic term [marbles,] as in Figure 1-3.
Most Web sites never clarify the main subjects they want their site to be rel-
evant for. Instead, they try to be all things to all people and wind up with a 
jumbled mess.

The goal for your site, if you want to rank for more than a single generic 
term, is to selectively decide what your site is and is not about. Rankings 
often are damaged in two major ways: by including irrelevant content, or by 
having too little content for a subject on a Web site.
So what subject themes are you currently ranking for?
The best places to start to identify what themes are your most relevant are 
your keyword research and the data from your Web site. You can start by 
examining the data from the following sources:
 
✦ Web analytics. (These are program routines embedded in your Web 
pages that are designed to track user behavior.)
 
✦ Pay-per-click (PPC) programs. (See Book X, Chapter 1 for more details 
on pay per click.) You can use PPC traffic to estimate whether a keyword 
is worth targeting in your SEO campaign.
 
✦ Tracked keyword phrases. All of the phrases you are tracking in your 
monitors are valuable sources of information when you apply competi-
tive research tactics (see Book III, Chapter 2 for mining themes.)
Each of these sources of information can provide the history of who visits 
the Web site and why. They won’t tell you why the site isn’t ranked for 
desired keywords directly, but they help you understand what keyword 
phrases your site currently ranks for organically and which visitors find 
your site relevant.

Web analytics evaluation
You have several ways to obtain the data or logs for the search engine 
spider history and the footprints of visitors to your site. First off, you may go 
right to the source and download the actual log files from your server using 
FTP. If your server comes with a free log file analyzer, you can use that, or 
you can use a program like Web Trends (www.webtrends.com/) or dozens 
of other desktop applications that help decipher Internet traffic data. Many 
businesses also use on-demand services that use cookies and JavaScript 
to pull live data on the patterns of search engines and visitors. These busi-
nesses do so through an online service like the exceptionally powerful 
Omniture (www.omniture.com/en/), ClickTracks (www.clicktracks.
com/), or Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics/), which is a 
free service. However you access the data history, you are looking for the 
search terms that brought users to your site. Book VIII focuses on Web 
analytics and guides you through many of your options.
PPC programs
You can also find clues to the words that your current site is relevant for by 
evaluating the words that you bid on with pay per click programs offered 
by all major search engines. Often, companies bid on words that they would 
like to be relevant for within the organic search arena, but that for one 
reason or another they have not yet achieved ranking success.
Tracked keyword phrases
The last and most accessible method of discovering your Web site’s most 
important subject themes is to find out which keyword phrases are cur-
rently the best ranked. What phrases are pulling people to your Web site? 
Running a keyword monitor, checking your Web analytics program reports 
and server logs, and using tools like the one found at the SeoDigger Web site 
(www.seodigger.com) are all ways to discover which queries are already 
bringing you traffic. Obviously these aren’t the only terms that you’ll want 
to focus on in your SEO campaign, but they are important to optimize for so 
that you don’t lose the traffic they’re already bringing you. Pair them with 
your new keyword list when you do your organization.
 
After you identify your keywords and implement them in your campaign, 
you want to continue to track them, paying close attention to which key-
words are bringing traffic and, of that traffic, what percentage of visitors 
are converting.
Keyword research
After creating a starter list of 10–100 keyword terms that appear to be most 
relevant to your company’s product or services, it’s time to begin keyword 
research. During the process of keyword research, the first goal is to grow 
that keyword list as large as possible. Cover as many relevant subjects that 

Book VI
Chapter 1
Employing Linking 
Strategies
373
Theming Your Site by Subject
can be remotely connected to the Web site’s subject themes as you can. 
Use Trellian’s Keyword Discovery tool (www.keyworddiscovery.com) or 
Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com) to identify keywords and synonyms 
that are related to the site’s subject matter. Another excellent tool is the 
Google Keyword Tool from Google AdWords (https://adwords.google.
com/select/KeywordToolExternal). Refer to Book II for the nitty-gritty 
on keyword research techniques.
After you answer the question of where the site currently ranks, you know 
two major factors: what you are ranked for and not ranked for in the search 
engines. The next challenge is to understand what subjects your site is legiti-
mately relevant to and why you are ranked as you are currently.
 
Many site owners get incensed that they are not better ranked for terms 
they feel they are relevant for. These owners feel that engines misjudge the 
value of their site. A poor mechanic always blames his tools. There are rare 
exceptions where the tools are at fault, but 99 percent of the time, the prob-
lem is that the site is not focused enough on its dominant topics. Owners try 
to cram in too many things at once, and the search engine has a hard time 
figuring out what the site actually is supposed to be about. Your task is to 
figure out what your site is about after stripping away all the visual hoo-has 
and getting down to the actual content.
Page Analyzer
A great place to begin is to run Page Analyzer within the SEOToolSet. (Non-
toolset subscribers can use the tool on SEOToolSet.com on the Free SEO 
Tools page — www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html.) Page 
Analyzer reveals the density, distribution, and frequency of keyword phrases 
used throughout the page (for more information on this subject, please see 
Book III, Chapter 2). By running the main pages of your site through this 
tool, you can begin to identify if the major themes are used throughout the 
titles, Meta tags, headings, Alt attributes, and body content. If your terms 
are absent, make a note that the keyword densities seem low. Evaluate how 
often a phrase is repeated in each major category element and take note of 
the commonly repeated phrases and infrequently repeated phrases. Are all 
the terms concentrated only near the top of the pages? If so, make a note 
that the distribution of the keywords could stand to be more spread out. 
Don’t bunch them all together.
Multiple Page Analyzer
SEOToolSet subscribers can use Multi-Page Analyzer to further help their 
siloing efforts. After evaluating, if the pages throughout your site contain 
keyword rich densities, compare your pages to that of the top 10 competi-
tors for your major keyword terms. Using Multi-Page Analyzer, you are given 
a report that summarizes why the competitors’ sites ranked highly and rec-
ommends how to adjust your own pages to have keyword densities similar 
to those of the top ranked sites.

Theming Your Site by Subject
Using search engine operators for discovery
The last test is to evaluate each major engine by using the following search 
index operators in Table 1-1. Take a moment to discover all the ways you 
can extract Google’s index data and then highlight two separate functions: 
the [site:domain.com] command and the [link:www.domain.com] command. 
In Google, the two most relevant measurements of rankings are how many 
pages a site has about a subject, and how many inbound links reference the 
site. Please note how the link: command requires the fully-qualified URL. The 
purpose of using these commands is to better understand the scope or size 
of competitive Web sites. Use these tools to research why the competition 
ranks, and create a graph that documents the contrast between your site 
and the competition. (For more on researching your competition, see Book 
III, Chapter 2.)

Implementing Clear Subject Themes
After you know what you are ranked for, what you’re considered to be 
relevant for, and hopefully have performed some analysis on the data you 
gathered so you can determine why your competition ranks the way they do, 
you’re still not done. For each keyword phrase you’ve identified, you need 
to make a decision: Is it worth the work to write dozens of pages of content 
to rank for a subject you don’t already rank for? To make this decision, 

376
Implementing Clear Subject Themes
consider whether your site is really about that theme, and whether adding 
more content about the subject could make your site become less relevant 
for more important terms. You do not want to dilute your site. You need to 
sit down and figure out whether you’re willing to make the commitment to 
establish a theme and do the work required.
 
There are many ways to establish a clear theme: Begin by visualizing the pri-
mary and secondary categories that you would prefer for your site. If you 
don’t have a clear idea of what the primary theme of your Web site is, search 
engines and users are going to be confused as well. You can start figuring 
out your primary theme by creating a simple outline. Think of this chart like 
a business’s organization chart, except for themes. Define the major theme 
or primary subject that you want to become relevant for and create an orga-
nization chart or linear outline to cement your ideas in place. Often, it’s not 
until you actually put pen to paper that major subject complications or con-
tradictions surface. Look at Figure 1-4 and note how one main topic is sup-
ported by several smaller subtopics.
 
Figure 1-4: 
A main topic 
is supported 
by

Nissan

Ford
CARS
Or you can use a simple bulleted list, like this:
 
✦ Major theme
 
• Subtopic 1
 
• Subtopic 2
 
• Subtopic 3
 
• Subtopic 4
Creating an organization flow chart is a third way to lay out your subject 
themes visually. The Organization Chart is an easily accessible tool that can 
be found within Microsoft Visio, or you can use another organization chart 
creation software program. Using one of these visual representations of your 
themes and subtopics (outline, bulleted list, or organization chart) provides 
the opportunity to visually explain to others involved in the Web site what 
the focus of the Web site should be and what subjects actually serve to dis-
tract the search engines from the main subjects.

377
Siloing
After completing this exercise, ask yourself what keyword phrases users 
actually type into the search engines when looking for this information. This 
helps in organizing your broad phrases for the large, traffic-heavy pages for 
your site, and the smaller, more specialized phrases that go on your sub-
pages.
Siloing
After you have your main themes and subtopics laid out on paper, you can 
match up your Web site content. You may have a good landing page (a page 
that users come to from clicking a search result or an outbound link from 
another site) for each main topic; if not, that’s going to be at the top of your 
list. Next, you want to make sure you have enough subtopic content, or sub-
pages, to support each main topic. You also want to make sure that every 
page’s content is focused on its particular theme. In other words, it’s time to 
start arranging your Web site into silos.
One way to visualize a silo is to think of a pyramid structure. Look at Figure 
1-5 and notice the top tier. That’s a landing page, which has the big broad 
terms you want to be ranking for. The pages underneath it are the support-
ing pages, which are the smaller subcategories you came up with to support 
the main term.
 
Figure 1-5: 
A silo looks 
a lot like a 
pyramid, 
in that the 
main topic 
is supported 
by the 
smaller 
subtopics.
 
Chevy
Tahoe
Corvette
Impala
CARS
The top page receives the most support (and hopefully the most traffic) 
because it’s the most relevant and focused page about its particular subject. 
Your site proves that it’s the most important by the way it’s structured, with 
supporting pages under the top page, and by the way you have your links set 
up. The way you set up your site should tell the search engines exactly what 
each page is about and which is the most important page for each keyword 
theme.

378
Doing Physical Siloing
 
There are two ways of doing siloing. One way is physical (or directory-based) 
siloing, which involves building the directory structure to reflect your site 
themes and constructing your links to follow the structure of your directory, 
where subpages in a directory are also subpages in for a particular theme. 
The other way is through virtual siloing, which establishes what your main 
subject themes are based entirely on links without the reinforcement of your 
directory structure.
Doing Physical Siloing
One way you can do your siloing is to link in the same pattern as your direc-
tory structure. (The directory structure refers to the folders where your Web 
site files physically reside and how they are arranged.) When you upload 
files to your site, you place them in a directory. A siloed directory structure 
has a top-level folder for each main topic, subfolders within each main-topic 
folder for its related subtopics, and individual pages inside (as shown in 
Figure 1-6). Linking then naturally follows this structure, effectively reinforc-
ing your directories through links.
 
Figure 1-6: 
A siloed file 
directory 
structure.
 
When building a directory structure, be sure not to go too deep. For exam-
ple, take a look at the URL of the page. The full address is the directory of 
where the page is. Observe:
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/mustang/index.html
The URL lets you know where the page is. Notice how the page named 
“index.html” is saved within the folder named “mustang,” which is a sub-
folder of the main directory “ford.” This page is only two levels deep in the 
site structure, which is good.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Employing Linking 
Strategies
379
Doing Physical Siloing
Too many levels of subdirectories can have the following negative effects:
 
✦ The more clicks it takes to get from the home page to the target page, 
the less important it is deemed by the search engines.
 
✦ Long directory paths make long URLs, and studies have proven that 
users avoid clicking long URLs on a search results page.
 
✦ Long URLs are more prone to typos. This can discourage deep linking or 
even cause broken links to your Web pages from other sites. Also, users 
can make mistakes typing in your URL.
 
So don’t get category-happy. Making your directory structure ten directories 
deep is bad, having five levels is bad, and even having three levels of subdi-
rectories is still not great. Although there’s no hard and fast rule, you should 
try to remain quite shallow: One or two level deep is usually sufficient. The 
closer the page is to the root of the directory, the more important your page 
looks to the search engine.
For example, your classic car Web site only has one main directory level 
(the car’s make) and two directory levels of subcategories (model and year). 
The directory could look something like this:
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/delrio/index.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/delrio/1957.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/delrio/1956.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/fairlane/index.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/fairlane/1958.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/fairlane/1959.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/mustang/index.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/mustang/1965.html
http://www.customclassics.com/ford/mustang/1966.html
Note how shallow the directory structure is: No page is more than three 
directory levels away from the root.
The other thing to keep in mind when working with physical siloing is the 
difference between absolute and relative linking. A fully qualified link pro-
vides the entire URL within the link, and a relative link is only linked to a file 
within the current directory. A fully qualified link looks like this:
<a href=”http://www.classiccars.com/ford/mustang/tireoptions.
html”>
A root-relative link looks like this:
<a href=”/ford/mustang/tireoptions.html”>
And a directory-relative link looks like this:
<a href=”tireoptions.html”>

380
Doing Virtual Siloing
When you use a relative link, it’s only going to work in relation to the current 
directory (or the next directory up, if you use slash characters relative to 
the root of the site). So a link to tireoptions.html works only if there’s a 
file called tireoptions.html for it to link to in the same directory as the 
file you are linking from.
With fully qualified linking, there is no confusion about where the file is 
located and what it is about. A fully qualified link has the added bonus of 
being very clear for the search engine to follow. Fully qualified links allow 
the search engine spider to have the full address when it follows a link and 
ensures that the pages being linked to can be found and indexed when the 
spider returns in the future. Using relative links, or links that are not fully 
qualified (with the http://www URL), can send the spider to a wrong place. 
Fully qualified links make links easier to maintain and ensure that the search 
engine spider can always follow them.
 
Whenever you move files, links need to be updated. Absolute links break 
absolutely if you rearrange folders, whereas if you picked up an entire sub-
directory and moved it somewhere else, relative links actually still work. The 
disadvantage of relative linking is not being able to see at a glance the com-
plete path where a file exists, which may make it tougher to maintain.
Doing Virtual Siloing
You may have your Web site directories currently set up in a non-siloed 
structure, with thousands of files and hundreds of folders already in place. 
Or, you may need to maintain a directory structure that does not reflect 
your site theme for some other reason. Never fear: As with most difficulties, 
there is a technical solution that can still enable you to silo your site and 
achieve better search engine optimization.
You can make the theme of your Web pages clear to the search engines even if 
you do not follow your directory structure so long as you connect your pages 
on the same theme through internal linking. This is called virtual siloing.
If you want to think about it in the simplest terms possible, the Internet is 
a series of Web pages connected by hyperlinks. A Web site is a part of the 
great Internet soup, being both a member of the whole vast network and an 
individual group of pages unique unto itself. What search engines attempt to 
do is collect information from individual sites into content groups: “This site 
means this, and that other site means that, and so forth.” They try to deter-
mine every site’s content and give it a category. Search engines award the 
Web sites that have the most complete subject relevance with high rankings 
for those keywords.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Employing Linking 
Strategies
381
Doing Virtual Siloing
The difference between physical siloing and virtual siloing is that in physi-
cal siloing, it’s about how you set up your directory structure and links. 
Virtual siloing is about setting up your links regardless of your directory 
structure. It’s achieved through the anchor text, the text that is hyperlinked 
that describes the actual link; the backlinks, the links going to your site from 
external sites; the external links, the links going out of your site; and internal 
linking, which are the links within your site.
Anchor text
The anchor text for a link tells the search engine what the page that’s being 
linked to is about. Clicking a link that says “tires” should take you to a page 
about tires. Because if the page is about tires, and the anchor text says 
it’s about tires, and any other links to that page all contain the word tires 
(or synonyms of tires), that creates a giant blinking neon arrow to tell the 
search engine that that particular page is about tires. Anchor text is the 
hyperlinked text that explains what the link is and what the page it is linking 
to is about. It sometimes helps to think of anchor text as your ability to vote 
for what keyword phrase the target page should rank for.
Backlinks
Inbound linking (also called backlinks) is perhaps the most well known and 
often discussed of the link structure elements in search engine optimization. 
These backlinks are the links that point into your site from an outside Web 
site. You might be saying to yourself, “Hold up, I can’t control what people 
say about me.” That is true, to an extent. However, having a page on your 
Web site instructing visitors how you prefer to be linked to or even offering 
an appropriate code snippet helps both you and the people you want to link 
to you. Supporters and people interested in spreading the word about you 
are likely to add mention of your site to their personal or even company Web 
site. Your Web site can suggest to these people what the most appropriate 
way to link back to your site might be. Many videos or links provide several 
different ways of linking back to themselves, or embedding themselves on 
a Web site. You can similarly offer links back to items on your site: All you 
have to do is provide the appropriate code.
So what are some of the ways a search engine measures the value of a 
backlink?
Keyword-rich anchor text
The link’s anchor text should contain appropriate relevant keywords (such 
as cars, Corvette, Impala, Chevy Cavalier, and so on). The link text must also 
match the target page subject in order to be considered relevant.

382
Doing Virtual Siloing
Relevant Web sites link to relevant categories
A relevant Web site linked to the most relevant category on your Web site 
offers the highest value. A link from a Web site that has little or no relevance 
doesn’t help your site with expertise or authority. It won’t hurt your site, 
however, in most cases. Irrelevant links harm a Web site only if the links turn 
out to be purchased in mass quantities as part of a link farm and you recip-
rocate the link. (Link farms are networks of Web sites built for the express 
purpose of driving up link popularity.) In most cases, the worst thing that 
happens is that the links are filtered and no value is passed to the target 
page or site.
Natural link acquisition
It’s important to have other high-ranked Web sites pointing links to your 
site; however, if the only Web sites that link to your site are PageRank 5 
or higher, it may seem artificial or suspicious to search engines. It’s more 
common to see a variety of new and more established sites linking to your 
site, acquired naturally over time rather than instantaneously. It doesn’t 
harm your rankings to have good links and there’s no reason not to solicit 
links from relevant experts in your industry, but a natural link distribution is 
something to keep in mind.
Ethical site relationships
Choosing to seek links from other ethical Web sites has a lasting effect on 
your Web site’s rankings. On the other hand, choosing sites that deliberately 
try to boost link popularity through link farms or other schemes to fool the 
search engines may lead to a drop in rankings or more drastic search engine 
penalties such as being removed from the index itself. When you’re engaged 
in link building efforts, give serious thought to the types of people that 
you’re asking to link to you.
Purchased links
On the whole, we recommend that you don’t buy links. The only time we 
do recommend buying links is for the purpose of advertising in order to 
increase your site traffic — not to increase your link popularity. Buying links 
for commerce purposes (traffic) is acceptable but buying for link equity is 
deceptive SEO and is spam. We cover more on buying links in the section 
“Link buying,” later in the chapter.

Doing Virtual Siloing
External links
Links from your Web site to other Web sites are called external links. Often, 
the drive to build backlinks dominates site owners’ link structure projects, 
whereas external linking remains ignored and misunderstood. Some com-
panies are mistakenly concerned that they could lose traffic and customer 
sales if they link their site to other relevant sites’ information, products, or 
services. After all, why should you link to your competition? Well, failing to 
link out harms your search engine rankings. The effort devoted to attracting 
backlinks is only effective when balanced with appropriate external linking 
to relevant expert sites. External links count towards your search engine 
rank because it’s natural that an expert site would be connected with other 
related sites in its industry (or subject “community,” as the search engines 
call it). Being a competent reference source is important for SEO.
External link anchor text
The anchor text that points away to another site must be evaluated with 
the same scrutiny given to backlinks. Evaluating the competition is critical 
to understanding why a site has high keyword rankings. The phrases used 
in link anchor text should reflect the same type of keywords that the site is 
trying to rank for.
In order to pass on subject relevance, you don’t need to link to direct com-
petitors; rather, you can choose compatible or related Web sites. Often, sub-
ject experts are education-related sites, as well as other compatible services 
that complement your services, rather than confusing or confiscating your 
users.
 
Do not sell links for SEO. Obviously, many sites use advertising to support 
themselves: We’re not talking about that. We’re talking about the guy who 
offers you a $1,000 a month for an undisclosed paid link on your home page. 
Google has made it very clear that they do not like links that are bought for 
the purposes of trying to game their algorithm. If you’re going to sell link 
advertisements on your site, make sure they’re clearly labeled as such. Link 
selling, no matter how tempting, can be met with search engine penalties 
and possibly a complete Web site ban that removes the Web site from the 
search engine.
Internal linking structure
The last part of virtual siloing is building subject relevance using the naviga-
tion and on-page elements of your Web site. This means arranging the main 
subjects in the most straightforward way possible in order to build subject 

384
Doing Virtual Siloing
relevance and organizing your navigation menus to categorize the content 
of your site. Remember the pyramid that we talked about at the beginning of 
the chapter? The broader terms are supported by the lesser terms, and the 
lesser terms are supported by the even lesser terms, and so forth.
Every silo needs to be assigned a main landing page focused on that silo’s 
primary subject theme. The landing page should have at least five pages 
of support for it, and so on. Linking should stay within the silos or point to 
other important landing pages. Look at Figure 1-7, which shows a graph of a 
silo with one big broad page and five smaller subcategory pages, each with 
their own attached supporting pages.
 
Figure 1-7: 
A typical 
silo: Note 
how the 
categories 
are 
arranged.

Cobalt
Aveo
Tahoe
Impala

When you’re building your silo, the smaller pages should not link cross-
category. Your page on Ford tires should not link to a page about Chevy 
tires, for instance. Instead, have both pages link to a separate landing page 
about tires. Too much cross-linking between unrelated subjects dilutes the 
silo and confuses the search engine.
You can also use a couple of tricks with cross-linking in order to keep the 
links streamlined, but they should be used sparingly. If you must cross-link 
theme supporting pages (not landing pages), we suggest that you add the 
rel=”nofollow” attribute to a link to keep the search engine from fol-
lowing the link. This allows unrelated pages to link to each other without 
confusing the subject relevance.
 
The nofollow attribute is not a substitute for having a good linking strategy, 
and every page on your site must be linked to from at least two perfectly 
normal, followable links on perfectly normal, indexable pages.

Building Links
Excessive navigation or cross linking
When it is impossible to remove menus or other links that contradict sub-
ject relevance categories, instead use technology to block the search engine 
spiders from indexing those specific elements and maintain quality subject 
relevance:
 
✦ JavaScript: Great for drop-down menus, forms, and other elements that 
you don’t want the spider to follow. You can use JavaScript to prevent 
the search engine from indexing a menu if, for example, your whole 
site’s navigation menu shows at the top of every page (which could con-
fuse the spiders).
 
✦ Iframes: If you have repetitive elements, add an iframe to isolate the 
object to one location and eliminate interlink subject confusion.
 
✦ Flash: Effectively remove a menu or content links from the search 
engines’ view by placing your content or menu within a Flash object, 
which spiders can’t follow. This technology is developing rapidly and 
may be spiderable in the near future, but for now, proceed with caution.
 
✦ AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): AJAX applets are gorgeous 
Web 2.0 applications that can be used to create engagement, but that 
can’t be indexed in search engines, providing the perfect haven for con-
tent, menus, and other widgets for the user’s eyes only.
 
Striking a balance between these three elements of link structure (inbound, 
outbound, and internal site linking) serves to create maximum subject 
relevancy.
Building Links
Link building goes back to what we were talking about earlier in this chapter 
about inbound links. It’s about getting external sites to link to you. We go 
over this more in depth in Chapter 2 of this minibook, but here are a few dif-
ferent ways you can solicit links to your site:
 
✦ Link magnets
 
✦ Link baiting
 
✦ Link requests
 
✦ Link buying

386
Building Links
Link magnets
When we say link magnets, we mean elements on your site that you build in 
such a way that people naturally want to link to them. Much like a magnet 
attracts iron filings, these site content elements simply attract links. People 
happen upon your site, find the link magnet, and decide that it’s relevant 
and worthy of a link, so they stick a link to your content on their site. This 
happens because someone finds your page both useful and interesting, and 
it’s a process that happens over time. But it means that the link is generally 
going to be from someone who is actually interested in your industry, not 
just in your gimmick. Remember, search engines judge you based on your 
expertise, and good quality links from relevant sites add to that.
 
The Search Engine Relationship Chart available at Bruce Clay’s site (www.
bruceclay.com/serc) is a good example of a link magnet. People in the 
search engine optimization industry find it relevant to their sites and useful 
for reference, so they link to it. We continue to keep the chart updated, so it 
always reflects the current state of the ever-changing search engine land-
scape. For this reason, the chart maintains its relevance over time, as 
opposed to something brief and flashy that has no long-term value.
Link bait
Link bait is an accelerated version of a link magnet. Link bait is anything that 
is deliberately provocative in order to get someone to link to you. Examples 
would be a cartoon that someone did of your boss, or a video depicting 
wacky hi-jinks in your office that was linked to a few well-read blogs.
Link bait, unlike link magnets, is usually more broadly appealing in scope 
and probably isn’t targeting your core market. Like any other non-relevant 
link, a link generated from link bait is often not one that would be considered 
a high quality link in general. But it does have the bonus of bringing a lot of 
traffic to your site, and hopefully a few of those visitors may poke around 
your site and decide to give you a permanent link.
 
An excellent example of link bait is any kind of viral marketing. Blendtec, a 
blender company, gets tons of links and traffic off of their videos on their 
Will It Blend? site, where they put all manner of strange and surprising 
things into their blenders (like rakes, marbles, and iPhones) and post the 
videos on the Internet. Most sites linking to Will It Blend? are not directly 
related to blenders, commercial or retail, and certainly can’t be considered 
blender “experts” by the search engines, so those links count for less.

Building Links
Link requests
Link requests are just what they sound like: e-mailing or contacting someone 
and asking for them to link to your site. If you find a site related to your 
subject themes that you would like a backlink from, you can contact them, 
providing them with information on what your site is, why you think it would 
be good to link to your site, and the anchor text with which you’d like to 
be linked to. It’s basically like going door to door with your Web site and 
having to recite your pitch over and over again. Out of a neighborhood of 
100 houses (or a hundred e-mails sent), you might get one or two takers. But 
is it worth the time and the effort for those two links? Link requests do work, 
but there’s not a lot of return for the time you put in. It’s not something we 
recommend.
Link buying
By ad link buying, we don’t mean going out and selling or buying links to 
your own site for SEO link building purposes. There are two loose groupings 
of link buying: buying advertising for traffic purposes but not for SEO, which 
is acceptable; and buying a link for SEO purposes that is not a qualified testi-
monial, which is considered deceptive and if detected could result in a spam 
penalty.
Acceptable link buying is paying for a link on someone’s advertising site. 
You must do it strictly for advertising and traffic purposes only, and not 
for link popularity. Google doesn’t like to consider paid links and does not 
assign weight to a paid link. Paid links may pass some value until detected, 
but after they’re detected, you lose all SEO value and could incur a pen-
alty. If you do have a paid link on someone else’s site, ask them to place a 
rel=”nofollow” attribute on it. This attribute alerts the search engines 
that link equity should not be passed via that link. This is also important 
because if Google discovers a sold link on the site, it might stop passing link 
equity to all of the links on the site.
 
If you decide the traffic and advertising is worth the effort, it’s perfectly 
acceptable to pay a site to have them run your banner or text link ad. Be 
aware, however, that part of the whole “paid links” issue is that you have to 
pay for it.
A word about reciprocal links: Reciprocal links are when two sites link to each 
other: site A to site B and site B to site A. This exchange of links is essentially 
a barter and generally does not contribute much, if anything, to link equity, 
but they are not harmful. Links between authority sites are natural and 
expected, whereas links between non-expert sites are of limited value. As a 
bartered link exchange, reciprocal links are essentially purchased; you are 
simply “paying” by giving a link in return. Building a link campaign based on 
reciprocal linking is largely a waste of time, but don’t hesitate to link to a site 
that links to you if that site would be useful to your users.

✓ Creating a press release
I
n the previous chapter, we talk a little bit about getting people to link to 
you, and how it affects your overall ranking within the search engines. 
Having links from good reputable Web sites lends to your site’s overall cred-
ibility and is used in the search engine’s algorithm (formula that measures 
a Web page’s overall relevancy to the search query) to determine whether 
you can be considered an “expert” in your field. Remember, the search 
engines want to give their users the best results possible, because if they 
give the user what they want, users come back and continue to use the 
search engine.
In this chapter, you find out how to research and solicit links for your site. 
You also find out how not to obtain links, and how to properly evaluate paid 
links. The last thing we cover is how to work with RSS feeds and syndication.
Researching Links
You can acquire new backlinks, or inbound links to your site, in a number 
of ways. Examples include writing articles, creating new widgets for your 
site, and so on. Each technique can produce results, but the amount of time 
and effort that goes into them can be costly. So it makes sense to consider 
attracting high-quality links to your site with good content — especially if 
you have limited time, effort, and money to pursue new links. You can read 
more about what makes good content in Book V.
 
The benefit of good content is that it can attract quality links on its own 
(and those links are likely to stay there), as well as help you build your busi-
ness reputation. The idea is to attract long-term expert testimonial links to 
your site. It makes you seem more authentic and trustworthy to the users 
and search engines alike. Although developing good content also takes time 

390
Researching Links
and effort, the added benefit of building your reputation as an authority in 
your industry has lasting value and allows you to compete more successfully 
on the Internet.
If you’ve already got that exciting and interesting content all ready to go 
(lucky you), and you want to be more proactive about obtaining links, you 
can go about it in several ways. First, you need to think about what kind of 
sites you want to link to you. Brainstorm about places that might link to you, 
and vice versa. Think about your competition and who’s linking to them and 
especially why. Take note of whether your competition uses paid advertising 
(such as banner ads) or hosts banner ads on their own site in exchange for 
another site hosting there.
After you have a working list of possible sites, you have a long list of points 
to consider when you start thinking about soliciting links from different Web 
sites. If you’re going to spend money, the cost of advertisements has to be 
justified based on the potential increase in traffic and brand awareness, not 
the potential ranking benefit. Any ranking boost you receive is only an addi-
tional side benefit; do not get too attached to that boost, eventually the paid 
link will be detected and discounted. Pages that are visited often on your 
site are better targets for purchased links or advertisements.
 
The quality and reputation of the site that links to you is crucial. Though 
Google states that there is almost nothing another site can do to harm yours, 
almost nothing is not the same as absolutely nothing. Links from unethical 
sites, such as sites involved in spam or unethical search engine results page 
(SERP) manipulation, can seriously damage your reputation and rankings if 
they show up in large quantities, and you could even wind up pulled from 
the index (the database of Web sites that search engines maintain for all 
queries). Never solicit links from any site that you suspect may be engaged 
in spam or unethical practices.
PageRank is a term that is unique to Google. 
Google considers a hyperlink to a page to be 
a vote of confidence for that page. Every site 
on the Web has a certain PageRank, or PR, 
based on these votes and how much PageRank 
inbound the linking pages have. PageRank is 
distributed within a site based on links: those 
coming from third-party sites and from the 
site’s internal linking. Usually, the home page 
of every site has the most PageRank because 
it has the most direct links from other sites and 
because it is commonly linked to from every 
page internally. The terms link popularity or 
link equity are often used synonymously with 
PageRank. They refer to the same concept, but 
are more generic and can thus be used when 
discussing any search engine.
A brief explanation of PageRank

Book VI
Chapter 2
Obtaining Links
391
Researching Links
Try to pursue links from sites that are strongly related to the industry or 
overall themes of your Web site. But while you’re doing that, bear in mind 
that a link from a newer site can have just as much value (or more) if the 
site has a lot of link popularity or authority within the search engines. Also 
consider that a newer site could potentially drive much more traffic than an 
older site with stale content, an old design, and little or no maintenance. It’s 
a matter of trial and error.
Try to obtain links from sites with varying PageRank values. (Note: the Google 
Toolbar PageRank scale ranks pages from 0 to 10, with www.google.com 
being a 10.) A natural distribution of links to any given page includes a major-
ity of links from PR3 or lower pages. Generally, there should be fewer links 
from PR4 pages, even fewer from PR5, and so on. With that said, do not avoid 
getting a link from a higher PR page if you are obtaining it in an ethical way.
Your links should be formatted so they can be counted toward your link 
equity. They should not include a rel=”nofollow” attribute or otherwise 
block the spiders from following and indexing links. Don’t create links using 
JavaScript, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), or Flash (with rare 
exceptions) as they will not be spiderable. Each link should also directly 
connect to the designated page in the target site. Links acquired should 
point to different landing pages within the site, as well as the home page. 
They should be based on topic relevance of the anchor text and the page 
they are being referred from.
 
Make sure linking sites are not part of a link farm (sites that exist only as 
thousands of links for the sole purpose of fooling the search engines) or 
another search engine spam network.
Reciprocal links (an “I’ll link to your site if you link to mine” swap) should be 
avoided as a general solicitation practice. However, this doesn’t mean that 
you should never have reciprocal links. Remember, the search engines want 
to do what’s best for your users. If your user would find value in a site that 
links to you, by all means, link back.
 
Ads or other bartered links should only be obtained from relevant sites. 
Linking to a spam network puts you in danger of getting pulled from the 
search engine index, so be very careful and review all sites accordingly.
Develop a list of the preferred anchor text you would like to see on each URL 
from which you are seeking inbound links. Your anchor text describes to 
the search engine the subject of the page linked to. It’s like a sign that you 
point to yourself. Ideally, all links should use the preferred anchor text you 
provide to the site. If any “tailoring” occurs, be sure main keywords are pres-
ent (that is, not removed). Realistically, you do not control the site linking to 
you, so in the end, it’s up to the linking site to use whatever anchor text they 
feel is best. Suggested link text is just that: a suggestion.

392
Researching Links
Links should remain on the original URL from the date placed and should 
not move around. The goal is to achieve link stability and longevity. Check 
back occasionally on solicited links to find out if they’re still there.
Use social media sites (social networking sites like Facebook, communica-
tion sites like Twitter, social news sites like Digg, social bookmarking sites 
like Delicious, and so on) to generate interest in your site. The goal is to get 
others to see the post and then post about the article elsewhere. However, 
be aware that links from non-related blog pages, social media sites, wikis, or 
forums only help your link popularity in a limited fashion (see the section 
“Making Use of Link Magnets and Link Bait” later in this chapter for more 
details).
Linking pages should ideally have unique content, and not content used on 
other domains. The Title and Meta tags on linking pages should also be 
unique.
In some cases, an inbound link from a high quality education (.edu, but not 
student accounts) site should be considered. Inbound links from an .edu 
site can hold increased value when the link is relevant (for example, the 
.edu links to your page discussing research in which that educational insti-
tution is involved). These links can also pass link equity even if those pages 
are not relevant to the pages they’re linking to simply by virtue of their own 
authority.
Although obtaining links from directories is a good way to build the link 
popularity of a new Web site, your long-term link building strategy cannot 
consist solely of directory links. The vast majority of your links should be 
from non-directory based sites.
Sites with a top-level country domain (for example, .co.uk for the United 
Kingdom, .co.nz for New Zealand, and so on) should try to obtain links 
from other sites that have the same top-level domain (TLD) designation and 
are hosted in the country associated with that top-level domain. Links from 
other top level domains are fine as well, but you absolutely need links from 
other sites in the same TLD as your domain. The more links that you can 
obtain from sites hosted in that country, the more likely it is that your site 
ranks well in search engines specific to your country.
Linking sites should reside on different IP address ranges than your site. 
Additionally, there should not be a large number of links from the same 
C-block of IP addresses. (The C block is the third set of numbers in an IP 
address. In the sample IP address, 255.168.219.32, 219 is the C-block.) If all 
of your links are from the same C-block, it looks unnatural and spammy. 
Excessive linking between sites on the same IP ranges might be seen by 
search engines as a link farm community.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Obtaining Links
393
Soliciting Links
 
Links should be obtained gradually over time, not in the span of a few days 
or weeks. This allows your link growth to appear more natural and reduces 
the risk of search engines flagging your Web site for forced or artificial 
increases. This guideline is far more important in regards to advertisements, 
as they can be obtained at a much faster rate.
Soliciting Links
After you’ve figured out which sites you want to obtain links from, you can 
go about the process of actually soliciting them. But how do you do that? 
Do you go politely from site to site, knocking on their doors like a vacuum 
cleaner salesman? For maximum benefit to your SEO efforts, you want to 
obtain non-purchased links from respected Web sites that are related to 
your subject themes. The search engines reason that if your site is expert, 
other people in your industry naturally want to link to you, without having 
to be paid to do it.
Requesting unpaid backlinks
One approach to obtaining a natural backlink from a related site involves 
contacting the Webmaster or site owner directly and making a request. Link 
solicitation can be a very laborious process, but the benefit of choosing the 
right “linking fit” can be enormously beneficial to both you and the other 
site. If you can communicate this to them, your chances of actually obtaining 
your specific link request is much better.
First, you need to determine which sites are the best candidates for your 
link solicitation. You may know of some off the top of your head; if so, great. 
A tried-and-true method for obtaining relevant links, though, is to discover 
what sites link to the Web pages that already rank for your keywords. 
Chances are that if the Web site has linked to your competitor, it might be a 
good candidate to link to you.
To discover what sites link to your competitors, follow these steps:
 
1. Identify your competition: Run a search on Google.com (or Yahoo.com 
or Ask.com) for your search terms, the keyword you’re trying to rank 
higher for.
 
2. Go through the results one at a time, opening the pages if you have to 
in order to understand what kind of site they are.
 
 If the page is a direct competitor or is not likely to link to your site, 
move on to the next URL in the results. (If the page is not a direct com-
petitor, search for information on how to contact the site’s Webmaster. 
These sites could be good backlink candidates, too.)

394
Soliciting Links
 
3. Make a list of the Web pages (URLs) that rank well for your keywords.
 
 These are your competitors.
 
4. After you’ve identified your competition, find out who links to them 
by running your competitors’ URLs through the Link Analysis Report 
that’s available as a free tool on our SEOToolSet Web site (www.seo
toolset.com/tools/free_tools.html) or through another compar-
able tool.
 
 The paid version of the SEOToolSet has a competitive link analysis tool 
that compares six sites and their linking schemas that is also useful 
for this.
Look over the report, which shows external pages with backlinks to your 
competitor. Figure 2-1 shows a Link Analysis Report from the SEOToolset 
(version 4.0) that found sites that link to the sample page. You can see that 
each URL is hyperlinked, so you can click to follow the URLs and look at the 
pages as needed.
Here’s what you should look for as you review the various URLs shown on 
the report:
 
✦ Newness: If the page already links to your Web page, examine the 
anchor text and see if it would be better to change it or even point to a 
more relevant page on your site. If it’s already a good link, ignore it. You 
want to find new candidates for backlinks.
 
✦ Relevancy: Make sure the content on the Web page relates to your page 
content. You don’t want to solicit irrelevant links that won’t pass any 
link equity. Also, the page should not have dozens of links to non-related 
sites.
 
✦ Appropriateness: We get into this more in Chapter 4 of this minibook, 
but you don’t want to solicit links from bad neighborhoods. If the page is 
nothing more than a list of 100 random links with no content or theme, 
or full of paid ads, or looks spammy, or smells fishy . . . you don’t want 
any part of it.
When you’ve determined good Web pages to solicit backlinks from, make a 
list of their URLs, including whatever information you can find on their site 
for how to contact their Webmaster.
When you have a list of Web pages you’d like links from, you’re almost ready 
to contact them. We say “almost” because there’s a little more preparation 
you can do so that your correspondence is customized for them and doesn’t 
come across like junk mail. What follows is a recommended scenario that 
you can use for soliciting a link. After you read through this, we explain what 
we mean by “preparation”:

Figure 2-1:

Report 
showing 
Web pages 
that link 
back to a 
particular 
page.
 
Write an e-mail that’s customized. Do not start with “Dear Webmaster” if 
you want to stand out from the rest of their inbox fodder. Do not use generic 
boilerplate text (although you can start with something generic and then 
modify it).
In your e-mail, explain that you’ve looked at their page (giving the URL) and 
feel that it relates well to the subject matter of your Web page (give the URL 
of your page as well). You can call this subject or theme by name to further 
personalize your message. If a particular section of the page seems most 
related, specify it: That proves that you actually read their page, and it may 
give you a better-placed link near relevant surrounding text.
If you’ve identified any technical problem with their site, such as a broken 
link, typographical error, missing graphic, server error, or other, you can 
offer this information to them. For example, you could say, “By the way, 
when I was on your page yesterday, I noticed a broken link about halfway 
down to the Squiggly Slalom Ski Shop. Thought you could use that infor-
mation — we Webmasters have to stick together.” Tools are available to 
help you locate broken links or other problems with another person’s Web 
page. We suggest running the Link Checker tool, which is available for 
free on the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) site at www.w3.org/QA/
Tools/#validators.

396
Soliciting Links
Praise the sites that they link to already and say that you noticed there’s an 
existing link to another site that offers similar services/information/products, 
or whatever, to yours, so you wondered . . . 
Then, if you have a link magnet of some sort that you think is relevant to 
their site, suggest that they consider visiting your cool chart, table, interac-
tive tool, or other widget to see if they believe it would add value for their 
site visitors. You don’t have to ask for the link; if they like it, they’ll make 
that decision on their own.
Close the e-mail with your name and contact information so that the 
Webmaster knows you’re a real person, not just a computer.
The link-request e-mail you construct based on the preceding steps contains 
some specific information that you gather before sending the request. This 
preparation may take a little time, but a valuable link may be worth five 
or ten minutes. After all, you’re trying to start a business relationship that 
could have value in itself. In the best-case scenario, they give you a backlink 
that lasts for a long time to come and may end up passing you quality traffic 
to your site that goes beyond better rankings.
Writing a customized link request can show the other site’s Webmaster that 
you know what you are talking about, illustrate your expertness, and dem-
onstrate your commitment to success for both parties. In this case, putting 
yourself in their shoes might also prove helpful. You don’t want to scare 
them by coming on too strong. Consider how you would react to the same 
type of request and adjust your approach accordingly. In some cases, it 
might be appropriate to pick up the phone and call them, or even visit their 
offices in person. (Visit them in person after you’ve made phone or e-mail 
contact, please: We don’t want to encourage cyber-stalking!) It all depends.
Soliciting a paid link
Obtaining a free link is not always possible. On those situations, you may 
want to come up with a plan to approach Web sites about direct advertis-
ing on their site. In that case, you have to determine a price point that is 
not only acceptable to you, but to the other site as well. In some instances, 
a partnership may be developed that benefits both parties without any fees 
actually being exchanged. But however the paid link is secured, you want to 
be sure that you get a link from the most relevant page with the best anchor 
text possible.
 
Remember that obtaining a paid link does not necessarily give you a direct 
SEO benefit. The search engines do not pass link equity through links that 
have been identified as paid, so you only want to buy links if traffic or adver-
tising, not rankings, are what you’re really after. In fact, if Google detects 
paid links on a Web page, it may stop passing PageRank through any of the 
links on that page, whether they’re really paid or natural.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Obtaining Links
397
Making Use of Link Magnets and Link Bait
Here’s how to solicit a paid link from another site:
 
1. Determine if there are advertising possibilities on the Web site.
 
2. If there are no listed advertisement packages, you may want to con-
tact the Web site owner or Webmaster to propose privately paying for 
an advertisement on their Web site.
 
3. Try to obtain text links with optimal anchor text located on the most 
relevant pages for your subject theme.
 
 If the paid link you solicit is formatted as an image or banner, this may 
increase your click-through rate (the number of visitors who click your 
link) and traffic. Ideally, any links that you obtain (paid or not) should 
have surrounding text related to your subject and not be one among 
dozens of non-related links. Again, this isn’t done for the SEO benefit. 
Image links/banner links are less likely to pass the same weight as 
good anchor text. In fact, most large sites that sell banner ads run them 
through redirects or advertising networks that more than likely use 
iframes (embedded frames that display a separate page in the frame) 
and pass no link equity at all. Paid advertisements are strictly for adver-
tising, not for link building.
Making Use of Link Magnets and Link Bait
Another way of attracting links is to set yourself up as a link magnet or put 
out some link bait and wait for the links to come to you. We introduce these 
concepts in the previous chapter, but we elaborate on them here. Link mag-
nets are typically creative Web applications, tools, how-to guides, reference 
materials, or any information that is unique and valuable to users. Link bait 
is content created for the purpose of attracting attention and links. The dif-
ference between the two is that a link magnet is for the purpose of attracting 
relevant links, whereas link bait is mostly good for short-term traffic. Rarely, 
link bait can translate into long-term links, but that’s only if you have good 
content to go along with the video or blog or other tantalizing things you’ve 
just released.
Generating information, applications, tools, or ideas that people talk about 
is a surefire way to generate links: This is the benefit of a link magnet. 
Developing an idea for a link magnet takes some dedicated brainstorm-
ing and creative thought, as well as a good understanding of your target 
audience and what they might find useful or even humorous. For example, 
research that generates data or insights into the differences between com-
peting services might be highly valued by a technology audience.
Creative insight that grabs everyone’s attention and generates discussion 
is what you’re after. When you come up with an idea, actual construction of 
the link magnet may also require hard work, although some link magnets can 
be developed with little effort.

Making Use of Link Magnets and Link Bait
Articles
Adding an article section to your site or posting articles on a blog can be a 
valuable source of links. Not only are articles a good way of adding keyword-
rich content to your site, but they can also be a good way of attracting links. 
Other sites frequently link to articles that provide useful advice or informa-
tion in order to share it with others.
There is a difference between articles that you write to provide information 
about your products or company and articles that can be deemed link-worthy. 
The latter tends to be non-commercial, informative, and entertaining, whereas 
the former tends to be more marketing-oriented, like a page describing your 
product or service that is not designed to garner links and draw traffic, but is 
merely to give more information to people already interested in you.
The key to writing articles that generate links is to make sure the article is 
something that viewers want to read and share with others. Think of it as an 
article you would read in a magazine, not just something written strictly for 
SEO value.
Many different types of content can be used as link bait:
 
✦ Top 10 lists: These have nearly become cliché online, but can still be 
effective if they are new and fresh.
 
✦ How-to guides: Explain how to do something in a clear and easy way. 
Visuals, like images or videos, can be helpful.
 
✦ Articles about hot button issues: Debate a controversial industry-
related topic.
 
✦ Resources: Offer new research, information, tools, charts, and graphs.
 
✦ Humorous and off-beat material: Include funny stories and topics.
 
✦ Games: They can be developed for fun that may or may not be related to 
your industry.
Videos
 
Using engagement objects such as images and other rich media can be an 
integral part of link building. Blended search (searching for different types of 
content, such as text, videos, photos, and so on) is becoming a bigger part 
of search engine algorithms as they mix various types of files into search 
results. Some people online are looking for more than just static Web pages. 
You can utilize video, Flash animations and videos, and podcasts to reach 
this audience. Not only does this help your overall Internet marketing cam-
paign and raise brand awareness, but it can also help generate quality links.

How Not to Obtain Links
Videos can be used as link magnets and link bait and can be a great way of 
increasing awareness of your Web site. The key to a good video link magnet 
is to make your video unique and link-worthy. The video should incorporate 
branding and advertising strategies, but above all, it should be entertaining.
Videos from YouTube (www.youtube.com) currently rank high in Google 
video results. Although videos on YouTube can increase exposure for your 
company, they do not necessarily build link popularity for your Web site. 
However, YouTube can be used to raise awareness for the video link mag-
nets that are hosted on your site. You can do so by posting shortened video 
clips on YouTube that link back to additional or higher quality videos posted 
on your Web site.
 
The best way to build link popularity with a video link magnet is to embed 
the video into a Web page on your site. This way, anyone linking to the video 
is directly linking to your site, which is of course the primary reason for 
creating a link magnet. However, showing up on a search results page as a 
blended result might be a secondary goal as well. You can increase the likeli-
hood of meeting that goal by adding links from your site to the videos you 
have put on YouTube.
One famous example of a video link magnet is the “Will It Blend?” series of 
videos done by Blendtec, a company that manufactures blenders. Blenders 
may seem like a boring product for a video, but Blendtec makes their videos 
entertaining by obliterating all sorts of items in their blenders and styling 
the demos like a 1960s game show. Blendtec posts their videos on YouTube, 
but they also integrate them into their Web site.
After you have created a video link magnet, you need to promote it. Issuing 
a press release is one way to do this. (See the section, “Creating a press 
release” later in this chapter for more on how.) You can also bring aware-
ness to your video through social news sites like Digg (www.digg.com) 
and Reddit (www.reddit.com), as well as social bookmarking sites like 
Delicious (www.delicious.com), StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com), 
and Furl (www.furl.net). Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a great way to 
build a community and put out information as well.
How Not to Obtain Links
As with many things in life, there is a right way to go about obtaining links, 
and there is a wrong way. We’ve put together a handy list of what not to do 
when trying to get links to your site.
 
✦ Do not spam. This means no sending of mass e-mails like, “Dear 
Webmaster, can you please link to me? Here is the anchor text I want to 
use. XOXO. Me.” If you are soliciting links from a Web site, make sure to 
customize each and every e-mail you send.

400
Evaluating Paid Links
 
✦ Avoid incestuous linking. If you build a vast network that only links 
back in on itself, or only back to itself, it’s considered incestuous linking. 
This is a huge no-no for Google, and there are actual penalties involved 
that could result: Your site could be removed from the index or sub-
jected to heavy ranking penalties instead of just having your links dis-
regarded as part of the PageRank.
 
✦ Do not buy links for ranking. You can buy links in terms of traffic 
and for advertising, but buying a link for ranking is a definite no-no for 
Google, which disregards the weight of paid links and possibly any and 
all links on that page.
 
✦ Do not use run of site links. Run of site links happen when a site has 
links to your site on every single one of its pages. These kinds of links 
are heavily discounted and are usually immediately flagged as paid links 
at best and spam at worst.
 
✦ Do not use link farms. There’s more about link farms in Book I, Chapter 6. 
Link farms are spam, and you incur penalties for using them. You could 
get your site yanked from the index; if this happens, you need to clean it 
up and grovel to the search engines to get back in.
 
✦ Do not solicit links from irrelevant sites. It does not matter if the site is 
very, very popular: It won’t help you if your content is in no way related 
to their content: like, say, your dog grooming business soliciting a link 
from a gossip site like Gawker (www.gawker.com).
 
✦ Do not set up several different sites all with the purpose of linking to 
yourself. This is spam. Spamming is bad.
 
In general, think about how you would want people to try to obtain links from 
you. Treat others as you want to be treated. Also, always avoid sneaky, under-
handed, or devious techniques. You will be caught and will have to do it the 
right way anyway. It saves you the time and effort of cleaning up your page and 
the hassle of begging Google to consider resubmitting your site into the index.
Evaluating Paid Links
When soliciting paid links, remember to do it only for the traffic or the adver-
tising. Soliciting a paid link in order to increase your ranking is definitely 
not recommended. Google hates that. A lot. But if you’ve decided to try and 
solicit some paid links for the advertising traffic, you need to properly evalu-
ate the Web sites you are looking at in order to make sure you get a quality 
link and don’t get ripped off.
First, check out the site and see how much traffic they are getting. Also take 
a good hard look and determine whether they’re using spam techniques. If 
you think that they’re a good legitimate site, send them a solicitation letter. 
Suggest a trial run for your ad — you could pay them for a month’s worth of 
advertising, so you can check and see if your traffic goes up.

Chapter 2

Working with RSS Feeds and Syndication
There are other methods of gauging/estimating traffic to a site before you 
purchase advertising. Most sites that are serious about selling ads have 
demographical and traffic data available. Sites like Hitwise (www.hitwise.
com), comScore (www.comscore.com), Compete (www.compete.com), and 
even Alexa (www.alexa.com) can give you some idea of what they can do 
for you.
 
One thing to monitor is the quality of the traffic your advertisement is bring-
ing you. Is it bringing you conversions or just a lot of traffic? It might not be 
worth the money you spend on the ad if the traffic does not bring you any 
conversions. Instead, you can wind up just paying for the ad and the extra 
fees when your server gets hammered by all the new traffic.
Working with RSS Feeds and Syndication
Another way of going about obtaining links is working through RSS feeds 
and syndication. RSS is a method of offering a convenient way to distribute 
content on your Web site that you’d like others to use. In other words, it’s a 
mechanism to “syndicate” your content.
No one agrees for sure on what RSS stands for. RSS was introduced by 
Netscape in 1999 and then later abandoned in 2001. They said it stood for 
Rich Site Summary. Another version of RSS pioneered by UserLand Software 
supposedly stands for Really Simple Syndication. In yet another version, RSS 
stands for RDF Site Summary. The reason for so many different names is 
because there’s some rivalry over who invented RSS. But the purpose is all 
the same: It’s a program that publishes new information updates from Web 
sites.
One way of thinking about RSS is to compare it to the funny pages in the 
newspaper. The artists draw their cartoons and then, through their syndi-
cates, the cartoon is made available to any newspaper that cares to run it, in 
exchange for a fee. Syndication of Web content via RSS can be an easy way 
to draw attention to your material, bringing you some traffic and perhaps a 
little net fame, depending on how good your information is.
So how does RSS syndication work? When you publish a new Web page 
about a particular topic, you want others interested in that topic to know 
about it. You can do so by listing the page as an item in your RSS file. You 
can have the page appear in front of those who read information using RSS 
readers or news aggregators, which are software programs that allow users 
to subscribe to and read RSS feeds. RSS also allows people to easily add 
links to your content within their own Web pages. Bloggers are a huge core 
audience that loves RSS feeds, and bloggers are the gossip columnists of the 
Internet. Telephone, telegraph, or tell a blogger, and the information gets out 
there.

402
Working with RSS Feeds and Syndication
There are several RSS or news aggregators out there that you can use. We 
mention a couple here, but this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. A little 
searching around will turn up the feed reader that’s just right for you:
 
✦ NewsIsFree (www.newsisfree.com/): A free service. With it, you can 
create customized pages for different topics, and then have headlines 
from various resources automatically filled into those pages.
 
✦ Feedreader (www.feedreader.com/): A small, free software-based 
tool. Just enter the URL of a feed, and the headlines are brought back 
and made viewable within the application.
 
✦ Radio UserLand (http://radio.userland.com/): Another long-
standing news aggregator. This one starts out with a free 30-day trial, 
and then you pay an annual fee of $39.95. Enter the URL of a news feed, 
and it’s added to your personal list.
 
✦ Google Reader (www.google.com/reader/): An easy-to-use feed 
reader that also enables you to share, comment on, and trend items. It’s 
integrated with your Google account. As with most things Google, it’s 
completely free.
Creating a press release
Internet press releases are an effective and economical solution for distrib-
uting information to the public. After a press release is sent out through a 
third-party company, the information it contains is usually archived on that 
company’s Web site. Most of the companies that offer this service allow you 
to write your own content, including links to your site. This ensures that you 
not only acquire an inbound link, but also that it’s from a page with relevant 
content and optimized anchor text.
Press releases should be written once every couple months (minimum), dis-
cussing new services that are being offered, the latest deals available, and 
what is happening on your site in general. You can generate press releases 
for significant announcements or events worthy of a press release. It’s pos-
sible to do all your press release writing yourself, or you can hire a writing 
service to generate your release for you. It all depends on how confident you 
are in your ability to write for journalists.
A good company to distribute press releases is PRWeb. Their Web site is 
located at www.prweb.com. For more information on how to write an effec-
tive press release, visit www.prweb.com/pressreleasetips.php. PRWeb 
is priced from $80 to $360 per press release, depending on the package and 
reach that you choose for your distribution. 
You should create a handful of links in each press release you send out, 
using different anchor text that links to various landing pages on your site. 
The links ideally go to the home page and high-priority landing pages for 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Obtaining Links
403
Working with RSS Feeds and Syndication
your most profitable and most searched services. When linking to pages, be 
sure to use one of the page’s top keywords as the anchor text rather than, or 
in addition to, the URL.
Here are some other tips for writing an article or press release:
 
✦ Avoid sounding like an ad. No one likes to read a press release that 
offers nothing more than a commercial. Gather quotes from relevant 
parties to support your assertions and work them into your text.
 
✦ Avoid promoting your company or product too much in articles. If 
your article seems too much like a sales pitch, people are less likely to 
read or link to it.
 
✦ Offer something new. Provide something new in your article. Avoid 
repeating the same information that may be online elsewhere.
 
✦ Use keywords in the title. The article should have a catchy headline 
that encourages people to want to read, but that also includes the 
keyword phrase you are targeting. Others will likely link to the article 
with the title, so including the main keyword phrases helps incorporate 
keyword-rich anchor text into the links.
 
✦ Avoid keyword stuffing. Use a natural writing style that appeals to your 
audience and avoid overusing or “stuffing” keywords.
 
✦ Be truthful. Don’t use articles or link bait to lie to your visitors, as they 
will never return to your site if you can’t deliver something you promise.
 
✦ Tackle controversy. Don’t be afraid to tackle a controversial subject. 
Articles that cause people to think or want to debate the topic can make 
them more apt to want to post a link about it elsewhere.
 
✦ Always opt to use the exact phrase you are trying to optimize in your 
articles. If your keyword is SEO training, it should appear right up front, 
not just in the title, but in the first sentence and throughout your text. 
Just like optimizing a Web page, you need to remember what you want 
people to consider the point of your article.
A press release can also be used to help promote and bring awareness to 
your link magnet. For example, if you have created a chart or checklist as 
a link magnet, write an article that shows how helpful your chart, widget, 
illustration, or checklist can be and send out a press release announcing its 
launch and covering the main advantages.
Spreading the word
After you have written an article, you need to let people know about it. Of 
course, you should link to your article on your Web site, but you also need 
to spread the word to other Web sites, and social media is a great way to do 
this. One way you can do this is through a Share link on your articles that 

404
Working with RSS Feeds and Syndication
includes links to submit your content to social news sites like Digg, Reddit, 
Delicious, and StumbleUpon. These sites allow users to submit articles they 
find interesting, and then the rest of the community votes and comments 
on them. You can also promote your article on other social networking sites 
like Facebook (www.facebook.com) and MySpace (www.myspace.com), on 
your blog, or on industry-related forums.
The purpose of attracting links to your content from social media sites is 
not just to get the link popularity from the links. After all, the benefit of 
these types of links is short-lived because news changes constantly. The real 
reward is that social media sites help generate traffic and awareness. Your 
goal is to spread the word about your article and get people to read it and 
want to share it with others by linking to it and discussing it. Hopefully, per-
manent and valuable links are built as a result.

S
iloing is a way of arranging your Web site according to themes that 
allows for prime search engine optimization. We discuss siloing a bit in 
the previous chapters, but, in this chapter, we go into how to actually build 
and structure your site in order to have the best silos possible.
First, we review the subject theming of your site, and then we discuss link 
equity. From there, we cover actually creating and maintaining your silos. 
This means we walk you through the setup, construction, and maintenance 
work necessary for good silos.
Another thing you read about in this chapter is a site map. There are two 
different kinds: the traditional site map and the XML site map. A traditional 
site map is a Web page that is designed to guide users to all the pages on 
your site. It’s a little like an index page in the back of a text book where 
every page is listed and linked to, usually grouped by subject theme. An 
XML site map is a document designed specifically to be readable by a search 
engine. You can tell a search engine all about your site using this kind of 
document. Despite their confusingly similar names, the two types of docu-
ments aren’t interchangeable and they both have their uses. In this chapter, 
we show you how to use both to your advantage.
Subject Theming Structure
We talk about subject theming, which is picking out your themes in order 
to better arrange your silos, in Chapter 1 of this minibook. Now you need 
to actually implement your themes into a silo structure. Look at Figure 3-1, 
which is a silo pyramid.

Cars
Classic
Modern
The example we’re using is a classic car Web site. The very top of the page 
represents one of the broadest themes, which are the makes of cars, and 
this silo is for Ford.
You can accomplish siloing by setting up either directory-based silos, where 
the linking structure follows the physical setup of the site (physical siloing), 
or non-directory based silos, where the linking structure alone defines the 
theme (virtual siloing). These types of silos both create themes through link-
ing, but they do so in different ways. Virtual silos create content and subject 
relationships through cross-linking alone to create theme, whereas physi-
cal siloing creates relationships by utilizing directory structure and links to 
group like content. They can both be used in the same site, depending on 
organizational structure.
In a physical silo, relationships between pages are created by grouping pages 
with like content in a single directory and linking those pages together. The 
names of the pages help to focus the subject matter of the directory. The 
theme of the directory is tied into the directory structure itself.
Directory structures require at least five pages of textual content that sup-
port whatever topic the directory is addressing. Directory silos must be very 
structured and highly organized.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Structuring 
Internal Links
407
Optimizing Link Equity
In a virtual silo, the theme is created through linking. The names of each 
page are not important because the pages in the relationship are not neces-
sarily in the same silo. The silo is defined by what pages are linked together. 
Thus, you are creating a theme based solely on links rather than hanging the 
linking framework on the directory structure. You have the landing page, or 
the main page, at the top of the silo, and, underneath, you have pages that 
support the main landing page’s theme.
 
The difference between a primary and a sub-silo is like the difference 
between a main theme and a secondary theme. A primary silo should be on 
the main subject you’re wishing to attract to your site. The sub-silos branch 
off from the primary silo, covering their own smaller subthemes. These sub-
silos should both clarify and support the primary silo.
Optimizing Link Equity
Part of the search engine algorithm (how search engines rank your site) is 
measuring your link equity to see whether you’re an expert on your subject. 
In broad terms, more links equals greater expertise, especially when the 
links are from expert sites that are relevant to your site. The more outside 
Web sites link to you, the bigger your “expert” status. (Note: We go over link 
solicitation much more in depth in the previous chapter.)
Say you’re a member of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). Being a member 
of the BBB is a good practice for a business. It’s a trust issue for your visi-
tors who feel better knowing that you’re a member. Naturally, you want 
to tell people this affiliation, so you place a link to the BBB on your Web 
site. Unfortunately, if you’re like a lot of Webmasters out there, you were 
so proud of joining the BBB that you stuck a badge and link to their site on 
every page of your entire site. In doing this, you just gave a huge amount of 
link equity to a site that is not your own.
Link equity is something Google measures when reading your site to deter-
mine whether a site is an “expert” in that field. If many people are linking to 
you from relevant quality sites, obviously you must know something, or so 
the logic goes. Obviously you can create spammy links to fool the engines, 
but that won’t last long. Valid links from other sites, on the other hand, con-
tribute to your being recognized as an expert.
It’s not a bad idea to link out to other sites. You want to link to other sites. 
It gives you an air of respectability when you point to others and say, “This 
person is also an expert in the field, and you should check them out.” It 
makes you look like you know what you are talking about. There is also the 
added bonus of the person you have linked to turning around and linking 
back to you, thus proclaiming you to be an expert as well.

408
Creating and Maintaining Silos
 
On the other hand, you have to be picky about who you link to and where 
you place those links on your site. (Check out Chapter 2 of this minibook for 
details on dangers to avoid with outbound linking.)
Creating and Maintaining Silos
If you’re like most businesses, you probably already have a Web site, and 
you can’t exactly chuck the whole thing out the window and start over from 
scratch. But there is a way to streamline and tweak your site to build better 
silos. It’s a fairly easy process:
 
1.  Identify your main themes — these will be your main silos.
 
2.  Identify the smaller subthemes, which are your subpages or support 
pages for your silos.
 
3. Identify the keywords for each page.
 
 We go over choosing keywords more in depth in Book II. You should 
choose the broader keywords for the main themes and the more special-
ized keywords for the subpages.
 
4. After you have your pages organized, you can start linking them 
together.
There are three basic types of pages within your silos:
 
✦ Landing pages are the pages that you want to direct your users to. 
These are the main subjects that are supported by the smaller sub-
pages.
 
✦ Subpages are the supporting information for your main subjects or land-
ing pages. All landing pages need at least five subpages of information 
to support them, as a general rule. As it happens, these sub-pages may 
evolve into landing pages themselves if they have enough supporting 
material of their own.
 
✦ Article pages are classified as subpages. These are pages that contain 
articles, history, or any sort of information about your theme. These 
pages usually contain lots of text and are a good place to have concise 
keywords.
To correctly implement a directory silo, you would group like content into 
separate directories. Take Ford and Chevy, for example. You would create a 
directory for each theme, one for Ford and one for Chevrolet. Within these 
directories, you would have subsequent content-rich pages to support the 
overall theme of the directories. If you have two models of Ford you want 
to use, Mustang and Explorer, these would fall underneath the Ford page. 
You’d need further information about Mustang and Explorer, and all of the 
information regarding each model type would fall underneath its respective 
directory.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Structuring 
Internal Links
409
Creating and Maintaining Silos
So, what if you want to link between the Ford directory and the Chevy direc-
tory? You have a page underneath the Ford directory that discusses a model 
of Chevy that is very similar to a model of Ford, and you want to do a link 
between these two pages. Rather than linking from that model of Ford to the 
similar model of Chevy that complements it, you would only link from the 
model of Ford page to the Chevy landing page. Although you could link to 
the specific Chevy model page, you would need to add a rel=”nofollow” 
attribute to that link because the model page is not a landing page for the 
silo. The reason for this is that if you have multiple links linking models 
of Ford and Chevy with Ford, you are diluting your theme, which makes it 
difficult for your keywords to stand out and tell the search engines what 
your pages are about. If you have two distinct categories, or silos, Ford 
and Chevrolet, it’s much easier for your keywords to stand out and, conse-
quently, be ranked by the search engines.
In your classic car Web site, you have your site split into two main catego-
ries, Ford and Chevy. The Ford page would be one of your main landing 
pages, and the Chevy page would be another. Say also that you have addi-
tional pages that discuss the specific years of cars, but they are located in 
different silos. These pages all link separately to your main landing page and 
they link horizontally to each other, thus helping to build the theme of that 
silo. See Figure 3-2 as an example of horizontal and vertical siloing.

Building a Silo: An Illustrated Guide
You must decide what you want to be ranked for: Do you want to be ranked 
for Ford as a general keyword, or for specific types of Fords? Siloing too 
tightly would mean that you would not be supporting your general term with 
your specific terms. In this respect, cross-linking within a silo would be okay. 
It all depends on which keywords you want to be ranked for. You definitely 
should target the more specific keywords that are relevant to your site, but 
you may also want to try to rank for more general keywords, which tend to 
be more competitive and harder to optimize your site for. To rank for gen-
eral terms, you need to have some general content pages at the top of your 
site that link down into your category silos (picture an extra row above your 
pyramid of silos), but that don’t receive links back up from the more interior 
pages.
 
Cross-linking between subjects dilutes your theme. The point of linking is to 
group similar subjects in order to tell the search engine what this section is 
about. You want a giant neon arrow pointing to your subjects on your site, and 
keeping them free of other unnecessary links and keywords helps to do that.
Say that you want to discuss Chevy as well as Ford. The Chevy page would 
have its own silo design. The landing page would be the Chevy page, and, as 
in the Ford silo, any pages that discuss varieties of Chevy would be the sub-
sequent pages that would all link to the Chevy landing page, but not to each 
other.
In your Ford page, which discusses a particular year of Ford, you might also 
want to discuss a Chevy model manufactured in the same year. Rather than 
directly linking from the 1962 Ford page to the 1962 Chevy page, you would 
link from the 1962 Ford page to the Chevy landing page. The reason for 
this is that if you have multiple links linking different Ford years and Chevy 
with Ford, you dilute your theme, which makes it difficult for your key-
words to stand out and tell the search engines what your pages are about. 
Again, it is possible to link from one page to the other directly if you use a 
rel=”nofollow” attribute to block the passage of link equity.
Still confused? Not to worry. Siloing is a tricky process, so we’ve put 
together a handy illustrated guide in order to walk you through it.
Building a Silo: An Illustrated Guide
Start each silo with an index page. This is the main landing page, which is 
the big enchilada for your silo. This is where all the big broad keywords go 
within the silo’s theme, and where you introduce yourself to the world as 
an expert on this subject. In your directory, you would call this the index.
html page. So, the URL would read www.classiccarcustomization.
com/index.htm, as seen in Figure 3-3.

Branching off from the silo’s landing page you would have several subpages 
that support the theme. If your silo theme is Ford, you would have subpages 
about the history of Ford, the different types of Ford models, pictures of 
Fords, some videos, and maybe some articles. Each of these subjects would 
get their own separate pages and would be named in the Ford directory as 
follows:
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/index.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/articles.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/models.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/pictures.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/video.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/history.html
Each of these subpages would link back up to the index page, but not to 
each other. When siloing, the rule of thumb is to link up. See Figure 3-4.

Building a Silo: An Illustrated Guide
Any one of these subpages can become its own landing page as well. If you 
intend to make a subpage a landing page — for example if you want to rank 
for the keyword phrase [Ford history] — make sure that it has its own sub-
pages to go along with it. You need at least five subpages of support for your 
landing pages. Doing this creates a smaller silo below the Ford silo, with just 
one overlapping page in common.
Next, build a sub-silo for the Ford Mustang content that you have. Mustang 
falls under Ford, so you would want a page devoted to the keyword [Ford 
Mustang] in the Ford silo, with a link from the Mustang page going to the 
Ford page, as in Figure 3-5.
That Mustang page simultaneously functions as a subpage within the Ford 
silo above it and as the landing page for the Mustang silo. In addition to this 
index page, the Mustang silo needs at least five subpages linking to the index 
page (they could be its own history, articles, years, pictures, and video sub-
pages). The directory structure would look something like this:
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/mustang/index.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/mustang/history.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/mustang/articles.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/mustang/years.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/mustang/pictures.html
www.classiccarcustomization.com/Ford/mustang/videos.html
The silo now resembles Figure 3-6, which goes down another level to show 
the Mustang silo.

Now, if you want to have a link from one of the smaller Ford subpages to 
the Chevy subpages, you would not link directly between them. Instead, 
you would link the Ford subpage to the Chevy landing page, as in Figure 3-7. 
Remember, this method of linking is to avoid dilution of the silo themes.
But if you really want to have links between the subpages (usually to enhance 
the user experience), you can. All you need to do is use a non-spiderable 
method to link: Create the links in JavaScript, or in AJAX, or in an iFrame, 
or add a rel=nofollow tag to the link in order to keep the search engine 
spiders from following the link, as in Figure 3-8. This way, your silo still reads 
like you don’t have any links between the subpages, but the user can follow 
the link with no problem.

Maintaining Your Silos
Whenever you make content changes to an existing site, you run a risk of 
losing ground in the search engine rankings for a while. If your changes 
are well-planned and SEO-smart, your long-term gains are worth the risk. 
However, you need to know how to maintain your site with care.
It’s pretty common for people to ask, “How can we modify our site to better 
focus our silos without losing our existing rankings?” Well, think of your site 
as a work that’s constantly in progress. In order not to alienate visitors and 
keep your traffic consistent, consider expanding or growing your site one or 
two silos at a time and then carefully analyzing how each change you made 
affects your rankings. Also, don’t change the site in one giant update and 
just hope everything is re-indexed properly. Hundreds of different configura-
tions of silos may end up being a better fit; all it takes is constant tweaking in 
order to figure out what is working best for your site.
It is our experience that you can update an entire site all at once without 
any loss of ranking but it’s not something that we would recommend doing 
without our help or the help of an SEO professional. It’s very easy to make 
a mistake. We doubt that any improvement to a site will result in a loss of 
rankings but as these modifications are extensive and often involve other 
changes with less certain benefit, we strongly suggest that you exercise cau-
tion in your updates.
Part of the maintenance aspect of your site is watching your silos to see if 
they’re a strong silo or a weak silo in the search engine rankings. One exam-
ple of a weak silo is a silo without enough content in it. If you’re not ranking 
for your theme, your silo probably needs more content, more links, or more 
pages added to it to strengthen it.

Including Traditional Site Maps
A critical part of maintaining any site is cutting back or pruning parts of the 
site that are diluting your theme. It is simply getting rid of clutter on your 
site. Keywords or pages that do not fit your silos and no longer belong on 
the site should be removed in most cases. Silo pruning also helps if you are 
doing a targeted promotion, like offering a coupon. You don’t want that to 
index because it’s going to dilute your site, so you use a piece of code (an 
iFrame, pop-up window, JavaScript link) to prune it out of the silo and insert 
the noindex command in Meta robots tag of the head section of the page. It’s 
linked so the users can find it if you want them to, but the link and the con-
tent aren’t indexed. Your users can see it, but not the search engines. Make 
it a routine part of site maintenance to remove links that decrease subject 
relevance.
 
If you prune a page that has backlinks, you should 301 redirect that URL to 
another page on your site so that you don’t break those links and lose that 
link equity.
Including Traditional Site Maps
Traditional site maps are static HTML files that outline the first and second 
level structure of a Web site. The original purpose of a site map was to 
enable users to easily find items on the Web site. Over time, they also 
became useful as a shortcut method to help search engines find and index 
all the parts of a site. Today, we recommend that you have an XML site 
map, which effectively provides an easy-to-read link dump for the spiders to 
index. Although certain Web browsers can display an XML site map for users 
to read as well, you should offer both kinds of site maps (HTML and XML) 
if you want to be sure to cover both the search engines and your users. 
However you implement them, site maps play an important role in your 
siloed Web design.
A site map displays the inner framework and organization of your site’s con-
tent to the search engines. Your site map reflects the way visitors intuitively 
work through your site. Years ago, site maps existed only as a boring series 
of links in list form. Today, they are thought of as an extension of your site. 
You should use your site map as a tool to lead your visitor and the search 
engines to more content. Create details for each section and subsection 
through descriptive text placed under the site map link. This helps your 
visitors understand and navigate through your site and also gives you more 
food for the search engines. You can even go crazy and add Flash to your 
site map! Of course, if you do include a Flash site map for your visitor, you 
must include a text-based site map as well because site maps must also aid 
users who aren’t using advanced technology like Flash or JavaScript.

416
Including Traditional Site Maps
A good site map does the following:
 
✦ Shows a quick, easy-to-follow overview of your site.
 
✦ Provides a pathway for the search engine robots to follow.
 
✦ Provides text links to every page of your site.
 
✦ Quickly shows visitors how to get where they need to go.
 
✦ Utilizes important keyword phrases.
When it comes right down to it, the purpose of a site map is to spell out the 
central content themes and to offer a cohesive representation of where to 
find information on your site. At its best, a site map is your table of contents; 
at its worst, it’s just an index.
 
Now what do site maps have to do with content siloing? A well-planned site 
map can help improve the organization of a site and focus its theme, which 
may in turn influence rankings. The reality is that few sites make any real 
effort when creating an outline of the content on their site. They add content 
arbitrarily, either as brochure marketing or a sales tool, or because they are 
told they need it to qualify for keyword ranking. Instead, the site map should 
be the first document created in a Web site construction project, laying out 
all the structure and content to follow.
We can already hear dissenting minds arguing that you can engineer a site 
to qualify for high keyword relevance without tailoring the entire site by 
subject relevance. The reality, though, is that most organizations forget 
what their focus is, and the site often devolves into a mish-mash of com-
peting subjects or is forced to remain stagnant, without any clear plan on 
how to expand content. Adding a well-designed site outline in the form of a 
traditional site map encourages organization without restricting creativity. 
A good site outline shows where the site is trying to go by offering a clear 
purpose. Since when is offering clarity a bad marketing or sales tool? Get 
everyone in your company on the same page with a well-conceived and well-
rendered site map.
 
Site maps are very important for two main reasons. First, your site map pro-
vides food for the search engine spiders that crawl your site. The site map 
gives the spider links to all the major pages of your site, allowing every page 
included on your site map to be indexed by the spider. This is a very good 
thing! Having all of your major pages included in the search engine database 
makes your site more likely to come up in the search engine results when a 
user performs a query. Your site map pushes the search engine toward the 
individual pages of your site instead of making them hunt around for links. 
A well-planned site map can ensure your Web site is fully indexed by search 
engines.

Including Traditional Site Maps
Site maps are also very valuable for your human visitors. They help them to 
understand your site structure and layout, while giving them quick access to 
your entire site. They’re also helpful for lost users in need of a lifeline. Often, if 
a visitor finds himself lost or stuck inside your site, he looks for a way to find 
what he’s looking for. Having a detailed site map shows him how to get back 
on track and find what he was looking for. Without it, your visitor may just 
close the browser or head back over to the search engines. Conversion lost.
Here are some site map dos and don’ts:
 
✦ Your site map should be linked from your home page. Linking it this way 
gives the search engines an easy way to find it and then follow it all the 
way through the site. If it’s linked from other pages, the spider might 
find a dead end along the way and just quit.
 
✦ Small sites can place every page on their site map, but larger sites 
should not. You do not want the search engines to see a never-ending 
list of links and assume you are a link farm. (More than 99 links on a 
page looks suspicious to a search engine.)
 
✦ Most SEO experts believe you should have no more than 25 to 40 links 
on your site map. This also makes it easier to read for your human visi-
tors. Remember, your site map is there to assist your visitors, not con-
fuse them.
 
✦ The anchor text (words that can be clicked) of each link should contain a 
keyword whenever possible and should link to the appropriate page.
 
✦ When you create a site map, go back and make sure that all of your links 
are correct.
 
✦ All the pages shown on your site map should also contain a link back to 
the site map.
 
✦ If you have a very extensive Web site, you should create a separate site 
map for each silo. These would link up to the site map of the silos above 
and below them, which would further reinforce your silo organization 
to the search engines. You would also create one master site map at the 
top level of your site — this would be the one linked from your home 
page — which contained links to all of the other top-level site map 
pages. The master site map would not contain all pages in your Web 
site, but would lead search engines and users to the appropriate site 
map for their area of interest. In essence, you need to silo your site map 
just like the rest of your site.
Just as you can’t leave your Web site to fend for itself, the same applies to 
your site map. When your site changes, make sure your site map is updated 
to reflect that. What good are directions to a place that’s been torn down? 
Keeping your site map current helps make you a visitor and search engine 
favorite.

418
Using an XML Site Map
Using an XML Site Map
Your XML site map should be constructed according to the current Sitemap 
Protocol format (which is regulated by www.sitemaps.org). Sitemap 
Protocol allows you to tell search engines about the URLs on your Web 
sites that should be crawled. An XML site map is a document that uses the 
Sitemap Protocol and contains a list of the URLs for a site. The Protocol was 
written by the major search engines (Google, Yahoo!, and Live Search) to be 
highly scalable so that it can accommodate sites of any size. It also enables 
Webmasters to include additional information about each URL (when it was 
last updated, how often it changes, and how important it is in relation to 
other URLs in the site) so that search engines can more intelligently crawl 
the site. Note that even though its name is similar to the traditional HTML 
site map, an XML site map is a totally different kind of document, and the 
two are not interchangeable. You shouldn’t rely on an XML site map alone 
for your site.
XML site maps define for the spider the importance and priority of the site, 
better enabling the search engine to index the entire site and to quickly re-
index any site changes, site expansions, or site reductions. This XML format 
offers excellent site indexing and spider access. Additionally, many site-
mapping tools can diagnose your XML site map, informing you of duplicate 
content, broken links, and areas that the spider can’t access. Sitemaps.org 
has a tool that constructs an XML file for you: This is a great place to start.
Google adheres to Sitemap Protocol 0.9 as dictated by www.sitemaps.
org. Site maps created for Google using Sitemap Protocol 0.9 are therefore 
compatible with other search engines that adopt the standards of www.
sitemaps.org. 
A normal version of the XML code looks something like this:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
 <urlset xmlns=”http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9”>
 <url>
 <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc>
 <lastmod>2005-01-01</lastmod>
 <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
 <priority>0.8</priority>
 </url> 
 </urlset>

slash, if your Web server requires it. This value 
must be less than 2048 characters.
<lastmod>
Optional
The date of last modification of the file. This 
date should be in W3C Datetime format. This 
format allows you to omit the time portion, if 
desired, and use the YYYY-MM-DD format.
<changefreq>
Optional
How frequently the page is likely to change. 
This value provides general information to 
search engines and may not correlate exactly 
to how often they crawl the page.
<priority>
Optional
The priority of this URL relative to other URLs 
on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0. 
This value has no effect on your pages com-
pared to pages on other sites and only lets the 
search engines know which of your pages you 
deem most important so that they can order the 
crawl of your pages in the way you prefer. The 
default priority of a page is 0.5. We recommend 
setting your landing pages at a higher priority 
and non-landing pages at a lower one.
The XML site map also must
 
✦ Begin with an opening urlset tag and end with a closing urlset tag.
 
✦ Include a url entry for each URL as a parent XML tag.
 
✦ Include a loc child entry for each url parent tag.
 
As we explain earlier in this chapter, content siloing can be strengthened 
by both traditional site maps and XML site maps. A lot of evidence supports 
the adoption of complete site transparency in search engine optimization. 
That means that all the elements of your site should consistently offer

subject relevancy. You can always work on different projects and use differ-
ent methods, but a clear and concise method of building and maintaining 
your site is the best way to go. You are helped by using traditional site maps 
and XML site maps, which ensure that everyone is on the same page. Not 
only will your IT and marketing departments agree, but even the site users 
will be able to tell what your site is trying to say.

Chapter 4: Vetting External Links
In This Chapter
✓ Identifying inbound links
✓ Avoiding poor links
✓ Identifying quality links
✓ Making the most of outbound linking
✓ Handling advertising links
✓ Dealing with link spam issues
I
n this chapter, we discuss inbound links. Inbound links are the links 
coming into your site. If you are Bob’s Classic Car Customization, and 
you get a link from Motormouth Mabel’s Classic Car Boutique, that’s 
an inbound link. In addition to rankings by content, part of how search 
engines rank pages is based on inbound links. Google’s description of their 
PageRank system (a part of Google’s link algorithm) for instance, notes that 
Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote of confidence, by 
page A, for page B. That means that they read an inbound link from another 
page as a testimonial link in your page, as if it means, “Hey, this guy knows 
what he’s talking about!” Unfortunately, like a lot of things in life, there are 
good inbound links and bad inbound links.
In this chapter, we discuss the difference between the good and the bad 
links, how to avoid the bad links, and how to figure out the good ones. We 
talk about making the most of outbound linking. We also discuss handling 
all of your advertising links and dealing with link spam issues.
Identifying Inbound Links
So how do you know who’s linking to you? Well, going back to Chapter 
2 of this minibook, we had you solicit a bunch of links from other sites. 
Generally, those are the links you’re going to know about. It might be a good 
idea to check and see if the links are still there. Sometimes, for whatever 
reason, a site stops linking to you. Perhaps it’s because they found someone 
better, perhaps it’s because their site folded, renamed the page, redesigned 
their site, who knows? (And trust us, it’s not you, it’s them . . . ) Not all links 
come from solicitation. Sometimes a site stumbles upon you and decides 
you’ll be excellent to link to, and they just give you a link. You can achieve 
this just by being awesome (or, more clearly, having good design, a lot of 
relevant information, and interesting and dynamic content that the other 
site thinks their users would be interested in).

422
Avoiding Poor Quality Links
 
One way to find out who is linking to you is to go to Google and type in 
[link:yourdomain.com]. This is the command for Google to search for your 
inbound links but you won’t get a comprehensive list this way. Google only 
shows a sample of the links they know about. To get a better list, use Yahoo!, 
go to http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com and use the site explo-
ration tool to track your inbound links.
If you are a smaller site, you need to be checking on your links constantly. 
If you have 50 incoming links, all of those are going to count towards your 
link equity (how much weight Google assigns your links). If you are a large, 
fairly well-known site, it’s not going to matter much when one or two sites 
stop linking to you, unless they are major sites . . . you need to manage those 
relationships. But little guys need all the help they can get, and every little 
bit helps.
There is also the possibility that the page linking to you has a very new 
link, and the search engines are not aware of it yet. However, this is for new 
links. If a site gave you a link a while ago (before the last time the page was 
crawled by the engine — you can see the last crawled date by looking at 
the Google cache of the page), but it’s not in the index, there’s probably a 
reason why, and it’s probably not a good one. We go over that a bit more in 
this next section.
Avoiding Poor Quality Links
Inbound linking is generally a good thing — it tells the search engines 
that you have a vote of confidence in your “expertness” level — but some 
inbound links out there only hurt you in the long run. There are several 
kinds you should be on the lookout for: from non-harmful reciprocal links to 
the riskier incestuous links, Web rings, link farms, and bad neighborhoods.
 
Google can detect when you have bad links. They can take away the link’s 
PageRank (part of their link algorithm that measures the value of the link to 
you) as well as the link and domain equity/authority and won’t pass on any 
link value to your page. Google won’t count the bad incoming link, and if 
they suspect you’re doing something sneaky and devious with it, they even 
penalize you for it. The penalty could be as simple as removing all of the link 
equity of your site, or they could punish you by reducing your rankings on 
the results page. They may even remove your page or entire site from their 
index. Ouch! We’ve stated this before, but dishonesty (like crime) never pays.
Reciprocal links
Reciprocal linking is the least worrisome of the bad inbound links. If a 
site links to you, and you give them a link back, that’s a reciprocal link. 
Unfortunately, doing this does limit the value of the link in either direction. 
Google’s usually but not always going to rate those links as having no value. 

Book VI
Chapter 4
Vetting External 
Links
423
Avoiding Poor Quality Links
The reasoning is that it is impossible for Google to judge the intent of every 
reciprocal relationship. Google doesn’t know if your intent is good or if 
you’re trying to trick them. Reciprocal links are bartered exchanges, so they 
might be treated just like an ad from a search engine perspective.
 
If you have a reciprocal link, don’t expect it to carry any value, especially if 
you have a small site. If you are linking out, link to a non-competitive relative 
expert. However, if you want to provide some reciprocal links that would be 
valuable to your visitors, by all means do so. Just be aware that they may 
not count towards your link equity.
Incestuous links
Incestuous links occur when people link to their own properties or among a 
group of friends’ sites and then try to pass the links off as legitimate links 
from outside sources. If you have several sites, and they all link to each 
other, and you’re trying to pretend that you don’t own half of those sites, 
that’s some incestuous linking going on.
There are large networks that do link between their properties, like the 
Gawker Media Network, which has links between all of its sites (www.
gawker.com, www.jezebel.com, www.io9.com, www.lifehacker.com, 
www.gizmodo.com, among many others). This is not incestuous linking 
by definition. They’re linking within their network, yes. But they are, first, 
a large company and, second, not trying to hide the fact that they own the 
sites in the networks. Generally, this happens for user experience or for 
branding purposes. Large companies know that linking within their own 
networks doesn’t mean they gain any link equity from it. In most cases, 
these links are for commercial value and perhaps credibility, but not for link 
equity or Page Rank. And most importantly, they’re not trying to hide the 
fact that they do it. It’s a general rule of thumb: If someone is trying to hide 
something that they did, they’re probably doing something wrong.
 
We call these types of links incestuous links because they are no good and 
should make you feel icky. Smaller sites caught using them are punished. 
When you are caught using incestuous links, not only do you run the risk of 
having those links devalued, but your site could also be marked as spam, 
and you may have all of your links devalued. And that’s not even the worst 
that can happen.
When you get penalized for this type of spam, your site can vanish from the 
index altogether. We know of one site (that shall remain nameless) using 
incestuous links and ranking really, really well, with a ton of link equity. 
Then Google made some tweaks to its algorithm and discovered that this 
particular site was using incestuous links. So Google punished them. The 
site’s rankings dropped down to the thousandth place on every one of its 
keywords, and they couldn’t even rank for their own name. Trust us when 
we say dishonesty doesn’t pay.

424
Avoiding Poor Quality Links
Link farms
We discussed link farms in Book I, Chapter 5 when we were talking about 
search engine spam. Spam includes any sneaky, devious, or underhanded tech-
nique used to trick search engines into giving Web sites higher rankings. Link 
farms are literally pages of hundreds (or even thousands) of links on many 
sites that all link together. This is slightly different than incestuous linking as 
you might not own the properties involved. In general, you should be very sus-
picious if someone asks for a link from your site and offers you a link from a 
totally different site in exchange. That’s a classic warning sign for a link farm.
 
Link farms are sites that have many different links to multiple different sites, 
all for the express purpose of passing link equity and giving those sites a 
higher rating in the search engines. Sometimes you can’t help it if a link farm 
links to you, however. If you discover that your site is part of one, politely ask 
for it to be removed as soon as possible. Being caught as part of a link farm 
could lead to all of your links losing their link equity or even harsher penalties.
Web rings
Web rings are not necessarily spam. Web rings are any collection of Web 
sites from around the Internet that join together through interlinking in a 
circular structure. When you join a Web ring, you are automatically part of a 
circle of related Web sites. You can tell a site belongs to a Web ring because 
they usually have a widget (an interactive piece of HTML coding) that looks 
like Figure 4-1.
It’s pretty easy to identify whether you’re in a Web ring, as the presence of 
the widget is something of a clue. We don’t recommend joining a Web ring 
because all of those links do not give you any link equity. On top of that, it 
probably isn’t worth the traffic you’ll be receiving.
 
You want natural links. People link to you because they feel that your site is 
worthwhile. Web rings are not natural links. And although they have fallen 
out of favor in recent years, they do still exist. And quite honestly, they’re 
not worth the trouble.
Bad neighborhoods
Say you have a site that wants to link to you. You take a quick look at the site 
and check to see whether it’s in the search engine’s index by entering it into 
Google. But this site does not show up anywhere in the search results. Do 
you want a link from this site? Chances are, probably not.
Sometimes a Web site is not part of the search engine’s index. It could be that 
the Web site is too newly created. But it is more likely that the Web site is from 
a bad neighborhood. This is a Web site that got yanked from a search engine 
index, and probably for a good reason. Either they were spamming or using 
other sneaky methods to try and fool the search engines, and they got caught.

Avoiding Poor Quality Links
Being part of a bad neighborhood or accepting links from a site that has 
been banished from the index is about the same as if you had suddenly asso-
ciated with the bad kids at your high school. Your site gets flagged, and you 
come under suspicion of using spam techniques yourself.
Normally when Google “flags” you, your site gets a serious search by a 
human instead of their normal algorithms. That means that anything you 
have hidden from the search engines in images or with any other kind of 
technology is visible. It is a little bit like being audited. If the person doing 
the inspection catches you doing something wrong, you are penalized. You 
will most likely be punished by getting kicked out of the search index. If you 
catch any unsavory linkage from sites in a bad neighborhood, drop them an 
e-mail and ask for your site to be removed. Also, this is why we insist that 
you keep all things on your site above-board and clean — Google doesn’t 
inform you if you have been flagged. They might send you an e-mail if you 
have Google Webmaster Tools, but otherwise, if you’re flagged and they dis-
cover anything wrong, you are simply punished.
 
You can’t help it if someone chooses to link to your site. But it’s a good 
idea to avoid actively attracting unsavory attention. Try to avoid poor links 
whenever you can, and focus on attracting quality links that will add to your 
PageRank and grant you link equity. If you do get an unsavory link, try to dis-
tance yourself from them as much as you can.

Identifying Quality Links
Identifying Quality Links
So we’ve talked about the kind of links that you don’t want to attract, but 
what about the ones that you do? Quality links are links that contribute 
to your perceived expertness and your overall link equity. These are the 
links that point to you and declare that you know what it is you’re doing. 
Your classic car customization site would want the kind of links that shout, 
“These people are good at what they do, and we think you should check 
them out.” Because those kinds of links establish you as an expert.
There are three different types of quality links that you want to attract:
 
✦ Complementary subject relevance links
 
✦ Expert relevance reinforcement links
 
✦ Quality testimonial links
Complementary subject relevance
Complementary subject relevance links come from a site that has similar 
content to yours. The site might not be exactly what you do, but its subjects 
and themes are close enough to be complementary. If you have a classic car 
customization site, and you receive a link from a Web site devoted to classic 
car enthusiasts, this is a complementary link. Your site discusses something 
that their site also discusses, and they have declared your site to be worth 
reading. This kind of link is worth more than a link from, say, Jill’s House of 
Hamsters.
It doesn’t matter if the link from the hamster site has great anchor text (the 
text that is the outgoing link). The search engine is going to read the sur-
rounding text around the link on the hamster site, the overall content of 
the page, and the content of the site itself, and it’s going to figure out that 
this is a site about hamsters, and hamsters don’t really have anything to do 
with classic cars (unless, of course, instead of horsepower, your car runs on 
“hamster” power).
 
When the search engine notes that the site linking to yours doesn’t have a 
whole lot of relevance to your subject, it’s going to say that the link is not 
a quality link, and the link is not going to add anything to your overall link 
equity. It also doesn’t matter if the page linking to your site has relevance. If 
the linking site has a page devoted to mesothelioma (the cancer caused by 
asbestos), but the rest of the site is about peanut butter, the mesothelioma 
page just looks crammed in there. It’s going to dilute that site’s theme, and it 
might raise a red flag with the search engines.
Figure 4-2 is a graph about the power of sites linking to you. The numbers 
are on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the least relevant and 10 being the 
most, and the higher the number, the more your link equity goes up.

The box in the middle is your classic car site. The circle with the 1, is Harry’s 
House of Hamsters: It bears very little relevance to your site, so it carries 
very little weight. The box with the 8 is a link to a large, official auto-trading 
Web site. Because it is a large, official Web site with a lot of expertise on 
its own and it has relevance to your site, the worth of the link goes up. It’s 
important to note that we’re just using these numbers to represent varying 
weights given by relevance — we’re not referring to PageRank at all here.
Then there’s the -2 poker site that has linked to you. The poker site comes 
from a spammy, spammy industry, used to shady doings and basically being 
a headache for the search engines. Having a link from one of those sites 
not only gives you no link equity, but it might actually cause your site to 
get flagged for review if you have a lot of these kinds of shady backlinks. By 
associating with one of these sites, you make it easy for the search engines 
to assume that you are doing something shady, too. Though Google says 
that almost nothing someone else does can harm your site, that doesn’t 
mean there’s absolutely nothing at all. Don’t sweat a few bad links coming to 
you, but do your best to only work on acquiring links from quality sites.
The links you need to be attracting are the kind that have relevance to your 
industry. Remember, link equity comes from how much of an “expert” in 
your subject you are, and the more people with similar content link to your 
site, the more of an expert you are.
Expert relevance reinforcement
It’s natural to have experts link to other experts. If you are an expert in your 
field, you are naturally going to be linking to other experts in your field. It’s 
like a Nobel prize-winning physicist name-dropping another Nobel laureate 
in economics, as opposed to a kid who won his school science fair.
Experts require validation from their peers. When scientists publish a sci-
ence paper in a journal, they expect other scientists to go out and test the 
published theory on their own, in order to receive validation from these 

428
Identifying Quality Links
other scientists. The same is true for Web sites. If an expert Web site dis-
cusses you on their own site and then provides a link to you, claiming you as 
another expert, that just reinforces what you say on your own site.
To put it another way, if the biggest, baddest, classic car customization site 
on the whole Internet has a link and a section describing you and linking to 
your site, that is going to mean a lot more than your brother’s very small 
classic car site giving you a link.
Quality testimonial links
We have discussed three kinds of linking sites in this chapter — the good, 
the bad, and the really ugly:
 
✦ The good kind of link is the “expert” industry site. A big name clas-
sic auto trader site linking to your classic car customization site, for 
instance.
 
✦ The bad kind of link is the site that really has no overall relevance to 
your subject (such as the hamster site linking to the classic car site).
 
✦ And then there’s the ugly. The spammy, spammy poker site that offers 
nothing of value and only makes you look bad.
But there is one type of link that is considered the best of them all: the testi-
monial link.
A testimonial link is a link that appears in a paragraph in the context of a 
lot of relevant information and then points to you as another resource of 
information. Basically, it’s like someone describing how to properly custom-
ize classic cars, and then providing a link to your site, as in the following 
example. Note that the text “classic car customization business” would serve 
as the anchor for a link back to www.classiccarcustomization.com.
 There are many classic car customization businesses out 
there, but for the best, you have to check out Bob’s 
Classic Car Customization, which has tons of resources 
for restoring and customizing every kind of classic Ford, 
Chevy, and 50s hotrod on the planet. Check out their 
gallery of restorations for some seriously cherry autos.
A testimonial link is worth a whole lot of link equity and is one of the best 
kinds of links you can receive (as long as it’s not coming from any sites that 
practice the “worst practices for linking” we described previously).

Finding Other Ways of Gaining Link Equity
Link equity is always an important thing to keep in mind when you’re vetting 
external links. One good testimonial-grade link is worth a lot more than a 
hundred decent links or a thousand bad links. Link equity through a testimo-
nial link is the highest grade of link equity possible. We’re not quite sure why 
this is, other than Google says it is, so we’re going with that.
Finding Other Ways of Gaining Link Equity
Another thing that carries a lot of link equity weight is a link from a top-level 
domain (the root of a Web site’s URL) that ends in .edu or .gov. These are 
official domains that belong to colleges or the government. People only have 
access to these domains if they belong to either an educational establish-
ment or they work for the government. No one else can have one. These are 
exclusive domains. So a link from an .edu site (from a university controlled 
page, not from a student-owned Web page) or a .gov site is harder to obtain 
and makes you look more like an expert. It’s the difference between a link 
from Bob’s House of Hamsters and Stanford University. The .edu or .gov 
link is considered more authoritative and thus passes a lot of link equity.
 
If you obtain an .edu or a .gov link, your site is presumably doing some-
thing worthwhile to earn it because .edu or .gov sites generally do not link 
out to just any old site.
Google scores a site’s toolbar PageRank on a 
scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being worth the least 
and 10 being the highest. But there’s a mag-
nitude of difference between each level. It’s 
kind of like the Richter scale in that a 5.0 level 
earthquake is 32 times greater than a 4.0, and a 
6.0 is 1000 times greater than a 4.0.
It’s worth noting that the PageRank that appears 
in the Google toolbar is for entertainment pur-
poses only. That’s right. That PageRank number 
in the corner? Meaningless — it is only an 
indication and is updated differently from the 
PageRank algorithm. On average, that number 
is many weeks out of date. Using that PageRank 
number as a basis for your actual PageRank 
is kind of like calling a psychic hotline — it 
might be accurate, but generally it’s a shot in 
the dark.
The PageRank number in the toolbar changes 
every now and then, when Google updates it 
every so often. It is based off of a real number, 
but using it is like using a stethoscope to do 
an MRI. Real PageRank rank means some-
thing, but unfortunately there’s no way to find 
out what your actual PageRank is. So the next 
time you overhear someone bragging about 
their PageRank number in the Google toolbar, 
just smile and nod: You know that the number 
should be purely for entertainment purposes.

Making the Most of Outbound Links
Say you have an international site, like one that deals with customizing clas-
sic Volkswagen cars in Germany. You run your site from your office in the 
U.S., but your site is in Germany and hosted on a German server, with a URL 
such as www.classiccarcustomization.de. If you do have an interna-
tional site, make sure you have at least one link from within your ccTLD. 
The acronym ccTLD stands for country code top level domain. For example, 
domains coming out of the United Kingdom end in .co.uk, domains from 
Japan end in .co.jp, and so on. So your German car site would need links 
from several .de sites (for Deutschland) because that is the local domain. 
Again, your goal is to look respectable and trustworthy. If you are trying to 
do business in another country, you look better if you have recommenda-
tions from that country than if all of your links are from American sites.
Making the Most of Outbound Links
Your outbound links are the links that you have going out of your site. It’s 
important to actually have outbound links to resources and experts in your 
industry that help your visitors. It also shows the search engine that you rec-
ognize who the other experts in your industry are and helps them to define 
your site by association. Here’s a quick list of things to keep in mind for your 
outbound links:
 
✦ Link out to other experts. Pick non-competitive sites that you feel are 
relevant to your own site and are experts in their subjects. Not only 
does it increase your standing in the search engines (experts linking to 
experts), but it also makes you appear more trustworthy to users.
 
✦ Make sure the link is useful to your users. Having a bunch of irrelevant 
links on your site damages your expertise in the eyes of the search 
engines. It also makes you look bad to your users. They’re coming to 
your site for research, and if you can’t give them any useful links to 
follow, they’re probably not going to come back.
 
✦ Relevancy is key. Your links have to be relevant to your site, for you 
and the search engines.
 
✦ Validate links. Make sure your links are legitimate and won’t get you in 
trouble with the search engines.
 
✦ Be selective. If you’re associating with another Web site, make sure it’s 
worth it — no bad neighborhoods, no irrelevant links.

Handling Advertising Links
Handling Advertising Links
We talk a little about buying advertising links on other sites in previous 
chapters. Buying links for anything other than advertising or traffic purposes 
is considered pointless in search engine–land and could even be harmful to 
your site. When you buy links, they do not do anything for your link equity.
When it comes to selling links or ads (because hey, you need the revenue), 
you can display them on your site in such a way so as not to get in trouble. 
You don’t want the search engines to think that your site is a link farm, or 
that you’re trying to fool them into treating paid ads as legitimate, equity-
passing links. First, you have to state right off the bat that these are paid 
links. Call them ads, call them partner links, or call them sponsored links. 
Second, make sure that they have a “rel=nofollow” attribute included in 
the link tag, which alerts the engines that the link should not be considered 
a testimonial link and shouldn’t pass link equity. Let the audience (and the 
search engines) know that these are paid links right away.
It’s important to keep search engines from 
following advertising links on your site. You 
don’t want the search engines to index them 
and pass link equity through them. The ads are 
there for the users, not for the engines.
One of the ways you can keep your page as 
clean as possible with the advertising links is 
by using technology to hide them. You can do 
this either with iframes (putting the links in an 
imbedded frame (iframe) on the page, which 
search engine spiders see as its own sepa-
rate page) or using JavaScript. Remember that 
search engines do not crawl JavaScript, so 
they won’t be able to see the ad. JavaScript 
has the added bonus of making the ad appear 
dynamic and attractive. You can also place the 
ad and the link in an image. Search engines 
can only read text, so they can’t read or follow 
the ad in the linked image. You can also design 
your ad in Flash which the search engines 
cannot yet fully spider.
The last solution is simply to use a 
rel=”nofollow” attribute on the link. 
A rel=”nofollow” is an attribute that 
attaches itself to a piece of HTML code of the 
anchor tag (a) that tells the search engine not 
to follow the link. Users can still access the 
link, but the search engines won’t follow it.
Example:
<a href=”http://www.domain.
com/page.html” rel=”no
follow”>Link Text</a>
Using technology with advertising links

432
Dealing with Search Engine Spam
 
It’s best to play on the safe side and be as transparent about your methods 
as possible. Do not do anything to confuse or deceive the search engines. 
The easiest way for a search engine to catch you doing something wrong is 
to look like you are doing something wrong.
It’s important to note that you should always play by the search engines’ 
rules and let them know that you do have advertising links on your site. 
Otherwise, you run the risk of the search engines devaluing all of the other 
links on the page.
Dealing with Search Engine Spam
As we discussed in Book I, Chapter 6, there are several different ways that 
someone can spam (deceive or trick) the search engine into giving their 
pages higher rankings or allowing them to rank for keywords that have noth-
ing to do with their site. Search engine spammers also use links to practice 
their sneaky ways. Here are some of them:
 
✦ Link farms. A link farm is any Web site that links to a large, random 
assortment of different Web sites which all link back to each other. 
Most link farms are created through automated programs and services. 
Search engines have combated link farms by identifying specific attri-
butes that link farms use and filtering them from the index and search 
results, including removing entire domains to keep them from influenc-
ing the results page.
 
✦ White text/links on a white background. Putting white text and links 
on a white background (or black text on a black background, and so on) 
renders the text invisible to a user unless it is selected with the mouse. 
Spammers can then insert text that is merely keywords or hyperlinks 
that the spiders read and mistakenly count as relevant.
 
✦ Hidden text or links. Spammers sometimes hide content by covering it 
with an image or other layered element so it is not visible. People also 
specify a negative page position so that the page technically stretches 
up higher or wider than the browser window. Or they hide spiderable 
content under the page content (layer) so that can’t be seen with the 
naked eye. 
The problem with link spam is that you cannot help who is linking to you. 
What you can do is disassociate yourself from them as quickly as possible.
 
You might drop a line to Google and report any link farms or any other 
unsavory links to their spam department (www.google.com/webmasters/
tools/spamreport).

Dealing with Search Engine Spam
The following is Google’s policy when it comes 
to quality for the sites in their index. This was 
taken from the Google Webmaster Guidelines 
at www.google.com/support/web
masters/bin/answer.py?hl=
en&answer=35769#3. We include it here 
in its entirety as a handy guide. Be aware that 
Google does occasionally update their guide-
lines, and so you should monitor the Web site 
(or search for Google Webmaster Guidelines 
in Google) so that you’re always playing within 
the rules.
 
 These quality guidelines cover the most 
common forms of deceptive or manipula-
tive behavior, but Google may respond 
negatively to other misleading practices 
not listed here (for example, tricking users 
by registering misspellings of well-known 
websites). It’s not safe to assume that just 
because a specific deceptive technique 
isn’t included on this page, Google approves 
of it. Webmasters who spend their energies 
upholding the spirit of the basic principles 
will provide a much better user experience 
and subsequently enjoy better ranking than 
those who spend their time looking for loop-
holes they can exploit.
 
 If you believe that another site is abusing 
Google’s quality guidelines, please report 
that site at https://www.google.
com/webmasters/tools/spam
report. Google prefers developing scal-
able and automated solutions to problems, 
so we attempt to minimize hand-to-hand 
spam fighting. The spam reports we receive 
are used to create scalable algorithms that 
recognize and block future spam attempts.
Quality guidelines — basic principles
 
 Make pages primarily for users, not for 
search engines. Don’t deceive your users 
or present different content to search 
engines than you display to users, which is 
commonly referred to as “cloaking.”
 
 Avoid tricks intended to improve search 
engine rankings. A good rule of thumb is 
whether you’d feel comfortable explaining 
what you’ve done to a website that com-
petes with you. Another useful test is to 
ask, “Does this help my users? Would I do 
this if search engines didn’t exist?”
 
 Don’t participate in link schemes designed 
to increase your site’s ranking or Page
Rank. In particular, avoid links to web 
spammers or “bad neighborhoods” on the 
web, as your own ranking may be affected 
adversely by those links.
 
 Don’t use unauthorized computer programs 
to submit pages, check rankings, etc. Such 
programs consume computing resources 
and violate our Terms of Service. Google 
does not recommend the use of products 
such as WebPosition Gold™ that send 
automatic or programmatic queries to 
Google.
Quality guidelines — specific guidelines
 
 Avoid hidden text or hidden links.
 
 Don’t use cloaking or sneaky redirects.
 
 Don’t send automated queries to Google.
 
 Don’t load pages with irrelevant 
keywords.
Google’s site quality guidelines

434
Dealing with Search Engine Spam
 
 Don’t create multiple pages, subdomains, 
or domains with substantially duplicate 
content.
 
 Don’t create pages with malicious behav-
ior, such as phishing or installing viruses, 
trojans, or other badware.
 
 Avoid “doorway” pages created just for 
search engines, or other “cookie cutter” 
approaches such as affiliate programs 
with little or no original content.
 
 If your site participates in an affiliate pro-
gram, make sure that your site adds value. 
Provide unique and relevant content that 
gives users a reason to visit your site first.
 
 If you determine that your site doesn’t meet 
these guidelines, you can modify your site 
so that it does and then submit your site for 
reconsideration.

I
n recent years, the world of online social networking (sites where people 
can meet and interact with one another) has exploded in popularity. You 
may have heard of sites like MySpace and Facebook, which allow users to 
create their own Web pages and connect with other users all over the globe. 
This kind of social networking has expanded to include news sites, enter-
tainment media, and beyond.
Social networking is another way to find and attract links. The majority of 
links from link bait (media or articles specifically created to attract links) 
comes from social networking sites. Social networking is also a way to build 
your brand and a name for yourself. This is where true grassroots market-
ing begins, and if you’re creative and smart enough, you can use social net-
works to your advantage.
In this chapter, we discuss what you need to do to take advantage: blogging, 
social news sites, media optimization, social media optimization, commu-
nity building, and Web widgets.
Making Use of Blogs
Blog is short for Web log, and blogs are primarily an online conversation 
medium. Blogs can be anything from people’s personal journals to talk 
about their day, their trip to the hair salon, and the rude guy who cut them 
off on the way to the grocery store, to media and corporate blogs describing 
new products and services. Blogs cover entertainment, politics, fashion, life-
styles, and technology. If you name it, probably somebody out there is blog-
ging about it. Blogs should be updated daily, or at least a few times a week.

436
Making Use of Blogs
One way to use blogs is to set up a blog to your own Web site. A major ben-
efit is increasing the amount of content (the text and media offered on your 
site) related to your subject matter because an actively-used blog site builds 
content rapidly. A blog also helps you by improving user engagement on 
your site and strengthening your customer service: Blogs provide a place for 
you to hear from your users and to interact with them. (For more informa-
tion on setting up a blog, see Book X, Chapter 2.) In general, blogs take a lot 
of attention and time, get links very quickly, and lose them just as fast. Blogs, 
like all social media links, are high-maintenance and require consistent care.
Blogs can also benefit you when someone writes about your site or your com-
pany and links back to your Web site. The worth of a link from a blog depends, 
however. If an authoritative blog — such as Wonkette (www.wonkette.com) 
a political gossip blog, or Jalopnik (www.jalopnik.com), a car enthusiast 
blog — links to your Web site, that link could equal a whole lot of traffic for 
you, plus the prestige that comes along with it. On the other hand, most links 
from blogs are actually pretty worthless. You only see an increase in traffic 
within the first day or maybe just a few minutes; after that, the link cycles off 
the page, the blogger updates with new content, and your link is yesterday’s 
news. Links from blogs are good for passing around link bait, but not a whole 
lot else.
Blogs also have the ability for users to comment on them. You can click a 
button at the end of the blog post and leave your thoughts, criticisms, or links 
of your own. Other users can reply to your comment, as can the author of 
the blog. Blog comments usually do not pass any link equity (the worth of a 
link as defined by the search engines). The rel=”nofollow” attribute (an 
HTML code that tells search engines not to follow a link) was actually invented 
for blog comments. It was there to stop spammers from crashing blogs and 
cluttering up the comments page with useless, unrelated information. Most 
blog software programs apply a rel=”nofollow” attribute to every link by 
default, so anything in the comments is not read by a search engine.
However, don’t let the lack of link equity stop you from using the comments 
option and interacting with other readers on a blog. Like other forms of 
business networking, the comments section of a blog can be a great place to 
network with other people and find out what the guy on the street is saying 
about products or services in your industry. People interact with you in the 
comments section; they might decide to check out your site and wind up 
giving you a link from their Web site.
 
This type of link building by relationship building is a much slower process 
than the normal heavy traffic that you would receive if you were linked 
through the blog, but these kinds of links (and the traffic gained from them) 
based on a relationship formed through a blog stick around longer. Don’t be 
afraid to interact in the comments section on a blog. Just be sure to practice

Discovering Social News Sites
good etiquette. Be who you are, not some fictitious persona. Also, don’t go 
around trolling on other blogs. Trolling is the act of deliberately being rude 
and offensive just to make people angry on blogs and other Web forums, and 
most definitely gets you banned from the blog or site.
Discovering Social News Sites
Today, the Internet puts the news right at your fingertips, and there are 
hundreds of sources for news out there. You can go to a site like CNN (www.
cnn.com) or any newspaper site and read articles at their source. But the 
Internet has turned news-reading into a social activity, too. A social news 
site is a site where news stories and articles from anywhere on the Web can 
be voted on by users, and the importance of a story or article is determined 
by the audience rather than by the editors of the site or source. Several 
social news sites are out there, but the big ones are Digg (www.digg.com/), 
StumbleUpon (www.stumbleupon.com/), and Reddit (www.reddit.com/).
When you read an article on a news site, a blog, or on an Internet-savvy com-
pany Web site, at the bottom of the article, you can usually find icons such 
as the ones shown in Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Social news 
chiclets 
let readers 
submit or 
vote on an 
article.
 

438
Promoting Media on Social Networking Sites
These icons are called chiclets, which are Web icons that can be clicked to 
submit or “vote for” an article on a particular social news site. Each chi-
clet represents a different social news site. The Digg chiclet is a tiny icon 
of a figure holding a shovel (dig, get it?) When you find a story or article 
that you find interesting, you can click the Digg chiclet (or the chiclet for 
StumbleUpon, Reddit, or whatever). This takes you to Digg’s Web site, where 
you can write a short description of the news item or article and then post it 
to the Digg network.
People on the social news network have the ability to click the link to the 
story and then vote “up” or “down” on the item. (On Digg, these are known 
as “digging up” or “burying.”) The more positive votes an article receives, 
the closer it gets to the front page. With a social news network, users get to 
decide what stories are most important and entertaining.
With time, effort, and good luck, a site or article could make it to the first 
page. If it’s your site or article, congratulations! But sorry about the server 
crash. Digg alone has five or six million hits from unique users a day. Digg 
has a huge community to draw from, as do StumbleUpon and Reddit, and 
the higher you appear on their news pages, the more traffic you get. Success 
with a social news site can be both a blessing and a curse: It has the possibil-
ity of generating more permanent links, but your server might not be able to 
handle the traffic.
 
An article’s popularity varies from network to network because each net-
work has its own unique appeal to different kinds of users. Digg’s network 
tends to be generally young, male, liberal, and technology-savvy. Reddit’s 
network is a little older, has a higher population of women, and is more 
mixed in its political views. The StumbleUpon network is geared more 
towards entertainment stories and less towards news, and its demographics 
are more mixed in terms of age and gender.
There are also smaller, more niche-oriented social news networks that focus 
on a particular demographic, like a particular gender, age group, or political 
affiliation.
Promoting Media on Social Networking Sites
Social media sites are another way to get links via relationship building. 
Posts that promote your engagement objects are good forms of link bait that 
can pay off with huge amounts of traffic and short term links. Taking advan-
tage of the social media sites requires some advanced planning. After you’ve 
identified which site would be best for your subject, you still need to make 
some decisions about how, when, and what. If you plan to submit different 
forms of media to social networking sites, consider optimizing it for those 
sites first. The media in question includes videos, podcasts, and images.

Promoting Media on Social Networking Sites
If you have videos, put them on your Web site as well as on video-sharing 
sites like YouTube (www.youtube.com). People who view them on the 
other site read your description and hopefully will follow a link back to your 
site that you include in the description, as in Figure 5-2.
 
Figure 5-2:

their videos

back to their 
site in the 
description.
 
 
Your media has to be engaging. Make it funny, creative, educational, and 
engaging or, if all else fails, controversial. You want to get people talking 
about it. Don’t be afraid to make people angry, if it comes right down to it. 
One of the fastest ways to get links to a blog is to write something that is 
sure to make people angry, but turn the comments off. People go running 
back to their own blogs and newsfeeds to write what they think about you, 
with a link back to your site. This benefits you in terms of link equity. The 
thing about link equity is that Google doesn’t care if a link is positive or 
derogatory. Google still passes link equity.
Another thing to keep in mind about your content is not to be stingy with 
it. Share it! A comparison has been made about media and the card game 
Canasta. In Canasta, a good strategy to win is to give away all of your best 
cards in the beginning so that you get them back at the end. Similarly, if you 
freely give away your media, people come to your Web site.

Social Media Optimization
For example, you can put your images on the photo-sharing site Flickr (www.
flickr.com) under the Creative Commons license, which allows you 
either to retain some rights over your image or to make it free for use in the 
public domain. (You can find out more about the Creative Commons license 
options at http://creativecommons.org/). You can make the images 
free for public use as long as they provide a link back to your site, which 
people generally more than happily provide. In any kind of photo-sharing 
network, you also have the option of tagging your photos with relevant key-
words, as well as providing links to your site.
As with most links you want to attract, you want to attract media links natu-
rally. You want links to come to you on their own because people find and 
enjoy the media you put out there and think your site is a relevant and enter-
taining place that they would recommend to other users to check out. You 
have to have a vested interest in creating quality content. Give the people 
out there something of value. An example is musician Jonathan Coulton, who 
makes all of his songs available for public use under the Creative Commons 
license on his Web site. He allows others to take his songs and use them for 
their videos and media projects. Using this, he is able to introduce his music 
to a much wider audience. Go to YouTube and check out how many people 
are using his music for their own projects and you’ll get an idea.
If you have a classic car customization Web site, a good example of both 
utilizing video and giving things away would be to make a video about how 
to properly repair chipped paint on a classic car, or fix a dented fender. 
(Or, get a little silly and teach them to properly hang dice from a rearview 
mirror.) But you want to do so in a way that is clever and entertaining. For 
instance, you might dress up as ninjas while repairing the chipped paint. 
The easiest way to draw people to you is to be clever and entertaining. (This 
is why it’s a good idea to watch those social news networks, so you can see 
what is funny versus something that is definitely not funny.)
You can also allow people to take your content that is under the Creative 
Commons license and post it on their own sites, as long as they give you a 
link back. People are usually more than glad to give you a link.
Social Media Optimization
Social media is any sort of online environment that allows social interaction, 
including blogs, social news sites like Digg (www.digg.com) and Reddit 
(www.reddit.com), social networking sites like MySpace (www.myspace.
com) and Facebook (www.facebook.com), and others. Social media sites 
have become great for branding. Not only can they bring you inbound 
links, but they also provide great opportunities for reputation management 
because you can read and respond to what’s being said about your brand.

Social Media Optimization
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is a popular microblogging site that allows 
you to update your status via the Web or through text messaging (Micro-
blogs are like blogs, but they only allow you to update a few words at time.) 
Google reads microblogs a lot because of how frequently they are updated. 
But even more than that, Twitter is a great way to control your branding 
because it allows you to go out and engage other users.
 
The important thing to remember is to snap up your brand name right away 
on each of the major social media sites. Go out and register your name and 
every variation that you can think of as fast as you can. You want to keep 
others from taking them and potentially using them to pretend to be you, 
damaging your online reputation (we go over this more later in this chapter). 
This has happened many times, and when someone does take your name 
before you can register it, there’s not much you can do about it. So make 
sure you grab your own brand name.
What follows is a list of social networks at the time of writing that are good 
for search engine optimization (SEO). The Internet is an ever-changing 
entity, so it’s safe to say that this list will change and expand, but these are 
good places to start. All of these sites allow followable links in your profile 
area for search engines:

Community Building
Community building is managing your reputation and brand building via the 
social networks. Social networks are not a traditional network, so traditional 
networking is not really going to work here. People on the Internet react 

Book VI
Chapter 5
Connecting with 
Social Networks
443
Community Building
differently. For one thing, traditional advertising, such as, “Our product 
is great, please buy it!” generally does not fly with the Internet audience. 
Many big companies do not do very well with Internet marketing, and that’s 
because they’re using the same types of traditional marketing messages that 
work in print and TV advertising. On the whole, Internet users are turned off 
by traditional marketing methods.
 
So what do you do in this situation? The solution is to give away control. 
That’s right: There is only so much you can do for your brand, and, at a cer-
tain point, you must allow it to work for itself. When you’re engaging others 
in a conversation on the Internet about your brand, you cannot control the 
conversation. You can only be a participant in it.
A Web site for a large car manufacturing company was able to find out about 
problems with its vehicles through its Internet forums (a message board 
where users can log on and post about topics on a related subject). If you 
are willing to use social networks and actually listen to what your users say, 
you can get some great feedback on your products and services, and on 
your competition as well. People are honest in forums (almost brutally so). 
Don’t disregard the positive or negative feedback. This is good, usable infor-
mation. You can see what you are doing right, and what your competition is 
doing right. On the flip side, you can also pinpoint where your weaker areas 
are, and where your competition is messing up.
Twitter (www.twitter.com) is also a great resource for this. You can pay 
attention to what people are saying about you, and you have the ability to 
search and listen in. With Twitter, you can follow people (that is, read all of 
their posts) and, in return, people follow you and read your posts. Figure 5-3 
is an example of a Twitter page. Twitter consists of nothing but short posts 
(the maximum you can type in one post is 140 characters including spaces).
 
Companies can search for their names in your posts. A colleague tweeted 
(that’s what Twitter calls posting) about Southwest Airlines when his flight 
was late, and, six minutes later, a Southwest Airlines representative was fol-
lowing him on Twitter.
Another example is a cable TV company that has used Twitter to help 
improve its reputation. The company does not have a great reputation when 
it comes to customer service. However, they assigned an employee to do 
nothing but manage a Twitter account for the company. His job is to sit on 
Twitter and catch tweets about problems with the company, respond, and 
then fix their problems. And he does. He offers technical solutions through 
Twitter, and then he calls and arranges for a service technician to come out 
to fix problems he cannot fix himself. This is an example of a company using 
social networks to the fullest. The company is using Twitter to fix problems 
and expand its reputation as a company that cares about its customers.

Figure 5-3: 
When 
logged in, 
your Twitter 
home page 
has a profile 
box and 
timeline of 
updates 
from people 
you’re

Another example is Zappos (www.zappos.com). Zappos is an online shoes 
retailer. Every employee is on Twitter, and they are encouraged to talk. This 
is community building for the company. Even the CEO has his own Twitter 
account. For Zappos, it’s not just their product they’re selling; they are sell-
ing customer satisfaction. They’re selling themselves. With their products, 
they provide free overnight shipping. They don’t advertise this, but when 
a user makes a purchase, Zappos e-mails them and informs them that they 
have free overnight shipping. Plus, they have a very easy return policy. 
Simply call them, and you are sent a box with a label, for no charge, and you 
are given a refund. The point of Zappos is not how much money a customer 
spends, but whether their customer is satisfied. This is a grassroots market-
ing campaign that works not only because their satisfied customers want to 
do business with them again, but also because they tell others about their 
experiences and bring in new customers to Zappos.
On the Internet, people are going to care more about a company that seems 
to be listening to them and engaging them. That is why it is important to 
always be genuine with your customers and with people on the social media 
sites. You have to be out there, talking to your customers. But be honest. 
People — on the Internet, and everywhere else — hate being lied to. If they 
find out you are not being genuine about yourself or your intentions, woe to 
you. As Shakespeare once (sort of) said, “Hell hath no fury like an Internet 
scorned.”

Incorporating Web 2.0 Functioning Tools
 
Astro-turfing is a term used for a fake grassroots market campaign (a term 
based on AstroTurf, which is artificial grass). For example, it was discovered 
that several blogs praising Wal-Mart were fake. Supposedly these blogs were 
written by “real” customers, but they were actually written by Wal-Mart’s 
public relations firm. This was uncovered because the bloggers sloppily pro-
vided links to their PR firm. Needless to say, that did not go over well with 
the Internet audience. Be warned: As soon as people find out they’re being 
deceived, they turn on you.
Lonelygirl15 was a popular video blog series on YouTube, until it was 
discovered that the girl was an actress, and the blogs were scripted. 
Lonelygirl15’s popularity dropped off sharply after that, and the video blog 
series is now defunct. If you are going to create something along these lines, 
be upfront right away that this is not real. Don’t hide the fact that something 
is a marketing campaign. Users do not like feeling tricked.
You also have to be concerned about the problem of people taking your 
brand and then using it to harm you. On Twitter, there was a case where a 
company supposedly had two IT guys giving out advice on how to fix prob-
lems, both with account names that included the brand name. The trouble 
was that one of these IT guys was a fake and did not work for the company 
and was giving out particularly bad advice. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much 
the company could do beyond letting people know that the person was not 
employed by their company. (This is also why it is important to keep track 
of your employees and what it is that they’re supposed to be doing.)
If someone illegitimate does get a hold of your brand name, you can’t do a 
whole lot other than distance yourself from him and make sure that your 
customers know that the guy that stole your name or who is pretending to 
be you is not affiliated with you in any way.
 
The Internet is still like the Wild West. There is no law out there to deter 
someone who registers your brand name, and no punishments for people 
who pretend to be you. The most you can do is register your Web site under 
a federal copyright and hope that gives you enough teeth to take out some-
one who steals your name. (See Book V, Chapter 5 for more on copyright 
infringement.)
Incorporating Web 2.0 Functioning Tools
What is Web 2.0? It’s the current wave of technology aimed at bringing 
people together, enhancing creativity, and stimulating conversation. The 
next stage of the Web means going from static pages without any interac-
tion to a living site that reacts to the users and gives visitors a way to affect 
the status of the page. Social networking sites, where you can upload your 

446
Incorporating Web 2.0 Functioning Tools
profile, talk to friends, and make new connections, are the most well known 
aspect of Web 2.0. When we talk about Web 2.0 functioning tools, we’re 
actually talking about widgets. A widget is a piece of HTML code that can be 
imbedded in a page that a user can interact with. One social media profes-
sional likes to say that a widget is what’s left of a page if you get rid of all the 
junk like the navigation, the template, and the footer and only leave the con-
tent. That’s pretty accurate.
But there are other kinds of widgets as well. On many personal blogs are 
links to online quizzes. These quizzes can be about anything from personal-
ity, astrology, which TV show character you most resemble, or how long you 
can survive chained to a bunk bed with a velociraptor. For the most part, 
these quizzes are for entertainment purposes only. But all of these widgets 
feature a link for other users who see these quizzes and want to take them 
themselves, and will bring other users into that Web site. The results of the 
quiz come with a line of HTML code that you can use to post your results on 
your personal blog, or on your other social networking page (like Facebook 
or MySpace). The HTML coding presents an image with your results and link 
back to the site with the quiz.
A clever and entertaining widget can generate lots of traffic for your site and 
bring you plenty of links because all the widgets feature a link back to your 
site. These can be both fun and functional. For your classic car site, you 
could create a quiz that tells a person which classic car matches their per-
sonality most, along with an image and link back to your site.
 
It’s very important to prominently display your link and not try to hide it. 
If you are hiding something, the search engines might think you are doing 
something wrong. The link must also be relevant to the widget and your Web 
site. Don’t hide links to other sites in the widget; otherwise, the links from 
the widget are discounted. Also, beware of using widgets for spam. Don’t use 
the widget for any sneaky, devious, or underhanded techniques. You will be 
caught and punished.
You can use other types of widgets for your site. Again, just make sure 
they’re relevant. You might have a widget on your site that can tell your 
users what time it is in Tokyo, but if it’s for your American classic car cus-
tomization site, it wouldn’t be relevant. What might be better is a quiz that 
determines whether your driving skills enable you to outrun a herd of ram-
paging wildebeests (because people respond to cleverness and creativity, 
and, when all else fails, wildebeests are always entertaining).
Another type of widget that might be worthwhile is a poll. Polls ask ques-
tions and publish counts of people’s answers, like in Figure 5-4.

Book VI
Chapter 5
Connecting with 
Social Networks
447
Incorporating Web 2.0 Functioning Tools
A poll is a way of engaging your audience and finding out what it is that 
they’re actually thinking. Your audience also checks back to see how the 
poll is doing, and, if you leave a comments section with the poll, your audi-
ence can interact with one another and discuss the poll. Even if the poll 
doesn’t actually mean anything, if you make it fun, it can help build com-
munity and bring you traffic. Another example of widgets includes a sports 
statistics ticker that constantly gives updates. It could include scores, who’s 
won, who’s on first, and so on. These are useful for sites that are related to 
sports in some way.
Stock market tickers are another excellent example of a widget. They give 
constant updates on how the stock market is doing that day — although 
these days, you might prefer to remain in the dark. These are useful for 
sites having to do with finances or brokerage firms. Pretty much anything 
you think of can be a widget. In most cases, if you have an idea for a widget, 
you need to build it yourself or hire a clever programmer to build it for you. 
Some companies do have widgets of their own that you can customize (like 
for a poll), but that’s not always the case.
The primary results of widgets are traffic and engagement, and the second-
ary results are branding and linking. An effective and clever widget can be 
associated with your Web site and ultimately boost your brand.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Even a very 
simple poll 
invites user 
engagement.

our Web server is the software application/service that runs your Web 
site. (The term Web server can be used to refer to both the hardware 
and the software that runs a Web site, but here we’re talking about the soft-
ware.) Anytime a user does something on your site, such as load a page or 
view an image, it’s your Web server that receives the request and serves up 
what the user wants. Like a good waiter in a restaurant, your site’s server 
should be as fast and efficient as possible so that your site visitors feel 
happy and well satisfied.
Server issues impact search engine ranking, from the type of server you use 
to how well it performs. Sites that frustrate users by being slow or unavail-
able are not the type of sites that any search engine wants to present in its 
results. A slow server, or a server that fails often, can cause a site to drop 
out of the search engine’s index (the databases of Web site content that 
Google, Yahoo!, or Microsoft Live Search pulls from when delivering search 
results), or prevent a site from ever being indexed in the first place. A key 
and yet often overlooked point of failure for a Web site is the server environ-
ment where it resides.
If your site is up and running, you are either operating your own server 
equipment or using a hosting facility. Either way, you need to know what 
type of server you use. You also need to know something about the IP 
address that your site occupies. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is the 
numeric code that identifies the logical address where your site resides on 
the Web — as well as other server-level factors that can have a big impact 
on your success with your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts.

452
Meeting the Servers
In this chapter, we discuss the importance of choosing the right server and 
keeping your server in optimal health. You also discover ways to identify 
server problems that can have a negative impact upon your search engine 
ranking so that you can address them.
Meeting the Servers
In the world of Web servers, two competitors hold more than 90 percent 
of the market share: Apache and Microsoft IIS. In this section, we give you 
some basic information on each server to introduce you to these two reign-
ing heavyweights.
Using the Apache server
The most popular Web server on the market, the Apache HTTP Server is 
an open-source software application (a computer program whose source 
code is available for free to the public) maintained by the Apache Software 
Foundation. Currently in version 2.2.9, the Apache Web server supports 
approximately 50 percent of all sites on the World Wide Web. The fact 
that it’s free may contribute to its popularity, but the Foundation people 
in charge say it also contributes to its strength because the entire Internet 
community can participate in identifying and fixing bugs and in improving 
the software.
 
For search engine optimization purposes, Apache is the best server avail-
able. Its configuration options make it the most flexible server, which is 
important because SEO requires constant monitoring and tweaking. Apache 
also gives you direct access to the server even if a third-party hosting pro-
vider runs your site. This is a crucial advantage over a straight Microsoft IIS 
server environment.
Using the Microsoft IIS server
The main competitor to the Apache server is Microsoft Internet Information 
Services (IIS). This proprietary software (meaning that it must be purchased 
from Microsoft) provides a platform for running a Web site. IIS is currently 
in version 7.0 and comes included with the Windows Server 2008 operating 
system for data centers.
Microsoft IIS is the next-best server available after Apache. The main disad-
vantage with IIS occurs if your site resides on a shared server operated by a 
third-party hosting provider. With an IIS server, only the administrator can 
access the server directly — so anytime you need to look at or make changes 
to your server files, you have to go through the hosting provider, which can 
cause delays and end up being a little frustrating. However, if you have a dedi-
cated server (not shared with any other sites) that you can access directly, 
the IIS server can accommodate your SEO needs if you have administrator-
level access rights.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Server Issues: Why 
Your Server Matters
453
Making Sure Your Server Is Healthy, Happy, and Fast
 
You can overcome some of the administrator-rights requirements and get 
Apache-like, flexible functionality out of your IIS Web server. To do this, you 
need to install an ISAPI_Rewrite plug-in into IIS. ISAPI stands for Internet 
Server Application Program Interface, and ISAPI_Rewrite software can be 
obtained from several vendors. If you’re using IIS 7.0, we suggest you down-
load it directly from Microsoft. Another version that is excellent and that 
works well on IIS 5.0, 6.0, or 7.0 comes from Helicon Tech (www.isapi
rewrite.com/). (For more information on ISAPI_Rewrite, see Chapter 4.)
Using other server options
A bunch of other little guys out there also offer Web servers. Sun Microsystems’ 
Sun Java System is the most well known of the also-rans, but there’s a plethora 
of others with intriguing names like AppWeb, Barracuda, Cherokee, Yaws, and 
IceWarp. Red Hat makes an enterprise (large-scale) edition of the Apache server 
that targets large clients with high-traffic demands. All of these have different 
limitations that you won’t find with the Big Two (Apache and Microsoft IIS).
 
For your SEO efforts, you want to make sure that your site uses either an 
Apache or a Microsoft IIS server. We recommend these servers as only they 
provide the flexibility and performance you need.
Making Sure Your Server Is Healthy, Happy, and Fast
A slow server can spell disaster for your site. If the search engines keep trying 
to visit your site to no avail, eventually they may stop trying. They don’t want 
to index a site that isn’t going to load when users try to access it — search 
engines don’t want to give their users unreliable, slow information. That kind 
of thing makes the search engine look bad.
If your Web site takes forever to load a new page, or links end in error mes-
sages, you also won’t have happy site visitors. And you may lose their busi-
ness for good.
To succeed with search engines and users, you need a fast, clean server. 
You should check your server’s health regularly to ensure it’s performing 
well. Here are three things you should look for:
 
✦ Malfunctions: You need to make sure that your site remains free of 
server problems such as improper redirects (HTML commands that 
detour a request to a different page), script errors or malfunctions that 
could cause a page not to display.
 
✦ Fast processing speed: Speed counts a lot with the search engines. Kind 
of like the postal service through rain, sleet, or snow, the search engine 
spiders have a lot of ground to cover as they roam the Internet. If your 
site bogs down their progress due to a slow server, they’re less likely to 
crawl it completely and won’t re-index it as often.

Making Sure Your Server Is Healthy, Happy, and Fast
 
 Servers, in the overall scheme of things, are pretty cheap. If you take the 
cost divided by the number of visitors per year, you are talking about 
pennies. You should therefore address speed issues head-on, buying 
servers any time performance is slow.
 
✦ Clean and uncrowded IP: Your IP address also matters and should be 
monitored because your site can be adversely affected if another site on 
your IP is caught spamming (intentionally trying to deceive or manipu-
late the search engines) or doing other dirty deeds.
Running a Check Server tool
One way to check the status of your server is to run a quick diagnostic util-
ity called a Check Server tool. This is a utility that attempts to crawl your site 
the same way a search engine spider does. If the Check Server tool runs into 
any obstacles that could prevent the spider from indexing your site, it tells 
you about them on a report that the utility creates. Even if your content is 
perfect, a poorly functioning server can keep your site from reaching its full 
potential in the search engine rankings. It’s a good idea to run this diagnos-
tic tool on a regular basis.
You can use any Check Server tool you have access to. You can also use the 
free Check Server tool located on our Web site. To run our Check Server, do 
the following:
 
1. Go to www.seotoolset.com/tools/free_tools.html.
 
2. Under the heading Check Server, enter your Web site’s domain (such 
as www.yourdomain.com).
 
3. Click the Check Server Header button and wait until the report 
displays.
A Check Server tool performs several different page requests and checks the 
returned status codes and the content. If they don’t match up, by showing 
error codes or inconsistent page content, it may be that your server is show-
ing the search engines an error, even though there’s no real problem. Having 
this information lets you fix issues quickly, which is important because 
search engines often reduce Web site rankings due to Web server errors 
they encounter. At the very least, even if you encounter a common error that 
would not cause you to be dropped from the index, a “cleaner” site is likely 
to rank higher in the search engine results.

Right below the table on the first page of the report, you’ll notice a number — 
in Figure 1-1, it’s 200. This represents the Web page’s status as a search engine 
would see it. In this case, 200 means the page is normal.
Table 1-1 explains the most common server status codes. These server sta-
tuses are standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an inde-
pendent governance organization that oversees Internet standards, so they 
mean the same thing to everyone. We’ve boiled down the technical language 
into understandable English to show you what each server status code 
means about your Web page. The official definitions can be found on the 
W3C site at www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html in 
case you want to research further.

200
OK
The Web page 
appears as 
expected.
This is what you want to see. 
Your server and Web page 
have the welcome mat out 
for the search engine spiders 
(and users too).
301
Moved 
Permanently
The Web page 
has been redi-
rected perma-
nently to another 
Web page URL.
When a search engine spider 
sees this status code, it moves 
easily to the appropriate new 
page. A 301 Redirect status is 
not a problem for your search 
engine optimization.
302
Found (Moved 
Temporarily)
The Web page 
has been moved 
temporarily to a 
different URL.
This status should raise a 
red flag if it’s on your Web 
server. Even though there 
are supposed to be legiti-
mate uses for a 302 Redirect 
code, they can cause serious 
problems for your optimi-
zation efforts. Spammers 
frequently use 302 Redirects 
maliciously, so if you don’t 
want a search engine mistak-
ing your site for a spam site, 
avoid them.
400
Bad Request
The server could 
not understand 
the request 
because of bad 
syntax.
This could be caused by a 
typo in the URL. Whatever 
the cause, you don’t want a 
search engine spider blocked 
from reaching your content 
pages, so investigate this if 
you see this status code on 
your site.
401
Unauthorized
The request 
requires user 
authentication.
Usually this means that you 
need to log in before you can 
view the page content. Not a 
good error for spiders to hit.
403
Forbidden
The server 
understood the 
request, but 
refuses to fulfill it.
If you find this status code on 
your Web site, find out why. If 
you want to block the spiders 
from entering, there ought to 
be a good reason.

The other thing you can glean from the Check Server report is whether the 
page is cloaked. Cloaking (showing one version of a page’s content to users, 
but a different version to the spiders) is a big no-no with the search engines, 
so if your page appears to be cloaked, you need to know about it. If the page 
uses cloaking, it says so right on the report.
Indulging the need for speed
 
You also want to monitor your site’s performance, which is computer-speak 
for speed. The faster your server can deliver a page after it has been 
requested, the better. You want your human visitors to have a smooth, 
pleasant experience using your site because that leads to more conversions 
for you (which could be sales, sign-ups, subscriptions, votes, or whatever 
action that you want people to take on your site). More importantly for your 
search engine rankings, you want the search engine spiders to be able to 
move fast and freely through your site. The quicker they can get to your 
pages, the more pages they’ll index and the more often they’ll come back.
You can tell how long it takes a search engine spider to retrieve your Web 
pages. This information shows up as a call in your server log (a server log 
is a complete record of requests sent to the Web server and the server’s 
actions in response). You should be able to check your server logs and

establish a benchmark, and then regularly check it again for comparison. If 
checking your server logs sounds too complicated, try this easier way: Use 
the Web Page Analyzer free tool offered at www.websiteoptimization.
com/services/analyze/ instead. Either way, one factor that influences 
your search results ranking is your page response time, so this is a good 
thing to keep tabs on.
 
Many factors influence your Web site’s performance. The user’s Internet 
connection speed, location, and computer have a big impact on how fast 
they perceive your site to be, factors that are frustratingly out of your con-
trol. When a search engine spider comes to crawl your site, you can rest 
assured that on their end, things are humming. On your end, though, many 
things can affect site speed. These include server computing power (also 
known as chip speed) and setup, the amount of Internet bandwidth avail-
able compared to the amount of traffic, the efficiency of your HTML code 
and programming, contention with other sites sharing your IP, and whether 
you’re the only site on your IP address, to name a few.
Excluding Pages and Sites from the Search Engines
Sometimes you need to block a spider from crawling a Web page or site. For 
instance, you may have a development version of your Web site where you 
work on changes and additions to test them before they become part of your 
live Web site. You don’t want search engines to index this “in-progress” copy 
of your Web site because that would cause a duplicate-content conflict with 
your actual Web site. You also wouldn’t want users to find your in-progress 
pages. So you need to block the search engines from seeing those pages.
Using a robots text file
 
The best way to exclude pages from the search engines’ view is with a 
robots text (.txt) file. The robots text file’s job is to give the search engines 
instructions on what not to spider within your Web site. This is a simple text 
file that you can create using a program like Notepad, and then save with the 
filename robots.txt. Place the file at the root of your Web site (such as www.
yourdomain.com/robots.txt), which is where the spiders expect to find 
it. In fact, whenever the search engine spiders come to your site, the first 
thing they look for is your robots text file. This is why you should always 
have a robots text file on your site, even if it’s blank. You don’t want the spi-
ders’ first impression of your site to be a 404 error (the error that comes up 
when a file cannot be located).
With a robots text file, you can selectively exclude particular pages, directo-
ries, or the entire site. You have to write the HTML code just so, or the spi-
ders ignore it. The command syntax you need to use comes from the Robots 
Exclusion Protocol (REP), which is a standard protocol for all Web sites. 

Book VII
Chapter 1
Server Issues: Why

459
Excluding Pages and Sites from the Search Engines
And it’s very exact; only specific commands are allowed, and they must 
be written correctly with specific placement, uppercase/lowercase letters, 
punctuation, and spacing. This file is one place where you don’t want your 
Webmaster getting creative.
A very simple robots text file could look like this:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /personal/
This robots text file tells all search engine robots that they’re welcome to 
crawl anywhere on your Web site except for the directory named /personal/.
Before writing a command line (such as Disallow: /personal/), you 
first have to identify which robot(s) you’re addressing. In this case, the line 
User-agent: * addresses all robots because it uses an asterisk, which is 
known as the wild card character because it represents any character. If you 
want to give different instructions to different search engines, as many sites 
do, write separate User-agent lines followed by their specific command 
lines. In each User-agent: line, you would replace the asterisk (*) charac-
ter with the name of a specific robot:
User-agent: Googlebot would get Google’s attention.
User-agent: Slurp would address Yahoo!.
User-agent: MSNBot would address Microsoft Live Search.
Note that if your robots text file has User-agent: * instructions as well 
as another User-agent: line specifying a specific robot, the specific robot 
follows the commands you gave it individually instead of the more general 
instructions.
You can type just a few different commands into a robots.txt file:
 
✦ Excluding the whole site: To exclude the robot from the entire server, 
you use the command:
Disallow: /
 
This command actually removes all of your site’s Web pages from the search 
index, so be careful not to do this unless that is what you really want.
 
✦ Excluding a directory: (A word of caution — usually, you want to be 
much more selective than excluding a whole directory.) To exclude a 
directory (including all of its contents and subdirectories), put it inside 
slashes:
Disallow: /personal/

460
Excluding Pages and Sites from the Search Engines
 
✦ Excluding a page: You can write a command to exclude just a particular 
page. You only use a slash at the beginning and must include the file 
extension at the end. Here’s an example:
Disallow: /private-file.htm
 
✦ Directing the spiders to your site map: In addition to Disallow:, another 
useful command for your SEO efforts specifies where the robot can find 
your site map — the page containing links throughout your site organiza-
tion, like a table of contents:
Sitemap: http://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml 
We should point out that in addition to the previously listed commands, 
Google recognizes Allow as well. This is applicable to Google only and may 
confuse other engines, so we don’t recommend using it.
 
We recommend that you always include at the end of your robots text file a 
Sitemap: command line. This ensures that the robots find your site map, 
which helps them navigate more fully through your site so that more of your 
site gets indexed.
A few notes about the robots text file syntax:
 
✦ The commands are case-sensitive, so you need a capital D in Disallow.
 
✦ There should always be a space following the colon after the command.
 
✦ To exclude an entire directory, put a forward slash after as well as before 
the directory name.
 
✦ If you are running on a UNIX machine, everything is case-sensitive.
 
✦ All files not specifically excluded are available for spidering and indexing.
If you discover that a search engine has 
indexed content from your Web site that you 
wanted to exclude, there is something you can 
do about it. The search engines offer ways to 
request that a particular URL be removed from 
their index. Here are links to get the instruc-
tions (or you can search for current info):

Excluding Pages and Sites from the Search Engines
To see a complete list of the commands, robot names, and instructions 
about writing robots text files, go to www.robotstxt.org.
 
Always be aware of your robots text tag. Mistakes here can absolutely 
destroy your site’s rankings in the search engine. Here’s a story that’s unfor-
tunately all too common about a business that learned about this the hard 
way. The company had a huge Web site and multiple development environ-
ments where they made changes and tested new pages before those pages 
went live. Of course, they had a robots text file set to Disallow: / all 
pages on the test site because they didn’t want the search engines to index 
an in-progress copy of their Web site.
After a major revision, they moved the finished test site into place, replacing 
the old site files entirely — including the robots text file. Unfortunately, they 
neglected to take out the Disallow: / command. Soon the search engines 
stopped crawling their pages. Their site started to drop like a boulder in the 
rankings, and no one knew why. It took them three days to figure out that 
the cause was their robots text file! By simply changing one line of code in 
that file, they fixed the problem, but it was a costly lesson. Their estimated 
revenue loss topped $150,000 per day. The moral of the story: Don’t forget to 
update your robots.txt when you upload a new site!
 
As a further safeguard, make it part of your weekly site maintenance to 
check your robots text file. It’s such a powerful on/off switch for your site’s 
SEO efforts that it merits a regular peek to make sure it’s still “on” and func-
tioning properly.
Using Meta Robots tags
Besides the robots text file, there is also another way you can prevent 
search engines from seeing something on your site. On an individual Web 
page, you can include a special tag in the HTML code to tell robots not to 
index that page, or not to follow the links on that page. You would place this 
tag after the other Meta tags, which are part of the HTML code located in the 
head section of a Web page.
Using Meta robots tags is less efficient than using a site-wide robots text 
file for two reasons. First, robots sometimes ignore Meta robots tags, and 
second, these tags slow down the robots reading your pages, which may 
decrease the number of pages they’re willing to crawl. Also, this method can 
give your Webmaster headaches because the tags have to be maintained on 
the individual pages, rather than in a central file.
The Meta robots tag below tells the search engine robot not to index the 
page and not to follow any of the links on the page:
<META NAME=”ROBOTS” CONTENT=”NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW”>

462
Excluding Pages and Sites from the Search Engines
You could use this tag to tell the robot to read and index the page’s content, 
but not to follow any of the links:
<META NAME=”ROBOTS” CONTENT=”INDEX, NOFOLLOW”>
The next tag instructs the robot to ignore the page’s content, but follow the 
links:
<META NAME=”ROBOTS” CONTENT=”NOINDEX, FOLLOW”>
Being wise to different search engine robots
Not all search engines are created equal. We focus on Google, Yahoo!, and 
Microsoft Live Search because they account for nearly all search-generated 
traffic on the Web. Even among these three, however, you find a few slightly 
different options for your robots.txt file and Meta robots tags.
For example, you can use a different Meta robots tag per search engine 
to partially control where the two-line description that accompanies your 
page’s link on a search engine results page (SERP) should come from. To 
see what we’re talking about, look at Figure 1-2, which shows a typical SERP 
result with its two-line description highlighted.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Server Issues: Why

463
Excluding Pages and Sites from the Search Engines
The search engines pull SERP descriptions from varying places, depending 
on which seems most relevant to the user’s search query. They often pull 
information from a directory that they either manage or contract with, which 
is a hand-assembled set of Web site data arranged like a list. Different search 
engines work with different directories.
 
✦ Google: Google uses one of three sources for their search engine results 
descriptions: the Open Directory Project (ODP), which is a hand-assembled, 
human-edited directory of Web site data (go to www.dmoz.org if you 
want more information on this ambitious project); the Meta descrip-
tion tag on the Web page itself; or a snippet from the on-page content 
containing the searched-for keywords and some surrounding text (also 
referred to as an auto-snippet).
 
✦ Yahoo!: Yahoo! displays a description pulled from its own Yahoo! 
Directory, the Meta description tag, or the on-page content.
 
✦ Microsoft Live Search: Live Search pulls descriptions from either the 
Meta description tag or the on-page content. They don’t currently use a 
directory.
You can prevent the search engines from using the directories, if you feel 
the manually edited description there is either out-of-date or inaccurate for 
some reason. For SEO purposes, it’s always better to avoid showing some-
one else’s description for your pages. If you like their wording, use it on your 
Web page, but we recommend that you exclude the directories. By using the 
proper Meta robots tag, you can force them to pull descriptions from your 
Meta description tag or your Web page.
The following tag instructs Google not to pull the description from the Open 
Directory Project:
<meta name=”robots” content=”noodp”>
The following tag tells Yahoo! not to use the description contained in the 
Yahoo! Directory (YDIR for short):
<meta name=”robots” content=”noydir”>
 
Within a Meta robots tag, you can include multiple commands by separating 
them with a comma and a space. To tell all robots not to pull descriptions 
from either directory, you could write the tag like this:
<meta name=”robots” content=”noodp, noydir”>

Creating Custom 404 Pages
Creating Custom 404 Pages
You’ve seen it probably a hundred times — File 404: Page Can Not Be 
Displayed. It’s the error page that means, “Sorry, you’re out of luck. The Web 
page you wanted is broken or missing, and you can’t see it right now. So go 
away!” A user will probably do only one thing when presented with this 404 
error page, and that’s hit the Back button.
You can give your Web site visitors and search engines a much better expe-
rience when there’s a problem displaying a page. You can present them with 
a customized 404 error page that’s actually helpful and friendly rather than 
the standard browser-issued version.
 
This issue matters to your SEO efforts, too. If the spiders find a default 404 
page on your site, you’ve thrown a roadblock in front of them that they 
have no way to get over. Search engines can’t hit the Back button or use the 
other advanced features of your Web site. All they can do is follow links. If 
they come across a bad link and you don’t give them anywhere else to go, 
they leave your site. This may result in entire sections of your site not being 
indexed. Creating a custom 404 page that includes links to other pages on 
your site helps prevent this from happening. You have to give the engines 
something to follow.
Designing a 404 error page
Here are tips for creating a user-friendly and SEO-friendly 404 error page for 
your Web site:
 
✦ Design the page to look like your Web site. Keep your users feeling like 
they’re still on your site and everything’s under control.
 
✦ Apologize and tell them what happened (such as “Sorry, the page 
you requested is unavailable.”). Your message should match the tone 
of your site, but consider making it humorous to keep your readers 
engaged, such as, “The well-armed monkeys normally operating this 
Web page are engaged in full-scale warfare at the moment. To avoid the 
flying fur, try one of the escape routes suggested below.”
 
✦ Offer suggestions with links to other pages they might want to go to. 
Include helpful descriptions in the links. (“Read about our car customi-
zation services. See picture of ‘new’ classic cars. Hear what our custom-
ers say about us.”)
 
✦ Include a link back to your home page, with meaningful keywords 
in the anchor text (visible link text that a user can click). Don’t call 
it Home.
 
✦ Include a link to your site map. This is especially important for search 
engine robots because they can follow that map to get around your 
entire site. Providing access to your site map becomes even more ben-
eficial because the engines continually return to your site to see if those 

Book VII

465
Creating Custom 404 Pages
nonexistent pages have returned. If they have, the search engines re-
index them. If they haven’t, the robots still find your 404 page and all of 
your relevant links.
 
✦ If you have a good programmer, customize the page contents based on 
where the user had a problem. For instance, if the page was supposed 
to show Ford Mustang steering wheel options, the message and links 
could dynamically change to offer them a way to get to another Ford 
Mustang page in your site, rather than just showing them a generic error 
message.
 
✦ If you are running a sale, put images linked to your current ads on the page.
 
✦ Put a search box on your error page, front and center. Let users type in 
what they’re looking for and go to that exact page on your site.
 
✦ Put a Meta robots tag on your custom 404 error page. Tell the search 
engines that they should follow the links on the page, but not index it:
<meta name=”robots” content=”noindex, follow”>
 
✦ Do not redirect your 404 error page (for more on handling redirects 
properly, see Book VII, Chapters 3 and 4).
 
✦ Be sure your 404 error page passes a 404 error code, which stops search 
engines from indexing it. Many sites forget this step, and their error 
pages can show up in search results (see Figure 1-3).

Creating Custom 404 Pages
Customizing your 404 error page for your server
After you’ve created your 404 error page, you need to customize it for your 
server. The instructions vary depending on which server you use, so we’ve 
provided a list of options in the next few sections.
Apache
For an Apache server, you need to add some code into your .htaccess file 
that instructs the server to present a custom page (in this case, 404.php) 
instead of the standard error, in the event of a particular error occurring (in 
this case, ErrorDocument 404):
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
ErrorDocument 404 /error-pages/404.php
</IfModule>
 
If you like, you can enhance the user-friendliness of your site even more by 
creating custom pages for other types of errors, as well. In the following 
code snippet, the server is being told to display five different custom pages 
that have been built for different kinds of errors that could occur on the site:
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
ErrorDocument 404 /error-pages/404.php
ErrorDocument 403 /error-pages/403.php
ErrorDocument 401 /error-pages/401.php 
ErrorDocument 500 /error-pages/500.php
ErrorDocument 501 /error-pages/501.php 
</IfModule>
Microsoft IIS
It’s also easy to configure a custom 404 error page in the Microsoft IIS server 
environment, if you have the administrator rights to access the server. (If 
you have to beg your ISP staff to do it, it may take longer, but it’s still pos-
sible.) You simply make changes within the Properties dialog box to point 
various errors to their correct pages. To get ready, you need to have your 
site up on your IIS server (at least one page, anyway) and have already cre-
ated a custom 404 error page. We call the page 404error.aspx in the follow-
ing steps:
 
1. Open the Internet Services Manager.
 
 Typically, this is located in your Programs list under Administrative 
Tools.
 
2. Click the plus sign (+) next to your server name to expand the list.

then right-click it and choose Properties.
 
4. Open the Custom Errors tab.
 
5. Select the error 404 from the list, and then click the Edit button.
 
6. Browse and select your custom error page (400.htm is shown in Figure 
1-4, but you should name yours 404error.aspx or similar).
 
7. Click OK to exit the dialog box.

Monitoring your 404 error logs to spot problems
You can find out a lot by monitoring your 404 error logs (the server record 
of every time a page could not be displayed on your site). The error log can 
alert you of problems with your Web pages so that you can fix them. You 
may also notice people linking to your site with an incorrect URL, in which 
case you could redirect (using a 301 redirect) those bad links to another 
page that is valid. Because 404 errors are a major reason why people aban-
don a site, tracking where your site gets 404 errors can help you capture and 
hold visitors, improving your traffic and your bottom line.

borhood was quiet and peaceful when you first moved in, that doesn’t mean 
it won’t change over time and become an undesirable place to live.
 
IP addresses come in two flavors: virtual and dedicated. If you’re using a vir-
tual IP address, it means that there are multiple Web sites, as many as your 
server allows, using the same IP address you are. If you’re using a dedicated 
IP address, you are the only site on that IP.
We recommend that you use a dedicated IP for your site. Even so, you still 
need to monitor it to make sure it stays clean because you can also be 
affected by bad behavior of other IPs within the same C block. (The second 
to the last set of digits in an IP address, such as the 179 in the IP address 
208.215.179.146, identify the C block. It’s similar to an area code for a tele-
phone number, except that unlike your area code, you can change C blocks. 
You can move your site to a new IP address and C block if you have trouble 
with the one you’re in. Call your hosting company and tell them you want to 
be moved.)
If you do share a virtual IP with other sites, which is often the case with 
small or brand new Web sites, it’s like being in an apartment building. 
Similar to living in an apartment building, it’s important that the IP isn’t full 
of bad neighbors, even though that’s pretty much out of your control. If the 
search engines find out you’re next door to a spam site, for example, your 
site could be tainted by association. Google has indicated that it is difficult 
to be tainted by surrounding sites, but why take a chance? We recommend 
being in clean IP blocks whenever possible.
The other drawback of using a virtual IP is that occasionally, a search engine 
or a user navigates to your Web site by your IP address rather than your 
URL (usually only if your server is configured incorrectly). If you’re on a 
virtual IP, they may not be able to find your site. Any of the various sites 
located on that IP could come up; it’d be the luck of the draw. And do not 
forget that shared IPs may mean that your server performance will slow 
down based on the traffic load of your neighbors.
To find out your Web site’s IP address, look no further than our free Check 
Server tool, which we covered earlier in this chapter. The report identifies 
your DNS IP address. See Figure 1-1. 
Diagnosing your IP address’s health
After you have an IP address, you can find many tools on the Web that can 
evaluate whether it’s clean. By “clean,” we mean that the IP is not on any 
IP blacklists, which are lists of sites suspected of illegal acts such as child

Your Server Matters

Fixing Dirty IPs and Other “Bad Neighborhood” Issues
pornography, e-mail spam (sending unsolicited e-mail indiscriminately to 
tons of people), or hacking (attempting to break into computer networks and 
bypass their security). You may have never done anything unethical on your 
Web site, but your IP’s history with previous sites (or other current sites, if 
you’re on a shared IP) could still haunt you.
Being blacklisted is bad news. Most major e-mail services (Hotmail, Yahoo!, 
AOL, Gmail, and so on) block any e-mail coming from a blacklisted IP 
address, so being blacklisted seriously affects your ability to communicate 
with the outside world. For instance, it harms your ability to reply to sales 
inquiries, and thus can cost you money.
Being blacklisted also puts you in hot water with the search engines. Search 
engines refer to these IP blacklists for purposes of spidering, indexing, and 
ranking of Web sites. We don’t know how much the IP blacklists influence 
the individual search engines, and Google indicates that it should not, except 
in severe cases, impact your rankings. However, the search engines do flag 
your site and watch it closely because they assume that a site involved in 
e-mail spam has a high likelihood of being involved in other types of spam. 
Simply put, you become guilty by association.
To find an IP checker tool, do a search on Google for [“ip blacklist” check]. 
We found several free options this way — one you might try is MX Lookup 
(www.mxtoolbox.com). Alternatively, we recommend the monitoring 
reports at DNSstuff (www.dnsstuff.com), which are available for a paid 
subscription only.
When you run an IP check, it shows you the status of your IP with many dif-
ferent blacklists. If you see any red flags, you need to take steps to get off of 
that blacklist ASAP:
 
1. Contact your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and request a change to a 
clean IP.
 
 Better yet, try to move to an entirely new C block. You want to get as far 
away as possible.
 
2. As an alternative, ask your hosting provider to clean up the neighbor-
hood and then petition the search engines to have the IP marked as 
clean. They can do that.
 
3. If your hosting provider won’t cooperate, then cut your losses and 
change hosting providers.
 
 However, this problem should never occur. There is no excuse for an ISP 
operating blacklisted IP ranges.
 
4. Be sure to run an IP check on your new IP address when you get it.
 
 You want to see for yourself that you’re moving into a good neighbor-
hood. If you can, try to check the target IP before you are moved to it.

The diagnostics available through Google Webmaster Tools (www.google.
com/webmasters/tools/) are extremely helpful. After you sign up your 
Web site (which is free), Google verifies your site and then sends a spider to 
check it out. You receive a report that quickly tells you if they found any-
thing wrong. Hearing in Google’s own words that your site is A-OK is reason 
enough to celebrate, but you get the added bonus of lots of cool tools to try.

S
hakespeare once said, “A rose by any other name would smell as 
sweet,” implying that a name does not affect an object’s essential 
makeup. That may be true, but a Web site is not a rose — your site’s name 
is critical to its success. Your domain name (the root of your site’s URL 
address, such as yourdomain.com) must be chosen strategically, based on 
your business goals. Pick a good domain name, and you’ve got a foundation 
for a successful online presence.
In this chapter, we explain some guidelines for selecting an appropriate 
domain name for your Web site. You discover the basics, like how to reg-
ister for a domain name and how to pick a hosting service to get your site 
up and running. You also find out about securing variations of your domain 
name in order to protect your brand (company name) long-term.
Selecting Your Domain Name
Picking the right domain name for your Web site depends on your business 
strategy. You need to decide how you want people to find you on the Web. 
You have basically two ways to approach choosing a domain name — by 
brand or by keywords (search terms that people might enter to find what 
your site offers).

472
Selecting Your Domain Name
If you have a unique brand name and want people to be able to find your 
Web site by searching for your brand, you should secure your brand as your 
domain. Having a brand for your domain name makes sense if any of the fol-
lowing is true:
 
✦ Your brand is already established and recognized (Nike, Xerox, and so on).
 
✦ You have advertised or plan to advertise to promote your brand.
 
✦ Your brand is your own name (such as bruceclay.com) or very unique.
 
✦ You want your site to rank well in search results for your brand name.
As an alternative, you could choose a domain name containing keywords that 
identify what your business does. For instance, if your business is called Marty’s 
Auto but your Web site is focused on your classic car customization business, 
you might get a lot more mileage out of classiccarcustomization.
com as a domain name than out of martysauto.com. Search engines can 
parse the domain name to recognize the distinct words classic car customiza-
tion, and your keyword-laden domain name would make your site more rele-
vant to searches for those terms. Also, the business name Marty’s Auto doesn’t 
identify what services you really offer — it could be auto sales, auto repair, or 
other. Unless you plan to heavily advertise and build Marty’s Auto into a brand, 
you’d be better off choosing a keyword-centered domain name.
 
You may run into problems getting your first choice of domain name because 
someone has already registered it. People often buy domain names that they 
don’t intend to use, just so they can turn around and sell them later. Your 
desired domain may fall into that category, in which case you can try to con-
tact the domain owner and negotiate to buy it from them. However, that isn’t 
always possible, especially when the domain is legitimately operating as a 
thriving Web site. So in this case, you need to be creative and start thinking 
of alternative domain names that would work for you.
Here are a few points to keep in mind when trying to come up with a good 
domain name:
 
✦ Length: Shorter is better than longer in a domain name. There are three 
reasons why: The URL string for your files can be shorter, and people 
tend to avoid clicking long URL links on search results pages; a short 
URL is easier to remember than a long one; and there are fewer opportu-
nities for typos when someone enters your URL in a browser window or 
sets it up as a link.
 
✦ Multiple words: Search engines have no trouble parsing words that are 
concatenated (run together without spaces). Most Web site domains for 
businesses with multiple-word brand names run the words together, 
such as bankofamerica.com, bestwestern.com, and so on. 
Concatenating domain names is the best practice. However, sometimes, 
you may need to separate words visually to make them easier for users 
to understand. When you must separate words, use a hyphen. The 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Domain Names: 
What Your URL Says 
About You
473
Selecting Your Domain Name
search engines interpret hyphens as word spaces; underscores (_) don’t 
work well because they count as alphanumeric characters. Imagine 
you own a tailoring business called the Mens Exchange and that you’re 
interested in branding exactly that name. But wait a second: The domain 
mensexchange.com could be parsed two ways. To make sure the site 
name isn’t misunderstood, a hyphen is needed; mens-exchange.com 
prevents any misunderstandings.
 
 We recommend you use no more than one hyphen (or two at the most) 
in a domain name — more than that can make your site look suspicious 
to the search engines, like spam (deliberately using deceptive methods 
to gain ranking for irrelevant keywords). Although none of the engines 
ban you for having a multi-hyphenated domain name, they may still 
think that your domain buy-cheap-pills-and-try-free-poker-here.com 
looks a little suspicious. What’s more, your visitors do too.
 
✦ Articles: Part-of-speech articles like a, an, and the may help you create 
a unique domain if they make sense with your name. For instance, 
Hershey’s has a Web site at hersheys.com that’s consumer-targeted 
and all about chocolate. But for their investors, they have a separate 
domain at thehersheycompany.com that’s full of company-related 
news and information. In most cases, you’re not going to need the arti-
cle, so don’t even worry about it.
 
You also want to consider your future plans as much as possible. It might be 
hard to foresee how your business may change and expand, but try to avoid 
boxing yourself in. For example, Marty’s Auto might decide to branch out and 
also do classic car brokering and resale, or possibly include current-model 
car customization, bicycle customization, or another type of expanded ser-
vice. In those cases, the domain name classiccarcustomization.com 
may become too restrictive in the long run.
As a general rule, you want to choose a domain name that will last. This 
makes sense from a usability point of view because you want your custom-
ers to rely on your Web site, bookmark it, and come back often. It’s also 
important from a search engine optimization (SEO) perspective. The search 
engines consider domain age as a factor when ranking sites. The longer your 
domain has been continuously registered and active on the Web, the higher 
your score is for the age factor. Granted, this is only one of more than 200 
different ranking factors Google considers, but that doesn’t make it insig-
nificant. Because competition can be so tight on the Web, you want every 
advantage you can legitimately get.
 
Remember in the 2008 Summer Olympics when Michael Phelps won a swim-
ming relay by 1/100th of a second? That was in a field of only eight swim-
mers. When you consider how many thousands of competitors you could 
face on the Web, you see why every little advantage can make such a big 
difference. In SEO, you need to sweat the small stuff. Having a domain that 
endures is a small thing that can pay off big with long-term customers and 
search engine rankings.

Registering Your Domain Name
Registering Your Domain Name
To find out whether a domain has already been taken, start by just typing it 
into the Address bar of your Web browser and seeing what comes up. If you 
see an error message saying “Address Not Found” or something similar, 
you might think you’re in luck and have located an available domain. But 
sometimes a domain may be taken even though no site displays, or it may 
look taken when in fact the domain holder would like to transfer it to some-
one else.
A more foolproof way to check for available domains is to go to a domain 
name registrar (a company accredited and authorized to register Internet 
domain names) and use their domain name search tool. A domain name 
search tells you whether the name is available and then quotes prices to reg-
ister it to you if it is. Domain name registrars we recommend are
 
✦ Register.com (www.register.com)
 
✦ Moniker (www.moniker.com)
 
✦ Go Daddy (www.godaddy.com)
 
✦ Namecheap (www.namecheap.com)
 
✦ Whois.net (http://whois.net)
 
✦ Domain.com (www.domain.com)
 
✦ Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com)
 
Also check with your Web site hosting company to see what they can do for 
you. Many provide all the same services as a domain name registrar.
If a domain is available, you can claim it on the registrar’s Web site. The 
standard price to register a .com domain name is $9.95 a year or greater 
(international domains can cost much more), although you may be able to 
secure it for two or more years up front at a discount.
In the future, you’ll need to renew your domain name registration. You don’t 
buy a domain name; they’re only licensed for a period of time. So when your 
current registration is near its expiration date, you need to re-register it, and 
then repeat this process throughout the life of your Web site.
If a domain name you really want is already taken according to a domain 
name search, look at the Web site. See if it looks like a real site doing busi-
ness, or just a placeholder site, or better yet, just brings up an error. All 
of these could indicate that someone has registered the domain name but 
hasn’t gotten around to creating a site yet — or that they don’t intend to. 
Domains are often purchased on speculation and sold later. In these cases, 
you may be able to negotiate with the domain holder to obtain the domain. 
There’s no telling what the initial price might be that the domain holder

would require, but it may be worth it to you to negotiate a deal. Some sites, 
such as Moniker (www.moniker.com), also operate periodic auctions where 
domains are auctioned by their holders.
 
You can find out the name and contact information of the registered domain 
holder using the WHOIS Lookup tool on the home page at http://whois.
net. Then try your best persuasive techniques and see what happens.
Covering All Your Bases
You may want to register other domains in addition to your main URL. Most 
companies try to cover all their bases — not just to attract more traffic (visi-
tors) to their site, but to protect their brand and their future online business 
as well. Securing other domain names besides your primary domain can be 
an important proactive step for your Web site, but you want to do it stra-
tegically. This section covers why you might want to have more than one 
URL. We also help you understand the variety of choices beyond the .com 
domains, so you can make informed decisions.
Country-code TLDs
You may be wondering what to do about all the other types of domains 
besides .com. There are many domain name extensions other than the 
familiar .com extension, such as .net, .org, .me, and so forth. Known as 
top-level domains, or TLDs, they represent the topmost part of a domain 
name under which all domain names within that TLD are registered. So .com 
is a TLD, and all domain names that use the .com extension (wiley.com, 
amazon.com, and so on) fall within that TLD.
 
Who’s in charge of the domain system, you ask? The Internet’s domain name 
system is managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers, or ICANN for short. This not-for-profit international organization 
coordinates the Internet globally, creating technical naming and numbering 
standards to ensure that every Web site and computer on the Internet can 
be identified uniquely, which is a technical necessity. You can read more 
about ICANN on their site (www.icann.org).
There are two main types of TLDs within the Internet’s domain name system: 
country-code TLDs and generic TLDs.
Country-code TLDs have a dot followed by two letters. Below are a few 
examples of country-code TLDs:
.au 
Australia
.ca 
Canada
.de 
Germany

476
Covering All Your Bases
.eu 
European Union
.fr 
France
.il 
Israel
.mx 
Mexico
.us 
United States
When a country-code TLD is established, the country can issue domain reg-
istrations for that TLD as they see fit, according to their own local policies, 
so the rules vary from country to country. We recommend that you obtain a 
domain within the country’s TLD for anywhere you think you might do busi-
ness. Secure your domain name if you can. You need to research the rules 
for establishing a domain in each country, however. Here are some specific 
examples:
 
✦ .de: If you want to do business through a German domain (.de for 
Deutschland), they require that you either live in Germany or have a 
physical business located there.
 
✦ .ca: Canada has less stringent requirements; if you have a relative who 
lives in Canada, you can obtain a .ca domain.
 
✦ .us: If you’re located in the U.S., by all means pick up a .us domain 
name. The .us domains aren’t very common yet because most com-
panies use .com, but some notable examples are Delicious.com (a 
popular social bookmarking site), which started life at the much more 
complicated http://del.icio.us, and directory pages for each ZIP 
code that contain information about that locality (such as http://
www.93065.us).
 
✦ .co.uk: Sometimes a country-code TLD looks more complicated than 
a simple two-letter code. The United Kingdom, for example, chooses to 
register domains with an additional second-level domain specified in 
their extensions. So a business Web site in England typically ends with 
.co.uk; an English non-profit group would have a site ending in .org.
uk; and so forth.
 
✦ .fm: The Federated States of Micronesia has reserved the TLDs .com.
fm, .net.fm, .org.fm, and others, but makes money by allowing 
anyone in the world to register a .fm domain. Although this is uncon-
ventional, .fm has become popular with sites related to FM radio and 
Internet radio (such as the social music site www.last.fm or the 
Internet marketing industry site, www.webmasterradio.fm).
 
✦ .tv, .me: Occasionally a country goes so far as to sell the rights to oper-
ate its TLD. This happened with the .tv country code (for Tuvalu) and 
the .me country code (for Montenegro).

Generic TLDs are usually three or more letters long. The most common are

can be registered by anyone who’s interested, but others require that you 
meet certain eligibility requirements. Table 2-1 below shows the different

can, buy them! (For a complete list of TLDs with more details, see ICANN’s

are running a museum, by all means grab up classiccars.museum. It’ll be 
a conversation piece, if nothing else.
 
After you’ve chosen your domain name, we recommend that you register 
every variation you can. Pick up the .com, .net, .org, and so on — as many 
as are available. Remember, this is your future business reputation you’re 
protecting. If you set up your Web site at www.classiccarcustomization.
com but don’t secure the other TLDs for that domain name, down the road, 
someone may build a competing site at www.classiccarcustomization.
org. Potentially they could confuse your customers, take away some of your 
traffic, or even damage your reputation by using your brand name for differ-
ent purposes. By locking up those other domains now, you could be safe, not 
sorry.
Vanity domains
A vanity domain is an easy-to-remember Web address used to market a spe-
cific product, person, or service. You would obtain a vanity domain with your 
users in mind, not search engines. Movies often register a vanity domain in 
addition to their primary location on the studio’s Web site. For example, the 
2008 movie The Dark Knight snatched up the vanity URL www.thedark
knight.com to capture all the direct type-in traffic (users who type a URL 
directly into their browser’s address bar) of people looking for the movie by 
name. However, www.thedarkknight.com redirected you automatically to 
http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/dvdsite/, a subdomain on 
the Warner Brothers studio site containing the movie’s Web pages.

Obtain a vanity domain if you want to market your product or service with a 
simple Web site address. A long, complicated URL doesn’t look good in ads 
and isn’t easy for people to remember. You might also want to register rele-
vant, really good vanity domains just to keep your competition from getting 
to them first.
Misspellings
Another good idea is to register domains that are commonly misspelled ver-
sions of your main domain name. Not only might this help you rank better 
for your misspelled brand name in the search engines, but also it helps you 
capture the direct type-in traffic, or the people who type a URL directly into 
the address bar of a Web browser. Figure 2-1 below shows a typed-in URL, 
which bypasses the search engines and takes the user straight to a Web site 
(assuming the URL is entered correctly).
 
Figure 2-1: 
Users 
sometimes 
type a URL 
directly into

Google, for example, has covered their bases by securing close misspell-
ings of their domain name. If you type www.gogle.com into your browser’s 
address bar and press Enter, you instantly get redirected to www.google.
com. This also works with www.googlee.com because Google has regis-
tered it, too.
To support your www.classiccarcustomization.com Web site, you also 
might want to pick up the misspelled versions (such as www.classicar
customization.com), as well as the hyphenated versions www.classic-
car-customization.com and www.classiccar-customization.com, 
and then redirect them all to your primary site. For ideas on the common 
misspellings of your brand name, look no further than your customer corre-
spondence (such as letters and e-mails).
 
Consider all the ways people might try to find you and make all paths lead to 
your site. Secure all the different variations of your actual domain name that 
are available and make sense.

Pointing Multiple Domains to a Single Site Correctly
Pointing Multiple Domains to a Single Site Correctly
After you’ve registered a bunch of domains, you need to know what to do 
with them. Having multiple domains all point to a single Web site is usually 
bad for search engine optimization because the search engines think you’re 
trying to index multiple Web sites all for the same content. They can tell that 
it’s duplicate content (by matching long text strings, file sizes, and so on), 
and they usually only use one site and throw the others out of their search 
results.
You can correct this problem by using an IP funnel. This is a method for fun-
neling many domains to a single canonical site (your primary, main Web site) 
correctly, so that search engines won’t view your multiple sites as deceptive 
or misleading.
With an IP funnel, you don’t have to host all of your different domains and set 
up redirects on them. (Redirects are HTML code that automatically forwards 
links to a different page.) Instead, you only have to host two domains — your 
canonical site plus one other domain, and then “funnel” the other domains to 
it. You save money and effort and prevent duplicate content.
An IP funnel corrects the problem of multiple domains pointing to the same 
content. Figure 2-2 shows how you could set up an IP funnel to reroute many 
different domains to your canonical site domain.

Choosing the Right Hosting Provider
Most domain name registrars provide the ability to “point” or “forward” 
domains to another site. If you had six extraneous domains in addition to 
your main site domain, you would first choose one of the six to be your 
“feeder site” because it “feeds” all traffic to your canonical site. All the other 
five domains should point to the feeder site (not to your canonical site). 
These five extra domains do not need to be hosted on a server; you can just 
have all requests for those URLs forwarded automatically to your feeder site.
The feeder site (we’ll call it www.feeder.com) should be hosted, but it 
doesn’t need to have a visible user interface. The feeder site only needs to 
have two files:
www.feeder.com/index.htm
www.feeder.com/robots.txt
The index.htm file should have an optimized Title tag, Meta description 
tag and Meta keywords tag. It should also include a Meta refresh statement 
and a Meta robots “noindex” command.
The robots text file can be left blank. It just needs to exist so that when the 
search engine robots go looking for it, they aren’t met with an error. For 
more on creating a robots text file, see the previous chapter.
The last thing you need to add is a 301 redirect command (server code that 
indicates where the site has permanently moved) to the feeder site. You 
want to redirect the feeder site domain to your main site so that any links 
are passed automatically. The feeder site can then correctly redirect traffic 
to your “real” site.
Choosing the Right Hosting Provider
Deciding where to host your Web site is very important. Pick a reliable host, 
and managing your site can be fairly headache-free. Choose a bad one, and 
you could have a nightmarish experience with unreturned calls, unanswered 
e-mails, and a Web site that’s unavailable to visitors.
Unless you have your own server and other equipment in-house, and the 
technical know-how or staff to run them, you’re going to need a Web-site 
hosting provider. Hosting providers are third-party companies that lease out 
Web space by month or by year, similar to office space. In addition to space 
on their servers, they offer varying degrees of additional services.
In this section, we explain the key things you should ask about when 
researching hosting providers. Keep in mind, however, that what works 
for your friend’s site won’t necessarily work for yours. Factors include the 

482
Choosing the Right Hosting Provider
amount of traffic your site receives, how complex your site or application is, 
how much storage space you need, and so on. The best hosting provider is 
the one that meets your needs and provides the right balance between qual-
ity and value.
 
✦ Customer service: One of the most important elements of a good host-
ing provider is their level of service, which can range widely. How easy 
is it to contact them for support, and how quick and helpful is their 
response? You can get a feel for this by asking a few questions of differ-
ent providers in advance. Don’t let them intimidate you with technical-
speak. They should be willing to answer your questions promptly and in 
an understandable way, or they aren’t the people you want to work with.
 
✦ Server: The type of server software they use is critical. To ensure 
enough flexibility for SEO, make sure you go with either an Apache 
server or a Microsoft IIS server. (Chapter 1 of this minibook explains 
more about the servers.)
 
✦ Dedicated versus shared IP: If you have a small site that’s just getting 
started, you might initially share an IP address with other sites. (Short 
for “Internet Protocol,” an IP address is the numeric code that identifies 
the logical address of a server or a computer on the Web.) Having an 
IP that hosts only your Web site, however, is preferred for many SEO-
related reasons. This is called a dedicated IP. Here are good things to 
find out from a prospective hosting provider:
 
• If the IP will be shared, ask how many sites share it (the fewer, the 
better).
 
• Ask if they offer dedicated IPs, and find out how you would get one.
 
✦ Uptime: Uptime means the percentage of time the site is up and running, 
not including scheduled maintenance periods. A guaranteed uptime of 
99% is not uncommon, so make sure you’re contractually covered.
 
✦ Bandwidth: The amount of bandwidth available to your site determines 
how much traffic your site can comfortably handle. Bandwidth refers 
to the flow of data transferring over an Internet connection. You can 
think of it like a pipe — the pipe’s diameter determines how many gal-
lons of water can flow through it at the same time. The bigger the pipe, 
the more water it can transfer. The higher the bandwidth, the greater 
the number of consecutive visitors your Web site can handle. You need 
more bandwidth if any of the following are true:
 
• Your site is large (in number of pages).
 
• Your site has a lot of traffic regularly at peak periods.
 
• Your site serves many Flash and sound files, or has large images, 
audio, video, or other elements that require a lot of bandwidth to 
display.

Choosing the Right Hosting Provider
 
 Very large or application-intensive Web sites that need maximum con-
nectivity should find a hosting provider that’s physically located on 
what’s known as the Internet backbone. This refers to the main hub con-
nections of the Internet, which are primarily located in major cities 
around the world (Los Angeles, Denver, New York, and so on). A site 
right on a hub means that data can transfer to and from the site faster 
than if it had to travel through multiple spokes to reach the server.
 
✦ Storage: File storage space is cheap, and most hosting providers give 
out a generous amount even to the smallest sites. However, more stor-
age space is needed if you plan to have a ton of image, audio, or video 
files on your site. If you’re going to operate a social media site (a Web 
site enabling user participation and consisting of user-generated con-
tent) where people can upload their own videos, for an example, you 
want to be prepared with lots of storage space to hold them.
 
✦ Server capacity: This refers to the processing power of the server. You 
know how a new computer always seems to work faster than the old one 
did? That’s because it has a much more powerful processor. Similarly, 
server capacity affects the performance speed and capacity of your 
Web site. If your site application requires a lot of processing power, ask 
about how they allocate server capacity and strongly consider requiring 
a dedicated IP.
 
✦ Scalability: Scalability means being able to expand your server 
resources as needed. If and when your Web site business grows, you 
want to be able to scale your server resources up to deliver the same or 
better site performance. You also may want to add storage space, band-
width, or server capacity to your site at peak times, or all the time. Make 
sure you have a flexible hosting environment that is easy to adjust as 
your site needs change.
 
✦ Clean IPs: You don’t want to move into a bad neighborhood, so you 
want to make sure your site isn’t on a dirty IP address (the Internet 
Protocol numeric code that identifies the logical address of a server or 
a computer on the Web). Because you have no way to know in advance 
what IP address you’ll get, make sure it’s written into your service level 
agreement that you require a clean IP that’s not blacklisted (listed on 
anti-spam databases).
 
When researching hosting providers, look up online reviews written by cur-
rent or former customers. These can be very insightful. Just remember that 
each Web site’s needs are different, so you have to take their comments with 
a grain of salt.
One last recommendation on choosing a hosting provider: Don’t consider 
it a permanent arrangement. You hold the rights to the domain and the site 
assets, and you can host them wherever you think best. Be willing to move 
to a new hosting provider if your current provider isn’t cutting it.

Understanding Subdomains
Understanding Subdomains
In the domain name system (also known as “DNS”), a subdomain is a depen-
dent domain set up within the primary domain. Here’s an example: The fol-
lowing code shows what the URL would look like if you set up a subdomain 
called events in your classic car customization business domain.
http://events.classiccarcustomization.com/
Events is the subdomain, .classiccarcustomization is the domain, 
and .com is the TLD.
Why people set up subdomains
Web sites often create subdomains in order to segregate sections of Web 
pages to create a virtual “site within a site.” In the example in the previ-
ous section, an events subdomain could be used to hold information about 
classic car shows, car industry conventions, company-sponsored events, 
or other types of event-related information that you decided not to include 
within your main site navigation scheme.
Some social media sites automatically create a subdomain for each person 
who signs up (such as myname.socialmediasite.com). Similarly, some 
companies choose to create subdomains for their different employees. So 
you could have
http://bob.classiccarcustomization.com/
http://katie.classiccarcustomization.com/
http://susan.classiccarcustomization.com/
Other sites set up subdomains as a way of separating all of their Web site 
content into different categories, like this:
http://remodels.classiccarcustomization.com/
http://paint.classiccarcustomization.com/
http://parts.classiccarcustomization.com/
 
In other parts of this book, we recommend siloing your Web site, which basi-
cally means organizing your Web site content into a hierarchy of subject 
themes, with each silo focused on its own particular theme through key-
words and relevant links. Although the subdomains shown here appear to be 
organized by subject theme (remodels, paint, parts), this is not siloing. (For 
more on siloing, see Book VI.) We don’t recommend organizing the bulk of 
your site content by subdomains, for several reasons we discuss in the next 
section.

Understanding Subdomains
How search engines view subdomains
Search engines consider subdomains to be entirely separate sites. 
Subdomains endanger your search engine optimization because the search 
engines do not see the subdomain as part of your main site. They also 
don’t see any connection between your various subdomains. By using sub-
domains, you effectively put up walls between your different sets of content. 
In essence, you are taking all the benefit of your inbound links and all of your 
well thought-out content and dividing them across several separate Web 
properties. Unless you have a lot of both, dividing them up is a really bad 
idea. But if you did it, you would need to optimize each subdomain for the 
search engines separately, if you wanted them to rank.
You benefit from using subdomains on your Web site only in the following 
cases:
 
✦ Totally unrelated content: If you wanted to start a side business sell-
ing bicycles, you wouldn’t want to dilute your classic car customization 
Web site with pages on frame sizes, bicycle brands, and prices. You 
could register an entirely different domain for this, or you could handle 
this new business as a subdomain of your main Web site.
 
 Blog (short for “Web log”) sites provide another great example of sub-
domains. If you sign up for a blog account on WordPress.com (www.word
press.com), for example, your blog would be assigned the yourname.
wordpress.com subdomain. Your blog would contain your writing and 
thoughts and would have no relation to other people’s blogs. Subdomains 
work well in this situation because each blog contains legitimately differ-
ent content.
 
✦ Large brands: Huge companies with a highly branded name can suc-
cessfully use subdomains to separate their content. Why? First, they 
have tons of pages about each division or product, enough so that each 
subdomain ranks well with the search engines on its own. Second, it 
benefits users to have the well-known brand name in every URL because 
it confirms that the pages legitimately belong to that company. Third, 
having multiple subdomains could yield multiple results on a search 
engine results page (SERP), if several come up for the same keyword.
 
 Companies using subdomains include Google (news.google.com, 
images.google.com, maps.google.com, and so on) and National 
Geographic (kids.nationalgeographic.com, video.national
geographic.com, animals.nationalgeographic.com, and so on). 
Large education institutions (.edu sites) also use subdomains because 
each institution may only have one .edu domain name, leaving only sub-
domains to separate the different schools within it.

486
Understanding Subdomains
 
✦ International sites: Targeting different countries can be very effectively 
done through the use of subdomains. If you don’t have the resources to 
buy www.mybusiness.co.uk, or if that domain is already taken (not all 
domains are available around the world), you can target the UK through 
uk.mybusiness.com instead. We discuss more about international 
SEO in Book IX.
 
✦ Secure content: If part of your Web site can only be accessed through 
a logon, it could be set up effectively as a subdomain. Search engines 
don’t spider content that’s behind a logon anyway, so having it in a 
separate subdomain doesn’t matter to your SEO efforts.
Your site needs lots of subject-relevant content to reach the front pages of the 
search results. Most people struggle to have enough site content to support 
their keyword themes and get the rankings they’re after. If you’re like them, 
splitting up what content you have into separate subdomains is self-defeating. 
And if you’re currently using subdomains as a way of organizing your site con-
tent, stop it. Use siloing instead. For more on siloing, see Book VI.

n your toolbox of search engine optimization (SEO) techniques, the redi-
rect tool is an important one to master. Redirects are HTML or server 
commands that automatically forward incoming links to another page. With 
this tool, you can trim outdated pages off your site without losing the visi-
tors who still go to those pages. You can also organize many domains (root 
names of Web site URLs) into one site, so that they won’t be competing 
with each other. With redirects, you can avoid creating duplicate content 
(Web pages that search engines see as duplicates of each other) that could 
damage your rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs). And the best 
part is that redirects are not hard at all to learn.
This chapter covers the four main types of redirects. We explain what each 
type is for, although for SEO purposes, only one type of redirect is safe to 
use — a 301 redirect. Then in Chapter 4 of this minibook, you discover the 
“how tos” of placing 301 redirects in your Web site.
Discovering the Types of Redirects
There are several different types of redirects in the world of the Internet. 
These commands give you a way to redirect your site visitors from one 
URL (the Web address of a page, such as www.wiley.com) to another (like 
www.wiley.com/index.htm). Often, you need to use a redirect to reroute 
people linking to an old page to its replacement page, especially if your 
Web site undergoes reorganization so that files and directories have to be 
renamed and moved around. You also need to use redirects in the normal 
course of site maintenance, to help visitors coming to alternative URLs 
(such as the non-www version of your domain instead of the www version, 
and so on) to get to the URLs that contain the content they’re looking for.

488
Discovering the Types of Redirects
 
Short for “redirection status codes,” the various redirects are defined by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is an organization that oversees 
Internet practices and creates standards that enable Web sites all over the 
world to work smoothly together as one giant network. Webmasters have a 
bunch of tricks they can use, but not all of them benefit you, your site, your 
users, or your search engine rankings. In the case of redirects, although the 
available redirect methods are intended to have different functions, only one 
is thoroughly search engine–friendly.
In this section, you find out about the four most common ways to handle 
automatically redirecting one URL to a different URL: 301 redirects, 302 redi-
rects, JavaScript redirects, and Meta refreshes.
301 (permanent) redirects
The 301 redirect is the preferred and most SEO-friendly form of redirect. Also 
known as a permanent redirect, the 301 informs a search engine that the page 
has been permanently moved to a new location. This is the cleanest redirect 
because there’s no ambiguity — the search engines get a clear message that 
one page is history, and some other URL has now taken its place.
To put it in perspective, say your favorite barbeque restaurant closes without 
your knowledge. Fortunately for you, the next time you head over for their 
mouth-watering ribs, you see a sign in the window: “WE’VE MOVED TO NEW 
LOCATION: 123 Yummy Drive.” This sign enables you to get back in the car 
and head to the restaurant’s new location without too much inconvenience.
A 301 redirect is kind of like that “WE’VE MOVED” sign, but better. On the 
Web, visitors don’t even have to realize you’ve moved. Your Web site auto-
matically redirects them to the new URL and displays the new page.
If you’ve registered a vanity URL (an easy-to-remember domain that isn’t 
your main business domain name), you should put a 301 redirect on it so 
that when users go to the vanity URL, they’re taken to your real site instead. 
For example, people interested in a currently playing movie often type the 
movie title directly into their browser’s address bar, so movie studios try 
to register those URLs in advance. For the 2008 movie The Dark Knight, if 
you typed in www.thedarkknight.com, you were automatically redirected 
to http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/dvd/, which was a sub--
domain on the Warner Brothers studio site. That’s because the studio wisely 
secured the movie title URL and then redirected it to the actual site using a 
301, thereby capturing more Web site traffic.
 
For site maintenance, you could use 301 redirects when physically reorganiz-
ing your pages and directories. For instance, you might redirect a page with 
a ghastly long URL (such as www.classiccarcustomization.com/
extras/dashboard/gauges-chevrolet-impala/speed-or-tach/
139348w9d.htm) to a new and cleaner URL address (like www.classic

htm). You wouldn’t want to keep the old page location active on your Web 
site, but there are backlinks (incoming links from other Web sites) to the old 
page that you don’t want to break. So you can’t bring in the wreaking ball 
and just demolish the page — you need to redirect the old URL to the new 
one instead. The right way to do this is to set up a 301 redirect from the old 
URL to the new one. Then users who click to come to the old page automati-
cally find themselves looking at the new one; also, search engines get the 
message loud and clear.
When a search engine encounters a 301 redirect, it does three things:
 
✦ Drops the now defunct page from its index (database of Web pages from 
which the search engine pulls search results), so that that page won’t be 
included in future search results.
 
✦ Includes the new page in the index, available for listing on search results 
pages.
 
✦ Transfers link equity from the old page to the new. (Link equity refers to 
the value of all incoming links to a page, which the search engines use to 
determine a Web page’s authority, or expertise, in its subject.)
 
The 301 redirect is the SEO-recommended form of redirect because it 
reduces duplicate content within the search engine index. Duplicate content 
hurts your search engine rankings because search engines don’t want to 
show their users results that are essentially the same. Therefore, if a search 
engine detects that two pages it has indexed are the same, it filters out the 
less-authoritative page, so that only one of the pages can appear in search 
engine results pages (SERPs). Because a search engine responds to a 301 
by dropping the old page entirely from its index, the chance of having two 
pages in the index with the same content is nil. (See Chapter 4 of this mini-
book for details on implementing 301 redirects.)
302 (temporary) redirects
Another commonly used form of redirect is the 302. A 302 redirect means 
“document found elsewhere” and it’s meant for temporary relocations of a 
Web page. Search engines see the new page as only temporary and continue 
to crawl and index the original location instead.
Although the search engines claim to be able to interpret a 302 correctly, 302 
redirects are known to cause duplicate content to be indexed. Because dupli-
cate content can cause pages to be filtered from SERPs or be assigned to a sup-
plemental index, for the sake of your SEO efforts, you should avoid using 302 
redirects. (Note: We cover duplicate content in depth in Book V, Chapter 4.)
Remember, 301 and 302 redirects are server (not HTML) commands, 
whereas the following types of redirects are done within an HTML page.

490
Discovering the Types of Redirects
Meta refreshes
A Meta refresh is a type of Meta tag (command located in the top or head sec-
tion of a Web page’s HTML code) that tells the page to refresh automatically 
after a given time interval. When you refresh a page (by clicking the browser’s 
Refresh button, for example), it causes the page to reload and redisplay its 
contents. A Meta refresh command can be written in several ways:
 
✦ Refresh the page instantly (time delay = 0).
 
✦ Refresh the page after an interval (time delay = 1 or more seconds).
 
✦ Refresh the page repeatedly every X number of seconds.
 
✦ Refresh to another page (with or without a time delay).
Officially, search engines say that they handle Meta refreshes as follows:
 
✦ A Meta refresh with a time delay of zero (0) or one second (1) is treated 
like a 301 redirect.
 
✦ A Meta refresh with a time delay of two (2) or more seconds is treated 
like a 302 redirect.
However, we’ve observed that this isn’t usually the case. The search engines 
sometimes follow the link (as they would with a 301 or 302), but sometimes 
they don’t. Sometimes they index the new content, but sometimes they 
ignore it. The search engines don’t handle Meta refreshes reliably, and 
that’s one reason to avoid using them in your Web site.
Another reason to steer clear of Meta refreshes is that they look suspicious 
to the search engines. Because Meta refreshes can be used to show different 
content to a search engine than to a user, they have traditionally been used 
by spam sites (Web sites that intentionally deceive search engines about 
their real content). In one case, a site put up pages about baby blankets, 
but it was just a cover for a pornography site. The search engines didn’t see 
the porn content because the Meta refreshes delayed the change. A grand-
mother searching for baby blankets discovered the truth and reported the 
site. The search engine’s spam team went to work, and soon that site was 
banned from the index. (For more about spam, please see Book I, Chapter 6.)
Many sites use Meta refreshes for legitimate reasons, as well. For example, 
the Los Angeles Times (www.latimes.com/) uses a Meta refresh to refresh 
their front page every 600 seconds (10 minutes). They do this to make sure 
online readers always see the most up-to-date news because their stories 
change frequently. However, search engine spiders won’t stay on the page 
for 10 minutes to read the new content. The spider only sees what’s on the 
page at the outset.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Using Redirects 
for SEO
491
Discovering the Types of Redirects
 
With a typical site (less well known than the L.A. Times), you don’t want the 
search engines to miss reading all of your rich content, so you can have the 
maximum chance of ranking in search results. Even worse, using a Meta 
refresh may get your site flagged as suspected spam. Search engines espe-
cially suspect sites that use a Meta refresh to fetch another page. Bottom 
line: if you need to redirect users and search engines to a new URL for a 
page, do it with a 301 redirect.
JavaScript redirects
The search engines have a hard time following and indexing your pages 
properly if you program a redirect using JavaScript (a scripting language 
used to add functionality to Web sites). JavaScript redirects give you the 
ability to customize the user experience, so the benefit is all on the usabil-
ity end of the spectrum. (Usability refers to the user-friendliness of the site, 
which in this case runs counter to search engine-friendliness.) A JavaScript 
redirect is also not recommended from an SEO perspective. The problem is 
that search engines cannot execute JavaScript and therefore cannot follow 
the redirect to a new page.
With JavaScript, you can redirect users to particular versions of a page 
based on settings that can be detected by JavaScript. You can detect the 
user’s browser type, Flash capability, cookies settings, and so forth. So you 
could deliver a page that has Flash animations to users that have the Flash 
plug-in installed, but show a non-Flash-enhanced page to others — in other 
words, personalize it somewhat. That’s a useful application, but sites can 
also use JavaScript deceptively to create a “bait-and-switch” type of effect.
The search engines usually flag instances of JavaScript redirects for human 
review. Flagged sites are then dependent on the discretion of the human 
reviewer, who determines if the redirect benefits the user — in which case 
it’s usually be allowed — or is a tactic for delivering a different page to a 
spider than a user — in which case the site could be penalized for spam 
(that is, thrown out of the index, or buried way down in the results page). 
And because the search engines continuously improve their spam-detection 
efforts, you want to make sure to keep your Web site practices in the safe 
harbor.
We recommend that you never implement JavaScript redirects, except for 
personalization. Even if you’re not doing something wrong, you don’t want 
to attract negative attention from the search engines. It’s similar to driving 
when there’s a police car present. You watch your speedometer to make 
sure you don’t go over the speed limit even a little because that could catch 
the officer’s attention. And if the police officer notices you, she might also 
notice that you’re not wearing a seatbelt, or that your right taillight is out. 
You’re better off just not attracting notice in the first place.

Reconciling Your WWW and Non-WWW URLs
Reconciling Your WWW and Non-WWW URLs
How can you use redirects on a practical level? One common situation 
that’s solved by a 301 redirect is how to reconcile your www and non-www 
domains.
If you’re like most Web site owners today, you probably have two versions 
of your site URL, one with and one without the “www.” in front of the domain 
name, such as
www.yourdomain.com
yourdomain.com
Having both versions is recommended because users have a tendency to 
type either of the above versions into their browser, and you want to receive 
all of that traffic. However, because these are treated as two different Web 
sites by search engines, you have to make it clear to them which one is the 
main, or canonical, site. Otherwise, you could end up competing against 
yourself for search engine rankings.
Unfortunately, many Web sites don’t handle the dual-version URL issue cor-
rectly. They end up with pages from both the www and the non-www URL 
versions indexed by the search engines. This is a problem because if both 
the www and non-www versions of a URL are indexed, your pages look like 
duplicates in the index — this causes the search engines to filter some of 
your pages out of their search results. Similarly, if there are links pointing 
to both versions (either internal links on your own site or external links 
originating on other Web sites), your link equity is diluted because it’s split 
between the two URLs. (Link equity refers to the value of all your incom-
ing links, which search engines use to determine your page’s authority and 
expertise on its subject matter.)
We always recommend that sites 301 redirect the non-www version of any 
URL on its site to the www version. Doing so prevents duplicate content 
from being indexed and also protects your link equity from being diluted.
 
It doesn’t matter which way you go — you could point the www version to 
the non-www version just as effectively as you could point the non-www ver-
sion to the URL starting with www. However, it’s more usual to make your 
www version the main site.
To ensure that www.yourdomain.com is indexed as your canonical site, you 
need to do one of two things. The first and best way to make sure your site 
is indexed the way you want it to be is to set up a 301 redirect (permanent 
redirects, not any other kind) that points the entire yourdomain.com site 
to www.yourdomain.com. This ensures that any kind of spider or browser 
that comes to your site gets the version of the domain that you want them to 
see, with no mistakes. (Remember, you can find all the nitty-gritty details on 
doing this in Chapter 4.)

Reconciling Your WWW and Non-WWW URLs
In February 2009, a rare collaboration by Google, 
Yahoo!, and Microsoft resulted in a new Head 
section tag called link rel=canonical. 
If you have a single Web site domain that has 
identical or nearly identical pages that have 
different URLs (such as pages with session ids 
or tracking codes), there’s now a way you can 
specify which page you prefer to have indexed 
and treated as the original.
Identical but separate pages within a site can 
be the result of poor site design, but more often 
than not it’s the result of a content management 
system (CMS) spitting out long URL strings full 
of parameters, categories, or session IDs. This 
causes search engines to find lots of different 
URLs that all contain the same page content. 
That kind of duplicate content is bad for your 
search engine optimization.
The big three search engines say that this new 
feature is not something that should take the 
place of proper redirects or any of the other 
best practices we cover for avoiding duplicate 
content (in Book V, Chapter 4, for example). 
However, if your site has duplicate content 
issues that you cannot solve in one of the pre-
ferred ways, you should use this to hint to the 
engines which page they should treat as the 
original.
You add link rel=canonical tags to 
your HTML pages to tell the search engines 
which of your pages to consider the canonical 
versions, and which ones to consider dupli-
cates. You could do this for every instance of 
duplicate content on your site. Here’s how:
Say that your preferred (canonical) page for 
Ford Mustang hubcaps is
http://www.classic
cars.com/product.
php?item=MustangHubcaps
But your CMS sometimes creates URLs like 
these for the same page:
http://www.classiccars.com/
product.php?item=MustangHub
caps&category=accessories
http://www.classiccars.com/
product.php?item=MustangHub
caps&trackingid=1234&session
id=5678
You can now add the following tag inside the 
Head section of these duplicate content URLs, 
to tell the search engines where to find the 
canonical version of that page:
<link rel=”canonical” 
href=”http://www.classic
cars.com/product.
php?item=MustangHubcaps” />

Reconciling Your WWW and Non-WWW URLs
set up 301 redirects and you don’t want to dump your Web host, you have 
another option. You can submit www.yourdomain.com to Google as your 
preferred domain. (This works for Google only, so you might still have 
issues with Yahoo! and Microsoft Live Search.) Google allows you to submit 
your preferred domain to them in their Webmaster Tools. This allows you 
to decide which versions of your URLs you want indexed, which can help 
prevent any potential problems from the non-www issue. Please see www.

edirects are HTML or server commands that automatically forward 
incoming links and users from one page’s URL to another URL, which 
is an extremely useful Web site-maintenance technique.
Of the four types of redirects we covered in the previous chapter (301, 302, 
Meta Refresh, and JavaScript redirect), only the 301 redirect passes the 
test for search engine optimization (SEO) friendliness. In this chapter, we 
cover how to set up 301 redirects and show you some specific situations 
that call for them. Because a lot of this explanation involves step-by-step 
instructions, we give a set of instructions for each server. Your server is the 
software that runs your Web site. The server receives and “serves up” user 
requests to display pages or perform other site tasks.
If you aren’t sure what type of server your site runs on, ask your Webmaster 
or your hosting provider (the service where your Web site is physically 
hosted).
Getting the Details on How 301 Redirects Work
The 301 redirect tells the search engine that the page at location A has per-
manently moved to location B. It says that one URL is forever replaced by 
another URL, like www.shoe-site.com/oldpage.htm has moved to www.
shoe-site.com/newpage.htm, which is a very clear-cut, unambiguous 
message. The search engine responds by doing three things:

496
Implementing a 301 Redirect in Apache .htaccess Files
 
1. Dropping the now defunct page from its index (database of Web pages 
from which the search engine pulls search results).
 
 This ensures that the old page won’t be included in search engine 
results pages (SERPs).
 
2. Including the new page in the index, so that it’s available for searching.
 
3. Transferring the old page’s link equity to the new URL.
 
 (Link equity refers to the value of all incoming links to a page, which the 
search engines use to determine a Web page’s authority and expertise in 
its subject.)
In the next few pages, you find instructions for creating 301 redirects on the 
following types of servers:
 
✦ Apache server
 
✦ Microsoft IIS server
 
✦ ISAPI_Rewrite for the Microsoft IIS server
Don’t forget to test. After you’ve put your redirect in place, be sure to test 
to make sure you did it properly. Just type the old URL into your browser’s 
address bar and press Enter. If you’ve implemented your 301s correctly, 
you’ll immediately see the new page (and the new page’s URL in your 
address bar).
 
When setting up redirects, you must be careful. The server programs require 
a strict syntax to be followed, similar to a programming language. If you 
change a server configuration file (such as .htaccess) and your changes are 
just one character off, it can literally take your site offline until the mistake is 
corrected. Reading this book alone cannot prepare you to work at the server 
level. Make sure that whoever makes the types of modifications shown in 
this chapter really knows what they’re doing.
Implementing a 301 Redirect 
in Apache .htaccess Files
Redirecting pages or sites on an Apache Web server is very easy. You do it 
by modifying a file on your Web site called the .htaccess file (note that the 
actual file name begins with a period.) The .htaccess file is a control file that 
allows server configuration changes on a per-directory basis. The file con-
trols that directory and all of the subdirectories contained within it. Usually, 
this file is placed in the root folder of your Web site. It is very important that 
when you edit Apache files that your editor saves the file in UNIX format or 
errors may occur.

497
Implementing a 301 Redirect in Apache .htaccess Files
 
The .htaccess file should be set up by default, but if your root folder doesn’t 
contain the file, have someone who understands how to build an .htaccess 
file create it. Be careful here. Some upload (FTP) programs hide the .htac-
cess. You don’t want to overwrite an existing .htaccess with your update.
Here’s an example of a .htaccess file for a site that moves from ASP to 
PHP and redirects the non-www version to www (note that where it says 
mydomain, you should put in your own domain):
# BEGIN
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.mydomain\.com$
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.mydomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]
RedirectMatch 301 (.*)\.asp$ http://www.mydomain.com$1.php
</IfModule>
# END
Before you start, you should make sure that you can access your .htaccess 
file. If you have access to your server so that you can upload and modify 
files, you should have no problem. (With the Apache server, modifying the 
.htaccess file does not require administrator-level access rights.) If you 
cannot access files in your Web folders, call your hosting provider and 
request this ability (or contact the person who can access these files 
for you).
To edit the .htaccess file to redirect page(s) on your Web site, you must first 
know the URL(s) of each Web page/site you want to redirect, and the URL(s) 
of the new page/site where each will be redirected to. Then follow these 
steps:
 
1. Log on to your Web site. In the root Web folder, locate the file called 
.htaccess.
 
 If there is no .htaccess file present, you need to create one. Again, be 
careful that there really is no .htaccess present and that you aren’t over-
writing one.
 
 .htaccess is a hidden file, so you need to enable your FTP program to 
view hidden files to be able to see it.
 
2. Open the .htaccess file using a text editor such as Notepad.
 
 A code editor like Adobe Dreamweaver also handles the .htaccess file 
perfectly, because it opens it as text, but a simple text editor also does 
the job.
 
3. Edit the file as needed, being careful to follow the exact syntax 
required. (See the examples in the following sections.)

498
Implementing a 301 Redirect in Apache .htaccess Files
To add a 301 redirect to a specific page in Apache
Add a line to the .htaccess file that tells the server what to do. The two 
ways to do this follow, and they both accomplish the same thing. (Note: You 
would substitute your own file URLs and domain name (the root part of your 
site’s URL) when using the examples given here.)
RedirectPermanent /old-file.html http://www.mydomain.com/
new-file.html
or:
Redirect 301 /old-file.html http://www.mydomain.com/new-
file.html
To 301 redirect an entire domain in Apache
To redirect an entire domain, you would add a line to the .htaccess file that 
gives the server your instructions. A redirection from one domain to another 
would be written like this:
RedirectPermanent / http://www.new-domain.com/
To break these down, each 301 redirect command contains three parts:
 
✦ The first part tells the server what to do, and you can type this in two 
ways, either RedirectPermanent or Redirect 301.
 
✦ The second part shows the old file’s relative path (its file location in rela-
tion to the current directory where the .htaccess file is located). If your 
.htaccess file is in your root Web directory, you can use the file’s URL 
without the domain name, such as /old-file.html.
 
✦ The third section is the full path to the new file. Starting with the http://,
 you want to include the complete URL (such as http://www.mydomain.
com/new-file.html).
After you’ve inserted the commands to 301 to redirect your pages, you need 
to put a blank line at the end of the file. Your server reads the .htaccess file 
line by line, so you have to include an endline character at some point to let 
the server know you’re finished.

Implementing a 301 Redirect on a Microsoft IIS Server
Implementing a 301 Redirect 
on a Microsoft IIS Server
 
Whereas an Apache server is comparatively easy to deal with, IIS is much 
more complex. Our recommendation would be to consult with your ISP to 
validate all IIS changes before you make them live. If your Web site resides 
on a Microsoft IIS server, you must have administrator-level access rights 
in order to set up a 301 redirect. You can add greater flexibility to your IIS 
server by installing a plug-in called ISAPI_Rewrite. With this plug-in, you 
can access your Web files without needing administrator access rights to 
the server. (We recommend that you request the ISAPI_Rewrite for your IIS 
server because with it you can work with the files hands-on, rather than rely-
ing on a third-party to make the changes you need.)
To redirect page(s) on your Web site, you must first know the URL(s) of 
each Web page/site you want to redirect, and the URL(s) of the new page/
site where each will be directed to. Then follow these steps depending on 
which version of IIS you’re running.
To 301 redirect pages in IIS 5.0 and 6.0
To redirect pages in these versions of IIS, do the following:
 
1. Start the Internet Services Manager (Start➪Programs➪Administrative 
Tools➪Internet Information Services Manager) and select the Web site 
you want to redirect from.
 
2. Right-click on the file or folder you wish to redirect and choose 
Properties.
 
3. Click the Home Directory tab and select the option at the top labeled 
A Redirection to a URL.
 
4. Enter the full URL of the page/site you’re redirecting to.
 
5. Make sure A Permanent Redirection for This Resource and The Exact 
URL Entered Above are selected.
 
6. Click Apply.
You may also want to pass a control variable to the new URL (the one you’re 
redirecting to), which is a code that communicates additional instructions 
to the server. Control variables can make your job a lot easier, giving you 
shortcuts for applying changes. Table 4-1 shows the various options.

Example
$P
Passes parameters 
that were passed 
to the URL to the 
new URL
If the request contains parameters 
such as www.mydomain.com/mypage.
asp?Param1=1, $P would represent all the 
values after the question mark in the URL 
(for example, $P would equal Param1=1).
$Q
Passes the param-
eters including the 
question mark
This is identical to $P but includes the ques-
tion mark (so $P would equal ?Param1=1).
$S
Passes the match-
ing suffix of the URL 
to the new URL
If the request is for www.mydomain.com/
mydir/mypage.asp, $S represents /mypage.
asp. If the request was for www.mydomain.
com/mydir, the value of $S would be /mydir.
$V
Removes the server 
name from the 
original request
If the request is for www.mydomain.com/
mydir/mypage.asp, $V would contain every-
thing after the server name (such as /mydir/
mypage.asp).
*
Wildcard symbol 
used to take 
the place of any 
character
If you want to redirect all requests for HTML 
pages to a single .asp page, you could do so 
using *;*.htm;myasp.asp.
To 301 redirect an entire domain in IIS 5.0 and 6.0
When redirecting an entire domain, the control variable $V is the most useful. 
If you’re preserving the directory structures and page names completely and 
only want to change the domain name, you can simply type the new URL 
(such as the one below) with the variable in the Redirect to text box:
http://www.new-domain.com$V
Putting the $V control variable at the end of the new site URL redirects all 
directories and pages from the old site to the new one, as long as they have 
not changed. For example, www.oldsite.com/directory1/page1.html 
would redirect to www.newsite.com/directory1/page1.html. For com-
parison, without the $V variable, you would only redirect the home page. 
When you have pages that rank well with the search engines in your site, it’s 
especially helpful to redirect those pages using these variables as well.

Implementing a 301 Redirect on a Microsoft IIS Server
Occasionally you may need to change host-
ing providers or move your site to a new IP 
address. Your domain name stays the same, 
but your new IP address (the numeric code that 
identifies the logical address where your site 
resides on the Web) must be communicated 
to the Internet at large. There can be a delay 
before all computers see your new location, 
because of the way DNS servers cache (store) 
domain information. (A Domain Name System 
(DNS) server is an authoritative database 
that publishes information about the various 
domains assigned to it, which the rest of the 
Internet can see.)
The following procedure helps to minimize the 
downtime and confusion your site may experi-
ence while your new DNS information is being 
propagated. Refer to the following figure and 
follow the path numbers as you read the cor-
responding numbered steps.

To move a site to a new hosting provider, do 
the following:
 1. Modify the DNS on your new host to point 
to your existing (old host) site first. Don’t 
skip this important first step.
 2. Change the TLD (top level domain) infor-
mation at your domain registrar (the com-
pany where you registered your domain 
name) to point to your new site DNS. Your 
old site should still show by either IP or 
domain name. This step starts propagating 
your new DNS information to DNS servers 
worldwide.
 
 Although the actual length of time varies 
depending on when each server next grabs 
its update, it’s a safe bet that the whole pro-
cess will take up to 72 hours to complete. 
Therefore, you shouldn’t proceed with the 
next steps until waiting about four days.
 3. Copy your existing site to your new site, 
and then validate that all files have trans-
ferred and that the links work.
 4. After waiting the four days for your new 
DNS information to be propagated, point 
your new DNS to your new site.
 5. Check to confirm that your old site’s mail-
boxes have been emptied before you 
change any DNS information. After this 
DNS change occurs, you won’t be able to 
retrieve your old mail.
 6. After everything has been validated, point 
the old DNS to your new site. (This is for 
safety, just in case you run into a propaga-
tion problem.)
How to move a site to a new host

Implementing a 301 Redirect on a Microsoft IIS Server
To implement a 301 redirect in IIS 7.0
This is how to implement a 301 redirect within a Microsoft IIS 7.0 server. 
Note that there are many cases where it would be more appropriate to 
rewrite a URL, which means changing just the displayed URL, rather than 
sending a user to a new page. (We talk about rewrites in the next chapter.)
You would set up a redirect in IIS 7.0 when you physically move files or 
directories, or when you need to relocate your physical site contents from 
one domain to another. In order to set up a 301 redirect on a Microsoft 
IIS server version 7.0, you must have administrator access to the Internet 
Information Services (IIS) Manager. In order for you to have this access, your 
site must use a dedicated server (meaning that yours is the only site on the 
server) and you must have administrator-level access rights.
If those preparation issues are taken care of, you’re ready to set up your 301 
redirect:
 
1. Open the Internet Services Manager (Start➪Programs➪Administrative 
Tools➪Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager).
 
2. In the left column, select the site, directory, or page that you want to 
redirect from.
 
3. Next, using the Features View in the main window, locate the icon 
labeled HTTP Redirect and double-click it.
 
4. Check the box labeled Redirect Requests to This Destination and type 
in the URL where you want to redirect to.
 
 These examples show the proper syntax for different types of destinations:
 
 Redirecting to a single page:
www.mydomain.com/newpage.htm
 
 Redirecting to a directory:
www.mydomain.com/newdirectory
 
 Redirecting to a domain:
www.mydomain.com/
 
5. If you’re keeping the directory structures and page names the same, 
make sure the two check boxes under Redirect Options remain 
unchecked:
 
 Redirect All Requests to Exact Destination: You would only check 
this option if you wanted every file that’s within the directory or 
domain you’re redirecting from to be rerouted to a single page.
 
 Only Redirect Requests to Content in This Directory: You would 
check this option if you wanted to redirect only the files located in 
the selected directory, but not redirect any subdirectories.

Implementing a 301 redirect with 
ISAPI_Rewrite on an IIS server
The ISAPI_Rewrite plug-in can make your life much easier if your site runs on 
a Microsoft IIS server. It allows you to upload, download, and modify your 
Web site files yourself, without having to have administrator access to the 
server. It also lets you handle 301 redirects without having to get your host-
ing provider involved.
You can obtain ISAPI_Rewrite from a number of software vendors, but here 
are the ones we recommend you check out:
 
✦ Helicon Tech: The ISAPI_Rewrite plug-in from Helicon Tech (www.isapi
rewrite.com/) is excellent; this is the one we usually use in-house. 
They have a free and a paid version. If you are on a shared hosting 
server, you need the paid version to apply the changes to only your 
site as the free version makes changes globally (to all sites on the Web 
server). This software works with IIS versions 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0.
 
✦ Microsoft: If you’re using IIS version 7.0, which ships with Microsoft 
Server 2008, you can use the Helicon Tech tool or the Microsoft URL 
Rewrite Module, which can be downloaded and installed into IIS 7.0. The 
download is available in two versions, so download the appropriate one 
for your server, either 32-bit (www.iis.net/downloads/default.
aspx?tabid=34&g=6&i=1691) or 64-bit (www.iis.net/downloads/
default.aspx?tabid=34&g=6&i=1692). Two exciting features of this 
product are its ability to import Apache .htaccess files and convert them 
into the rule set for IIS, and its helpful interface for writing rules that’s 
an improvement over simply editing configuration files.
Because there are different flavors of the ISAPI_Rewrite software, your actual 
code syntax may be different. You need to follow the specific rules for your 
software. However, for your reference, we give you two samples of redirects 
created in ISAPI_Rewrite in the next two sections.
To 301 redirect an old page to 
a new page in ISAPI_Rewrite
Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the file named httpd.ini located at the root of your Web site.

504
Using Header Inserts as an Alternate Way to Redirect a Page
 
2. Type the code into the file, following this example but substituting 
your own oldpage filename and newpage URL:
RewriteRule /oldpage.htm http://www.mydomain.com/
newpage.htm [I,O,RP,L]
To 301 redirect a non-www domain to 
the www domain in ISAPI_Rewrite
Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the file named httpd.ini located at the root of the non-www ver-
sion of your Web site (the site you’re redirecting from).
 
2. Type the appropriate code into the file, following this example, which 
is for redirecting http://domain.com to www.domain.com (be sure 
to substitute your domain name):
RewriteCond Host: ^mydomain\.com
RewriteRule (.*) http\://www\.mydomain\.com$1 [I,RP]
Using Header Inserts as an Alternate 
Way to Redirect a Page
If you’re just skimming through this chapter because you don’t have access 
to your server configuration files (the .htaccess file on Apache, or your 
Windows IIS Manager), fear not! We have another solution that enables you 
to redirect Web pages. It’s a bit more tedious, but it works.
An alternative way to implement 301 redirects is by adding code directly 
into the page you want to redirect. Yes, it means opening and modifying 
each page individually, but sometimes that kind of granular control is a good 
thing — especially if you only need to redirect a few pages. Called a header 
insert, this method involves placing a small amount of server code into the 
HTML of each page you want to permanently redirect to another URL.
 
Most Web programming languages allow you to add a header insert on a 
page. Note that all of these languages are server-side, meaning that they’re 
compiled or interpreted on the server into a page, and then the compiled 
version is sent back to the user’s browser. This type of 301 redirect involves 
modifying the response header information on a page (extra information 
that’s passed from the server to the browser, which helps the browser dis-
play the page properly but which is not visible to users). So you must insert 
the code at the very top of your page’s HTML code (on line #1) for the 301 
to work. This ensures that the server sees this code first before sending the 
page back to the user.

Using Header Inserts as an Alternate Way to Redirect a Page
 
For your reference, we’ve compiled a list of the most common programming 
languages and given sample code for each. Note that the examples are case-
sensitive, so you want to follow their use of uppercase and lowercase charac-
ters exactly. Based on which programming language your Web site uses, you 
can refer to the correct example in the upcoming sections to see a header 
insert that accomplishes a 301 redirect in your programming language.
PHP 301 redirect
The PHP scripting language is widely used for creating Web pages. (PHP 
originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it’s grown a lot since its infancy 
in the mid-1990s.) Some attributes of PHP are
 
✦ Usually used with Apache Web servers, but can also work with IIS.
 
✦ Has really good community support and several plug-ins/frameworks 
that make it pretty easy to use.
 
✦ Is fairly fast.
Here’s the sample 301 redirect code for PHP:
<?php
header(“HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently”);
header(“Location: http://www.mydomain.com/newpage.php”);
exit();
?>
ASP 301 redirect
ASP stands for Active Server Pages, which is Microsoft’s original server-side 
script environment. Developed to run with their Internet Information Server 
(IIS) version 3.0 Web server software, it’s admittedly an old program, but 
many Web sites still use it. (Note that Microsoft is currently vending IIS ver-
sion 7.0.) Some attributes of ASP include
 
✦ Works with IIS servers. With the advent of ASP.NET development, most 
ASP scripts are being upgraded to ASP.NET.
 
✦ Is backed by Microsoft, so the support is pretty good. There are a lot of 
good examples and scripts to use and customize.
 
✦ Is fairly fast.
Here is sample 301 redirect code for ASP:
<%
Response.Status = “301 Moved Permanently”
Response.AddHeader “Location”, “http://www.mydomain.com/
newpage.asp”
%>

ASP.NET 301 redirect
ASP.NET is a free Web site-building technology available from Microsoft. 
Some attributes of ASP .NET are
 
✦ Almost always used with IIS servers. This technology also works with 
Apache servers that have the MONO extension installed.
 
✦ Has great support from Microsoft.
 
✦ Overall, the speed is good. The initial request may take a little longer 
while the application puts everything together, but after that’s done, 
it’s fast.
The following sample 301 redirect code for ASP.NET must be inserted in the 
.aspx file:
<script runat=”server”>
private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
Response.Status = “301 Moved Permanently”;
Response.AddHeader(“Location”,”http://www.mydomain.com/
newpage.aspx”);
}
</script>
JSP 301 redirect
JSP stands for JavaServer Pages, which is a Java-based Web development 
technology. Here are some attributes of JSP:
 
✦ Usually used on the Apache Tomcat Web server.
 
✦ Supported by Sun and an open source community. It has excellent 
documentation.
 
✦ The speed is good, with the initial request taking a little longer while the 
application puts everything together.
Here is some sample code for a 301 redirect on JSP:
<%
response.setStatus(301);
response.setHeader(“Location”,”http://www.mydomain.com/
newpage.jsp”);
response.setHeader(“Connection”,”close”);
%>

ColdFusion 301 redirect
Now an Adobe product, ColdFusion is another programming language fre-
quently used for Web pages. Some attributes of ColdFusion are
 
✦ Usually hosted through a Microsoft IIS Web server, but can also be run 
in Apache.
 
✦ Made and supported by Adobe. The documentation is adequate.
 
✦ The speed is okay, but not great.
ColdFusion 8 or later versions require 301 redirects to be written like this:
<cflocation url=”http://www.mydomain.com/newpage.cfm” 
addToken=”no” statusCode=”301”>
ColdFusion 7 or earlier versions require 301 redirects to be written like this:
<cfheader statuscode=”301” statusnext=”Moved Permanently”>
<cfheader name=”Location” value=”http://www.mydomain.com/
newpage.cfm”>
CGI Perl 301 redirect
Some Web sites are built using CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting in 
the Perl programming language. Some attributes of this are
 
✦ Perl can be run on anything, but is usually run through an Apache Web 
server.
 
✦ Perl has been around for a very long time, which makes finding exam-
ples and documentation easy. There are a lot of modules that you can 
use to help with specific tasks.
 
✦ The speed isn’t as good as some of the other, newer languages, but it 
still delivers fast enough Web responses.
Here is sample 301 redirect code for CGI Perl:
$q = new CGI;
print $q->redirect( -uri => 
 “http://www.mydomain.com/newpage.cgi”, -nph => 1, -status => 
301);

Ruby on Rails 301 redirect
This Web development tool is specifically designed for building database-
backed Web applications. Attributes of Ruby on Rails include
 
✦ Fast application development, can run through the IIS and Apache Web

ehind every Web page viewed in a browser is a host of technologies and 
services working to make the star performers look good: the backend. 
Just as a Hollywood blockbuster has a crew of people supporting the actors, 
your Web site has servers, code, shopping carts, and, most importantly, your 
content management system that all must perform at their best to turn out a 
superior experience for your customers. A Web content management system 
(CMS) is a software program that helps simplify Web site creation. A CMS 
uses a database (such as your database of products, if you have a store), and 
publishes Web pages in an orderly, consistent fashion. It pulls information 
from your database and builds pages dynamically. This means the pages don’t 
actually exist until someone asks for them. If you have 10,000 products, you 
don’t want to build 10,000 individual pages by hand. Instead, you use a CMS to 
build them dynamically on the fly.
In this chapter, you discover the problems inherent in using a CMS to build 
your Web site. For all of their advantages, content management systems can 
sabotage your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. You also discover 
some technical solutions that can help you overcome these CMS issues, 
such as rewriting URLs to have names that are more search engine-friendly. 
We also give you tips for picking a good CMS, if you must have one, and how 
to modify its settings to work better for SEO. Last, for those of you who use 
the Yahoo! Store module, we tackle how to optimize those product pages.

Avoiding SEO Problems Caused by 
Content Management Systems
Content management systems seem like a Web site owner’s best friend. A 
CMS gets a Web site operational fast and keeps it running smoothly. It can 
manage data, image files, audio files, documents, and other types of content 
and put them together into Web pages. They create the pages based on 
templates, which are standard layouts that you design, so that your Web site 
has a consistent and cohesive look. Large sites managing thousands of items 
use them because the CMS keeps everything organized and systematic. 
Small sites benefit because with a CMS, they don’t even have to know HTML 
(HyperText Markup Language, the predominant markup language used on 
the Web): The CMS can do the technical work for them.
 
There is a catch, however. With automation comes a loss of control. When 
an airline pilot puts his plane on autopilot, the computer takes over com-
pletely and flies the plane according to a set course, adjusting things like 
altitude and speed based on its preprogrammed settings. If the plane needs 
to land unexpectedly, the pilot first has to take it out of autopilot mode. 
Otherwise, the autopilot stubbornly keeps the plane on its predetermined 
course.
Similarly, a CMS can be pretty inflexible when it comes to allowing you 
to make changes. And in order to optimize your Web site for the search 
engines, you must be able to customize your pages down to the smallest 
detail.
Understanding why dynamically generated 
pages can be friend or foe
If you have a store with several thousand products for sale, you don’t want 
to create a page for each item by hand. Instead, you’re going to use a CMS to 
assemble Web pages with product descriptions, pictures, prices, and other 
content pulled directly out of your product database. These dynamic pages 
look unique to the end user, but behind the scenes, they’re usually not.
 
For your pages to rank well in search engines, they must be unique. Search 
engines want to give their users a selection of relevant results. The search 
engine isn’t doing a very good job if half of the first 10 search results all 
point to the same content. Instead, search engines try to give users a choice 
by offering results that each deal uniquely with the keywords (the word or 
phrase the user searched for). So the search engines are always on the look-
out for duplicate content (Web pages containing some or all of the same text). 
When they identify duplicate content, they keep what they think is the most 
authoritative version and throw out the rest. Because of this, pages that are 
too similar run the risk of being excluded from Search Engine Results Pages 
(SERPs) altogether.

CMS Troubles
511
Avoiding SEO Problems Caused by Content Management Systems
CMSs typically create all kinds of duplicate content problems. By default, they 
often build non-targeted content, or generic text that isn’t customized for your 
various subject themes and keywords. You want to make sure each and every 
of your Web pages has unique text for all parts of your Web pages, including
 
✦ Title tags: The Title tag is part of the HTML code behind each Web 
page, and the search engines pay a lot of attention to it. The Title tag 
usually gets displayed as the bold heading in a SERP result, so it should 
specifically contain that page’s keywords.
 
 CMSs often put the same Title tag on every page. It might be the com-
pany name, the domain name (the root part of the Web site URL, such 
as wiley.com), or the company name plus a few keywords — but it’s 
applied as one-size-fits-all.
 
✦ Meta tags: Your Meta description and Meta keywords HTML tags also 
need to be different on every page. The Meta description is often what 
shows in your SERP result as the two-line description. The Meta key-
words tag needs to contain the keywords that are specific to that page. 
Out of the box, your CMS can’t be trusted to build these Meta tags in an 
SEO-friendly way.
 
✦ Headings: Your H# heading tags are HTML-style codes applied to your 
page’s headings and subheadings to make them stand out. The search 
engines look at these heading tags as clues to what a page’s main points 
are. They need to be keyword-rich and unique.
 
 CMSs often create heading tags that are generic (such as “Features 
Overview” or “More Details”), rather than specific and full of your tar-
geted keywords.
Dealing with dynamic URLs and session IDs
Content management systems create pages that search engines may con-
sider duplicates in another way, and that’s through dynamic URLs (the Web 
address of a page, usually starting with http://).
CMSs build the URL string dynamically for every page request. Dynamic 
URLs created by a CMS often contain variables (characters that vary). When 
variables are added to the end of a URL, it forms a new URL. Search engines 
think each URL is a distinct page, which causes duplicate content issues 
when the same content shows up under many different URLs.
Here are two common types of variables that CMSs often add to URLs, but 
there are many others:
 
✦ Session IDs: Many CMSs add a session ID code to the end of URLs as a 
user travels through the site. The purpose is to track the user’s session 
(the time period the user has been active on the Web site), but append-
ing the session ID to the URL is a really bad way to pass it from page to 
page. It causes every view of every page to have a different URL.

512
Avoiding SEO Problems Caused by Content Management Systems
 
✦ Categories: Products can be classified in many ways. For instance, a 
shoe store online could let users search by style, color, size, price, and 
so forth. Giving users many different paths to get to the same pair of 
shoes is good for your business and your users, but your CMS needs to 
handle it correctly. Often what happens instead is that the same product 
page ends up displaying under multiple URLs. For example, the two fol-
lowing URLs would both point to the same content, but the URLs differ 
because the CMS put the parameters for color and brand in a different 
order based on the user’s selection path:
www.shoe-site.com/pumps.asp?color=red&brand=myers
www.shoe-site.com/pumps.asp?brand=myers&color=red
There are many good reasons not to like dynamic URLs:
 
✦ They can cause duplicate content. As we mentioned, you can end up 
with different URLs having the same page content because their param-
eters vary.
 
✦ They aren’t user-friendly. Dynamic URLs usually include query strings, 
which are the parts of a URL that pass data to a page. Query strings 
aren’t readable because they contain symbols (such as ?, &, and +) as 
well as codes, session IDs, and so on. They look messy, or worse, intimi-
dating, to your human visitors.
 
✦ They’re long. Dynamic URLs with query strings end up being really long 
and cumbersome. These URLs are impossible to remember and difficult 
to type. Studies have shown that long URLs on search results pages 
aren’t clicked as often as shorter, understandable URLs, so your long 
URLs could actually be driving business away from your site.
 
✦ Search engines don’t like them. To ensure that your site is easy to 
crawl and index, you should prefer static URLs (URLs that don’t change). 
If a URL has a long string of parameters, the spider may just stop right 
there and not even crawl the page. (Note: The search engines continue 
to improve their techniques, and they may someday overcome this dif-
ficulty. However, making the search engine spider’s job as easy as pos-
sible is always the safest course.)
 
✦ They’re bad for your SEO. If the search engines don’t crawl your 
page, it won’t end up in their index (database of Web pages that search 
engines maintain), which means that searchers won’t be able to find it.
 
The best condition for search engine optimization is to have one static URL 
per unique page. Where the page content remains unchanged, there should 
be no change to the URL. You don’t want to put any variables directly into 
your URL strings except for ones that actually correspond with changed 
page content. You need unique content for every URL.
Now that we’ve made a case against the use of dynamic URLs, we want to 
explain how you can compensate for them on your Web site. 

Book VII
Chapter 5
CMS Troubles
513
Avoiding SEO Problems Caused by Content Management Systems
Here are some solutions for dynamic URLs:
 
✦ Remove session IDs: If your site passes session IDs through the URL 
string, you should correct your CMS or server application so that it no 
longer does this (using cookies or some other technology). If that’s not 
possible, consider using “user agent sniffing” to detect search engine 
spiders or you can try the link rel=canonical tag discussed at the end 
of the previous chapter. When the page detects a search engine spider, 
the exact same content could be displayed, but in a parameter-free URL 
instead.
 
✦ Control the parameter order: Make sure your CMS allows for order-
ing logic. You need to specify the sequence of parameters in URLs. One 
product could fall into many different categories on your Web site, but 
no matter how the user navigates to find it, that unique product should 
have only one page at only one URL address.
 
✦ Limit the number of parameters: If possible, keep the number of param-
eters being passed to a minimum. If you can limit it to one parameter in 
a URL, the search engines should be able to spider your pages and users 
won’t find them too intimidating. Here’s a sample URL with one parameter:
http://www.yourdomain.com/product.cfm?product_id=xyz
 
✦ Rewrite the URLs: If your CMS simply won’t cooperate and insists on 
building URLs that are long and ugly, you can go over its head and 
rewrite the URLs at the Web server (the software application that runs 
your Web site, receiving each user request and “serving” back the 
requested pages to the user’s browser) layer.
Rewriting URLs
At the server layer, you can rewrite those complex URLs as clean, concise, 
static-looking URLs. Rewriting doesn’t change the name of a physical file on 
your Web server or create new directories that don’t physically exist. But 
rewriting changes the page’s URL on the server layer (the viewable layer, or 
how the URL appears to the user and to search engines) and is visible on the 
presentation layer. So for example, if you have a shoe Web site and your CMS 
spits out product pages with long, parameter-laden URLs like this:
http://www.shoe-site.com/product.cfm?product_id=1234&line=wom
ens&style=pumps&color=navyblue&size=7
You could rewrite them to something simpler like this:
http://www.shoe-site.com/womens/pumps/productname.cfm
Notice how much more readable the rewritten URL is. This directory struc-
ture shown is just an example, but it illustrates how potentially you can have 
the domain name, directories, and the filename give information about the 
Web page. In this case, not only have you gotten rid of the ugly query string, 

514
Avoiding SEO Problems Caused by Content Management Systems
but also the directories “women’s” and “pumps” are short, understandable 
labels. Anyone seeing this URL has a good idea what the Web page contains 
before they even click to view it. Presenting a concise, informative URL like 
this to search engines can increase your Web page’s ranking — you’ve basi-
cally got the makings of a keyword phrase right in the URL. Additionally, pre-
senting this type of short, readable URL to users can also make them more 
likely to click to your page from a SERP, which increases traffic to your site.
The process of rewriting a URL is often called a mod_rewrite, which stands 
for module rewrite because that’s what it was originally called on the 
Apache server. Today, that term is used generally to refer to any URL 
rewrite, regardless of which server brand is involved. A mod_rewrite basi-
cally involves two parts:
 
✦ RewriteRule: You specify what rule, or action, you want the server to 
apply.
 
✦ RewriteCond: You also set up the conditions for when and how the rule 
should be applied.
 
When you rewrite Web pages to new URLs, you also need to redirect the 
old URLs if they are already indexed with the search engines. (A redirect is 
an HTML command that automatically forwards incoming links to a differ-
ent page.) One SEO rule of thumb is that whenever you remove a page that 
has been indexed, you must redirect it with a 301 (permanent) redirect to 
another page. That way, the search engines and any visitors linking to the 
old page are automatically sent somewhere new. You also don’t lose the link 
equity (value of the incoming links, which the search engines count towards 
your page’s authority) from whatever links may exist on external Web sites 
pointing to your old URLs. (We cover redirects in Chapters 3 and 4 of this 
minibook, if you want more information.)
You can do the redirect as part of a rewrite just as a failsafe measure, or you 
can find out for sure whether a particular page has been indexed first. On 
Google, you can do a search such as [site:yourdomain.com], replacing your-
domain with your actual domain (and removing the brackets). This search 
shows you every page Google has indexed from your domain. 
You need someone trained to work with your server software to create 
mod_rewrites. If you’re determined to try it out yourself, we’ve listed a few 
Web sites below that you can look at for reference, based on your server:
 
✦ Apache server: The Apache Web site has full documentation on how 
to do mod_rewrites (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/
mod_rewrite.html).
 
✦ Microsoft IIS server version 6.0 or earlier: You need to install an ISAPI_
Rewrite plug-in in order to rewrite your URLs. We recommend the one 
from Helicon Tech (www.isapirewrite.com/). From the same site, 
you can access extensive documentation that includes lots of examples.

Choosing the Right Content Management System
 
✦ Microsoft IIS server version 7.0: You can install the Microsoft URL 
Rewrite Module that can be downloaded and installed into IIS 7.0 (www.
iis.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=34&g=6&i=1691).
 
✦ Extras: We like the well-organized and helpful cheat sheets provided by 
www.addedbytes.com/. You can click the Cheat Sheets link at the top 
to see what’s available (mostly for Apache).
Choosing the Right Content Management System
Despite the disadvantages of content management systems for your SEO 
campaign, you might have a site that simply can’t do without them. For large 
stores, social media sites, forums, and other sites that have a large amount 
of page content that changes frequently, a CMS that can produce a site 
dynamically is a practical necessity. The CMS’s advantages in automatically 
managing all of that changing content outweigh its disadvantages.
You do need to find a CMS that won’t impede your SEO efforts. The main 
thing you want to find is a customizable system. You need to be able to 
change anything and everything on a per-page basis and not have your hands 
tied. SEO requires a lot of tweaking as you monitor each page’s performance, 
your competitors’ pages, the user experience on your site, and so forth. You 
must be able to modify a Title tag here, a Meta keywords tag there.
Here are some things to look for when you’re shopping for a CMS:
 
✦ Customizable look and feel: This isn’t SEO really, but it’s important 
nevertheless — you want to be able to choose a “look” for your site that 
fits your subject matter and appeals to your audience. We’ve already 
discussed minimizing bounce rates and increasing conversions. If the 
design turns off your target visitors, or it looks like a bunch of other 
sites, you’re sabotaged from the start. Be sure that you can modify the 
HTML templates (page layouts) and CSS styles (formatting of fonts and so 
on, using Cascading Style Sheets) so that you can ensure an appropriate 
look and feel that’s consistent throughout your site.
 
✦ Ability to externalize CSS and JavaScript: Look for the ability to set up 
external JS and CSS files. You need to externalize it to keep your code nice 
and tidy and keep your pages running fast. Plus, if your CSS is externalized, 
you have to make changes to only one file instead of hand-editing every 
single page each and every time you want to tweak the look of your site.
 
✦ Customizable directory structure: You want to be able to control how 
your files and directories are organized. Ideally, when you categorize 
your Web site into subject themes (which we call siloing your Web site), 
this is reflected in the physical file structure as well as in your internal 
linking scheme. Deciding how to categorize your Web site is an SEO 
activity, based on how people search and what brings in the most traffic. 
You don’t want your CMS dictating, for example, that your files should 

516
Choosing the Right Content Management System
be organized by brand and then by product type, if your SEO research 
tells you that you’ll get more search traffic organizing by product type 
and then by brand. (For more on how to silo your site, see Book VI.)
 
✦ Customizable page elements: Your CMS must allow you to customize 
the Title tag, Meta description tag, Meta keywords tag, heading tags 
H#, link anchor text, image Alt attributes, and every other element on 
your pages. You need this flexibility for every page, whenever needed, 
as you see fit.
 
✦ Customizable HTML output: You need to be able to control the HTML 
output of pages on your site. How the HTML is structured matters 
because that’s where the search engine spiders crawl. You want to con-
trol, for example, the order of tags in the head section (Title at the 
top, followed by description, keywords, and then any other Meta tags 
you need). You may also need to do content stacking, which moves large 
blocks of HTML coding down to the bottom of the page so that the spi-
ders can get to your rich text content as soon as possible. You want to 
ensure the other SEO-friendly guidelines are followed, such as using an 
external .CSS file to control formatting, and an external .JS file to house 
JavaScript if that’s used on your site.
 
✦ Ability to include analytics tracking codes: You need to know what is hap-
pening to your site, where your visitors are from and where they’re going 
to, what their behavior is and follow each visitor through a conversion.
 
✦ Customizable rules: Your CMS should let you specify rules that can be 
applied across lots of pages at once, especially if you have a site with 
thousands of products. You don’t want any factory presets spitting out 
the same Title tag on every page, for example. Instead, you should 
be able to write a rule for how each product page’s Title tag should 
be created to ensure each tag is unique and SEO-friendly (for example, 
“Item Category Brand” or “Category Item”) and the ability to change any 
element by hand if deemed necessary.
We wish that we could come right out and 
tell you which CMS we recommend. But we 
can’t. First of all, the CMS that’s right for one 
site doesn’t necessarily work for another. They 
have different features and capabilities, and 
you have to choose one based on what your 
site needs. Secondly, no CMS that we know of 
today is really geared for SEO. At this point in 
their development, SEO-friendliness is sort of 
off the features lists. As more and more poten-
tial customers demand SEO-compatible fea-
tures in the future, we hope that changes.
A relatively new product called PixelSilk, how-
ever, promises to be fully-SEO friendly. It was 
designed with SEO in mind and is probably 
worth a look. (In the interests of full disclosure, 
we worked closely with the PixelSilk team 
during their product development.)

Customizing Your CMS for SEO
 
Customization is crucial for your search engine optimization. You need a 
CMS that allows for customization of every single element on your Web site. 
Period.
Customizing Your CMS for SEO
The shopping list we just laid out can help you pick out a good CMS if you plan 
to purchase one. Or, if you already have a Web site running on a CMS, the 
list should point out the strengths or weaknesses of that purchase. Better 
yet, if your site doesn’t have lots of changing content, you can avoid the CMS 
issue altogether! But for those Web sites that need a content management 
system, this section gives you tips for making your CMS work for you.
The two main principles are
 
✦ Set up rules that make every page have the ability to exist with unique 
SEO elements.
 
✦ Customize these individual page elements as needed to optimize them 
against the competition for the search engines.
Creating rules for each of your important SEO elements is a key part of 
making a CMS work for you. You should be able to define how the CMS puts 
together the Title tags, Meta description and keywords tags, heading tags, 
hyperlink anchor text, image Alt attributes, and everything else on your 
pages.
For instance, if you have an e-commerce store, you have many fields in your 
database that pertain to each product, such as the product name, product 
ID, and product description. You’ve also done some categorization work 
and probably have each product assigned to a product category, style, type, 
size, color, flavor . . . you get the idea.
 
Often, manufacturers require that all retailers use their predefined product 
descriptions. You might be struggling with this very same problem because 
obviously it’s hard to rank well for product searches if your page just dupli-
cates the same text shown on countless other sites. Here’s what we suggest 
you can do to make your product pages stand above the rest:
 
✦ In addition to the mandatory product description, include more descrip-
tive text on the product page itself. How-to instructions, useful historical 
information, even just a paragraph about a hands-on viewpoint are all 
options for adding keyword-rich content.
 
✦ Make sure you fully optimize the other on-page factors and use these to 
help increase keyword effectiveness on the page.
 
✦ Make sure the image Alt attribute is unique and contains keywords.

518
Customizing Your CMS for SEO
 
✦ Customize the Title, Meta description, and Meta keywords tags on 
the page.
 
✦ Enable users to write product reviews on your site. This adds content 
about the product in the users’ own words, which can potentially match 
more search queries.
Create rules that define how the Title tag, Meta description tag, and Meta 
keywords tag should be put together on each product page. These rules 
should produce tags that meet the best practice guidelines for SEO, includ-
ing the proper length, capitalization, ordering, and so on. (You can find best 
practice details in Book V, Chapter 3.)
Also create rules that apply heading tags H# appropriately throughout your 
page. Headings should be hierarchical, with a H1 at the top of the page and 
other heading tags (H2, H3, and so on) throughout the page. Search engines 
look at the heading tags to confirm that the keywords shown in the Title 
and Meta tags at the top are accurate, so make sure that they contain the 
page’s main keywords and are unique to that page.
You should specify rules for every output element possible. You want to 
take advantage of the CMS’s ability to automate your site, but control that 
efficiency. Make sure that your resulting site is search engine-friendly and 
user-friendly, full of pages that are each unique.
After you have rules set up for how the CMS should construct your pages, 
the second part is customization. You should be able to tweak individual 
pages, applying all of the SEO principles covered throughout this book as 
needed. Here are a few scenarios to consider.
 
✦ Single page tweaking: Your online shoe store might carry a shoe that’s 
a hot seller in brick and mortar stores, but for some reason you aren’t 
getting much traffic for it online. You might want to do some competi-
tive research and keyword research, and then manually modify the key-
words in the tags and body copy of that particular product page to see if 
you can improve sales through that page. (You could also consider cre-
ative marketing options to attract more business for that product, such 
as adding supporting pages with articles, video, images, reviews, links, 
and so on.)
 
✦ Long-Tail keyword targeting: If your tags and headings contain specific 
product information, this helps you rank well for Long-Tail searches 
(search queries that contain multiple specific terms, rather than generic 
words). For instance, someone who searches for a particular shoe with 
a specific search like [Rockport Navigation Point brown] tends to be a 
serious shopper ready to make a purchase. It’s beneficial if your pages 
are optimized for long-tail searches, in that case, because the lower 
amount of traffic they generate is offset by the high potential for conver-
sion. Make sure your CMS doesn’t build only generic tags and headings.

Book VII
Chapter 5
CMS Troubles
519
Optimizing Your Yahoo! Store
 
✦ Generic word targeting: To balance out the previous scenario, you also 
may want to bring in more traffic to your site by optimizing for generic 
words and phrases. For instance, the pages on your shoe store site 
that have Rockports could also be optimized for the phrases [Rockport 
shoes] or [mens shoes] or [leather shoes]. In those cases, you want the 
ability to tweak certain things on the individual pages in order to rank 
for generic keywords as well, and capture more traffic to your site.
SEO is often a balancing act. The previous two bullet points illustrate this — 
these two scenarios explain why you want to optimize the same shoe prod-
uct page simultaneously for specific (Long-Tail) keywords and for generic 
keywords. We can’t stress enough the need to have full customization con-
trol over your Web site: Finding the right balance in a situation like this may 
take some trial and error. To practice effective SEO, you must be able to 
override the default output created by the CMS and modify individual pages 
as needed.
Optimizing Your Yahoo! Store
Yahoo! has a service called Yahoo! Merchant Solutions (http://small
business.yahoo.com/ecommerce/) that many people use to set up an 
e-commerce site quickly. The platform provides an easy way for a small 
store to get up and running. It offers store owners design templates, a step-
by-step wizard for inputting products, site hosting, and an e-commerce func-
tion that can accept credit card, debit card, and PayPal payments. It’s like a 
proprietary content management system just for Yahoo! We’re not endorsing 
the Yahoo! store here, but because many people use it, we felt it had a place 
in our book. If that includes you, read on: This section shows you how to get 
the most SEO value out of your Yahoo! store.
 
We’re just scratching the surface here. If you really want to dive into the 
unique opportunity that Yahoo! stores represent, check out Starting a Yahoo! 
Business For Dummies by Rob Snell (published by Wiley).
The good news is that it is possible to make a Yahoo! store rank highly for 
certain keywords. The bad news is that it’s going to be harder to do than if 
you operated your own site and used a customizable CMS. Your ability to 
optimize a Yahoo! store for the search engines is limited. You can modify 
some things, such as the look of the site, the domain name, and some of the 
important page elements (which we explain shortly). However, you can’t 
tinker with the inner workings of your site, such as
 
✦ Robots text (.txt) file: You can’t touch your robots.txt file, which 
instructs the search engine spiders which pages not to index and where 
to find your site map (file that lists the pages in your Web site, linked 
so that spiders can easily navigate). All Yahoo! stores have an identical 
robots.txt file.

520
Optimizing Your Yahoo! Store
 
✦ JavaScript: You can’t modify the JavaScript (a programming language 
used to apply interactive features to your Web pages).
 
✦ Control file: You cannot directly modify the .htaccess file, which is the 
central file you use to configure commands for an Apache server. This 
means that you can’t set up page-specific 301 redirects, which are the 
SEO-preferred method.
 
 You can create Meta refreshes, which are not search engine-friendly but 
do accomplish a redirect by causing the page to reload and display a dif-
ferent URL.
 
✦ Other: You basically cannot make server-level modifications to your 
store site, and your ability to customize pages is also limited. Yahoo! has 
its own programming language (RTML), and this coupled with the limi-
tations has driven many store owners to hire third-party design firms 
that specialize in customizing Yahoo! stores to do the customization 
for them.
To optimize your Yahoo! store, you should 
approach it like any Web site optimization 
project. Go through this checklist of items we 
explained throughout this book:
 ✓ Know clearly what your site is about, who 
your target audience is, and what your 
site’s goals are.
 ✓ Inventory your site and your off-site 
resources (such as printed material and so 
on) to see what kind of content you can add 
to enhance your site’s subject relevance.
 ✓ Do keyword brainstorming and research 
to determine what words and phrases you 
want to optimize for.
 ✓ Do competitor research for those keywords, 
looking for opportunities to move your pages 
up in the search engine rankings.
 ✓ Silo your site by establishing clear subject 
themes between related pages through 
linking.
 ✓ Examine your pages (using tools) and then 
work to improve the on-page elements like 
text content, headings, and Meta tags, 
optimizing for your keywords.
 ✓ Make sure every page, heading, and tag is 
unique.
 ✓ Create a keyword-rich site map.
 ✓ Implement good navigation links through-
out the site that pass link equity to the main 
pages you want to rank well and give users 
an easy way to move through the site.
 ✓ Consolidate different domains into one 
(such as the non-www and www versions 
of your domain) to avoid having duplicate 
content.
 ✓ Monitor, analyze, and continue to go 
through this checklist, refining and adjust-
ing your site. (Remember, SEO is never

An SEO checklist for Yahoo! stores

Optimizing Your Yahoo! Store
 
From an SEO perspective, the best way to use the Yahoo! platform is to inte-
grate it with an existing site. For example, you could operate your online 
shoe store by building your own Web site with everything except the shop-
ping cart pages. Users would browse and make selections within your site, 
and then you could programmatically pass them to your Yahoo! store pages 
for the checkout process. You could integrate the two parts of your site 
together almost seamlessly by giving them the same look and feel.
Yahoo! offers three packages to choose from: starter, standard, and profes-
sional (for details, check out http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
ecommerce/plans.php). The three options vary widely in terms of the 
monthly and transaction fees. Your best option depends on your expected 
revenue and your business model; however, the standard and professional 
packages allow for more customization, analytics, reports, and other fea-
tures that are helpful if you’re trying to optimize the site.
Because it’s operated by a search engine, a certain degree of search engine 
friendliness is already built into Yahoo! Merchant Solutions. One big SEO 
advantage is that Yahoo! stores are automatically included in the Yahoo! 
index, so they can come up in Yahoo! search results.
On a practical level, here are some Yahoo! store site elements you can con-
trol that are important for SEO:
 
✦ Domain name: By default, Yahoo! structures your store’s domain like 
this: storename.stores.yahoo.net. If you want your store to rank in 
the search engines, you should use your own domain instead. Register a 
good domain name (see Chapter 2 of this minibook for some guidelines), 
and then use the Domain Redirect Setting in Yahoo! to permanently redi-
rect all Yahoo!-generated URLs for your store to your domain name.
 
✦ Title tags: Yahoo! creates a Title tag for each page using your busi-
ness name and the page name. Because the Title tag is a key indicator 
to the search engines of what your page is about, you probably need 
to customize what shows up in your Title tags so that they are each 
unique, of an appropriate length, and contain the keywords you’re trying 
to rank for in the search engines. Yahoo! lets you edit your Titles indi-
vidually (manually) using the Advanced Editor mode.
 
✦ Meta tags: Go to the Site Settings area of your Yahoo! account to see 
how your Meta description and Meta keywords tags are being built, 
modifying them as needed. You can also modify them for an individual 
page using the Page Settings link.
 
 For guidelines on writing effective Title, Meta description, and Meta 
keywords tags that help your pages rank with the search engines, see 
Book IV, Chapter 3.

522
Optimizing Your Yahoo! Store
 
✦ Site map: Yahoo! automatically builds an XML site map page for you 
that’s invisible to users, but available to the search engines. You also 
have the option to create your own, which they upload if it follows 
proper protocol. For tips on creating a site map, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
 
✦ Custom 404 error page: When a user tries to access a page that doesn’t 
exist, your Yahoo! store handles the 404 server status (the error code 
that means the page is not found) by redirecting the user to your store’s 
home page. This is not user-friendly or spider-friendly behavior, so you 
should create your own custom 404 error page and upload it. (For help 
building a custom 404 page, see Book VII, Chapter 1.)
You can read step-by-step instructions for making the changes we describe 
in the previous bullets when you search the Yahoo! Help system (go to 
http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/smallbusiness/store/). 
Figure 5-1 shows the Search Help box you use to find articles you need.

You know the part of an instruction manual that’s just labeled 
“Troubleshooting”? It’s sort of a catchall for problems you might have 
that don’t fit anywhere else in the manual, with tips for what you can do 
about them. This chapter is sort of like that troubleshooting section — a 
place for us to address miscellaneous problems you might run into and give 
some advice on how to resolve them.
You should look at your search engine optimization (SEO) project as an 
ongoing process. It’s not a journey with a fixed end point. There’s no “desti-
nation” that you can reach and then hang up your keyboard and mouse and 
declare, “Ahh . . . we’ve made it!” Even if you reach the number one spot on 
the search results, you can’t relax; you must continually monitor and fine-
tune your site to stay ahead of the competition.
Occasionally, you will hit roadblocks to your SEO progress. These shouldn’t 
be confused with the time lag that normally occurs before results become 
apparent. Usually it takes an SEO project three to six months to see a Web 
site rise considerably in ranking and traffic, after you put the initial site opti-
mization in place. Of course, results are always based on the keywords and 
condition of your site when the project starts. Your mileage is going to vary 
based on the competition. Sometimes it happens within a few weeks or even 
a few days, but that’s very unusual — normally, results take several months. 
Some keywords actually take years to rank well.
However, you can run into obstacles with SEO. You might find out that a 
search engine doesn’t have any of your pages in its index (database of Web 
pages that a search engine pulls results from). Or you might find your site 
plummeting down the search engine results for no apparent reason. Or you 
might have difficulties related to setting up a secure server (the software 
and hardware that runs a Web site) for parts of your Web site. In this chap-
ter, you find out what to do when you run into these kinds of roadblocks.

Inviting Spiders to Your Site
Inviting Spiders to Your Site
You may have pages that are missing from one or more of the search 
engines, which causes lower or non-existent search engine rankings. If you 
suspect a specific page is missing, find out for sure by entering a long snip-
pet of text from that page in a search query, enclosed in quotation marks 
like this: [“Here’s a long snippet of text taken directly from the page”]. The 
quotation marks force the search engine to look for an exact match, so your 
page should come up in the results if it’s in the index at all. (By the way, this 
is also a great way to find duplicate content from your site.)
You can also check to see how extensively the search engines have indexed 
your entire Web site in a single search. To check for this at Google, enter the 
search query [site:yourdomain.com], replacing yourdomain.com with your 
actual domain (and removing the brackets). To check in Yahoo!’s search 
index, use Site Explorer (http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com). 
Enter your domain (or a specific page’s URL, if desired) into the uppermost 
box and click Explore URL. As shown in Figure 6-1, the initial view is the 
Pages tab, which shows you the total indexed page count and the beginning 
of the page results.

Inviting Spiders to Your Site
 
If desired, you can page through the results, or click the Export First 1000 
Results to TSV link to get the pages into a format you can re-sort and work 
with in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
If you discover important pages that haven’t been indexed, you need to 
invite the spiders to your site. You want them to travel all of your internal 
links and index your site contents. What follows are several effective ways 
you can deliver an invitation to the search engine spiders:
 
✦ External links: Have a link to your missing page added to a Web page 
that gets crawled regularly. Make sure that the link’s anchor text relates 
to your page’s subject matter. Ideally, the anchor text should contain 
your page’s keywords. Also, the linking page should relate to your 
page’s topic in some way so the search engine’s see it as a relevant site. 
After the link is in place, the next time the spiders come crawling, they 
follow that link right to your page. This sort of “natural discovery” pro-
cess can be the quickest, most effective way to get a page noticed by the 
search engines.
 
✦ Direct submission: Each search engine provides a way for you to submit 
a URL, which then goes into a queue waiting for a spider to go check it 
out. It’s not a fast or even reliable method to get your page noticed, but 
it won’t hurt you to do it.
 
✦ Internal links: You should have at least two links pointing to every page 
in your Web site. This helps ensure that search engine spiders can find 
every page.
 
✦ Site map: You should have a site map (list of the pages in your site with 
keyword-rich links) for your users, but for the search engines, you want 
to create another site map in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format. 
Make sure that your XML site map contains the URL links to the miss-
ing pages, as well as every other page you want indexed. When a search 
engine spider crawls your XML Sitemap, it follows the links and is more 
likely to thoroughly index your site.
The two versions of your site map provide direct links to your pages, which 
is helpful for users and important for spiders. Search engines use the XML 
site map file as a central hub for finding all of your pages. But the user’s site 
map is also crawled by the search engines. If the site map provides valu-
able anchor text for each link (for example, “Frequently Asked Classic Car 
Questions” instead of “FAQs”), it gives search engines a better idea of what 
your pages are about. Google specifically states in their guidelines that every 
site should have a site map (www.google.com/support/webmasters/
bin/answer.py?answer=35769#design).

526
Inviting Spiders to Your Site
There is a limit to the number of links you should have on the user-viewable 
site map. Small sites can place every page on their site map, but larger sites 
should not. Having more than 99 links on a page looks suspicious to a search 
engine because spammers have tried to deceive the search engines by set-
ting up link farms for profit, which are just long lists of unrelated hyperlinks 
on a page. So just include the important pages, or split it into several site 
maps, one for each main subject category. (For more tips on creating an 
effective site map, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)
However, unlike a traditional site map, XML site maps don’t have a 99 link 
limit. There are still some limitations, but the file(s) is meant to act as a 
“feed” directly to the search engines. For full details on how to create an 
XML site map, visit sitemaps.org, the official site map guideline site run 
by the search engines.
 
In addition to having the search engine spiders come crawl your site, which 
is the first goal, you also want to think about directing them where you want 
them to go within your site. For comparison, when people come over to your 
house, you don’t just let them roam around and look anywhere they want to, 
right? You lead them around, showing them what you want them to see — 
probably skipping the disorganized garage and messy utility room.
With search engine spiders, you don’t want them to see every page or follow 
every link either. The two reasons you want them to crawl around are
 
✦ Indexing: You want the search engines to index your pages so they’ll be 
found relevant to people’s searches and returned in search results.
 
✦ Better ranking: When the spiders follow your links, they pass link equity 
(the perceived-expertise value of all the inbound links pointing to a Web 
page, which is a search engine ranking factor) to your landing pages (the 
pages you’ve set up to be the most relevant for a primary keyword). 
Concentrating link equity on your landing pages makes those pages 
move higher up in the search engine rankings and bring in more traffic.
The rel=”nofollow” attribute may also 
help with siloing your site, which is a method 
of organizing the site into subject themes. 
Because the search engines look for the most 
relevant pages for any search query, you can 
strengthen your site’s subject relevance by 
linking related pages together into themed 
silos. Each silo should have a main landing 
page and at least five supporting pages linked 
to it, all centered on a particular keyword 
theme. To reinforce your landing pages’ rel-
evance to certain keywords, you can apply a 
rel=”nofollow” sparingly to only those 
cross-silo links that might be necessary for 
your users, but which would only confuse the 
spiders’ understanding of what the page is 
about. (For more on siloing, see Book VI.)

Inviting Spiders to Your Site
Some pages, like your Privacy Policy or Terms of Use, need to be in your 
global navigation but they don’t need to rank well in the search engine’s 
index. You don’t want to rank for those pages, or to dilute the link equity 
being passed to your landing pages. Instead, you should “herd” the spiders 
where you want them to go. To keep spiders away from certain pages, here 
are a couple of techniques you should know:
 
✦ Nofollow: You can put a rel=”nofollow” attribute on any link that 
you don’t want the spiders to pass Link Equity to. Using this technique 
on links to unimportant pages, you could concentrate link equity onto 
your landing pages.
 
✦ Robots text file (.txt) exclusion: Be consistent. If you add rel=”no
follow” to a link to prevent spiders from crawling to your privacy 
policy page, for instance, do it everywhere. Put the nofollow attribute 
on every link to that page. Also instruct the spiders not to index the 
page by excluding it in your robots text file (a central file that gives 
instructions to spiders of where not to go, check out Book VII, Chapter 1 
for more on editing your robots.txt file).
 
✦ Meta Robots exclusion: Another way to put up a “Do Not Enter” sign for 
search engines is with a noindex Meta robots tag on a specific page. (A 
Meta robots tag is an HTML command in the head section (top part) of a 
Web page’s HTML code that gives instructions to search engine spiders 
whether to index the page and whether to follow its links.) This tag is not 
needed if you’ve excluded the page in your robots.txt file. But to put the 
exclusion directly into the page code, you could add a tag such as this:
<META NAME=”ROBOTS” CONTENT=”NOINDEX”>
So far in this book, we’ve talked only about the search engine spiders. Those 
are the good spiders — the ones you want coming to your site. However, 
there are also bad spiders out there, ones that come only to harm you.
Spiders called scrapers come to steal your site content so that they can 
republish it on their own sites. Sometimes they grab entire pages, including 
the links back to your site and everything. One problem with scraping is that 
it creates duplicate content (the same or very similar text on two or more 
different pages) on the Web, which can cause your page to drop in ranking 
or even drop out of the search results if the search engines don’t correctly 
figure out which page is the original. Another problem is that scraped con-
tent may end up ranking above your page/site and grab traffic that should 
have been yours. Scraping is a copyright violation, and it’s also a crime 
punishable by law, if you choose to pursue that. Unfortunately, the more 
good text content you have on your site, the more likely you are to attract 
scrapers. So as your site expands and your SEO project raises your rankings, 
you’re probably going to run into this issue.
Webmasters have tried to prevent site scraping in various ways. Some have 
gone so far as to build a white list (a list of approved sites or agents) that 
contains only the known good spiders, and then exclude all non-white listed 

528
Avioding 302 Hijacks
spiders from entering their site. That extreme measure is not commonly 
done because it’s difficult to maintain a current white list without potentially 
excluding legitimate traffic to your site.
A more typical defensive move is to “sniff” out a bad spider using a server-
level process known as user-agent sniffing. This process identifies spiders 
coming to your site, kind of like a security guard at your front door. If you 
know who a bad spider is, you can detect their arrival and keep them out. 
Or, some Webmasters choose to do more than just block them; they redirect 
them to a page with massive quantities of data in hopes of crashing the bad 
spider’s site. Block them or punish them, you choose, but unfortunately you 
can only do this after you’ve identified a spider as a scraper — not before 
you know who they are.
 
To deter others from copying your content, we recommend that you display 
a copyright notice on your Web site and register for a federal copyright. For 
more suggestions on handling scrapers, see Book V, Chapter 4, in the sec-
tion titled, “Scrapers.”
Avoiding 302 Hijacks
Here’s a scenario that we hope never happens to you. Your Web site is run-
ning smoothly and ranking well with the search engines for your keywords. 
One day, you find that your search engine traffic is dropping dramatically. 
Then you notice that your pages have disappeared from the search engine 
results pages.
This nightmare scenario could mean that your site was a victim of a 302 
hijack. A 302 is a type of redirect (an HTML command that reroutes a user 
from one page to another automatically) used to indicate that one Web page 
has temporarily moved to another URL. The search engine retains the origi-
nal page in its index and attributes the content and link equity of the new 
page to the original page.
An unethical way to use 302 redirects is called 302 hijacking. This technique 
exploits the way search engines read 302 redirects in order to cause a Web 
page’s traffic and SERP rankings to be drained away and given to some other 
page (the “hijacker”). The hijacker is basically stealing your Web site, rank-
ings, and search traffic.
Here’s how it works: The hijacker sets up a dummy page, often containing a 
scraped copy of your Web page’s content, and 302 redirects it to your rank-
ing page. The search engines see the 302 and think that the hijacker’s page is 
the real version, but it’s temporarily using your page’s URL. So the 302 tricks 
the search engines into thinking that your ranking page is the temporary ver-
sion of the hijacker’s virtual page. The search engine therefore gives all of 
your link equity and rankings away to the hijacker’s URL. Figure 6-2 shows 

Book VII
Chapter 6
Solving SEO 
Roadblocks
529
Avioding 302 Hijacks
how a hijacked page’s listing might show in a SERP. Notice that the URL on 
the bottom line does not match the company name shown in the listing; click-
ing this link would take the user to some other page off the company’s site.
 
A 302 hijacking can be devastating to a site, causing duplicate content penal-
ties and loss of ranking. The search engines are aware of this issue and have 
all tried to put preventive measures in place. They have had some success 
combating this crime, but it still happens.
 
Be on the lookout for page hijacking by regularly searching for snippets of 
your page text (do a search using quotation marks to find an exact match) 
to identify copycat pages, but you know for certain that it’s happening when 
you see someone else’s URL showing up on your SERP listings. If you have 
this problem, contact the third-party site and ask them to cooperate with 
you to fix the situation. Page hijacking is often accidental (through improper 
use of 302 redirects), so you may be able to resolve it with the person 
easily. If you discover that their intentions are malicious, however, you 
should report the site to the search engines immediately for investigation. If 
you’re ever in this situation, you need to contact the search engine directly. 
Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to fix it on your own — the 
search engines have to remedy the situation for you.

Handling Secure Server Problems
Handling Secure Server Problems
You may have pages on your site where users provide sensitive data, such 
as a credit card number or other type of account information. The Internet 
solution for protecting sensitive information is to put those Web pages on a 
secure server. Technically, this means that the Web page is on a secure port 
on the server, where all data is encrypted (converted into a form that cannot 
be understood except by knowing one or more secret decryption keys). 
You can tell when you’re looking at a Web page on a secure server because 
http: changes to https: in the URL address. 
Secure servers can cause duplicate content problems if a site has both a 
secure and non-secure version of a Web page. Two versions of the same 
page end up competing against each other for search engine rankings, and 
the search engines pick which one to show in search results. Also, because 
people link to both versions of the page, neither page can rank well because 
they’ve split their link equity.
Here are some SEO-minded best practices for handling secure servers:
 
✦ Don’t make duplicates: Many times, people just duplicate their entire 
Web site to make an https version. This is a very bad practice because 
it creates instant duplicate content. Never create two versions of your 
site, or of any page on your site. Even if you exclude your secure pages 
from being indexed, people link to them at some point and the search 
engines find the secure versions through those links.
 
✦ Only secure the pages that need to be secure: If the page doesn’t 
receive sensitive account-type information from users, it doesn’t need 
to be secured. This is easily handled with a rewrite rule; refer back to 
Chapter 4 of this minibook for more on redirects and rewrites.
 
✦ Spiders shouldn’t be allowed to crawl secure pages: Search engines do 
index secure pages, if they can get to them. Banks usually have secure 
pages indexed because they often put their entire site on an https. 
Because of the nature of their business, it makes sense that banks want 
to give their users the utmost level of confidence by securing their 
whole site. However, the best practice is not to try to rank for pages on a 
secure server.
 
✦ Access secure pages through a logon: The cleanest way to handle 
secure pages is to put them behind a logon. Search engine spiders can’t 
crawl pages that require a logon to access, so they definitely won’t be 
indexed. You also raise the user-friendliness of your site by including 
a logon because users will clearly understand why they’ve moved into 
a secure server environment and feel more comfortable entering their 
account information there.

Book VII
Chapter 6

531
Handling Secure Server Problems
If your Web site has secure pages that violate these best practices, here’s 
how to fix it:
 
1. Identify which pages on your site need to be secure.
 
 Secure only the pages where users need to enter account information.
 
2. Make sure your secure pages are not duplicated.
 
 Your secure pages should only have an https:// version. Do not 
offer a non-secured duplicate version. All links to and from secure 
pages should be full path links; that is, they should begin http:// or 
https://. Relative links to secure pages is just asking for trouble.
 
3. Clean up duplicate pages using 301 redirects.
 
 If you currently have secure pages that don’t need to be secured, redi-
rect them to the http version using a 301 permanent redirect. That way, 
any links going to the secure pages are automatically redirected to the 
right pages. The same goes for non-secure pages that should be secured, 
only vice versa.

W
eb analytics are two words that can strike terror into the heart of 
any unsuspecting practitioner of search engine optimization (SEO). 
You’ve been monitoring your pay per click (PPC) campaigns (advertising 
campaigns where you pay every time someone clicks on your link) and you 
are watching to see how well your pages rank within the search engines. So 
you should be able to do Web analytics, right?
Well, Web analytics can be a little more complicated than that. For a lot of 
people, Web analytics seems to consist of wild guessing and reading tea 
leaves. It can be pretty complex, but we walk you through it so it hopefully 
makes a little more sense. In this chapter, we give you a basic overview of 
Web analytics, before we dive into the nitty-gritty later on in this minibook. 
We go over how to measure your success in the search engines, identify 
what numbers you need to be tracking, point out key indicators to be watch-
ing when measuring your performance, and cover tools and software that 
help you with Web analytics and what a log file analysis is.
Discovering Web Analytics Basics
Web analytics is taking the information you have gleaned from all of your 
research and sitting down, looking at it, and figuring out what all of it means. 
Bear with us: This can get a little tricky because the terms are so similar. In 
order to figure out Web Analytics, you need to know the two different sets 
of numbers you are looking at — Web metrics numbers and Web analytics 
numbers.

536
Discovering Web Analytics Basics
Web metrics
Web metrics is the measurement of what’s happening on the Internet itself. 
It’s focusing on the number and types of people online, the number of broad-
band versus dial-up connections, advertisers, advertisements (shapes, sizes, 
level of annoyance) and all things related to the Internet as a whole. Web 
metrics is asking: How many Web sites are there? How many searches? How 
many e-mails? How many of those e-mails are spam? Does it make sense to 
promote items online for sale to certain countries or to seniors? How many 
people search at Google versus Yahoo! versus MSN?
There are four ways of tracking Web metrics data, and several kinds of com-
panies that fall into a particular niche. These firms study the Internet as a 
whole. Think of them as Internet archeologists. They take all of the raw data 
they get and interpret it in their own way, using information from many, 
many sites and sources out there on the Internet:
 
✦ People: The first kind of company that tracks Web metrics data does 
so by using large panels of people whom the companies follow as they 
surf the Internet as part of their daily routine. These companies report 
which sites are the most popular and can have their panels check out 
your competitors and do a comparative analysis. These are companies 
like Nielsen Online (www.nielsen-online.com/) and comScore (www.
comscore.com/).
 
✦ Hits: The second type of Web metrics firm checks out the hits on the 
ISPs (Internet service providers). These firms are watching the masses 
out there surfing on the Internet. They report on how these unidentified 
(and sometimes unwashed) users research cars, read the latest celeb-
rity gossip, and watch news stories. Hitwise (www.hitwise.com/) is 
one such firm that tracks ISP hits.
 
✦ Responsiveness: A third type of Web metrics firm watches the respon-
siveness of popular Web sites. They track how well a popular entertain-
ment site holds up during the Oscars or the Emmys or if sports sites can 
handle the traffic during the Super Bowl, and which ones run the fastest 
and which ones drown under the increased demand. Two firms who do 
this kind of Web metrics are Keynote Systems (www.keynote.com/) 
and Tealeaf (www.tealeaf.com/).
 
✦ Commerce: The final group tracks online commerce. They watch how

Discovering Web Analytics Basics
Web analytics
On a smaller but no less important scale is Web analytics, which concerns 
itself with the particulars of a single Web site, instead of the entire Web.
The people who do Web analytics are looking at how successful your site 
is in attracting the kind of visitors who bring you conversions. Visitors who 
convert do whatever your Web site is asking of them: make a purchase, 
sign up for a newsletter, watch your videos, and so on. Using Web analytics 
means looking beyond just finding out where you rank or how many people 
clicked over from the search engine listing and actually checking to see how 
many visitors came to your site and provided you a conversion.
Your first step with Web analytics should be to determine what your visi-
tor does and what they should be doing when they arrive on your Web site. 
Where do they go on your site? Do your visitors drill down to the product 
information? Do they put things in their shopping carts? Are they less costly 
customers because they use the online customer care tools and services? Do 
they leave your site right away or do they stay a while?
Hopefully they’re able to easily accomplish what they came to your Web site 
to do. But if you have a Web site, you need to be able to measure whether 
your Web site design and development are worth the effort you’ve put into it.
This site-level arena in Web analytics is governed by software for sale and 
systems for use that gather, crunch, and report on data from server logs, 
cookie data, JavaScript, e-commerce information, and so on.
Without Web analytics, search marketers would be obsessed only with 
achieving a high ranking. If they’re a little more on the ball, they focus 
instead on generating as much traffic as they can. Unfortunately, high rank-
ing and high traffic are only part of running a successful site. If you are get-
ting high volumes of traffic but your visitors aren’t doing what you want 
them to do (for instance, no one is asking for you to customize their classic 
cars), all that high traffic is just going to cost you money. Your server is now 
handling more non-converting traffic, your PPC campaigns are being clicked 
on with no return on investment, and even the time you spent on optimiz-
ing your site to rank organically is time that could have been spent making 
money. Traffic is only worth it if it provides return on investment (ROI).
 
This is why targeted traffic is so important. Targeted traffic is traffic that is 
interested in your product or service and provides you conversions. Your 
success is determined not by the volume of visitors you receive, but the 
quality. First, however, you need to figure out what it is you want that tar-
geted traffic to be doing. That’s what we cover in the next section.

538
Measuring Your Success
Measuring Your Success
The first thing you need to figure out before you get started with Web analyt-
ics is to figure out your goals for your site. Say you have a Web site that spe-
cializes in classic car customization services. The first thing you want to do 
is measure the amount of sales generated on your site. That’s easy enough — 
but there are other activities that need recording as well. Other activities you 
can record include e-mail newsletter signups, file downloads, RSS subscrip-
tions (news feeds that automatically show updates to a site that offers one), 
and user account creation.
 
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to measuring success. Goals differ 
based on what your Web site does and what you want users to do once 
they reach your site. For example, your custom car site would be tracking 
different user actions than a political site that wants people to sign up for a 
newsletter. Many advancements have been made in analytics, so if there’s 
something you need to track, you can do it with an analytics program.
You’re probably like most people building commercial sites: A Web site is 
a key component of your business, and you need to be making money from 
your site in order to be successful. The common adage is true: You have to 
spend money to make money; however, you need to be spending money in 
the right places or you might as well be setting the cash on fire. So, what is it 
that you want your Web site to do? This should be a fairly obvious question, 
but in order to accurately do Web analytics for your site, you need to know 
what it is that gets you conversions. It’s extremely important to define your 
business objectives.
There are four basic classifications for commercial Web sites: e-commerce 
sites, content sites, lead generation sites and self-service sites. We’ve pro-
vided some basic goals for the four types of commercial Web sites. You can 
use this information in defining your own business objectives:
 
✦ E-commerce sites: The objective with e-commerce is to increase your 
sales and decrease your marketing expenses. Basic measures include 
sales, returns and allowances, sales per visitor, cost per visitor, and con-
version rate. Advanced measures include inventory mix, trend reporting, 
satisfaction, and RFM (recency, frequency, monetary analysis).
 
✦ Content sites: The objective here is to increase your readership-level of 
interest and time the user spends on the site. The things you measure 
are visit length, page views, and number of subscriptions and cancelled 
subscriptions.
 
✦ Lead-generation sites: Here the objective is to increase and segment 
lead generation (things like newsletters). Basic measures include down-
loads, time spent on the site, newsletter opt-ins, reject rates on contact 
pages, and leads-to-close ratio.

Book VIII

Measuring Your Success
 
✦ Self-service sites: Finally, the objective here is to increase customer 
satisfaction and decrease customer support inquiries. Basic measures 
include a decrease in visitor length or fewer calls to a call center, as 
these are measures of customer satisfaction.
With clearly defined objectives and a good analytics tool, measuring your 
Web site’s success becomes a whole lot easier. Your objectives state what 
you want to do with your Web site or your marketing campaigns.
Identifying what you are tracking
In order to start analyzing whether your Web site is doing what it needs to 
be doing, you have to acquire a sample of data. This sample allows you to 
extract a baseline report of data on your users.
Types of data vary from site to site. A data sample from an e-commerce site 
reads differently than a sample from a political newsletter. For Web sites 
that are not impacted by seasonal trends (meaning they see a spike in busi-
ness around a certain time of year), a three-month sample is a great baseline 
range to work with. After you’ve determined what your baseline sample is (if 
you have seasonal trends, take a sample from your busy and slow periods), 
start recording numerical and trended data for analysis.
As someone who is going to be doing Web analytics from a SEO perspective, 
you have to be looking at the information that makes your life easier in the 
long run. You can do that by focusing on the elements that are most relevant 
to search engine referrals — information such as
 
✦ Percentage of traffic from search
 
✦ Conversions (leads, sales, and subscriptions) from search
 
✦ Average time spent on site (or “visit duration”)
 
✦ Share of search traffic (Google versus Yahoo! versus Live Search, 
and so on)
 
✦ Pages clicked on
The information that you use in your baseline should be unique to your busi-
ness goals and ambitions.
It’s also critical to separate your paid search results from your organic 
search results. Paid search results come from pay-per-click (PPC) programs, 
where you can buy an advertising link on Google or any of the other search 
engines and pay a sum every time a user clicks on your ad. You need to sep-
arate these two types of results because it can skew your data and throw off 
proper analysis. You have to understand how subtleties in an SEO program, 
like descriptions in a listing or movement in a SERP (search engine results 
page), can impact your traffic and productivity.

540
Measuring Your Success
This is also true with all of your PPC paid search programs, when you need 
to calculate your return of investment (ROI) on specific engines, keywords 
(search terms), or ad campaigns. Many PPC programs include the ability to 
tag your pages and track visitors from click to purchase. For more on PPC 
analytics, please refer to Book X, Chapter 1.
With analytics, you can use different types of reports from any number of 
analytics packages as long as you know what to look for. But even without 
the analytics part, you need to think about a quality search experience. 
Regardless of how a user searches, you have to get them the information 
they want, while also trying to get them to perform your desired actions.
To help get you started, here are a few tips on items that you can track and 
measure:
 
✦ Top search queries: You would be surprised how many businesses 
lose out on those desired conversions simply because they’re targeting 
the wrong keywords. This is why keyword research is so very neces-
sary. Sometimes what you think would be a good keyword search term 
turns out to be quite the opposite. This is why it’s so important to be 
thorough in keyword research. You can read more on how to properly 
research keywords in Book II. This can be a tricky thing to measure 
because it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Targeting terms that already are 
bringing you traffic could mean missing out on a better term that would 
bring you even more traffic. Watch this metric, but don’t put all your 
eggs in this basket.
 
✦ Top landing pages: A landing page is a page that someone uses to get 
onto your site. It might not always be your main page, but generally that 
would be the one you want to be your big landing page. When dealing 
with top landing pages, your concern should be the source of referrals. 
Because we’re talking about search engine optimization, we recom-
mend looking at search engine results. This is your first contact with a 
potential visitor, so make sure that elements of your landing page speak 
to the search terms and the type of user you want to bring to your site. 
Changes in page titles, listing descriptions, and URLs can have an impact 
on a user’s desire to click on your page.
 
✦ Top exit pages: Something you also have to monitor are the exit pages. 
If users are consistently leaving your site on a common page, it’s a good 
idea to figure out why. The process of pathing is reviewing the flow, page 
by page, that a user takes while visiting your site. If you begin to see that 
quality search referrals come into your site but are always leaving at a 
particular point, you need to work on the content or user experience 
you provide to keep those users from leaving. To figure out your exit 
pages, you need to perform a reverse path analysis to determine why 
so many people are leaving at this one particular page. If the top exit 
page is the Thanks for Ordering page, you have nothing to worry about. 
However, these situations are rare. The most common top exit page is 
usually your home page.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Employing Site 
Analytics
541
Measuring Your Success
 
✦ Bounce rate: The bounce rate measures the percentage of people who 
leave your site right after entering a page, usually within seconds and 
without visiting any other page on the site. This stat goes hand-in-hand 
with measuring exit pages. If you have specific pages designated for SEO 
purposes, be sure to measure and track the bounce rate on a regular 
basis. You don’t get desired conversions if no one wants to stay on your 
page. Maybe you’re targeting the wrong people with that landing page — 
after all, just because you rank well for a particular keyword doesn’t mean 
the page that ranks is saying the right things to the people who come to 
that page. You need to dig in deeper and figure out what the mismatch 
is. Are your images loading too slowly? Is the page layout confusing? 
Does the content of the page not meet the visitor’s expectations?
Experimenting with Web analytics is key, especially because all sites and 
report suites differ. So find out as much as you can about your visitors 
and don’t be afraid to experiment with your reports and theories. There is 
always more information to know, and like everything else in life, we often 
don’t even know what we don’t know. The only way to shed light on the 
activities going on with your site is to start investing in Web analytics.
Choosing key performance indicators
Key performance indicators help organizations achieve organizational goals 
through the definition and measurement of progress. Key performance 
indicators (KPIs) are the yardstick by which you measure your Web site’s 
success. In order to properly do Web analytics, you need to know what your 
goals are in order to know what it is you need to be watching.
Your key performance indicators (KPIs) should be based on your overall 
business goals and the role your Web site plays in achieving those goals. 
KPIs should be specific to your company, not influenced by the industry 
averages or your competitors’ KPIs, and they should be specific, significant, 
and measurable:
 
✦ Organizational goals: It is important to establish KPIs based on your 
own business goals rather than standard goals for your industry. For 
instance, a company whose goal is “to be most profitable” has different 
KPIs than a company who defines their goal as “to increase customer 
retention fifty percent.” The first company has KPIs that relate to finance 
and profit and loss, whereas the second is focusing on customer satis-
faction and response time.
 
✦ Measurement purpose: It’s important to analyze KPIs over time, allow-
ing you to make changes to improve Web site performance and then 
periodically reevaluate performance to verify your progress. So KPIs 
must be measurable. The goal “increase customer retention” is useless 
because there is no real goal; the goal of “increase customer retention 
by fifty percent” has a definite number that can be tracked.

542
Measuring Your Success
 
✦ Managerial consensus: It is important to have all managers on the same 
page because personnel from different functions within your company 
help create the KPIs. If your KPIs truly reflect your organizational goals, 
all levels of your company have to get with the program. Encourage 
company unity and enthusiasm for the project, and make sure that 
everyone knows what the KPIs are. Everyone has to be on board, and 
they have to know what it is that they’re doing. A crew can’t steer a ship 
if one half of the crew thinks they’re sailing to Zanzibar and the other 
half thinks they’re supposed to be Saskatchewan pirates.
 
✦ Goal continuity: KPIs are long-term considerations designed to help with 
your strategic planning. Although it is important to have targeted goals, 
they should also lead to an overall success. Just because something 
is measurable does not mean that it is significant enough to be a key 
performance indicator. You must define your KPIs and weigh them the 
same way from year to year. It’s not that you can’t adjust your goals, but 
you should use the same unit to measure those goals. Like, your Web 
site goal should be to increase of the number of conversions the same 
amount year in and year out.
 
Although you should be creating very specific KPIs for your business, a few 
metrics qualify as regular key performance indicators all across the board. 
These include the KPIs for measuring reach, acquisition, conversions, and 
retention.
Measuring reach
Every business that promotes products and services needs to measure it’s 
reach on an ongoing basis. Reach is how you reach your customers, basi-
cally. These following metrics are useful for understanding the effects of 
marketing programs designed to reach new customers:
 
✦ Overall traffic volumes: This tracks large spikes or dips in the 
requested page views.
 
✦ Number of visits: This indicates how well you reach and acquire your 
visitors.
 
✦ Number of new visitors: This number gives you the first part of two 
numbers needed to calculate ratios to determine quality of new visitors. 
Are they giving you your needed conversions? Conversions divided 
by the number of new visitors gives you the overall conversion rate. 
Obviously, higher is better.
 
✦ Ratio of new to returning visitors: Identifying changes in overall audi-
ence makeup. In general, it’s cheaper to keep an old customer than bring 
in a new one. Are you retaining your customer base? Have you made 
changes that alienated your core demographic? Was your core demo-
graphic converting as well as the new demographic?

Book VIII
Chapter 1

Measuring Your Success
 
✦ Percentage of new visitors: This helps track the changes in your traffic 
due to marketing reach and acquisition efforts.
 
✦ Visitor geographic data: Here you identify your traffic spikes from unex-
pected locations. Where is your traffic coming from? This can give you 
information you can use to better reach your customers.
 
✦ Your top 5-10 error pages: This metric helps you identify and resolve 
visitor experience problems.
 
✦ Impressions served: The number of times the page loaded and a user 
viewed the content. You can use this metric to calculate your reach and 
the overall success of your marketing campaigns.
Acquisition
Measuring acquisition is easier than measuring reach. Acquisition is the mea-
sure of users that you bring to your site. The difference is that reach metrics 
depend on information from various sources, whereas acquisition metrics 
come from your own Web analytics data.
Acquisition measurement is focused on the number of visitors your Web 
site is acquiring and where they all come from. What follows are the metrics 
that can help gauge the success of your Web site and marketing initiatives in 
acquiring prospects and customers. The metrics you should be watching for 
acquisition are
 
✦ Percent of new visitors: You can use this number to flag big changes 
in new visitor acquisition and their effect on overall Web traffic. You 
use this number in conjunction with your total conversions to help you 
determine if they are giving you conversions or just slowing down your 
servers?
 
✦ Average number of visits per visitor: This stat can help you ensure that 
content consumption remains stable, which is an indirect measure of 
user experience.
 
✦ Average number of page views per visit: This metric allows you to 
understand the changing nature of visitors attracted to your Web site. 
Do they peruse the whole site, or escape after one or two pages?
 
✦ Page stick and slip (time on page and bounce rates): View big changes 
in stickiness (how long a user stays on a page) or slip (how quickly visi-
tors leave a page) on your home page and key entry pages, including 
PPC campaign landing pages.
 
✦ Average pages viewed per visitor: This is a short-term measure of how 
well you direct visitors beyond home page or landing page.
 
✦ Cost per visitor: This is a rise/fall metric that shows fluctuation of visi-
tor acquisition costs due to an increase or decrease in your marketing 
spending.

544
Measuring Your Success
Response metrics
Response metrics are what your users are responding to on your Web site, be 
it an image or a newsletter or an email. These are the key items you need to 
be watching for:
 
✦ Responses and respondents: These are important indicators of cam-
paign success.
 
✦ Cost per acquisition or cost per click: Measuring these keeps you within 
campaign budget.
 
✦ Referring domains/URLs: These help you watch your visitors based on 
needs and origin. Where are they coming from and what can you glean 
about their needs from the site they originated from?
 
✦ Search engines: Check and see who’s coming in from the search engines 
to ensure that the money you spend on SEO and PPC is justified.
 
✦ Search keywords and phrases: Track what keywords are bringing visi-
tors to your site. You can use this info from search queries to refine 
your marketing message and materials to include these keywords.
Note that the raw data for the preceding metrics is not useful by itself: Your 
most important metric is the relationship between your current and previ-
ous data measurements. As indicators of change, the preceding KPIs can 
alert you to the ever-changing quality and quantity of your visiting traffic, 
and this may call for additional research.
Conversions
Conversion metrics are among the most important indicators to measure and 
monitor. Conversion rates are easy to measure and can be improved by fine-
tuning your Web site; every online business should watch these numbers 
and have Plan B ready in case key conversion rates suddenly plunge.
When you measure conversions, you are also looking at abandonment — the 
ones who got away. Maybe they intended to complete an action but were 
frustrated during the process and bailed out. Industry-neutral average con-
version rates hover around 3 percent. This means only 3 out of 100 visitors 
across all industries complete an intended action.
What conversion rates should you measure? There are three basic pro-
cesses that can be measured for conversion versus abandonment and each 
depends largely on what your ultimate goal for your site is.
 
✦ Activities that lead to an acquisition or conversion: The user makes a 
purchase or requests a service. This one is probably the easiest to mea-
sure because you know when it’s done and you have the money in hand. 
You can see the actual impact in your bottom line.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Employing Site 
Analytics
545
Measuring Your Success
 
✦ Activities that lead to gathering important data: The user fills out a 
form, signs up for a newsletter, or contacts you. You haven’t actually 
made a sale yet but you have more information about that user and prob-
ably also their permission to continue the business relationship. This 
might be the end in itself, or just a step along your conversion process.
 
✦ Activities that direct visitors to information that reduces your opera-
tional costs: This one is trickier to measure because you’ll have to track 
multiple data points — how often someone accesses your FAQ or Help 
section, how many calls to your customer support group you’re receiv-
ing, how much those calls diminish after implementing a change aimed 
at giving greater support up front, or any other operational changes 
aimed at reducing overall cost.
Retention
Retention is how many customers you keep once they come to your Web 
site. Customer retention is important to Web sites for various reasons. For 
instance, research shows that keeping existing customers costs less than 
attracting new customers. Studies have shown that the cost for acquisi-
tion on a per-customer basis is much more than that of customer retention. 
Research also says there is a small chance of converting a prospect to first-
time customer status, and a low percent chance of reacquiring a lost cus-
tomer. So customer retention is key.
The following metrics and ratios can help tell you how you rate at customer 
retention:
 
✦ The number of returning visitors
 
✦ The average frequency of your returning visitors
 
✦ The ratio of returning visitors to all visitors
 
✦ The frequency of the visit
 
✦ How recent the visit was
 
✦ The activity of retained visitors
 
✦ The views of key pages and contents
 
✦ Your retained visitor conversion rate
 
✦ The customer retention rate
 
✦ The average frequency of return for retained visitors
Although some business models do not expect customers to make a second 
purchase right away (for example, auto, housing, or travel), very few Web 
sites are designed for a single visit from a visitor without a return. The KPIs 
listed here should be tracked regardless of your business model or industry:

546
Examining Analytics Packages
 
✦ The ratio of daily to monthly returning visitors — a quick measure of the 
average frequency of return for all visitors.
 
✦ The percent of returning visitors and the frequency of those returns.
 
✦ The loyalty measurements for groups of returning visitors — it monitors 
big changes in visitor loyalty. How many are you losing?
 
✦ Your retained visitor conversion rate — this helps in determining Web 
site or campaign success.
 
✦ Your customer retention rate — which helps determine your Web site 
success.
Examining Analytics Packages
Analytics takes a long time, several in-depth volumes, and possibly a college 
course or two to really properly do on your own. Fortunately for you, sev-
eral analytics packages out there do the number-crunching for you and make 
sense of all of the metrics you’re watching out for. Analytics packages are 
governed by software for sale and systems for use that gather, crunch, and 
report data from server logs, cookie data, JavaScript, ecommerce informa-
tion, and so on. We go over a few here in this section.
Google
Web analytics offerings range in price from free to, well, not even close 
to free. On the free side, the most well known is Google Analytics. Google 
Analytics (http://analytics.google.com/) is a tool for Web analytics. 
Google is putting everything they can think of in this tool in order to show 
you just how important it is for you to keep buying more keywords. Google 
Analytics also generates detailed statistics about the visitors to a Web 
site. The main highlight of this program is that it’s aimed at marketers as 
opposed to Webmasters and technologists from which the industry of Web 
analytics originally grew, which means it’s geared specifically towards busi-
ness types, not tech types.
Google Analytics can track visitors from all referrers, including search 
engines, display advertising, pay-per-click networks, e-mail marketing, and 
even digital collateral such as links within PDF documents. Google Analytics 
also allows you to track your landing page quality and monitors your conver-
sions. Remember, conversions don’t always mean sales. This program can 
track whether users are viewing the page you want them to. Figure 1-1 shows 
you the overview from Google Analytics.

You can also use Google Analytics to determine which of your ads are per-
forming (when used in conjunction with Google AdWords, Google’s Pay-Per-
Click advertising program, more on that in Book I). Google Analytics also 
provides shorthand information for the casual user and much more in-depth 
info for those who are a little more versed in Web analytics.
Google Analytics works through the Google Analytics Tracking Code (GATC). 
The GATC is a snippet of JavaScript code that the user adds onto every page 
of their Web site. This code acts as a beacon, collecting anonymous visitor 
data and sending it back to Google data collection servers for processing. 
Data processing takes place hourly, although it can be three to four hours 
before you can get your data back. The Google Analytics Dashboard (as seen 
in Figure 1-2) can give you information at a glance about traffic, site usage, 
and traffic sources, among many others.
The Google Analytics Tracking Code also sets first party cookies on each vis-
itor’s computer. Cookies are parcels of text that are used to track, authenti-
cate, and maintain specific information about users. The cookies are used to 
store anonymous information such as whether the user has been to the site 
before (new or returning visitor), what the timestamp of the current visit is, 
and where the user came from.

Google Analytics is very easy to install on your Web site. They provide 
HTML code snippets that you can copy and paste into your page through 
the Global element, which means that the code snippet applies to every 
page across your site, and you won’t have to go in and add it by hand, unless 
you’re using goal tracking or conversion tracking code.
Not to be outdone, both Yahoo! and MSN Live Search also have analytics 
packages. But as of writing, both of these programs are still in beta and 
might be a little buggy. But hey, they’re also free.
Omniture Site Catalyst
So with the free packages out there, why would you pay for an analytics 
tool? After all, they can wind up being very expensive. Because there’s more 
to running a Web site than attracting people through the search engines. 
Google Analytics is aimed primarily at users coming from search engines, 
but paid tools such as StatCounter and Omniture capture an enormous 
amount of information. Google provides you a lot of pre-formatted reports 

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Employing Site 
Analytics
549
Examining Analytics Packages
and can do a limited amount of custom reporting. But Google also won’t 
report when a user downloads PDF files, JPEGs, or Flash files. And if you 
need to know about server error messages, you have to look them up on 
your own.
The more sophisticated the tool, the more sophisticated the analysis you 
get back. Here’s an example of a detailed analysis: Say you want to know 
how those who bought from you found your site. Using an analytics package, 
that’s pretty easy. But what if you want to compare users who bought over a 
period of several weeks against the path those users took through your site 
and the time of day they showed up? And then you wanted to see how many 
people came from the same source (banner ad, keyword, press release) but 
then dropped out and left your site? This is where the more sophisticated 
Web analysis comes in.
You would need a high-end analysis tool in order to perform these multidi-
mensional queries. If you have a smaller Web site, knowing who showed up 
when from where and what they did would probably be enough data for you. 
But if you’re a much larger company, you need these more sophisticated 
tools in order to help you find more prospective customers and figure out 
the competition better.
These paid Web analytics tools are worth every penny you spend on them. 
Which is good, because Omniture is pretty expensive. Be prepared to spend 
$1,500 or more for this monthly subscription service if you purchase it 
directly from Omniture. Installation is also expensive: Set-up fees are usually 
around $5,000. But it’s worth it: Omniture is one of the best analytics pack-
ages out there. Figure 1-3 is the Omniture dashboard.
 
Omniture is both JavaScript and pixel-based and is good for large sites. It 
can do both A/B and multivariant testing. A/B testing is comparing one page 
with another, and multivariant is comparing multiple pages.
Omniture is also good because you can tie in outside data, like your market-
ing and your log file analysis (more on that in the next section) and get a more 
comprehensive report, whereas Google Analytics only covers online data.
 
One way to trim your costs is to buy Omniture through a reseller. Omniture 
costs a lot if you buy it directly from the company. They sell in “blocks” of 
page views per months. For example, the first block Omniture directly offers 
is 1–1,000,000 views; if your site only gets 8,000 views, you still have to pay 
the same amount as someone who gets 1,000,000 page views. A reseller, 
such as Bruce Clay, Inc, buys the blocks from Omniture and then sells out 
the individual page views. A reseller buys the 1,000,000 page view block, and 
then sells to four sites that each get 250,000 pages views for a lower rate. We 
sell ours at $98 per 100,000 page views a month. Thus, you get a break.

Others
StatCounter (www.statcounter.com) is another analytics package that is 
available as a free service. Like Google Analytics, it offers a stat counter that 
you can choose to have visible on your site or not. It also offers custom sum-
mary stats based on all your visitors and a detailed analysis of your last 500 
page loads. Plus, it gives you the ability to manage multiple sites from one 
account.
Also using StatCounter, you can figure out
 
✦ What keywords visitors use to find your site
 
✦ Which are your most popular pages
 
✦ Which links are used to reach your site
 
✦ What countries your visitors come from
 
✦ How visitors navigate through your site
StatCounter is pretty good for a free service, but you’re not going to get as 
much detailed information as you would get from one of the paid analytics 
packages.

Getting Started: Log Files Analysis
Your Web site generates a lot of information. All you need to do is check 
out your server logs and you can see that. Your server log is something your 
server automatically creates of all the activity it performs. It’s a record of 
everything that happens during a given time period, be it hours, days, or 
minutes. More than just recording page loads, the server load includes every 
image loaded, every script run, and so on. It is a moment by moment map of 
site activity that involves your server. So it should be really easy to just pull 
up your server logs and read who’s coming into your site, what they did, and 
where they came from, right?
Well, no, not really. Figure 1-4 is what your server log looks like. It does not 
make for light afternoon reading.
It’s filled with incredibly dense information because the computer is record-
ing it in its own language, which isn’t exactly readable for someone who 
doesn’t speak serverese.
 
When a user connects to your server, the server records a line of data that 
looks a little like this:
72.173.901.16 - - [06/Oct/2008:19:46:42 -0800] “GET /
Mustang67red.html HTTP:1.1” 200 22832 “-“ “Mozilla/4.7 
(compatible; Firefox)”
The numbers on the left tell you who is asking for the file. A reverse DNS 
lookup (looking at what server the user is coming from) tells you that it’s 
someone from www.mabelsmotors.com. This means someone came onto 
your site and looked up a file named Mustang67red.html. Time is calculated 
in the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), in this case 19:46:42 (7:46 pm on the 12 
hour clock), and the -0800 means the visitor is in the Pacific time zone. The 
request was from the 1.1. Hypertext Transport Protocol, and your server 
returned a 200, which meant it happily showed the file. A 404 or any other 

552
Getting Started: Log Files Analysis
error code (message the server sends when something goes wrong) means 
that it could not find the file or something went awry on your site. Errors are 
usually found in a separate error log.
Then the log file shows us that the server sent back 22,832 bytes of data, and 
the hyphen in quotes (“-”) lets us know the referral link. (The hyphen indi-
cates that the Web site link was entered manually rather than clicked. A visi-
tor coming from a link would have a referring URL in place of the hyphen.) 
The end line lets us know that the user is using the Netscape 4.7–compatible 
Firefox browser.
If your head is spinning, that’s completely understandable. And here’s 
what’s worse: the preceding code is (comparatively) simple to understand 
and analyze. But a big Web site generates something in the neighborhood of 
more than 80 gigabytes of server logs a day. So it could get pretty tedious, 
extremely time-consuming, and definitely frustrating to try and do this all by 
yourself. Fortunately, that’s why you have a computer.

Getting Started: Log Files Analysis
 
If you have a large site, you definitely want to host your log file analysis on a 
different server than the one you use to serve up the Web pages on your 
site. Major companies like Google have rooms and rooms full of servers 
because they serve millions and millions of pages a day, but they have entire 
server farms dedicated to log file analysis. Serving data is one thing; actually 
analyzing it is another bag of cookies altogether.
If you serve a million pages and each page is made up of ten files and each 
file is about 20 kilobytes, your server has to find, read, and send 200 giga-
bytes of data. To analyze the data, the software needs to categorize it, hold it 
in memory, compare it, and report on the findings. Sifting through a gigabyte 
of data is not something you want to do on the same machine that is serving 
those pages. The amount of work the machine has to do makes viewing your 
site incredibly slow, never mind making the server keel over and catch fire. 
So having a separate server (or servers) for your log file analysis is a good 
thing.
There’s the human factor, as well. It takes much more than a few IT guys 
on entirely too much caffeine to do a log file analysis. You’re going to need 
some tools to help you as well. But choosing the right one is a little tricky 
and there are some things you need to be thinking of when choosing a log 
file analysis tool:
 
✦ What is the target audience for the software? You need a log analysis 
tool that you can tailor specifically to your Web site’s needs. Some tools 
are meant for large, robust sites that have to crunch huge numbers 
daily; others are made for only basic use. Some are very user friendly, 
and others expect a certain level of expertise on your part. You have to 
take into consideration your industry, your Web site’s ins and outs, and 
your promotional campaign.
 
✦ Flexibility: The more powerful the tool, the more flexible it can be. 
Generic reports can be useful, but if you want to make your log file 
analysis really work for you, you need a tool that you can customize to 
your Web site’s goals. It’s not likely you’ll be able to do this with a log 
file report.
 
✦ Archiving: Log file analysis becomes more successful over time, but 
storing the data can become unwieldy. You need a tool that offers file 
compression and archiving that shrinks the files and stores them for 
future use.
 
✦ Output: Some tools just spit out numbers. Others arrange them neatly 
into graphs. A really good tool allows you to manipulate the data much 
easier than a bad tool, in order to compare and contrast from outside 
sources.

554
Getting Started: Log Files Analysis
 
✦ Scalability: The larger the site, the more likely it is that a low-end tool 
(or even a free one) is not going to cut it.
 
✦ Speed: The difference between getting your log reports right away 
versus getting them the next week depends on how powerful your 
machine is. But faster reporting gives you an edge, and the better tools 
use special indexing techniques to allow them to perform much faster.
Be aware that there is no such thing as an overnight success, no guarantees, 
and no instant gratification. Log file analysis, like all of SEO, is something 
that takes time and concentrated effort to do properly. Remember, the 
cheaper you want it, the cheaper you get it. High performance accurate tools 
that don’t crash if there is too much data are worth what they cost you.
Log file analysis tools
There are several log file analysis programs out there (usually running a 
quick search on Google will turn up several), but here are a few so you know 
what to expect.
 
✦ Weblog Expert (http://weblogexpert.com/): From their Web site: 
“Weblog Expert will give you information about your site’s visitors: 
activity statistics, accessed files, paths through the site, information 
about referring pages, search engines, browsers, operating systems, and 
more. The program produces easy-to-read HTML reports that include 
both text information (tables) and charts.” There is a free demo version 
available, and commercial versions start at $74.95 and $124.95.
 
✦ Sawmill (www.sawmill.net/): Has three different versions available. 
Sawmill LITE is the cheapest of the bunch and does the basics of log 
file analysis. Sawmill Professional is the next step up and is highly cus-
tomizable. Sawmill Advanced is the most expensive, and has the most 
gadgets, including multi-processors and e-commerce options. There is 
a trial version available, and the commercial versions run from $99 to 
$30,000. Enterprise versions for extremely large sites are also available.
 
✦ 123LogAnalyzer (www.123loganalyzer.com/): 123LogAnalyzer can 
do reports by cities/states/countries, analyze .zip and .gz (Unix) com-
pressed log files on the fly, and support logs from server farms (or load 
balanced servers) without having to upgrade license. There is a trial ver-
sion available, and commercial versions run from $99 to $699.

Check out traffic numbers
Here is a list of things to look out for in your log files to make sure your 
numbers are correct. Not every visitor to your site is a human, and it’s the 
humans you want the data on — not the robots:
 
✦ Search engine spiders: Search engines use programs commonly called 
spiders or robots that come to your site and “read” it to help the search 
engine to analyze your site. You can check and see if the robots.text 
file was requested (this is how you figure out if your site was spidered 
or not). When you recognize a spider, grab the IP address and let the 
analytics software know to ignore hits from that address. Most good log 
analyzers reverse IP lookup the IP address to find spiders and ignore 
them for you.
 
✦ Masked IP addresses: Not every IP address represents an individual 
user. Corporations, universities, and even users from AOL can show 
your server a single IP address when in fact many people have visited 
your site. Watch for high traffic from a single IP address to see if you 
have more visitors than your log file suggests.
 
✦ Cookies: Don’t expect accurate visitor counts from cookies. Many 
people set their browsers not to accept cookies. Cookies also can’t dis-
tinguish multiple users on the same computer (like a library or school 
computer). Log files, however, do not contain cookie info.
 
✦ Busting caches: Caching is what happens when there is a saved copy 
of your Web site. It throws off your analytics numbers because you can 
be accidentally working off of an old copy of your page. (JavaScript 
doesn’t cache, so you do not have to worry about this if you are running 
JavaScript tags.) One way to solve this problem is to create a dynamic 
page. A dynamic page is a page that is built on the fly from the database 
using scripts. You can also set your server to prevent caching if you 
have enough bandwidth.
 
✦ Know your audience: Some sites only track users who are logging on 
from home or from work, those sites filter users coming in from libraries 
and schools using public terminals. In general, this means they require a 
login or a persistent cookie, which public terminals are not likely to allow.
Analytics is not just about gathering data. It’s all about knowing what you 
want from your Web site and then being able to read the pile of data you’ve 
acquired in order to see whether those goals are being reached, and what 
else you need to be doing differently to get a higher rate of conversion.

n order to properly do Web analytics, you need to gather your data. But 
Web analytics is not just about collecting data. It’s about collecting your 
data in such a way that you can read and understand it, and you can use it 
to make the necessary changes to your Web site. In this chapter, you dis-
cover several ways to gather analytics data.
You have to measure your Web site’s usability, in order to figure out 
whether your Web design works for your users and brings you those con-
versions. Next we talk about conversion tracking. Is your site getting the 
number of conversions you want? Conversion tracking helps you measure 
not just the final number of conversions, but where people drop off before 
they make the final conversion.
Tracking the success of your SEO project is monitoring your keywords and 
your search engine rankings, and whether they’re at the place they need 
to be, and if your traffic is increasing due to those rankings. Finally, we dis-
cuss how to analyze your rankings by putting them in the context of your 
business. Do your rankings in the search engine mean anything to your ROI 
(return of investment)? Read on to find out!
Measuring Web Site Usability
One of the first things you should do is to gather data in order to measure 
your Web site’s usability. This means going through your site and testing 
how your users see your site, measuring whether the users are interacting 
with your site the way you want them to. There’s a few different ways to do 
this: by using personas, A/B and multivariate testing, and cookies and ses-
sion IDs. We discuss all of these methods in the upcoming sections.

558
Measuring Web Site Usability
Personas
Personas are created in order to measure certain statistics for a Web site. 
To create a typical persona, you profile a user who fits the demographical 
information of your target audience, but you customize the profile to fit a 
real person.
Here are a couple of sample persons: Jill is a 20-something white female from 
New York. She’s a professional with a fairly large disposable income. She 
reads through your Web site, and because your Web site is about classic 
car customization, she doesn’t find anything of interest to her, so she clicks 
on through. Doug is in his mid-thirties, works for a real-estate firm, and has 
three cars of his own already. He wants to stop and take a look at your site, 
and quite possibly subscribe to your newsletter.
But here’s the thing: Neither Jill or Doug are real. They’re made-up people, 
or personas, created by marketing or usability firms in order to go through 
your Web site to see if your site is properly targeting its demographics. A 
persona can give you an idea whether your Web site is going to work for 
your target demographic. A firm often designs 7–10 different personas who 
are then used as a preliminary test market for your Web site. These are 
people from different age groups, socioeconomic backgrounds, and ethnici-
ties, and they go through your site and allow you to gather data on whether 
your pages are working the way you want them to or if you’re turning off the 
very people you want to entice. If your audience is the go-getter type like Jill, 
a long meandering trip to the conversion point is going to lose her early on. 
But rushing someone like Doug could make him uncomfortable and cause 
him to bail out, leaving a shopping cart full of goodies behind.
If your site sells shoes, a persona can help you more effectively target your 
market because you can keep track of whether Jill is going through your site 
and actually making a purchase as opposed to hitting your site and leaving 
immediately afterwards. We offer a lot more information about personas and 
creating them in Book V, Chapter 1.
A/B testing
One of the most commonly used tools for testing your Web site usability is 
A/B testing. It’s like doing a science experiment. You test your old version of 
your Web site (A) with the new version (B) to see which one measures up 
better. A/B testing and multivariate testing are somewhat complex. This sec-
tion and the next describe them so that you understand what they mean and 
how they can help. Afterwards, we describe options to implement testing.
The big advantage of A/B testing is that you can send half of your traffic to the 
page(s) with the proposed changes while sending the other half to the current 
page. That way, you can compare your current conversion rate for at least 
part of your site traffic in case some of the proposed changes aren’t working.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Tracking Behavior 
with Web Analytics
559
Measuring Web Site Usability
But you can’t run off and do a hack and slash job on the test page and expect 
to get any sort of meaningful data out of it. Here are some guidelines to help 
you get meaningful, measurable results, if you plan to run A/B tests on a Web 
site change or an e-mail campaign:
 
✦ Change only one variable at a time. It’s harder to figure out what exactly 
is working for you if you’ve changed several variables on the site.
 
✦ Learn the precise process for diverting traffic. One of the problems in 
A/B testing is that some marketers don’t understand how to divert traf-
fic and don’t get accurate traffic numbers.
 
✦ Establish accurate measures of volume. It’s hard to do a comparison 
test if you don’t know how many people you’re testing.
 
✦ Look for significant differences. If you see a difference in the conver-
sion rate for the B test, you need to ensure this difference is significant. 
A miniscule change to your goal is probably not going to be worth the 
effort, whereas a significant change is.
 
✦ Take the time to do a null test. A null test is a test you run on two A 
pages (pages you haven’t made any changes to) in order to establish a 
baseline and make sure the traffic isn’t coming in weird. This is to make 
sure that your have half your traffic going to one page and the other half 
is going to the other page, and that you have enough people going into 
the test.
 
✦ Run your test long enough to ensure results are real. You’re not going 
to get an accurate amount of data if you run the test only for a day, or 
a week. Make sure you run it long enough to get enough data to do an 
accurate comparison, typically a month, or more. Remember, with Web 
analytics, the more time you take to do something right, the better your 
results are.
 
✦ Run segmentation tests. A segmentation test is testing the variables in 
your incoming traffic, like testing the demographics of your incoming 
traffic by asking them to answer a couple of questions. Really, you can 
test any variable as long as you set it up right. The more information 
you have on your different variables, the better you can target specific 
changes to your site to drive up your conversions.
We cover much more on the ins and outs of A/B testing in the next chapter.
Multivariate testing
A/B testing is about measuring big changes to your site. It’s comparing the 
old site with the completely new version. Multivariate testing is about testing 
all of those smaller changes to your site, like the change of a certain font, or 
a button instead of an arrow. Typically, you test many small changes to the 
same page at once instead of two totally separate pages like in A/B testing.

560
Measuring Web Site Usability
Most of the testing tools involve copying and pasting a piece of JavaScript 
into the code of the pages that you are testing. The control code on the top 
of the HTML page tells you that someone is trying to load the page. The 
tracking script at the bottom of the code tells you that the visitor saw the 
page, and then you have another code on the conversion page (whatever 
page the user views after they have completed a conversion) that tells you 
they converted and what version of the page they were looking at. If you do 
a test, each version of the landing page has a unique sticker for you to iden-
tify it by. If you’re doing the test with Google Analytics, after the test runs for 
a while, Google populates reports for you. Other programs work similarly.
Here are some quick guidelines to keep in mind when running your test:
 
✦ Test a small number of variations. The rule of thumb is less than 100 
variables per combination of tested pages.
 
✦ Test big changes. If you can’t see any difference between two variations 
in eight seconds, your visitors probably won’t either and their reactions 
won’t tell you anything. They can’t react to what they don’t notice.
 
✦ If conversions are relatively rare in your business, consider testing for 
early indicators. If you’re selling a $100,000 software package, for exam-
ple, you won’t have a high number of sales to test. Instead, optimize for 
conversion indicators such as request info, view product details, and so on.
 
✦ Don’t jump to conclusions. A two-week test is not enough time to gather 
your data. Run each test for at least one month, if not two.
Cookies
When we talk about cookies, we don’t mean a tasty sugary snack. Cookies 
are little files that get saved in your browser to keep track of information on 
a particular site. A cookie is what enables you to automatically log onto your 
Facebook account regardless of whether you’ve closed your browser ses-
sion or even logged off and powered down your computer.
Once upon a time, a server would send out Web pages when they were 
requested, but didn’t record any data on who requested the page, where it 
went, or any other associated user behavior. Cookies were created to save this 
information. Cookies are used to enhance the browser experience, improve 
usability for customer interactions, increase purchase behavior, and improve 
commercial Web site performance by keeping track of what the user is doing.
Cookies are either first-party or third-party, depending on the type of Web 
site that sets them. A first-party cookie is set by the site that the user is visit-
ing, such as www.classicarcustomization.com. A third-party cookie is 
set by a third-party site providing a service to the main Web site, like a Web 
analytics vendor.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Tracking Behavior 
with Web Analytics
561
Measuring Web Site Usability
 
A first-party cookie can contain personal information such as user name and 
a login ID so that the user can be recognized when they visit a site. If cookies 
did not store this data, Web sites would have to request it every time the 
user returns to the site.
A third-party cookie tracks a visitor’s path through www.classiccar
customization.com so it can identify which pages work and which don’t, 
helping optimize for better site performance. The ad network cookies track 
user behavior across multiple sites, helping them classify user behavior. 
This helps in the targeting of ads to user segments. For instance, frequent 
visitors of sports sites are given sports-relevant ads. Although anonymous, 
this multi-site gathering of visitor information has also caused some contro-
versy regarding privacy violations.
Deleting third-party cookies
Your browser gives you options for deleting cookies. This, and the advent 
of anti-spyware software, has resulted in the deletion of third-party cookies. 
Cookie rejection is also being enabled by new software mechanisms that 
block cookies from ever being set on users’ computers.
This is a slight problem in that mass cookie deletion and rejection can make 
it appear that a Web site’s new visitors are increasing while returning visi-
tors are decreasing, which is a change in visitor behavior that is pretty 
unlikely.
Solving the cookie dilemma
To fix this skew, client-side Web analytics vendors have enabled their cook-
ies to be set by their client’s Web site, making them first-party cookies, which 
are less frequently deleted. Although this does not prevent all cookie-caused 
inaccuracies (users can still delete all cookies or use different computers), 
this can help.
 
An alternate solution suggested by Jupiter Research is to use Adobe Flash 
Local Shared Objects (LSOs) as a cookie replacement or backup. Similar to a 
cookie, an LSO is a text file that can be read only by the Web site creating it. 
There’s an extra benefit to using LSOs: Browsers and anti-spyware programs 
can’t delete them, and most users don’t know how. Although this works for 
now, it won’t be long before users figure out how to eliminate these as well.
The solution to the cookie dilemma may be to better describe the cookies 
because some users see cookies as adding to the browser experience whereas 
others see them as an invasion of their privacy. It’s easy to get confused 
between first-party and third-party cookies — which is helpful and which is of 
questionable value? In the end, every user has to decide for herself whether to 
delete cookies based on the pros and cons.

562
Tracking Conversions
Session IDs
Instead of using a cookie, you might be tempted to use a session ID. A 
session ID is a way of tracking a user when they come to your Web site. 
Generally, we recommend that you don’t use session IDs because they are 
assigned no matter who the visitor is, including a search engine robot. This 
means that every time a session ID is used, the search engines see a new 
page, and duplicate content mucks with your rankings in the search engine. 
Additionally, a session ID is not very useful when it comes to measuring your 
Web site usability because a session ID only tracks that user for the duration 
of their visit to the site. A cookie remembers that user when they return, 
whereas a session ID doesn’t.
 
Overall, it’s much better to use cookies to track your visitors, if they have 
cookies enabled in their browser.
Tracking Conversions
Your Web site’s objective is to make you money, not just sit out in cyber-
space and look pretty. Each activity on your site should be subtly directing 
the visitor toward a conversion. A conversion is a term used by marketers to 
describe the final outcome of a site visit. As long as that visitor does what 
you want them to do, they’ve completed a conversion.
Before any further analysis can be done, you need to identify which pro-
cesses on your Web site you want to measure, and how your Web analytics 
solution will help in the measurement.
As a rule of thumb, keep these three things in mind when deciding which 
processes to measure:
 
✦ Contact: Make sure visitors can contact you if they have difficulty with 
the process.
 
✦ Collect: Make sure you can collect the appropriate data when visitors 
complete the process so that you can retain the visitors in the future.
 
✦ Competitors: If visitors have difficulty on your site, find out whether 
they are able to complete a similar process on a competitor site.
 
Before going into the details of conversion metrics, it is important to note 
that you are dealing with two types of conversions, your Web site conver-
sions, conversions gained from your Web site, and your marketing campaign 
conversions, which is a conversion of any kind in the brick and mortar world. 
Because this is a book dealing with the online aspect, we concentrate on the 
Web site conversions.

Tracking Conversions
So what should you be tracking on your site? We’ve put together a list of 
things you should be looking for. Feel free to add to this list as needed; this 
is just a jumping-off point for you to get started.
Measuring marketing campaign effectiveness
The first thing you should look at are your marketing campaigns. It’s impor-
tant to measure the effect of marketing campaigns on your Web site traffic. 
The following metrics are specific to marketing campaigns aimed at driving 
traffic to your site.
 
✦ Campaign conversion rate: The effect of conversions from specific cam-
paigns. Did the conversions rise due to the ads you placed on other Web 
sites? Or a grassroots viral marketing campaign, like “These Come from 
Trees”? (“These Come from Trees” was an effort by an environmental 
group asking its users to place “These Come from Trees” stickers in 
public restroom stalls in order to curb over-usage of paper products — 
towels, toilet paper, and so on. These stickers had the URL of the orga-
nization’s Web site printed on them, where they provided more informa-
tion and stickers.)
 
✦ Cost-per-conversion: Cost effectiveness for specific campaigns. You 
have a great idea for a marketing campaign, but giving away twenty 
dollar bills stamped with your Web address might cost more than the 
actual conversion you’re aiming for. Make sure you can afford the cam-
paign before you start it.
 
✦ Campaign ROI (return on investment): Cost effectiveness for specific 
campaigns. Is your campaign bringing in the conversions you need, or 
are you losing money?
 
✦ Segment conversion rates: Track conversion progress over time. Your 
conversions most likely won’t change overnight. Watch them over a long 
period of time to make sure that your campaign is effectively working.
 
✦ Percent of orders from new and repeat customers: Determines the 
effectiveness of marketing or customer retention programs. You want to 
attract new customers, yes, but you also want them to turn into repeat 
customers.
 
✦ New and repeat customer conversion rates: Helps understand barriers 
to online purchases. One repeat customer is worth more than a new cus-
tomer because not only do they mean future conversions, but they also 
cost less than new customers because you don’t have to spend a whole 
lot to keep them.
 
✦ Sales per visitor: Measures marketing efficiency. How much is someone 
likely to buy? How little? Get an average so you can figure out how to 
budget your campaign more effectively.

564
Tracking Conversions
Here are some key metrics you should track regardless of whether your site 
is e-commerce, research, or any other kind of Web site:
 
✦ The conversion rates for any process that makes or saves money or is 
critical to the customer experience.
 
✦ The campaign conversion rate for current campaigns or the most expen-
sive campaigns, if you have a lot of them.
 
✦ The cost-per-conversion for the campaigns you selected to monitor.
 
✦ The segment conversion rates for key or critical group conversions.
Here are some specific metrics that e-commerce sites should be tracking:
 
✦ The site-wide conversion rate (all purchases to all visits or visitors)
 
✦ New and repeat site-wide customer conversion rates
 
✦ The percent of orders from new and returning customers
 
✦ The average order value, site-wide and for new and returning customers
 
✦ Sales per visitor (compare to site-wide conversion rate)
After you have decided which site-wide processes to measure and how to 
measure them, the following metrics can help you understand visitor suc-
cess or failure. These are metrics that follow whether a customer stays, 
searches, and actually makes a conversion:
 
✦ Home to purchase: The abandonment rate for visitors going through the 
sales path.
 
✦ Search to purchase: The abandonment rate for visitors coming from a 
site search.
 
✦ Special offer to purchase: This is the effect of various merchandising 
and pricing options.
 
✦ Lead generation: The abandonment rate when personal data is 
requested.
Establishing site objectives or goals and all of the parts that make up these 
objectives (the who, how, where, what, and why) are essential when tracking 
the conversions on your site. One of these factors could contribute to the 
success of your campaign and just as easily derail it.
Building conversion funnels
After your site objectives are established, you can measure your progress 
through the use of a conversion funnel. In the previous chapter, we defined 
the four basic Web sites: e-commerce, content, lead-generation, and self-
service. On an e-commerce site, a conversion is obviously a sale. For a

content site, it might be the number of newsletter subscriptions. Lead genera-
tion sites try to gather information for later contact. Self-service sites are tar-
geted at solving a customer’s problems, so the measure might be time spent 
on the site.
In the conversion funnel in Figure 2-1, each step in the sales process on the 
way to conversion is fraught with visitor drop-off. (Steps in the funnel differ 
based on the type of business and conversion that you’re seeking.)

Each block on the conversion funnel becomes smaller as we go down the 
sales (or conversion) path. This represents the amount of users you lose 
along the way to a conversion, for whatever reason.
The point of using a conversion funnel is to figure out where you are getting 
the most drop-off. In a perfect world, there would be no conversion funnels 
because all visitors to your site would perform your desired action and you 
would have a conversion column. But because this isn’t a perfect world, 
your main goal is for the drop-off rate to be as low as possible.
It’s a challenge to measure your Web site’s conversion rate because there 
are a number of steps leading to that final action, and sometimes visitors 
are thwarted in their quest to complete an intended action. You can hope 
that you lost them just because their browser crashed, but sometimes they 
simply didn’t find what they were looking for, or the site was too confus-
ing, or it took too long for them to get to their objective, and so they left. 
Additionally, many sites measure only their final conversion rate. This does 

566
Tracking Conversions
not give Webmasters the opportunity to improve their drop-off rates by ana-
lyzing the sales path and finding the bottlenecks in order to make the site 
improvements that result in higher conversions.
 
Don’t measure your end result conversion rate without tracking the path 
that your customers take to conversion.
Preventing conversion funnel drop-off
In a typical conversion funnel, visitors drop off along the way to the final step 
that completes the sale or achieves the desired action. The good news is that 
when your analytics program (like Omniture or Google analytics, see Chapter 
1 of this minibook for more info) tracks the micro steps required to reach the 
final conversion act, it reveals data that can be used to prevent drop-off. The 
analytics package you have does the work and the analysis so that you don’t 
have to. Just be sure to implement the changes it recommends.
One of the things you can do is to eliminate all the unnecessary steps to visi-
tor conversion to reduce the conversion funnel drop-off. The fewer steps 
needed for a visitor to convert, the greater the likelihood of a conversion. 
You should create an effective call-to-action for every step in the sales path. 
Your conversion rate reflects your ability to persuade visitors to complete 
their intended actions.
Analyzing your conversion funnel
Your conversion funnel is the path a user follows on your site on the way to 
a purchase. It’s important to follow the conversion funnel closely and ana-
lyze where you’re losing the most people by percentage. It’s very unlikely 
that 100 percent of your visitors will continue on step by step, but you do 
want a high percentage of visitors to continue on.
Say you have an e-commerce site that gets 2,000 visitors per month, your 
site has a three-step sales path, and your average sale is $11 per item. If half 
of your site visitors enter the sales path, that means 1,000 prospects drop off 
at the first step. A 50 percent drop-off rate at the first step could be due to 
an impediment such as requiring site registration. If 40 percent of that total 
drops off at the second step, and 30 percent of that group completes the 
sale, you have $1,980 in sales at a 9 percent conversion rate because only 
180 of the original 2,000 prospects made a purchase.
When people drop off, they have not found what they were looking for on 
your site. By identifying high abandonment pages, you can take a closer 
look to see what might be making visitors leave and test for ways that would 
make them want to stick around and continue on the conversion funnel. 
By properly analyzing this data, you can make sure you won’t lose as many 
people along the conversion funnel. More people convert, which means 
more money for you.

Making site improvements
Using the math from the previous example, if you can improve the final step 
of the sales path by just 10 percent, it would bring you an additional $198 in 
sales, upping your conversion rate to 9.9 percent. However, if you can make 
improvements at the first step of the sales path, reducing your 50 percent 
drop-off rate to 25 percent, you can increase your sales by $5,940, resulting 
in a 36 percent conversion rate.
However, if you do not know what to measure and why, or haven’t a clue of 
what indicators to evaluate in your analytics reports, you can’t take the nec-
essary actions to improve your site performance. So take the time to figure 
out the data to analyze based on your site objectives and then follow up on 
the data revealed through the use of your analytics software.
Simply picking out indicators that look good at first glance, like the increas-
ing number of referrals from Google and Yahoo!, or the number of increased 
page views, might not help you improve site performance. It’s not that 
these numbers are worthless, but they just might not be the right metrics to 
improve your site. Knowing the basic analytic principles ensures that you 
know what metrics to check for when making your business decisions.
So far in this chapter, we’ve talked about overall site objectives, but you also 
need to consider objectives for the individual pages within your site. That’s 
what we discuss in the next section.
Assigning Web page objectives
Assign individual objectives to each page, especially the ones that require 
the user to perform an action. Every page should be designed to have a user 
perform an action, even if that action is something as simple as clicking over 
to the next page.
In order to effectively implement this, every page on your Web site that 
requires action should answer the following three questions:
 
✦ What action is required? These are things such as clicking to the next 
page, playing a video, or reading the text on the Web site.
 
✦ Who must take that action?
 
✦ What information does your visitor need to take the required action?
By answering these questions, you can define your objectives and apply 
good analytics solutions to test and optimize your pages for improved 
results. The same principles you used for site optimization can also work for 
page optimization.

Tracking the Success of Your SEO Project
Tracking the Success of Your SEO Project
Besides watching your conversions, you still need to keep an eye on the big 
picture: Is the time, effort, and money you are putting into your SEO project 
actually bringing you a return? You need to know whether the keywords you 
are using are actually working out for you. Are they affecting your rankings 
in the search engines? Have your rankings gone up, stayed the same, or actu-
ally gotten worse? And in particular, has your traffic increased as a result of 
search engine traffic?
Determining success relies on tracking your keywords more effectively. 
Keywords are the search terms that users put into the search engines, (we 
go over them in depth in Book II). When you are tracking keywords in order 
to see if they’re working out for you, remember that it’s not just the broad 
phrases you should be looking at, but also the smaller, more specific key-
words and keyword phrases. Keyword phrases are groups of three or more 
keywords that users put into a query window, such as [classic car customi-
zation Poughkeepsie].
Using analytics, you can keep track of which keywords are working for you 
to gain more conversions and which ones are just not working out at all. You 
can keep track of how much you are spending on these particular keywords 
(through ad campaigns and whatnot, see Book II for more details) and if the 
ROI is really worth it.
 
Remember, if the keyword is not working out for you, don’t be afraid to get 
rid of it and find a keyword that does.
SEO is much more nebulous when it comes to identifying and tracking the 
metrics. A good keyword might bring you more traffic, but if those users 
aren’t giving you conversions, they’re just using up server space and costing 
you time and money. That’s why it’s essential that you have relevant key-
words and that you provide your users with the information or products you 
are advertising. For instance, if your keywords are [Classic car customiza-
tion], your site should provide information on classic car customization.
 
There’s also such a thing as too much information. The longer a person 
stays around your site, and the more they explore it, the more likely they are 
to provide you a conversion. So do provide them information, but don’t do 
it all on one page. Spread it around your site, and make sure your users can 
have access to it.
Also keep in mind that SEO takes a while to fully work, so give it a decent 
amount of time before you really start to worry if you don’t see a whole lot 
of change. It takes time for the changes to really take place, so be prepared 
to be patient, but it is truly worth it to put the time and the effort in.

Analyzing Rankings
Analyzing Rankings
Getting high rankings in a search engine is one thing. Say that you’ve 
achieved a coveted second or even first place spot on the first page of 
Google results for the keywords you wanted. However, getting to the top of 
the search engine results page means nothing if it doesn’t help your con-
version rate or your ROI. You’re not doing SEO to get high rankings; you’re 
doing SEO to get more conversions.
A high ranking in the search engine results page only increases your traffic, 
and that’s great if the conversions you are looking for happen to be a high 
volume of traffic. But if your traffic volume doesn’t provide you the conver-
sions you need, and your bounce rate is pretty high, you need to figure out 
what’s wrong with your site.
Analytics packages (such as those we talked about in the previous chapter) 
allow you to put these metrics next to one another, which you can then pair 
that data with a ranking monitor so that you can see the amount of your con-
versions next to how you are ranking.
 
You also need to be tracking the path your visitor took on the way to your 
site, so make sure that all of your visitors have a cookie. That way, you can 
know which users arrived from the search engines and which ones came 
from outside links, or from their own bookmarks. And if you know that, 
you can properly read the data coming in from the search engines. Also, be 
aware of seasonal trends in the search engines. Remember, some traffic is 
seasonal, especially around the holidays, so take that into consideration 
when you’re watching your search engine rankings.

Tools and Reports
In This Chapter
✓ Getting started with A/B testing
✓ Getting to know page and site analysis tools
✓ Using link analysis tools
I
n this chapter, we cover the nuts and bolts of A/B testing. We walk you 
through it step by step and hopefully demystify the process a little bit. 
We show you how to fix common conversion and usability problems, and 
introduce you to some page and site analysis tools. Finally, we discuss how 
to use link analysis tools.
Getting Started with A/B Testing
Say that you’ve gathered your data and done the proper analysis, and now 
you’ve decided that some things need to be changed on your Web site. 
Making major overhauls to your site requires A/B testing. A/B testing is test-
ing the original version of the Web site (A) against the one you made the 
major changes to (B). The A/B test is a tool that tells you which changes 
have a better effect and to what degree.
We’ve discussed A/B testing in the previous chapters, but now we’re going 
to go a little more in-depth and tell you how to actually do an A/B test. 
Before we get started, here are some cardinal rules you need to keep in 
mind for running an A/B test:
 
✦ Change only one variable at a time, especially when A/B testing 
involves major changes to your site. If you change more than one vari-
able at a time, you can’t determine which variable is responsible for the 
change and to what degree. Systematic testing helps you isolate impor-
tant variables.
 
✦ Divert enough traffic to your test page for a valid sample. The object 
of traffic diversion is to redirect a percentage of visitors through the 
page you made all those changes to. Ideally, the percentage of traffic to 
be redirected can be easily changed without having to completely over-
haul those pages.

572
Getting Started with A/B Testing
 
✦ Get a “visitors per page” count from your Web analytics tool. This 
ensures that you actually get the percentage of traffic you’re expect-
ing moving through your site based on the number of changes tested. 
For instance, if you expect to run half through A and half through B, 
you should see nearly equal numbers of visitors to the first page in the 
process. If you are running a three-way test (testing A/B/C pages), you 
should aim for a distribution of 33/33/34 percent of visitors running 
through each path.
 
✦ Look for significant differences. If you see a difference in the conversion 
rate for the B test, you need to ensure this difference is significant (like 
more than .5 percent) so you can be certain it comes from the change 
you made to the B page. Smaller differences can be due to variations in 
your visitors or any other number of environmental factors. Keep run-
ning your test until all of the changes can be attributed to the exact step 
that was tweaked, or until you are certain there was no change.
 
✦ Take the time to do a null test. A null test is putting 50/50 traffic through 
two identical pages to be A/B tested. It’s basically doing a control test 
for your science experiment. In this case, you replicate page A, calling 
this copy page B. Then without making any changes to page B, you test 
your analytics and conversions, which should be equal. A null test veri-
fies that you get the same conversion and abandonment rates and that 
your measurement tools are set up correctly. If you are not getting close 
to the same rates for both pages (about .5 percent), something is wrong, 
and your data from the A/B test will be skewed. If this happens, check 
that you are sending visitors into the tests exactly the same way, and 
that you are running enough visitors through the test. Depending on 
your traffic volume, you need to attain a reasonable sample, and this can 
take time. You must run a null test to make sure the data you get back 
from the actual A/B test is accurate.
 
✦ Run your test long enough to ensure results are real. It takes time 
to gather good, solid data from an A/B test. For example, you may see 
trends in the first few hours that reverse themselves later. You need a 
representative sample before you can assume that B is better than A or 
that A is still better than B.
 
✦ Run segmentation tests. Segmenting (dividing into like groups) the sub-
jects you are testing allows you to monitor their activities when they 
return to your site. This lets you target a group of visitors if it turns out 
that a good percentage of your B test visitors (presuming that A/B test 
results favored B over A) returned to the Web site within two months to 
make another purchase, especially if these were people who provided 
you with conversions.
 
The upside of A/B testing is that if your proposed changes don’t work, not 
all of your visitors are subjected to the bad changes, only those whom you 
put through the B test. This is better than just making the change without 
testing and crossing your fingers. The downside is that A/B testing is a long, 
complicated process that takes knowledge, precision, and time.

Getting Started with A/B Testing
Because conversions are critical to your business’s success, start up a 
program of A/B split testing before making final site changes. Test two dif-
ferent versions of your page when you’re testing things like changes on a 
call-to-action landing page, one at a time. Table 3-1 shows the hypothetical 
results of such a test.

Getting ready to run an A/B test
You can use any of several different tools to run an A/B test. Both Google 
Analytics and Omniture feature options for running A/B tests and multivari-
ate tests (which are like an A/B test except that they test smaller details, like 
a different font color, instead of large changes, and you can test all variables 
at once with different permutations). In this section, we outline the broad 
steps you have to take before you run the test.
The first thing you need to do before running your test is to choose your test 
page. Not every single page needs to have an A/B test run on it: You prob-
ably don’t care about conversions from your About Us page, for example. To 
be a good candidate for testing, the page needs to offer an action the user 
can take, like a purchase, download, or signing up for something. The action 
can be as simple as a link that you’re wanting your users to click on — the 
point is that it has to be a measureable response.
For your first test, choose a landing page (the page that visitors first land on 
when they arrive at your Web site) that receives high volumes of traffic, like 
the top of a category or a PPC (pay per click) landing page. This lets you see 
meaningful results quickly.
The second step is choosing your conversion page. A conversion page is the 
page on which the action occurs that you want the user to take once they 
reach your Web site, be it the aforementioned purchase, download, or sign-
up. If you have more than one conversion page, choose the one with the 
most traffic. You should use this page as the link from your test page.
 
For your first experiment, it’s not important what the link does. When you’re 
doing further, more in-depth testing, choose the conversion you wish to 
track in order to measure the success of your test page. Remember, these 
tests are to figure out whether they’re successful from a user standpoint.

574
Getting Started with A/B Testing
The third step is to figure out which kind of test you want to run. The 
Website Optimizer, a free tool from Google that we cover later in the section, 
“Doing an A/B test with Website Optimizer,” allows you to run an A/B or mul-
tivariate test. Depending on what kind of changes to your site you want to 
make, you can choose to either run the A/B test (for the big changes) or the 
multivariate test (for the small ones).
A/B tests compare the performance of two entirely different pages, which 
means trying out entirely different layouts, moving around sections of the 
page, or changing the overall look and feel of a page. A/B tests are simpler to 
run, and you can obtain results must faster.
Multivariate tests allow you to test content variations in different sections 
of your page simultaneously. So instead of tracking one or two big changes, 
you can test two different headlines, three different images, and two differ-
ent product descriptions. Obtaining results from these kinds of tests take 
longer, but they’re more flexible than A/B tests.
The fourth step is choosing the content you want to test, if you’re running 
a multivariate test. For a multivariate test, for example, you might test the 
headline and an image to go with it, not a totally new page structure.
For an A/B test, you wouldn’t need to choose the content you’re testing 
because you’re comparing two completely separate pages, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. (They don’t necessarily have to be two separate pages — you 
can run an A/B test on just about anything, like which offer brings in more 
conversions: free phones or free kittens.)
The fifth step is creating the actual content variations you want to test. For a 
multivariate test, for example, you could try a heading in a new font and test 
out some new wording, and perhaps a different image as well (see Figure 3-2). 
Smaller changes like this should be tested with a multivariate test, not an A/B 
test, because you get better results.
For the A/B test, you need your test page A (your control page) and your test 
page B (the page with significant changes).
During the experiment, your visitors either see your control page (A) or your 
test page (B). This way, you can test whether the variations in the content 
or page lead to more conversions. Do people react differently with differ-
ent images or text? Or does re-arranging your site differently lead to easier 
access for your users and more conversions for you?
 
The variations need to be significantly different than the original content. 
You’re not going to see much change if your headline changes from “Welcome!” 
to “Come on in!,” for example. Someone brand new to your page should be 
able to tell at a glance what’s different about the page. Subtlety has no place 
in an A/B test.

The last step is deciding how much traffic you want for your test. You are 
running this test on your actual Web site, so you might not want to lose a 
whole lot of your site traffic. You can actually choose to limit how many of 
your visitors see the new version of your page. But keep in mind that if you 
limit the amount of traffic to the test page, you’re going to have to wait a lot

longer to get any sort of meaningful results from this test. You need to run 
your test for at least a month to get any kind of decent results, and it may 
take even longer than that. Don’t quit too soon and make a judgment based 
on early numbers.
Doing an A/B test with Website Optimizer
Website Optimizer is a free tool provided by Google (available at www.
google.com/analytics/siteopt/splash?hl=en) that runs A/B and 
multivariate tests. After you sign in and agree to the user terms, you’re all 
set and ready to go. We walk you through using this tool because it’s quick, 
accurate, and free.
In order to start the A/B testing process, you need to do the following things:
 
1. If you’re using Website Optimizer within Google AdWords, sign in to 
your AdWords account and visit the Campaign Management tab, and 
then choose the Website Optimizer tab.
 
 If you’re using Website Optimizer through the standalone site, just sign 
in there (see Figure 3-3). Click Get Started, and you’re on your way.
 
 After accepting the Google Analytics Terms of Service (if you haven’t 
already), you reach the Experiment List page, which displays a summary 
of all your experiments.
 
Figure 3-3:

2. If this is your first experiment, your list is empty, like in Figure 3-4. 
Click Create Experiment, and you’re on your way.
 
3. The next screen (Figure 3-5) asks you to choose between an A/B exper-
iment and a multivariate experiment. For this example, we’re doing 
an A/B test, so click the A/B experiment link.
 
4. On the next screen, review the checklist they provide, which is similar 
to the previous section in this chapter:
 
1. Choose the page you would like to test.
 
2. Create alternate versions of your test page.
 
3. Identify your conversion page.
Check the box labeled I’ve Completed the Steps Above and I’m Ready to 
Start Setting Up My Experiment, and then click the Create button. You’re off 
to step 1 of the testing process!

Step 1: Name your experiment and identify pages
In order to begin, you need to supply the Website Optimizer with some infor-
mation, as shown in Figure 3-6:
 
1. Enter a name in the Name Your Experiment box.
 
 You can call it pretty much anything, from “Experiment 1” to 
“Experiment 92: Electric Boogaloo.” The only thing you need to be able 
to do is distinguish one experiment from the other.
 
2. Enter the URL of the test page that you picked out in the Identify the 
Pages You Want to Test box.
 
 The URL you enter should not contain any information after the page’s 
file name (such as index.htm or productpage.html). If you include query 
parameters, they are ignored. Enter any other URLs you have for each 
alternate page you have created. Remember, each alternate page you 
create has to be saved at a unique URL in order to be used in an A/B test.

580
Getting Started with A/B Testing
 
3. Enter the URL of the conversion page in the Identify Your Conversion 
Page box.
 
 Like the test page, it should not have any extra information after the 
page’s filename.
 
 After you have entered this information, Website Optimizer validates the 
URLs. If you leave either the test page or conversion page field blank, or 
if Website Optimizer got an error trying to access either page, it gener-
ates an error message.
 
 Your pages must all be on the same domain.
 
 After you have validated the URLs, you go back to the experiment work 
flow page. You can save your pages at any point in the process by clicking 
on the Save Progress and Finish Later link, as is shown in Figure 3-7. You 
will be taken back to the main page to see where you are in the process.

Step 2: Install and validate JavaScript tags
The next step is installing the JavaScript HTML tags into your site’s code. 
You have an option of doing it yourself, or letting someone else with a work-
ing knowledge of HTML do it for you. Website Optimizer provides the spe-
cific script to be installed, as well as detailed instructions available in their 
installation guide. This script also sets a cookie (a piece of text that allows a 
browser to remember a previous session) in your visitor’s browsers, so you 
should ensure that your site’s privacy policy covers the setting of cookies.
After you or your Web team has installed all the tags, you need to validate 
them. Website Optimizer provides a validation tool that examines your 
pages and verifies that the tags have been installed properly. If the valida-
tion tool detects any problems with the installation, you need to fix them 
before continuing. Website Optimizer won’t let you go on to the next step 
without validating.

582
Getting Started with A/B Testing
Website Optimizer has two methods of validating your pages:
 
✦ The first method requires you to provide the URLs for your test and 
conversion pages. If your pages are externally visible, Website Optimizer 
accesses them and notes any errors, as described previously.
 
✦ The second method is used if Website Optimizer can’t access the pages 
on your live site. You would need to upload the HTML source files for 
your test and conversion pages. This is helpful if your pages are part of a 
purchase process, behind a login, or inaccessible for some other reason. 
All you need to do is save the HTML source of your pages and upload 
the files, and Web site Optimizer validates them.
After you’ve validated your pages for a second time, you are directed to pre-
view your pages.
Step 3: Preview and start experiment
After you’ve tagged your pages and created your variations, relax: The 
hard part’s over. All you need to do now is turn the experiment on. But be 
warned: After you start running the experiment, you can’t change any of the 
variables, so make sure everything is as you want it to be before you start.
 
If you do find a problem, all you need to do is click the Back button to return 
to the Experiment Work Flow page, and click the Preview link. But if you 
change the page URLs at this point, you have to go through and re-install the

Step 3 is also where you get one last chance to preview the alternate page 
variations that are displayed to visitors during the experiment. If anything

After you click Start, you are sent back to the Experiment Work Flow page.
You also see an additional section on the page describing the progress of 
this experiment, including estimated duration and the number of impres-
sions and conversions tracked during the experiment. Your test page starts 
showing different variations immediately, but a delay of about an hour takes 
place before your reports start displaying data. The progress and duration 
of the experiment depends on how much traffic goes through your test and 
conversion pages.
After you’ve got some significant data, the reports have preliminary results 
ready for you. Click View Report to see experiment results.

Getting Started with A/B Testing
Viewing your results
Be sure to check that impressions (number of times the pages displayed) 
and conversions are being recorded soon after starting your experiment. 
If you’re not getting any impressions or conversions, check the trouble-
shooting guide for some suggestions on what might be causing this error. 
Sometimes errors occur that don’t show up until the experiment is actually 
running.
Hold off on checking your reports right away. Until a minimum amount of 
data has been collected, you get a message along the lines of Hold on There, 
Cowboy, We Don’t Have a Complete Report Yet. (Well, okay, not literally, 
but you get the idea.) Check back in a day or two in order to see your results 
start coming in. With any A/B test, you want to wait long enough to gather 
enough data for it to be meaningful. When you have enough data, you can 
check your reports, which look something like Figure 3-8.

The table looks pretty complicated, but Website Optimizer has a guide on

answer.py?answer=55944. Here’s what they say, slightly paraphrased:
 
✦ Estimated conversion rate range provides the most immediate insight 
into overall performance. When the bar is green, a combination is per-
forming better than the original. Yellow bars mean the result is still up 
in the air; they don’t have enough data yet. Gray bars mean that a page 
is performing on the same level as the original. A red bar means that the 
combination isn’t doing as well as the original.
 
✦ The chance to beat original column, immediately to the right, displays 
the probability that a combination will be more successful than the 
original version. The higher, the better the test page will do.

✦ Improvement displays the percent improvement over the original com-
bination or variation. You can ignore this one until you have a lot of 
information. Low numbers will lead to unreliable data.
 
✦ Conversions/visits is the number of conversions and visits a particular 
combination generated.

With enough time and data, the Optimizer identifies the winning variation. 
It’s all a matter of how long you run the experiment and how similar the vari-
ations are. If you’ve run the experiment for a long time and still don’t have a 
clear winner, your variations might be too similar to get correct data, so you 
may need to make some tweaks and run another experiment.

Discovering Page and Site Analysis Tools
When you run a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign, you spend money whenever 
potential clients click on your advertisement. Because you’re spending 
money on that campaign, you want to know how much money or value 
you’re getting back for that campaign. That’s where PPC Conversion reports 
come in.
First, you need to know what you want your Web site visitors to do. This can 
be anything from purchasing products, to signing up for a newsletter, to just 
getting more traffic to your Web site. After you know what you are measur-
ing, you can view how well you’re doing in your Analytics software.
PPC Conversion reports tell you things like how many people are buying 
products. They can also be configured to tell you how much money you 
made from selling products to people who came from a PPC advertisement. 
For example, in Google Analytics, you can run an AdWords Campaigns 
report and find the information shown in Figure 3-9.
The report in the figure tells us how many Visits you had for a particular key-
word, the number of times the ad was displayed (Impressions), the number 
of clicks that you received (Clicks), and how much those clicks cost you 
(Cost). With all of that information, the report determined your ad’s click-
through rate (CTR), how much your cost per click (CPC) was, and how much 
you made from that advertisement based on the revenue per click (RPC).

With these types of reports, you can analyze your spending and your rev-
enue based on PPC ads. This information helps you decide which keywords, 
advertisements, and campaigns are working the best for you and which ones 
are not working so well. With this information, you can optimize your PPC 
campaigns by limiting your spending and maximizing your revenue based on 
the spending constraint.
Understanding Abandonment Rates
Abandonment rates can be broken up into two categories: how soon the 
visitor left your site, and what page they were on when they left your site. 
These both have different meanings, and it is important to understand what 
they mean.
When visitors leave your site, it’s natural to want to know why. When a visi-
tor leaves after visiting a lot of pages, or going through a process on your 
Web site, that is when you want to know which page they left from. If they 
leave the site on the first page of their visit, the visitor is probably not satis-
fied with your site at that time. Reasons for their exit could range from the 
site not answering a specific need of the user to a bad design that just makes 
the visitor want to leave. Another reason is that the visitor only came to 
your site for one thing, found it, and then left — this is often the case with a 
blog. The percentage of visitors who leave after only looking at one page is 
called the bounce rate.
An exit page is the last page the visitor was on before they left the site. Most 
users leave usually because they have not found what they were looking for 
or they find your site hard to use and think they can find a better alternative. 
It is important to note that in most cases, the exit page that has the most 
number of visitors leave is usually the page that contributes most to your 
bounce rate.

586
Measuring Traffic and Conversion from Organic Search
Both types of reports can be found in almost every analytics suite. Figure 3-10 
is an example of a bounce rate graph: It shows how often a visitor leaves after 
only viewing one page.

Figure 3-11 shows the top exit pages on your site (bottom half of the figure), 
so that you can see where people are most frequently abandoning your site. 
Locating these pages can help you strengthen the weak points in your con-
version process.

Measuring Traffic and Conversion 
from Organic Search
Measuring how much of your traffic and conversion is from organic (non-
paid) search is important because it tells you how much traffic and money 
you are getting for your SEO efforts. Every SEO campaign costs you time and 
money, so you want to know what you’re getting back for it. Most analytics 
software packages come with an out-of-the-box report for getting traffic from 
organic search. Figure 3-12 is from Google Analytics.

Click maps
Click maps are reports that overlay your pages and tell you, on a per-page 
basis, which links visitors are clicking on to go to other pages on your site. 
Often, the most clicked-on links are bigger, have a richer color, or a note tell-
ing you how many clicks the link received.
These reports are helpful because they give you some insight on what visi-
tors find interesting about your Web site. Using these reports, you can deter-
mine if a call-to-action is working, or if the visitors are reading and clicking 
on what you want them to on any specific landing page.
These reports are made by loading the current page, and then using an over-
lay with the link statistics on it. Each statistic is displayed where the link on 
the underlying page is. The example in Figure 3-13 is from Omniture. The pic-
ture receives the most amount of clicks, indicated by its darker color. Other 
links in this example also have click activity.
Pathing
Now that you know where visitors are coming from, whether the visitor 
converts, and which links they are clicking on, you can put it all together 
with pathing. Pathing tells you how a visitor navigated through your site to 
wind up at their final destination. This helps you determine if people are just 
searching through your site until they get something they are looking for, or 
if they are following a predetermined path that gets them to something you 
want them to get at.
The example in Figure 3-14 is from Omniture. In this graph, you can see the 
most popular paths taken on this site.

Using Link Analysis Tools
Web sites earn a variety of inbound links. Some of these you get naturally, 
and some of them you might pay for. Either way, it’s helpful to know if those 
links are sending worthwhile visitors to your site. You can measure that by 
finding your conversions from referring links.
First, you need to know some things about referring links. Referring links 
can span a lot of different types, including referrals from search engines, 
social media, and even your own site. Because of this, it may be a good idea 
to divide your referring links into different segments. You could divide your 
reports into links from Search Engines, Blogs, Paid Banner Ads, Internal

Chapter 3

Tools and Reports

Using Link Analysis Tools
Blog, and more. By doing this, you have an easier time determining which 
initiatives are giving you the most return, instead of looking at them one link 
at a time.
Second, you need to determine what a conversion on your site is. This could 
be anything that you want your visitors to do. After you know what that 
is, you can set up your analytics software to report measurements on that 
metric. For example, say you’re trying to find how many new visitors you’re 
getting from our new profile on the social networking site Twitter (www.
twitter.com). In this case, your conversion metric is a new visit and your 
referring link would be anything from www.twitter.com, including from 
subdomains such as m.twitter.com, which is the mobile version of the site.
Knowing these pieces of information, you can run a report that tells that you 
had 302 new visitors to your site in the last month from Twitter, as shown in 
Figure 3-15. You can also see that this represents only 1.27 percent% of your 
total visitors in the last month:
Now that you have this information, you can determine if your time manag-
ing and keeping up with your Twitter account is worth the additional expo-
sure that you’re getting. This is very useful to help decide whether a specific 
initiative is really paying off.

Chapter 1: Discovering 
International Search Engines
In This Chapter
✓ Dealing with international copyright issues
✓ Targeting international audiences
✓ Identifying opportunities
✓ Quantifying how many people search
T
hroughout this book, we talk mainly about what to do to optimize 
for search engines here in the U.S., but what about the international 
market? What about Europe, Latin America, and Asia? This minibook covers 
what you would need to know about working on an international level.
In this chapter, you discover all the basics you need to know to start think-
ing globally. International copyright laws are different from domestic copy-
right issues, so you should definitely do some research before you jump 
right in. After you familiarize yourself with the law, you figure out how to 
actually target your international audiences. Cultures and languages vary 
across the globe, and if you don’t properly adjust your market strategy for 
your international audiences, you risk failure.
You also need to be aware of the different opportunities there are in interna-
tional search, and how many people out there are using search engines. Not 
to worry: We’ve got an overview all ready for you, so just read on.
Understanding International Copyright Issues
When doing business in other countries, you have to be aware of laws other 
than those of the United States. Unfortunately, to make things difficult on 
all of us, there is no such thing as a standard international copyright law. 
National laws, to no one’s surprise, apply only to businesses operating within 
that country. Two countries can barely agree on pizza toppings, metaphori-
cally speaking, let alone a standard international law. Instead, we have to 
contend with various international conventions, unions, and treaties.

594
Understanding International Copyright Issues
 
Most nations in the world belong to some form of trade convention, treaty, 
or union. In case you’re feeling daring (or suffering from insomnia), you can 
look up a list of all the various countries and the copyright treaties/conven-
tions they belong to online at the U.S. government copyright site at www.
copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf.
The U.S. is a contracting party to the following treaties: the Berne Union, the 
Paris version of the Berne treaty, the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), the UCC, the Paris revision of the UCC, the WIPO Copyright Treaty, 
and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. These treaties all have 
different levels of copyright protection and jurisdiction rules.
A copyright infringement case with international aspects is brought where the 
infringement took place. (This is when someone steals your stuff and passes 
it off as theirs or violates your copyright in any way.) This gets quite tricky 
when you throw in the whole “it happened on the Internet” part of the deal.
Courts all over the world have labored over this particular question, possi-
bly in the same way that the general populace grapples with the chicken/egg 
conundrum. The kinds of questions these courts run into are something like 
this: Is the infringement location determined by the location of the server or 
the residence of the person committing the infringement? Does it depend 
on the residence of the copyright holder or the defendant? What about 
where the harm from the infringement occurred? It’s a little like the riddle 
involving the goose, the fox, and the bag of grain. When someone tells you 
that international copyright issues are complicated, they’re not lying.
But here are a couple of things that most courts all over the world agree on:
 
✦ The fact that you can view a Web site with infringing content, like a site 
that is illegally hosting a movie, in a particular country does not give 
that country jurisdiction unless you make a purchase, like buying a 
pirated DVD.
 
✦ The fact that the offending Web site is hosted on a server within a coun-
try does not give that country jurisdiction either.
It’s becoming increasingly common that two or more countries have jurisdic-
tion to hear the dispute. A good example is if the person with the offending 
Web site lives in Germany, and the copyright holder also lives in Germany, 
but the target market and the host server are both in Holland. The case can 
be brought to a court in either Germany or Holland because both countries 
have connections to the dispute.
What can also sometimes happen is that a court applies the laws of other 
countries. It’s not something that judges like doing, but they will if the situ-
ation calls for it. Usually, this occurs because the parties in a contract agree 
to a specific forum. For example, a company in Germany and a company in 

Book IX

Targeting International Users
Thailand have both agreed to do business in Thailand, and they draw up a 
contract stating that any disputes are subject to German law and will be filed 
in Germany. If the Thai company exceeds the scope of the licensing agree-
ment, the German company can file suit in Germany. If there was no contract 
in place, the German company might have to file the suit in Thailand and be 
subject to Thai law. If there is no contract in place, courts apply the law to 
the forum country, which is usually where the infringement takes place.
On an international level, the U.S. government became a member of the 
Berne Convention in 1989 and fully supports the Universal Copyright 
Convention. Under this convention, any work of an author who is a national 
of a convention country automatically receives protection in all countries 
that are also members, provided the work makes use of a proper copyright 
symbol (©). The degree of protection may vary, but some minimal protec-
tion is defined and guaranteed in that agreement. Jurisdiction for prosecut-
ing violations lies exclusively with the federal government.
Targeting International Users
Say that you’ve decided to take your business to the international markets. 
You know that there is a market for classic car customization, and it will gen-
erate a whole lot more revenue for you and your company.
However, you have to think about certain challenges when you’re gearing 
up to start working in the international markets. First of all, be aware of the 
different browsers other countries use. Not all of them use Internet Explorer 
or Mozilla Firefox, and when designing or tailoring your international Web 
site, you need to be aware of the constraints of whatever particular browser 
is popular in your target country or region. This is why good coding is so 
important. Remember to always test your Web pages in a validator like the 
one at the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web site, www.w3c.org (more on 
validating your code can be found in Book IV, Chapter 3).
Another thing you need to be aware of is any difference in currency. It 
affects shipping rates and the prices of the goods you are trying to sell. For 
example, at the time of this writing, one Euro is the equivalent of 1.2933 
United States dollars (USD), whereas one Japanese yen is the equivalent of 
.0100331 USD. But the exchange rates fluctuate continually. A good currency 
converter is available at XE (www.xe.com/ucc/).
 
The language barrier is a fairly tricky one to navigate as well. Some coun-
tries have multiple languages spoken by the populace. For example, in the 
Netherlands, there are two main languages spoken by the population, Dutch 
and Frisian, but most people speak English or German as well. Marketing in 
the correct language can be trickier than you’d think. Having local input is 
the best way to make sure you’re getting it right.

596
Targeting International Users
Be especially aware of cultural dimensions within that language. Spanish is 
spoken in many different countries, but there are different variations, and 
what can be a completely innocent word in one country can be a very nasty 
slang term in another. For example, in the U.S., when you want to determine 
what is causing a problem, you’d say you’re trying to get to the “root” of the 
problem. In Australia, “root” is slang for something very different and using 
it in a business meeting will probably get you accused of sexual harassment. 
It’s equally important to understand the impact of culture on the language. 
In Japanese culture, four is an unlucky number, so if your company has 
“four” in the title, or in advertisements, you might want to make a couple of 
tweaks if you’re going to expand into the Japanese business market. It’s the 
same as being aware of the number 13 and its impact in America.
Some other issues to think about with language include
 
✦ Local terms: This is especially important if you hope to do local busi-
ness within that country. Your classic car customization site for 
Southern Germany could use a listing of dealerships in Bavaria, for 
instance.
 
✦ Spelling and grammar differences: The Spanish spoken in Spain and 
the Spanish spoken in Central or South America all have some key dif-
ferences when it comes to spelling and grammar. For one thing, in Spain, 
Spanish makes use of verb conjugations for the plural second person, 
“vosotros,” whereas Spanish spoken in Mexico rarely uses it.
 
✦ Popular culture references: Be aware of dating yourself. Keep up on 
the pop culture trends in that country if you have a business that would 
be related (such as one that sells clothing). For example, if a site from 
Bulgaria talked about a popular sitcom character named Steve Urkel, 
when the sitcom the character is from hasn’t been on the air in the U.S. 
in many years, it would date the site.
 
✦ Translation issues: You risk a big hit to your credibility if you’re not 
careful translating your Web site content from its original language to 
a new one. For example, in Wales, a Web site that had been improperly 
translated for a school listed their staff as a “stave made out of wood” in 
Welsh. We suggest adding someone who is fluent in both languages (and 
preferably someone actually from that country) to your content building 
and marketing process.
 
✦ Vocal culture issues: This becomes an issue with languages that have 
different sounds than English. For example, in Japanese, there is no “t” 
sound, the closest approximation is “tsu,” so a word like “fruit” would 
sound like “fruits” when pronounced in Japanese.

Targeting International Users
 
✦ Visual design: Figure out a country’s particular design aesthetic. Study 
the visual culture of the target country. In both Japan and Korea, to look 
professional, you would want your Web site to have lots of bright colors 
and a busy page full of words and links. Google’s ultra-clean homepage
 doesn’t play well to that audience, but Yahoo!’s busy portal does. In 
England, however, a super busy and bright page is considered com-
pletely unprofessional. Similarly, color is an important consideration. 
In China, white is the color of death, much as black is here in the U.S. — 
probably not the best choice for your wedding site. Use red instead to 
represent joy.
 
When you are doing keyword research, make sure to do it in the target lan-
guage. Don’t just copy/paste into an online translator to find keywords to 
try. You run the risk of missing out on nuances, subtleties, and all of the cul-
tural references you could be using in keywords, and you may run afoul of 
many tricky conjugation rules.
In order to truly succeed in a different language, we recommend you get 
experts in each country on your team. Have a German classic car customiza-
tion Web site? Hire someone from Germany who’s an expert in classic cars. 
He can tell you about the different slang terms Germans use for cars, what 
kinds of cars are popular, and any of the cultural references you would miss 
if you relied on just yourself and a German dictionary.
When translating the Web site copy you already have, you should consider 
language issues and not try to translate your pages directly from one lan-
guage to another. To get the best final result for your foreign-language Web 
site, follow this process:
 
1. Break the original English down into main bullet points.
 
2. Have this translated by a professional into the second language.
 
3. Use that document to create your actual page copy for your target 
language.
 
 Hire a marketer who is native to the language and region so that you 
know she is getting the tone and slang right. Web marketer Ian McAerin 
refers to this process as the Symantec Expression Equivalency Document 
(SEED) process.
If all else fails, use the local rule of thumb. Use local terms, local keywords, 
and local structure in order to truly succeed in your foreign market. Words 
like glocal have started to be bandied about: Glocal is defined as localizing 
the global market.

598
Targeting International Users
 
The impact of languages and culture should not be underestimated. By 
understanding culture and languages, you can adapt better, succeed in your 
efforts to localize, and get more sales and respect. Showing an interest in 
communicating in the native language boosts interest in your company.
Domains and geolocating
Internationalization revolves around domain (where the site actually exists 
on the Web), language, culture, and geolocation issues. Geolocation is the 
identification of a Web page as belonging to or being relevant for a particular 
country. You also have to be aware of the country-code top level domain, 
which is the last part of an Internet domain name, as in the letters that 
follow the final dot of any domain name. A country-code top level domain 
(ccTLD) is a TLD that is specific to a particular country, such as .ca, .cn, 
.uk, .mx. Be aware that ccTLDs are in that country’s language, so the ccTLD 
for Germany is actually .de, for Deutschland.
Creation and delegation of ccTLDs is performed by the Internet Assigned 
Numbers Authority, or IANA (www.iana.org/). A full, comprehensive list 
of ccTLDs is available at IANA’s Web site at www.iana.org/domains/
root/db/.
The rules for obtaining a ccTLD are different for each country because 
each country can administer its own registered ccTLD as it chooses. A 
little bit of research is always required. For example, in order to obtain a 
.de (Deutschland) ccTLD, you need to not only have your site hosted on a 
German server, but you have to be doing business in the country physically 
as well. In Norway, a company can only own 20 domains. For more informa-
tion on how to obtain a ccTLD, go to www.iana.org/domains/root/
cctld/.
Some countries have licensed their TLDs for worldwide commercial use. 
Tuvalu and the Federated States of Micronesia, small island countries in the 
South Pacific, have partnered with VeriSign and FSM Telecommunications 
respectively to license domain names using the .tv and .fm TLDs to inter-
ested parties. More information on country-code TLDs can be found in Book 
VII, Chapter 2.
Search engines do not like to display duplicate content. If you have mul-
tiple domains connected to a single page, they’re only going to choose one 
domain to display. They choose which domain to display based on the link 
equity (however many links lead to your site and how much authority they 
pass) on the page, opting for the page with more links. If you want to be geo-
located for a particular country and your site is .com, have your site map 
point to the ccTLD, but make links within the site .com.

Site architecture tips
In order to have your site accessible in the international market, there are 
some very simple architecture guidelines you can follow:
 
✦ Have your site coded in UTF-8 (Unicode). This is a type of code that 
allows your site to be translated into languages from around the globe. 
It is backwardly compatible with ASCII and it encodes up to four-byte 
characters.
 
✦ Don’t translate your Meta tags and page titles (HTML coding for your 
site to define characteristics of your page) from English to the lan-
guage you’re working in. Work in the language itself and make all your 
tags individually. Plan to adjust for plurals, prepositions, special charac-
ters, and so on. Like your Web page content, these are too important to 
just leave for a straight translation.
 
✦ Adopt a global press release strategy. There are many online press 
release portals for different languages. Sending out articles announcing 
news on your company or your products generates links and helps build 
your global presence.
 
✦ Manage your 301s. 301 redirects send users from a URL that no longer 
exists to one that does automatically. This is the only type of redirect 
that is considered to be search engine friendly. The typical global site 
has hundreds of links going to Page Not Found errors. Domains around 
the globe are often incorrectly set up, and meta-refreshes (having 
the page automatically reload) are often present, which are not SEO-
recommended methods for handling page redirects.
 
✦ Make sure your URLs contain keywords (words that are used in 
searches) you want to rank for in that country. Just like optimization 
in the U.S., keywords in the URL help users identify your site as relevant 
and promote recognition.
 
✦ Use and source local links. This also enhances your credibility to your 
international users.
 
✦ Use experts for keyword research. What do you do if there’s no direct 
translation for a word? Employ someone fluent in that language to help 
you with the translation issues.
 
✦ Use ccTLDs. These are the domains that relate to a particular country 
and are more likely to inspire trust in your site.
 
✦ Have lots of content on your Web site that reads well to your target 
audience. Use good, clean copy and make sure you’re using the right 
character sets.

Identifying Opportunities for Your International Site
Identifying Opportunities for Your International Site
When expanding into the international market, you have three options when 
it comes to your site architecture: one site, multiple sites, or a combina-
tion of the two. With one site, you take advantage of subdomains (smaller 
domains linked to bigger domains) and subdirectories pointing to pages 
in different languages or geared towards specific countries. Multiple sites 
require you to build an individual site for every country with a local cc.TLD, 
preferably hosted in the country.
Each of these three options have their pros and cons. It’s up to you to do the 
research and figure out what’s best for your company in your target mar-
kets. However, you can understand the differences by reading the details we 
cover in the following sections.
Single sites
Having a single site and targeting using subdomains (such as uk.myglobal
site.com, fr.myglobalsite.com, jp.myglobalsite.com, and so on) 
provides you with several benefits. It’s easy to set up. You only have to keep 
track of one server and one domain, and you can keep all of your files in one 
place.
All of the incoming links (links from outside sources) and all of your Web 
traffic point to one domain, rather than being split between two or more 
sites. Although lots of traffic doesn’t necessarily mean a high conversion 
rate, it sure doesn’t hurt.
In addition, if you use a single site, you will have more pages in the search 
engine’s index, which is the search engine’s database of Web pages that they 
periodically search to offer up to users for search queries. Grouping by lan-
guage prevents duplicate content. Remember, search engines remove a site 
from their search results if they think it is duplicate content.
On the other hand, here are some disadvantages of a single site approach:
If your home page is in the “wrong” language, it can be confusing for your 
international users. To avoid this problem, you would need to create an 
entry page that allows a user to select what language they want to view the 
site in. These pages tend to be text-light, however, and not good for search 
engines.
Another disadvantage can be a home page that ranks highly in only one 
language. Having your site pop up high in the rankings for German is great, 
but what if you also want to do business in the English-speaking world and 
you’re nowhere near the top 100 search results? You have to spend the same 
amount of effort on each section of your site, which can be time-consuming.

Search Engines

Identifying Opportunities for Your International Site
If you were to group by country, you are risking duplicate content. Although 
it’s okay to have different pages in different languages, if you have separate 
pages for each Spanish-speaking country but don’t provide unique content, the 
search engines read repeat pages as duplicate content and don’t count them.
If you do decide you want to maintain a single site, you can do some of the 
following:
 
✦ Specify the target country for each subdomain in Google Webmaster 
Tools. To set a geographic target, do the following:
 
1. Sign into Google Webmaster Tools with your Google account.
 
2. Click the URL for the site you want.
 
3. Click Settings.
 
4. Under Geographic Target, select the geographic region you want to 
target.
 
✦ Redirect country-specific domains to the appropriate subdomain or 
subdirectory.
 
✦ Internal and external links should be language-appropriate and use the 
country-specific domains.
Multiple sites
Having multiple sites means you set up a separate domain for each country. 
Expanding to new countries is technically easy. You can add sites one at a 
time as needed, without impacting any of your current Web sites. Domains 
with local ccTLDs usually rank well in multiple country-specific search 
engines.
Certain countries require you to host your site on one of their servers in 
order to qualify for a ccTLD. But even if it’s not a requirement, it’s a good 
practice because search engines do try to match your server location to 
your physical location. Hosting the site in the same country means that you 
have a home-team advantage.
But here are some of the disadvantages of a multiple site approach:
The most obvious disadvantage is that maintenance is harder. Having more 
sites equals having more sites to update, more servers to troubleshoot, and 
more domains to keep registered. Additionally, you wind up putting in more 
time to your SEO. Multiple sites mean multiple SEO efforts. Dividing your 
time and resources could cause it to take longer for your main .com site to 
rise in the rankings.

602
Realizing How People Search
With multiple sites, you’re forced to target countries instead of languages. 
There are many Spanish-speaking countries in the world, for example, and 
maintaining a site focused on each and every country can get costly and 
time-consuming.
Some tips for this approach include
 
✦ Target the country in Google Webmaster tools.
 
✦ Make sure that external links have appropriate anchor text and link to 
the right country-specific domains.
The blended approach
If you have an international site on the .com top level domain, you can use a 
blended approach, which is a combination of single and multiple sites. This 
approach might be the most realistic for worldwide presence. With it, you 
can start with a .com site and build country-specific sites as needed. It can 
be costly to create, maintain, and update, however, because every site needs 
to be kept up-to-date and in step with all the others.
Here are some tips for implementing the blended approach:
 
✦ Specify countries in Google Webmaster Tools, but your international 
site — the one that serves any interest — should be left without a spe-
cific target country.
 
✦ Link your multiple country sites carefully and logically. External links 
should be logical. Keep the globally applicable content on the interna-
tional site and country-specific information on country specific sites.
You can use IP sniffing to automatically detect a user’s location and serve 
up a translation in the local language to direct them to the proper site. If you 
do that, always let them know that they are leaving the current domain and 
going to a new domain.
Realizing How People Search
In this section, we introduce you to how the rest of the world searches by 
discussing several internationally popular search engines. First up is Google, 
as shown in Figure 1-1. This figure shows the French, Japanese, and Brazilian 
versions of the site.
Google is available pretty much everywhere. Here’s a small sampling of 
the languages Google is available in: Afrikaans, Amharic, Basque, Bihari, 
Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, Hindi, Kazakh, Malay, Norwegian, Quechua, Slovak, 
Tagalog, Twi, Urdu, Yiddish, and Zulu. This is only a sample, but our point is 
that Google’s available pretty much across the globe.

As for the other U.S. players, Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) seems to be losing 
market share in most places worldwide and Microsoft Live Search (www.
live.com) is gaining. Ask.com (www.ask.com) is a relatively minor player. 
One extremely important thing to note here is that YouTube (www.you
tube.com) actually gets more searches per month than Yahoo! does. Video 
content is key even on an international scale.
Even search engines local to the target country are mostly backfilled (sup-
plemented when there is insufficient inventory in the local engine’s index) 
by Google’s search index and paid ads. AltaVista (www.altavista.com) is 
still alive in Europe.
Not every country out there is using Yahoo! or Google. Hold on tight: We’re 
going to take a whirlwind tour around the global to look at some of the most 
important search engine brands outside the U.S.
Baidu (www.baidu.com, shown in Figure 1-2) is the leading Chinese search 
engine for Web sites, audio files, and images. Baidu has an index of more 
than 740 million Web pages, 80 million images, and 10 million multimedia 
files, and attracts 5.5 million visitors annually.
Yandex (www.yandex.com, shown in Figure 1-3) is a Russian search engine 
and the largest Russian Web portal. Yandex was launched in 1997. Its name 
comes from Yet Another iNDEXer (Yandex).

Seznam (www.seznam.cz, Figure 1-4) is a Czech search engine with a cus-
tomizable home page and other features such as e-mail, maps, and a com-
pany database.
Naver (www.naver.com, Figure 1-5) is the most popular search portal in 
South Korea. Naver was launched in June 1999, the first portal in Korea that 
used its own proprietary search engine. Naver received two billion queries 
in August 2007, accounting for more than 70 percent of all search queries in 
Korea, and making it the fifth most-used search engine in the world, follow-
ing Google, Yahoo!, Baidu, and Microsoft Live Search.
Najdi.si (www.najdi.si, Figure 1-6) is a Slovenian search engine and Web 
portal created by Interseek. It’s the most visited Web site in Slovenia.
These are just a sampling of the search engines across the world. So where 
do you want to advertise? Simple answer: on all of them. You always want to 
be where your customers are looking for you. However, if that’s too broad 
and a little daunting, narrow your target market by demographic or search 
engine. Start out small and then expand as time goes on (depending on your 
success in the international markets, of course).

It’s time for a small, shameless plug: With the free SEOToolSet toolbar (avail-
able for Internet Explorer and Firefox), as well as the new version of the 
SEOToolSet from Bruce Clay, Inc., you can do three things for international 
search that make your international campaigns easier to manage:
 
✦ You can use it for local searches through a proxy server. This means 
that if you are in California and want to see what the Google local search 
results for London, England look like, you can see what someone in 
London would see.
 
✦ Search in different languages. The toolbar is available to do searches in 
more than 20 different languages, and growing all the time. Doing local 
research is key to succeeding internationally.
 
✦ Search in multiple engines, including country-specific engines like 
the ones we discussed previously. We think it’s a great tool, and not 
just because we built it. You can download the toolbar from SEOToolSet 
(www.seotoolset.com). For more about the capabilities of the toolbar, 
check out Book III, Chapter 2.

Chapter 2: Tailoring Your 
Marketing Message for Asia
In This Chapter
✓ Succeeding in Asia
✓ Discovering Japan
✓ Succeeding in China
✓ Finding out about South Korea
✓ Operating in Russia
T
he first stop on our world tour on online marketing in the international 
venue is the Asia region, which includes Japan, China, South Korea, and 
much of Russia. In the previous chapter, we briefly touch on the search 
engines popular in this region, along with a few tips and tricks for operat-
ing a Web site in those countries. In this chapter, we go into more depth 
on operating online in Asia. You discover tips on how to succeed in the tar-
geted country, the demographics of the region, and any other hints we think 
would we useful to you along the way.
Succeeding in Asia
Starting up a site or expanding your Web site into the Asian region can be 
a little daunting. Asian culture can be very different from Western culture, 
with nuances that can harm you and your company if you miss them, and 
that’s not even considering the language barrier. Not to worry, though. 
We’ve put together a step-by-step getting started guide for building or trans-
lating your site to work in the Asian markets.
 
It’s important to note that one chapter in a book is not enough to make you 
an expert in SEO for the Asian market. In fact, the most important message 
you should take away from this chapter is that there is no shortcut or sub-
stitute for research and local know-how.
Assessing your site’s chances
Your first step is simple: Assess the usability of your translated site — is 
it going to work for your target country? What works in the U.S. might not 
work in Asia. If you want to work in any country other than your own, 
you should be hiring some people who are native speakers from the local 

610
Succeeding in Asia
markets. This doesn’t have to be an expensive proposition. You might find 
some international students at your local college campus who want to earn 
a little money by looking over your translated site and pointing out anything 
you have missed. Look around and see who’s available to you and get them 
to tell you everything they can about your new target market.
 
Just as you would analyze the market back home, you want to consider the 
viability of your niche when marketing in Asia. The trick here is that you’re 
dealing with an entirely new culture. You need to find out what’s popular 
before you can start selling it, after all. So maybe there’s not a huge market for 
custom classic cars in Asia, but maybe you have a side operation that sells all 
sorts of classic car memorabilia, including fuzzy dice. Through your research, 
you discover that, in Asia, they can’t get enough fuzzy dice. You’re in business!
Sizing up the competition and 
sounding out the market
After you have your market, it’s time to analyze your competition. Having 
figured out that there is a large market for fuzzy dice in Asia, you need to sit 
down and study how your competition is doing in the foreign market. Check 
out other sites that sell fuzzy dice, especially if they’re local companies. 
This is where someone who speaks the language or knows the culture would 
come in very handy. All the tips and tricks from Book III are going to come 
in especially handy here. Follow the same step-by-step procedure to gather 
and analyze information.
You’ll have an easier time gathering information using the proper tools. 
There are a lot of SEO toolbars out there. We obviously recommend the 
SEOToolSet toolbar from Bruce Clay, Inc. (www.seotoolset.com). You 
can adjust the toolbar so that you can view it in more than 20 different lan-
guages, including Japanese. You can also use it to do a local search in the 
area you are targeting so that you see the same results that someone doing a 
local search sees. It’s a free tool, and it’ll help you a lot in your research.
After you’ve sorted out your competition, you need to broaden your 
research to the entire Asian market in order to plan your strategy and 
tactics. How does marketing work there? Who is online and how are they 
searching? A quick search turns up these stats:
 
✦ China has 162 million online users — 45 percent female, 54 percent male, 
and overwhelmingly in the 18–24 age group.
 
✦ In Japan, 69.9 percent of the population is online, which represents 89.1 
million people. Women 20–35 years old have 80 percent of the purchas-
ing power.
 
✦ South Korea has an incredible Internet infrastructure, and most of the 
population is online, many with broadband access. (North Korea’s stats 
are largely unknown.)

Succeeding in Asia
Determining your plan of attack
After you’ve determined your suitability, competition, and strategy, you can 
move on to the actual implementation. Your next step is the planning phase: 
Here’s where you create your Asian marketing plan.
If you have an e-commerce site (any Web site that sells a particular product 
or service, like fuzzy dice), you need to start with Japan, and then expand 
into South Korea and China. However, if you’re branding (establishing your 
name and associating it with your business, like Nike or Xerox), you need to 
start with China and then move into South Korea and then Japan.
Sound strange? It’s really not. China is notorious for knock-off brands, so you 
should be starting there immediately if you want to expand your brand. In 
Japan, they tend to copy technology faster and tend to be conscious about 
brand, so you need to establish yourself as the authority product and then 
work on your brand so that you’re recognized as the only brand to have.
Next, you need to know the search engines you’ll be using. Google is used 
almost everywhere in the world, but certain search engines are actually 
more popular in a particular country or region. You need to know which 
search engines are the most prevalent in your target market, and look at get-
ting indexed (getting your site into the search engine’s database) as soon as 
you can. The search engine statistics look something like this:
 
✦ In Japan, Yahoo! has 43 percent of the online market share, although 
Google is gaining on them every month.
 
✦ In China, it’s all about Baidu (www.baidu.com), which is the major 
Chinese search engine and the fourth most-used search engine in the 
world.
 
✦ In South Korea, Naver (www.naver.com, a popular Korean search 
engine) and Yahoo! together have 80 to 85 percent of the Internet search 
market. Google has only 1.5 percent market share.
 
Use localized keywords (search terms), advertising copy, and landing pages 
(the page a user arrives on when they first visit your site). Do not use an 
unnatural mix of English and the local languages. Think of how funny but 
untrustworthy misspelled signs or menus are. You might think a store offer-
ing “Creem donuts” is hilarious, but you probably wouldn’t make a purchase 
from them. The same is true when English speakers attempt to do business 
in other languages.
Building trust and face-to-face interaction are a huge part of selling yourself 
in the Asian market. Putting a face on your brand is very important, and 
you need to be selling yourself as much as your product. Be prepared to log 
some frequent flyer miles. Meeting with clients, vendors, and others you do 
business with face-to-face helps to establish trust.

612
Discovering Japan
You should also be monitoring your local competition. You’re the foreigner, 
so you are starting at a disadvantage. Be looking for an edge: something that 
separates you from the local competition, but at the same isn’t too foreign or 
untrustworthy.
 
In this chapter, we cover things that you should generally be aware of as you 
move into the Asian market. But each country has its own quirks and legal 
issues, so you need to do your research.
A man named Jianfei Zhu monitors all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean algo-
rithms for spam. He has a blog at googlechinawebmaster.com. It’s in 
Chinese, but you can use Google Translate (which should be available on the 
link to his site through Google) or another service to translate it. It might be 
worth it for you to check it out if you’re curious about search engine spam.
Discovering Japan
After the United States, Japan has the second largest economy in the world. 
This is even after the prolonged recession in the 1990s, and with the cur-
rent one occurring as we write this book. Japan also has open markets that 
actively encourage foreign investment. This means that expanding into 
the Japanese market might be slightly easier than operating in other Asian 
countries.
 
The most demanding shoppers in the world live in Japan. There is a huge 
market for brand name services and goods, and the Japanese are very big 
on brand names as status symbols. Louis Vuitton, Vivienne Westwood, and 
others do a healthy share of business based on their brand names alone.
Japan also leads other countries in terms of personal savings. The largest 
public savings purse is 14 trillion Japanese yen in total, which translates to 
about $90,000 in U.S. currency for every citizen of Japan. The online busi-
ness world in Japan is also expanding. The country’s online ad spending 
increased 30 percent in 2007 and 2008.
The Japanese are aware that the language of business on the Internet is 
English, but to really do business with the Japanese, you have to be able to 
communicate in Japanese. The Japanese design aesthetic is also different 
from the western one. Check out this music site from Japan in Figure 2-1.
This is a professional Web site in Japan. People in Japan are much more 
likely to trust a Web site that looks like this, as opposed to one that looks 
much simpler.

Figure 2-1: 
A typical

Web site

have lots of

To establish a Web presence, get a .jp domain (the space your site occupies 
on the web, like a .com, or a .net, or in this case, co.jp, or.jp, or ne.jp). 
Hosting your site on a server actually physically located in Japan is a good 
idea as well. Be sure to include your contact info on your Web site, like a 
number someone can call and receive information. Be sure that the person in 
charge of this phone line speaks Japanese and is able to answer any question.
As with starting a business in any foreign market, we recommend getting a 
person on the ground. Hire someone familiar with Japanese language and 
customs, and if at all possible, someone who actually lives in Japan. A local 
resident can help you navigate the differences between the Western world 
and Japan and help you achieve greater success in the long run.
Succeeding in China
China is a new frontier when it comes to the business world. It’s also a tricky 
one to navigate. Not only do you have the language barrier and the cultural 
issues to work through, but you also have more extensive and stringent gov-
ernment regulations to deal with. However, China’s economy is booming, and 
if you are willing to take the steps, now is a good time to get in the front door.

614
Succeeding in China
Searchers in China are very different than users in the United States or 
elsewhere. Twelve of the top 100 Chinese Web site domains include num-
bers. Why? Because there are 13,500 Chinese standardized characters. That 
means if you were designing a keyboard to have one key per character, 
there would be more than 13,000 keys! This is why so many businesses have 
adopted the number platform.
 
You also definitely need to get a Web site domain within China’s ccTLD 
(country code Top Level Domain) of .cn (or .com.cn, if you can). You also 
need to host your site in China to avoid gateway issues.
If you’re getting started in search marketing (PPC or SEO) in China, start 
with Google through their interface. Although they are not the dominant 
search engine in China, they’re a good place to start your optimization cam-
paign. The rules are familiar, and you can get your campaign up and running 
without too many hurdles.
The home page for Google China (Figure 2-2) is very different from the one 
here in the United States: As soon as you start typing, the search box drops 
down to offer a guided search (a search suggestion). Again, this is because 
the language has so many characters. It helps users to find information a lot 
more quickly.

Succeeding in China
Two products that Google is currently testing in the Chinese market are
 
✦ Popular Searches: This tool breaks down popular searches by category, 
allowing users to click to navigate to the search results page. Instead 
of having to type in [this week’s biggest music performers], Popular 
Searches just displays “Justin Timberlake” or whoever is big at the time. 
This would be a good way to do keyword research.
 
✦ Website Directory: This is a list of Web sites based on categories and 
services. It’s algorithm-based, which means that it isn’t just a static list.
A site that might be worth checking out is Tom.com (www.tom.com), which 
is one of the top 10 Web sites in China (see Figure 2-3). It has tons of links on 
the page without a search box above the fold. Users come here as a destina-
tion site, not to search.
Because people often use guided search (where the search engine makes 
suggestions on your queries, much like Google or Yahoo! Suggests) in China, 
search engine optimization is a little easier because search marketers know 
off the bat what queries searchers are using. Also, you can use Google 
China’s Popular Searches function.

616
Succeeding in China
Baidu (www.baidu.com, China’s top search engine and their answer to 
Google or Yahoo!) has a minimum implementation fee of $3,000–5,000 U.S. 
and funds must be prepaid by wire. Additionally, they have only Chinese-
speaking support, and they subject all sites to a tough validation process.
Analytics-wise, Baidu and Yahoo! provide no impression results. But Google 
Analytics is available in China. On Baidu, the paid listings are mixed in with 
the organic, (which means search engine results that pop up in a normal 
search of the index) and studies suggest that the users don’t know the dif-
ference. Long-Tail search queries (keywords, or search queries, made up of 
several words or a phrase) don’t really exist in China because users don’t do 
as many searches as we do. They rely more on guided search.
Here are some key observations on Baidu:
 
✦ It’s the most popular search engine for lifestyle searches, but not for 
business. Google trumps Baidu in business searches.
 
✦ Baidu’s results are overwhelmingly influenced by paid advertising 
campaigns.
 
✦ Baidu has its greatest reach with young lifestyle-centric searchers.
 
✦ Display advertising that charges by the page view, called CPM (which 
stands for cost per mille; that is, cost per each thousand impressions, 
mille being French for 1,000) advertising, is most popular with Baidu.
Being a foreigner in China can be both a disadvantage and an advantage. 
Although there is always going to be the natural tendency to push back 
against the unfamiliar, in China, you have something of an advantage if 
you’re an expert. When you come in to speak, if you have any kind of creden-
tials, you’re treated like a rock star. Additionally, by being a foreigner, you 
can get away with not knowing the customs at first. Be warned, however, 
that your grace period ends quickly, and you should be ready to adapt to 
Chinese culture.
There are a few challenges in the Chinese market that, while not unique to 
the country, are certainly worth knowing ahead of time:
 
✦ Budgets for local companies are small. If you’re a search marketer, 
you’ll find that you’re dealing with less capital than you might have 
expected.
 
✦ Clients are very particular about their contacts in your company. Have 
a point person who is extremely knowledgeable in the culture and can 
handle your business dealings in the local markets.

for Asia 
617
Succeeding in China
 
Business is very relationship-based in China. Good relationships are abso-
lutely critical to success. You have to be introduced to the right people at 
the right places. Many Westerners underestimate exactly how important it is 
to have good contacts. It’s true everywhere, but especially in China: It’s 
about who you know, how well you know them, and who you work with.
Your employees make or break a deal in the long run. Most of the advertis-
ing in the Chinese market is branding. It’s not about trying to convert. If you 
do decide to tap into the Chinese market, make sure you’re willing to be flex-
ible and do things their way.
When looking at hiring people abroad (and this includes all countries), be 
sure to check the following things:
 
✦ Check the credentials for the people you’re meeting.
 
✦ Confirm they are doing the work themselves and they’re not 
outsourcing it.
 
✦ Establish goals and document them in contracts.
 
✦ Do periodic checks of the quality of the ads and the effectiveness of 
campaigns.
You should pick your teams based on their effectiveness. Offer incentives for 
employees to maintain loyalty. As with any business, a happy employee is an 
efficient and loyal employee. Pick your partners well and do a lot of research 
on their capabilities.
In China, most users are still accessing the Internet via desktop computers 
(96 percent), although access via mobile devices is becoming trendy at 27 
percent of mobile users and growing. The growth in search from cell phones 
is due to increased interest in the Internet and the availability of 3G hand-
sets and connectivity.
What does all this mean to the outside world? There are a lot of opportuni-
ties to market to the Chinese if you do it on their terms and within their 
comfort level. The key to succeeding in China is relationships, patience, 
diligence, and an open mind. The truth is that most people in China still 
don’t trust the Internet. E-commerce is still very much in its infancy in China, 
and online marketing is mostly still for branding. Keep this in mind as you 
expand into the Chinese market.

Finding Out about South Korea
Finding Out about South Korea
When we say Korea, we’re talking about South Korea. North Korea is a 
cipher to pretty much all marketers, and we’re going to ignore them entirely. 
You should too.
South Korea has an incredible infrastructure and much (70.7 percent) of 
their population is online and searching. Nearly half of that number has 
broadband access. You can use Flash and lots of images without fear. In fact, 
that’s an advantage to you in Korea. The population tends to prefer very 
busy-looking professional sites (lots of color and text), so a Korean page can 
look a little something like Figure 2-4. Because of this push for color and con-
tent, Google’s clean designs do very poorly in Korea.
Operating in South Korea is a lot like operating in Japan and China. They 
prefer face-to-face interaction, and your success is a matter of establishing 
trust and accessibility. Get a .co.kr domain for your Korean site and get 
started optimizing.

Operating in Russia
You absolutely must do local link building. Work on making connections, 
gaining trust and links, and getting the local search engines to recognize 
those things. International links are fine, but local links carry more weight in 
the long run. Remember, relevancy is always key and local is more relevant 
than non-local.
Naver (www.naver.com) is Korea’s biggest search engine. It currently com-
mands a 77 percent share of all searches in South Korea. The other contend-
ers are Daum (www.daum.net) with 10.8 percent, Yahoo! with 4.4 percent, 
and Google with an itty-bitty 1.7 percent of Korean Web searches.
When Naver was first launched, its founders discovered a real dearth of 
pages in Korean on the Internet. So Naver decided to create content and 
databases, so that when you would search in Korean, you would be able 
to find quality content. Naver set up Knowledge Search in 2002, enabling 
Koreans to help each other in a type of real-time question-and-answer plat-
form. On average, 44,000 questions are posted each day, with about 110,000 
returned answers. The tool allows users to ask just about any question, such 
as requests for recipes or how to subscribe to international magazines via 
the Internet, and get answers from other users. This tool was used by Yahoo! 
as the inspiration for Yahoo! Answers.
Operating in Russia
We include Russia in the marketing for Asian strategy for reasons of geogra-
phy as well as strategy. Expanding to the Russian market is a lot like expand-
ing into the Chinese market. In order to have a fully successful venture, 
you’re going to need a person on the ground in Russia.
This means you need someone who not only knows the language and culture, 
but also who actually lives and works there, to provide you a brick-and-mortar 
foothold in the country. Having someone who is based in Russia can also help 
in dealing with any legal or local bureaucratic issues that could spring up.
About 23 percent of Russia’s population is online, which is about 32.7 million 
people. Of those, only about 2.9 million had broadband access in September 
2007. Consider the design limitations for your site when dealing with an audi-
ence running at dial-up speeds. Fancy technologies and enormous pages are 
going to be hindrances rather than a help.
The largest search engine in Russia is called Yandex (www.yandex.com, 
Figure 2-5).

Yandex was launched in 1997. The net income of the company in 2004 con-
stituted $7 million U.S. In June 2006, the weekly revenue of the Yandex.Direct 
context ads system exceeded $1 million U.S., and it’s still growing.
The closest competitors of Yandex in the Russian market are Rambler (www.
rambler.com) and Mail.RU (www.mail.ru). Services like Google and 
Yahoo! are also used by Russian users and have Russian interfaces. Google 
creates about 21–27 percent of search engine-generated traffic to Russian 
sites, and Yandex has around 44 percent. One of Yandex’s largest advan-
tages is recognition of Russian inflection in search queries.
As with all of the other countries we mention in this chapter, it’s best to 
have a domain within the country’s ccTLD and someone physically located 
on the brick and mortar side who lives and works in Russia to give you valu-
able credibility. You must do cultural research to pin down the right tone for 
your Russian audience.

Chapter 3: Staking 
a Claim in Europe
In This Chapter
✓ Succeeding in the European Union
✓ Knowing the legal issues in the EU
✓ Working in the United Kingdom
✓ Discovering France
✓ Operating in Germany
✓ Understanding the Netherlands
A
cross the pond from the United States lies the European Union (EU). 
When we talk about the EU, we’re referring to the group of countries 
that actually belong to the EU and thus are subject to certain laws and regu-
lations, and all the countries that are actually located within Europe itself.
Succeeding in the EU isn’t as simple as copying and pasting your Web site 
into German or French and then hoping the traffic comes to you. You have 
to consider legal and cultural differences, along with the technical issues 
that come from running a Web site in another country. In this chapter, we 
talk about how to succeed in the European Union, some legal issues you 
should be aware of, and some specific facts about doing business in the 
United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Netherlands that should give 
you a little more insight into the search markets in the European Union.
Succeeding in the European Union
You might think that getting started with the European Union would be 
pretty easy. It’s actually not. For one thing, you have to remember that 
Europe is made up of lots of different countries with their own languages 
and customs and their own markets for searchengines. You can’t make up 
one Web site for the whole EU, and then call it a day.
First you need to figure out what countries you want to target. This is 
important in terms of tailoring your marketing campaign. Each country 
has its own language, culture, and social mores that you need to use when 
doing your keyword research. For example, in the United States, personal 
telephones are called cell phones, so when a user does a search, they most 

622
Knowing the Legal Issues in the EU
likely enter keywords such as [cellphone], [cell phone], [cellular phones], 
and the like. But in the United Kingdom, personal telephones are referred to 
as mobiles. So a U.K. user would, for the exact same product, use keywords 
like [mobiles], [mobile telephone], and so on.
You also have to contend with the technical difficulties associated with 
obtaining and using a proper country code top level domain (the letters 
that follow the final dot of any domain name, for example, .com or .net). A 
country-code top level domain, or ccTLD, is a TLD that is specific to a cer-
tain country. The United States has .us and the United Kingdom has .uk. 
Users within a specific country are much more likely to trust a Web site 
that’s within their own country’s ccTLD than one with a foreign ccTLD.
European users are also much more likely to trust a foreign Web site if it 
includes links to sites within their country, especially local links.
 
You can also use the free SEMToolBar from Bruce Clay, Inc. to help with 
your international SEO. It has tools built-in to enable you to do a local search 
in the area you are targeting, so that you can see search results as someone 
would see them in Germany, even if you’re sitting pretty in Denver. The tool-
bar supports 20 different languages, including French and German, so it’s 
useful for your entire team, no matter where they’re based. The search is re-
routed using a proxy through a local IP address, so the search engine thinks 
you are located in the country you are searching for.
Knowing the Legal Issues in the EU
As a marketer to the EU, you benefit somewhat from the fact that stan-
dardized trade policies have been agreed on by all the member countries. 
However, one thing we have to stress is that the European Union is made up 
of many different countries, each with its own languages and laws.
For example, France is constantly suing Google over pay per click or PPC 
ads (paid advertising that appears in the search results, for which advertis-
ers pay a fee every time their ad is clicked). In the United States, you can 
bid on a trademarked keyword and win it if you put up enough money (and 
the keyword relevant to your company). In France, this is not the case, and 
there have been several lawsuits over this issue. All of the high courts in 
France (the Court of Nanterre, the Court of Paris, and the Court of Appeals 
of Versailles) have found that bidding on a copyrighted trademark is a copy-
right infringement.
However, according to the Cour d’Appel de Paris, the French courts have 
no jurisdiction if the ads in question lead only to Web sites owned by com-
panies established outside of France and appear only on google.co.uk, 
google.de, and google.ca, but not google.fr (decision of June 6, 2007, 

Book IX
Chapter 3
Staking a Claim 
in Europe
623
Working within the United Kingdom
Google Inc. and Google France versus Axa et al, CRI 2007, 155 ff). This means 
that if you have an ad for a trademarked keyword, you can use it as long as 
you are not a French company and it doesn’t appear on the French version 
of Google.
Another fun legal issue comes to us from Belgium. Several Belgian newspa-
pers sued Google News for displaying and storing their content. A company 
called Copiepresse claimed that Google violated Belgian law by keeping 
archived versions of stories in its search cache and using headlines and 
excerpts within the Google News service. Google claimed that their activities 
fell under “fair use” laws, but a Brussels court did not agree.
 
Because the legal system varies from country to country, you might want to 
hire a lawyer within the country you wish to be working in. You need some-
one who can help you with the ins and outs of that country’s legal system.
Working within the United Kingdom
It’s tempting to think that optimizing for the U.K. is going to be easy because 
you’re at least working in the same language. “Aha!” you think, “The United 
Kingdom is a lot like America because English is the primary language of 
both.” True — except that they’re really not speaking the same language 
at all. English in the U.K. has a lot of spelling conventions that an American 
spelling checker reads as misspelled (the “u” in words like colour and favour-
able, an “s” instead of “z” in words like customisation, and so on). British 
English is not exactly like American English, and you need to be well aware 
of that. There is no faster way to shoot down your credibility than forgetting 
cultural mores and language differences when working in another country.
It’s not just spelling that’s different. U.K. English often uses different words 
for everyday objects (a cell phone in the U.S. is called a mobile in the U.K., 
for instance), different slang terms, and the same word mean totally differ-
ent things. These differences can be subtle, but they stick out like a sore 
thumb to a native. Blogs like Separated by a Common Language (http://
separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.com/) are good resources for 
pinpointing the diversions between British and American usage.
In the U.K., Google is the predominant search engine, even more so than in 
the U.S., but there are some key differences:
 
✦ Google paid some outside agencies in the U.K. to bring people to 
AdWords (Google’s PPC program). This created two types of PPC agen-
cies in the U.K. — the optimizers (the ones that add value) and the dis-
counters (agencies that relied on how much you could spend). Google 
has since stopped this practice.

624
Working within the United Kingdom
 
✦ The U.K. has something called the Financial Services Authority (or FSA). 
It’s a body that regulates financial matters and financial companies like 
banks. Be aware that all it takes to cause you grief is an e-mail to the FSA.
 
✦ In the U.K., people use different currencies because they are members of 
the EU, so you’ll see euros and British pounds. Multi-currency transac-
tions are difficult to manage and track.
With Google, you get two sets of search results. Organic results are the links 
that naturally match a user’s search, and pay per click (PPC) results are the 
ads paid for by the advertising companies. When surveyed, more than 80 
percent of U.K. respondents said that the left side (organic) results offered 
the best results. Only 6 percent in 2007, and 4.66 percent in 2008, answered 
that the paid search results gave the best results.
So how much do U.K. firms spend on search? Nine percent of U.K. firms are 
spending more than £1 million U.K. annually on paid search. One in six U.K. 
companies spend more than £50,000 U.K. on search.
Compared to Internet users globally, U.K. users are quite confident online. 
They’re not scared to give their credit card information to a brand they 
recognize. They’re also a little more search engine-savvy than a typical 
American user.
Certain Internet issues are also of concern to the U.K. public:
 
✦ The U.K. has concerns about child safety issues, especially when it 
comes to online predators. There are growing calls to adopt a U.S.-like 
Amber Alert system, where automatic calls are sent out looking for miss-
ing children.
 
✦ Social networking sites can create problems at work, undermining 
employee relationships through gossip and also as a recruitment issue. 
People in the U.K. use social networking sites as much as Americans 
do. Unfortunately, this can be a bit of a problem for companies doing 
research on potential employees and finding, say, evidence of a poten-
tial employee doing questionable things on his MySpace profile.
You need to be aware of two laws when you expand into the U.K. market. 
The first is the John Doe law. The term comes from an 18th-century law. This 
particular law lets court proceedings go ahead even when the identity of 
the person is unknown. What it can mean for online marketing is that after a 
court order has been obtained, it is possible for a plaintiff to go to the ISPs 
(Internet service provider) or even the search engines to prevent the defen-
dant from entering sensitive information on a blog or Web site.
The second law is known as the Spartacus Order. The person responsible 
for anonymous activities must come forward and make himself known to 
the court or they could be found in contempt of court — a whole extra set 

Book IX
Chapter 3
Staking a Claim 
in Europe
625
Discovering France
of charges that the offending party may want to avoid. This means that if 
someone files suit against you, even if they don’t know who you are (using 
the John Doe law), and you fail to come forward, you are actually in danger 
of contempt of court. For online activities, where it’s not uncommon for the 
person behind a Web site to be unknown and untrackable, this is another 
level of trouble.
Discovering France
In France, more than 30 million people are connected via the Internet. But 
the digital economy makes up only 6 percent of the GNP (gross national 
product) in France, as opposed to 14 percent in the United States. More than 
thirty-seven percent of the population uses search engines several times a 
week, whereas almost 50 percent uses them several times a month. Most 
users between 45 and 54 say they don’t look past the first page of results, 
and women are less likely to go to the second page than men.
The search engine market in France looks something like this: Google is 
the biggest with 87 percent, and then Microsoft Live Search with 3 percent, 
Yahoo! with 3 percent, Voila (www.voila.fr, a French search engine, see 
Figure 3-1) is at 2 percent, with the rest of the pack making up the remaining 
5 percent.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Voila.fr is 
a French 
search 
engine.
 

626
Discovering France
There are a couple of ways to use Google in France. You can use the French 
version of Google (www.google.fr/), or you can use the English version 
(www.google.com/) and ask for your results in French. Most people in 
France, not surprisingly, use the French version of Google. Many of the most 
visited sites within France are French-specific Web sites such as Orange (www.
orange.fr), Free (www.free.fr/), PagesJaune (www.pagesjaunes.fr/), 
and Copains d’Avant (http://copainsdavant.linternaute.com/). In 
2008, French businesses planned to invest 29 percent of their resources in 
search marketing (22 percent was invested in 2007).
The top searched-for subject categories in France aren’t much different than 
in the U.S.: entertainment, computers, and business. French searchers look 
for entertainment more than the U.S. markets do, however. The top search 
terms include YouTube, jeux (games), and meteo (weather). This can be 
useful to you in terms of figuring out which keywords you want to target 
while working in France; however, remember that France is very strict about 
copyrighted keywords. You cannot use a copyrighted keyword that you 
do not own in any way. Although U.S. legislators have split on the issue, in 
France, nearly every case has gone the copyright holder’s way. Copyrighted 
keywords cannot be used in metadata or to trigger paid search ads.
Seasons differ between countries. In the States, the Christmas season offi-
cially begins the Friday after Thanksgiving. In other countries, the Christmas 
season can begin even earlier because there’s not another holiday in the way. 
Travel is also different in France (where people typically have five weeks of 
paid vacation), so holiday-related search words are in high use. You need to 
adjust your marketing strategy to take advantage of these differences.
Online social networks are booming in France, and the traffic is propor-
tionately huge compared to the U.S. Skyrock (http://fr.skyrock.com), 
a French social networking site that’s a lot like MySpace, is the big social 
media site (see Figure 3-2), and Copains d’Avant (http://copainsdavant.
linternaute.com/) is like Classmates.com for France, popular for recon-
necting with old schoolmates and friends.
Cell phones aren’t used a lot for search in France. Fewer than three percent 
of mobile phone users said they’ve used a phone to find information via 
search engines.
Here are some special French search engine issues you should keep in mind:
 
✦ You can submit your site/URL to most of the French search engines, but 
generally only if you have French language content.
 
✦ If you put an accent on the word, it may change the meaning of the 
word. If you ignore accentuation, the French word for diaper is the same 
for making love.
 
✦ Many French search engines try to analyze the word environment to try 
and understand the meaning of a word, even without accents, but it isn’t 
perfect.

Operating in Germany
Germany is a country of 82.3 million people. Of that number, 53 million 
people are online and the equivalent of $49 billion dollars was spent online 
in 2007. As of this writing, Germany’s GDP (gross domestic product) per 
capita is about $31,400. It’s a pretty healthy economy.
The search engine landscape in Germany looks a little like this: Google.
de has 95–98 percent market share. Yahoo! and Ask.com are there too, but 
Microsoft Live Search is barely on the chart. If you are going to operate in 
Germany, it’s probably best to concentrate on Google.de.
Local search, which is a search that is specifically targeted to businesses 
within the searcher’s local area, is almost nonexistent in Germany. It’s still in 
the starting stages, but it is growing.
In Germany, there are 11 million .de domains. If you’re thinking about going 
into Germany, you need to get a .de domain. Don’t use a subdomain (a depen-
dent domain set up within the primary domain, such as de.classicar
customization.com); it will not have as much success as a country specific 
top-level domain.
To obtain a .de, you need to have a branch of your company physically oper-
ating in Germany, which means you need a local contact. The server that 

628
Operating in Germany
will be hosting your .de Web site must also physically reside in Germany. 
Remember when we said that the rules are different for every country? This 
is a good example.
Credit cards are just becoming popular in Germany. Not a whole lot of pur-
chases are made with credit cards. (Many Germans are leery of giving out 
personal information over the Internet.) So make sure that they have an 
alternative way to pay in Germany if you are running an e-commerce (online 
retail) business.
Germans are also known to spend a lot of time researching. This is some-
thing to keep in mind if you’re running a research site (a Web site geared for 
providing information) as opposed to an e-commerce site; you might do well 
there.
If you are running an e-commerce site in Germany, there are some steps you 
can take to ensure that the process is as easy as possible for both you and 
your German users:
 
✦ Put on your landing page that you can ship worldwide and make it clear 
that it’s easy for you to do so. A landing page is the page where a user 
arrives on your Web site. (See Book IV, Chapter 4 and Book X, Chapter 1 
for more information on landing pages.)
 
✦ Have a German bank account so that transferring money for purchases 
is as easy and hassle-free as possible.
 
✦ Have a German phone number where people can call and request more 
information if they need to. This is why having a physical location in 
Germany really helps, and not just in terms of obtaining a .de ccTLD.
In the German social networking arena, local companies are very strong, 
much stronger than the U.S. companies like Facebook or MySpace. As of 
the writing of this book, Facebook has just launched in Germany. Important 
German social networking sites include studiVZ (www.studivz.net), which 
is a networking site for students and university students that is similar to 
Facebook. Another important social networking site is Yigg (www.yigg.de), 
as shown in Figure 3-3. Yigg is similar to the U.S.’s Digg.com. It’s a site where 
German users can vote on a particular news story. The more popular a news 
story becomes, the more likely it is that it will appear on the front page of 
the site.
The German language is much different than English. There are some 
common phrases, but for the most part, if you don’t speak German, you’re 
probably not going to understand it. There are also special characters in the 
German language that people in the U.S. aren’t used to. You want to keep all 
of this in mind when doing keyword research.

Understanding the Netherlands
In the Netherlands, about 87.8 percent of the population is online, which is 
the second-highest number of users online in the world and 16 percent more 
than the U.S. The Dutch also spend about $6 billion online, which makes 
them the fourth largest market in Europe.
However, that being said, the Dutch search engine market is actually fairly 
small, although highly competitive. The Dutch search engine usage is as follows: 
Google commands 93 percent of the market, Vindex.nl (a Dutch search engine 
shown in Figure 3-4) is at 2 percent, and llse.nl (another Dutch search engine) 
commands 1 percent of the market. Interestingly, llse carries Google ads.
When researching your keywords, be aware that Dutch is spoken by 15 mil-
lion people in the Netherlands, which is the vast majority of the population. 
About a million speak Flemish, which refers to dialects of Dutch. Be aware 
that the paid search campaign you’re running in one language won’t work in 
the other. That being said, English is taught in all Dutch schools, and most of 
the population of the Netherlands is fluent in English.

630
Understanding the Netherlands
 
Figure 3-4: 
Vindex.nl 
is a Dutch-
language 
search 
engine.
 
Stemming (the difference between the ending of a word that makes it sin-
gular or plural) is one of the anomalies in the Dutch market. For example, a 
single tree in Dutch is boom, while more than one tree is bomen. This means 
for Dutch keywords, you would have to target both “boom” and “bomen.” 
As for all keyword research in languages not your own, we recommend that 
you employ someone who is fluent in your target language and preferably an 
actual resident of that country.
As for local search, the Netherlands has Marktplaats (www.marktplaats.nl, 
see Figure 3-5), which is their biggest online marketplace site. It’s where a lot 
of the local search queries go.
Spam (sneaky or deceptive ways of fooling the search engines into giving 
a Web page higher rankings) is unfortunately pretty common in the 
Netherlands. If some shady operator does a bit of no-frills spam and some 
aggressive link buying, they rank pretty highly. People still do link farms too, 
so be wary when requesting links to your site. You can spot link farms a lot 
sooner than you could in the U.S. because there are only about two million 
Dutch Web sites out there.

Don’t be tempted by those link farms, however. Remember that honesty is 
the best policy, and it’s best to be operating aboveboard from the start. That 
way, when the Netherlands starts to clear out the spam in their search 
engines, you’re in the clear and way ahead of the game.

Chapter 4: Getting Started 
in Latin America
In This Chapter
✓ Succeeding in Latin America
✓ Using Google Webmaster Tools for geotargeting
✓ Making your Web site work in Mexico
✓ Operating in Brazil
✓ Discovering Argentina
L
atin America is the final stop on our search engine optimization (SEO) 
world tour. Latin America includes Mexico and both Central and South 
America. Keep in mind, as with the European Union and the Asian region, 
that the Latin American region is made up of many different countries, all 
with different cultures, economies, and languages. Many countries in Latin 
America have Spanish as their dominant language, but not all. In South 
America, the biggest country, Brazil, speaks Portuguese.
As always, you need to do research before you launch an online business in 
a particular country. Hiring someone with knowledge of the local language, 
customs, and legal ins and outs is also an invaluable asset to your company 
if you are looking to expand into the Latin American region. In this chapter, 
you find out a bit about operating in Latin America and discover some stats 
on a few countries in the area. Latin America is a pretty big place, so realize 
that we’re giving you only a peek into the region.
Succeeding in Latin America
Latin America is another up-and-comer in the search engine optimization 
industry, with a population that’s hungry for everything the Web has to 
offer. Latin American countries have a total of 53 million Internet users. 
Whereas the global average of hours per month spent online is 25 hours, the 
average in Latin America is higher, at 29 hours per month.
The amount of money spent online in Latin America is growing fast, both in 
terms of consumer spending and advertising. In 2006, online advertising in 
Mexico accounted for $80 million, Argentina $50 million, and Brazil $180 mil-
lion (all in U.S. dollars). E-commerce purchases in Brazil reached $114 bil-
lion in 2006, which represents 82 percent growth compared to 2005.

634
Succeeding in Latin America
 
In Latin America, language matters. Results differ by including accents or 
using the English or Spanish language versions of Google. When you’re 
researching keywords, have someone help you who’s from the country you 
are actually targeting, and not just a generic Spanish speaker. The language 
has subtle variations due to both regions and culture, and what might be a 
perfectly innocent word in one region might be an offensive slang term in 
another. For example, in Mexico, the term cajeta means a caramel dessert 
topping. In Colombia, it’s slang for a bodybuilder, like meathead in English. 
In Costa Rica, it means a form of low-quality marijuana. But in Argentina, it 
refers to female private parts. Definitely not a mistake that you want to make! 
These are just some examples of regional differences. Obviously, you should 
take great care.
 
If you are going to be translating your site into Spanish to target Latin 
American users, do have a way of getting your products to your custom-
ers! Learn from the mistakes of Best Buy Español. In November 2007, this 
leading North American retailer translated its site into Spanish in order to 
target Spanish-speaking customers. Best Buy Español was then immediately 
indexed (included in the search engine’s database of Web sites, which they 
pull from when a user does searches) and got huge numbers of people visit-
ing their sites. The problem was that they were showing up in the search 
engines in Spain and Latin America as well as in the U.S., but they didn’t 
have the ability to ship to those places! If you are going to translate your 
Web site just for the U.S. Spanish-speaking population, be aware that you 
will probably draw traffic from these other countries. If you do, have a way 
to ship to them! There’s nothing wrong with people wanting to buy things 
from you. Just make sure that you can provide what it is you are selling.
 
Also, do be aware that not all Latin American countries speak Spanish. 
Several countries, such as Brazil, use Brazilian Portuguese (distinct from 
that spoken in Portugal) as their primary language. Other countries still have 
a large native population that speaks their own diverse languages and dia-
lects. Argentina, for instance, has a large German-speaking population and a 
large English-speaking population as well. This is something to look for when 
you do your research, and keep in mind when you target your keywords and 
create a version of your site to run in those countries.
The SEM ToolBar from Bruce Clay, Inc. can help you do your keyword 
research and local optimization. Not only can you use it in 20 different 
languages, including Spanish, but you can also use it to view local search 
results from international sites. You can see what a Brazilian user would 
see, without ever having to leave the country. It’s a free tool and available 
for Internet Explorer or Firefox. We think it’s pretty cool, but try it out and 
decide for yourself.
As with expanding into any foreign market, it’s also best to hire a legal 
expert working in the country or region you are targeting. They help you 
work out any legal issues, commerce headaches, or trade and tariff rules you 
need to understand to do business in that country.

Geotargeting with Google Webmaster Tools
Google’s Webmaster Tools, which is a tool Google provides in order to help 
you build your site, has an option to help you associate a Web site with 
a particular country in order to enhance that Web site’s presence in the 
particular country’s local search results. A local search is a search geared 
specifically towards a user’s physical address, usually via the location of the 
server they are using.
In geotargeting, Google looks at a couple of signals to determine where a site 
is located or what particular region it belongs to:
 
✦ The server location of the Web site.
 
✦ The top level domain (TLD). A domain is the root part of a Web site 
address, such as wiley.com. The TLD is the part that identifies where 
the Web site is registered on the World Wide Web, and is marked by 
.com, .net, or other. In the case of international domains, the TLDs 
(known as country code TLDs, or ccTLD for short) identify the country 
where the domain was registered, such as .us, .uk, .co.jp, and so 
forth.
With the Webmaster Tools, you can do geotargeting even if your site 
is hosted in Colorado. If your Web site aims specifically for business in 
Argentina, you can use the tools to have your site appear in local searches 
for Argentina by setting it to that country in the Tools.
For more information on geotargeting using Google Webmaster Central, go 
to the Google Webmaster Tools site at www.google.com/webmasters/
tools.
Working in Mexico
Mexico has approximately 25 million Internet users, and there is an increas-
ing demand for broadband Internet services. By 2007, the vast majority (78 
percent) of personal computer Internet access was via broadband. There are 
approximately 7.6 million Internet hosts in Mexico, which means they rank 
eighth in the world. People online in Mexico have fast connections, which 
enables them to do online search much more effectively. Telmex is de facto 
the only company providing DSL connectivity in Mexico. They used to be 
owned by the government and had a complete monopoly. Although that’s 
no longer the case and the company is now privately owned, they still have 
near total control.
Mexico is a signing member of 12 separate trade treaties, the most important 
one being the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. NAFTA is 
a trilateral trade bloc between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. This 

636
Working in Mexico
means that these three countries have agreed to eliminate tariffs, quotas, 
and preferences on most goods and services between them. Whatever your 
political views on NAFTA, it does make commerce between the United States 
and Mexico slightly easier if you are looking to create an e-commerce site 
that targets Mexico, as opposed to other Latin American countries.
As for the search engines, Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Live Search have 
versions for Mexico users: google.com.mx, yahoo.com.mx, and msn.
com.mx. In fact, Google has a version for almost every Latin American coun-
try, including google.com.ar (Argentina), google.com.co (Colombia), 
google.com.pe (Peru), google.com.ec (Ecuador), google.cl (Chile), 
and so on.
 
For keyword research, you would be wise to add someone to your staff who 
both speaks Spanish and is actually from Mexico. This person can help with 
translating your Web site, pointing out cultural differences a simple transla-
tor tool might miss, and helping you effectively target your market.
You might also want to dip a toe into the YouTube (www.youtube.com) 
pool. Mexico and Brazil are the biggest consumers of YouTube in the world, 
and you have plenty of opportunity to connect with your users there. 
YouTube Mexico (mx.youtube.com) serves videos targeted at the Spanish-
speaking market (Figure 4-1).

Operating in Brazil
 
To take advantage of YouTube’s popularity to help promote your Web site, 
upload a few Spanish-language videos there, providing links back to your 
own site in the sidebar, and see where it takes you. This can be a very effec-
tive tool in marketing your brand and reaching a completely new audience.
Operating in Brazil
Brazil has the largest Internet population of any country in Latin America, 
with a total of 33 million users at last count. But this is a country of 186 mil-
lion people, so less than 20 percent of Brazil’s population is online. But, in 
recent years, the increased number of fixed telephone lines, cell phones, 
broadband access, and economic stability has afforded more Brazilians the 
opportunity to be online.
There is a high Internet usage among the upper and middle class in Brazil. 
Even with only 20 percent of the population online, a large number of people 
with purchasing power are online.
The Brazilian Internet Steering Committee has a survey about Internet usage 
in Brazil online. The full survey is available at www.cetic.br/publicacoes/
index.htm, in both English and Portuguese. The survey reports that 75 
percent of online users actively use search engines. The main searched-for 
categories include entertainment, jobs, health, and travel. This is a useful 
survey to look up when you’re starting to figure out your keywords.
Brazil is also one of the nine countries where Google has launched a local 
version of YouTube. As we mentioned in the Mexico section, uploading a few 
videos to this video-sharing site with links back to your Web pages can get 
you attention and bring you more traffic.
Orkut (www.orkut.com) (Figure 4-2) is the most popular social media site 
in Brazil. It’s run by Google, and the majority of users are from Brazil. The 
initial target market for Orkut was the United States, but the majority of its 
users are in Brazil and India.
As of May 2008, 53.86 percent of Orkut’s users are from Brazil. Using social 
media helps you be where your potential customers are, develop relation-
ships, and promote brand awareness for your site, so it might be worth 
checking out. Search-engine wise, Google is still the most popular. Yahoo! 
and MSN are up-and-comers.
Here are some other things to keep in mind while operating in Brazil:
 
✦ Do not just translate your ads into Portuguese. Take into account local-
isms and slang.

638

✦ Provide multiple payment systems, using both credit cards and Boleto, 
which is a local bank invoicing system.
 
✦ If you are running an e-commerce site, be aware of high taxes and duties 
that Brazil requires. Hire someone well-versed in Brazilian commerce 
legal issues to help you out.

Discovering Argentina
Argentina is another Spanish-speaking Latin American country with a large 
online population. The number of Internet users in the country has been 
estimated at 16 million in 2007. As of 2008, among the seven million PCs 
registered in Argentina, the number of residential and business computers 
connected to Internet totaled about 3.3 million, 92 percent of which were 
connected via broadband access to the Internet. Those without access to a 
PC at home make usage of Internet cafes called locutorios, so even those who 
don’t own computers may still have online access.
The most popular search engines in Argentina are Google at google.com.
ar and Yahoo! at yahoo.com.ar, with Microsoft Live Search not really reg-
istering on the radar.

Book IX
Chapter 4

639
Discovering Argentina
Google also powers the following Argentinean search engines: Ubbi at www.
buscador.clarin.com, Terra at www.terra.com.ar, and Uol at www.
terra.com.ar.
Google also powers Grippo (www.grippo.com.ar), an Argentinean direc-
tory of Web sites, as shown in Figure 4-3.
There are also regional differences in language in Argentina. Argentinean 
Spanish is closer in pronunciation to Italian, and they have a very dis-
tinct accent because of it. Italian is the second-most spoken language in 
Argentina, followed by German. In Argentinean Spanish, they also incorpo-
rate the usage of the pronoun “vos,” instead of “tu,” which is the informal 
“you.” Only a few other Spanish-speaking countries use “vos,” including El 
Salvador and Honduras.
 
As we always recommend, if you’re going to go international and target spe-
cific countries, do hire someone from that country who can help you out 
with the language and cultural differences. Having someone who knows the 
ins and outs of the language and culture on your side makes expanding into 
the international market a whole lot smoother for everyone involved.

P
aid search marketing (placing ads on a search engine results page, or 
SERP) and search engine optimization (SEO) are two different things, 
but they can work together, hand in hand. SEO focuses on moving your Web 
pages up in the organic search results, which are the Web pages that the 
search engine finds most naturally relevant to a user’s search terms. The 
goal of SEO is to make your Web pages appear on the search results pages 
for certain search terms, so you can attract the right kind of people to your 
site. But there’s another, quicker way to get your listing on a search results 
page: You can buy an ad.
In this chapter, you discover how to use paid search ads to your advan-
tage. You find out how to use them as a shortcut to get placed in the search 
engines. You also discover how they can assist your SEO efforts by letting 
you test keywords (the search terms your Web page is most relevant to) on 
a trial basis. It takes time and effort to make a Web page support a certain 
keyword strongly enough that the search engines recognize that page and 
bring it up in the rankings. Paid search marketing lets you “try out” a key-
word first to make sure it’s worth the work.
 
In this chapter, we use a different convention for discussing keywords and 
searches. Because paid search has its own syntax, the practice of delineat-
ing keyword phrases in square brackets won’t work here. Therefore, we 
switch, for just this one chapter, to using braces like this: {keyword} instead 
of square brackets like this: [keyword]. We make the change because in 
Google AdWords, inputting a keyword in square bracket means that you’re 
looking for an exact match (much like using quotation marks in Google’s 
regular search.) Why is it different? Who knows? The mind of Google works 
in mysterious ways.

Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
The most common business model for search engine ads is pay per click 
(PPC), in which advertisers pay the search engine each time someone clicks 
their ad. Clicking a PPC ad takes the user to a particular page on the adver-
tiser’s Web site selected by the advertiser (unlike organic listings, where 
the search engines choose the page they think is most appropriate). PPC 
ads appear at the top or side of a SERP and are labeled as Paid Listings, 
Sponsored Links, Sponsored Listings, or Featured Listings. Figure 1-1 shows 
Google’s SERP for the search query {Mustang hubcaps}, which includes PPC 
ads (they use the term Sponsored Links) both above and to the right of the 
organic results. In terms of page layout, Google AdWords alternates between 
the top one, two, or three advertisers appearing above the organic listings, 
only one top advertiser appearing above the organic listings, and all paid 
advertising on the right column. This is a random cycle and an advertiser 
cannot specify in which layout they would like to have their ads appear.

Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
You should consider using paid search advertising in addition to your SEO 
activities as part of your overall search marketing strategy. For example, 
if you would like to attract more muscle car business to your classic car 
customization Web site, you could use PPC ads as a testing ground for differ-
ent keyword phrases. You could set one up for {muscle car customization}, 
another for {hot rod customization}, another for {pony car customization}, 
and so forth. Then you could track what kind of traffic you received for each 
keyword/ad combination and compare the results. Remember, it’s not just 
numbers you’re after — you want to know which keywords bring in people 
who are truly interested in what your Web site has to offer and actually end 
up converting. Conversion data is key to PPC advertising — without know-
ing how well you convert visitors to customers, you have no way to measure 
if your PPC campaign is generating a positive return on investment (ROI). 
Conversion data is key because it tells you who is converting versus who is 
clicking through. Click-through data only tells you who is coming to your site 
and not what is giving you money.
PPC ads give you a relatively quick and easy way to experiment so that you 
can apply the lessons learned to your main Web site optimization, too. Here 
are some reasons to use PPC ads:
 
✦ Immediate results: PPC ads give you a way to get your Web page on 
the front page of SERPs almost instantly. You may or may not get traffic 
through your ad, but either way, you have instant feedback.
 
✦ Qualified visitors: Because your ad only appears when users enter a 
specific search query of your choosing, people clicking your ad should 
already want what you have to offer. This should make them highly 
qualified traffic to your site.
 
✦ Keyword research: PPC makes a great keyword testing ground. With 
PPC ads, you can try out different keywords to see which ones attract 
the most visitors and make the best “bait” for the kind of traffic you 
want. You’re interested in data, and PPC gives you data quickly that you 
can analyze.
 
✦ Conversion testing: You can test what kind of traffic a keyword and ad 
bring to your site by paying particular attention to their conversion rate 
(the percentage of site visitors who actually buy, sign up, subscribe, 
register, or do whatever action your site wants people to do). You don’t 
just want hordes of visitors; you want people who give you conversions. 
The flexibility of PPC lets you change ads at will, so it’s an easy way to 
test the market.
All of the major search engines give you reports and ways to track your ad’s 
effectiveness. To do PPC properly, you must tag your pages (insert HTML 
programming code provided by the search engine) to track everyone who 

646
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
comes to your site through a PPC ad, from clicking the ad to landing on your 
site and all the way to exiting. This detail helps you analyze the effective-
ness of each PPC ad. It also helps you find weaknesses in your Web site. For 
instance, you can track users through your site’s conversion funnel (the path 
users follow to accomplish a conversion on your site). If you find that very 
few visitors can get past a particular page and on to the next step, it may 
be that your signposts to take action on that page are unclear, or that some 
other improvement is needed. (Find much more on tracking conversions in 
Book VIII, Chapter 2.)
Third-party PPC analytics tools are available that can help you measure 
and analyze your paid search ads. If you’re running campaigns on multiple 
search engines, it might be a good idea to invest in a software package like 
this because it can track activity from all of your ad campaigns and iden-
tify for every conversion the search engine ad where it originated. Google 
AdWords provides much of this data on its own, or you can install one of 
many analytics products that we cover in Book VII.
No matter which tool you use, the important thing is to set up analytics on 
your site and track how effective your PPC ads are after users get to your 
site. Know what your metric is for conversion and revenue: Is it a purchase, 
a sign-up, a subscription, or something else, and how much average revenue 
do you generate per conversion? Watch what your visitors do once they 
arrive at your site. PPC pairs very well with analytics because everything 
can be tracked and quantified in terms of dollars spent and dollars earned. 
Analyze your data and make sure your return on investment (ROI) makes 
sense. If you’re spending $200 in PPC ads to bring in $100 of sales, that 
doesn’t add up. With PPC, you can find and adjust for problems like this 
quickly if you’re really watching your analytics.
Like any advertising campaign, PPC takes 
money. If your Web site sells products with 
very low markup or a narrow profit margin, or if 
you’re a non-profit organization, PPC might not 
be for you. You must be able to track dollars 
spent and dollars earned to justify and manage 
a PPC campaign. If you can’t put a monetary 
value on your conversions, how will you know 
what your return on investment is? PPC makes 
the most sense for online businesses that 
have products or services for sale. Then you 
can track the extra visitors brought in by your 
PPC ad, see how many of them converted, and 
count the dollars earned.
The only exception to this is Web sites that 
generate income from traffic. If you have a 
Web site that gets paid X dollars for each visi-
tor (or a set number of visitors) and you spend 
Y dollars in PPC advertising to get those visitors 
there, make sure that X>Y.

You can also use your analytics to compare different keywords that you’re 
thinking about optimizing your Web site for. ROI may only provide part of 
the picture; also look at data like how many people go beyond the landing 
page (the initial page the ad link brings a visitor to) into your site for each 
keyword, by looking at bounce rate and average page views.
Through the use of a cookie (small file stored on the user’s computer), your 
analytics package can also track how many times a user returns to your site, 
and what those return visits lead to. These factors can be just as important 
as an initial-visit conversion rate when determining which keywords to opti-
mize your Web site for long-term. You can use your PPC ads as a fertile test-
ing soil for the data you need to make educated keyword decisions for your 
organic SEO.
If you decide that PPC ads are worth a try, the next decision you need to 
make is what keywords to advertise on. Keywords in a PPC campaign are 
just as important as in an SEO campaign. Making sure you’re bidding on key-
words that people are searching for is critical to your PPC success. Bidding 
on the wrong keywords leads to frustration and wastes your hard-earned 
time and money.
To help choose the right keywords for your PPC ads, some research is in 
order. The same keyword-selection principles we’ve described elsewhere 
(particularly in Book II) will help you here, such as knowing your target audi-
ence, brainstorming a keyword list, researching top-ranked sites for those 
keywords, and analyzing your competitors’ sites to see how they’re attract-
ing searchers. The keyword research and log file analytic tools mentioned in 
Books II and VIII are available to let you see exactly what terms were used by 
the searcher. These are great resources for finding Long Tail keywords that 
may lead to conversions and for helping you to understand what terms your 
audience might be using.
You should also run your proposed PPC keywords through the Google 
AdWords Keyword tool (go to https://adwords.google.com/ and click 
Get Keyword Ideas). Figure 1-2 shows the Google Keyword tool. You can edit 
this by clicking the Edit link if you need to target a new location.
 
If you already have a PPC campaign up and running, you have the choice to 
generate additional keyword ideas by using Existing Keyword, which popu-
lates a list with the terms that you are using and allows you to choose one of 
the terms to find similar terms that you may be missing.

648
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
 
Figure 1-2: 
The Google 
AdWords 
Keyword 
tool lets you 
evaluate 
keywords 
for PPC.
 
If you select the Website Content radio button under How Would You Like 
to Generate Keyword Ideas?, the Keyword tool scans your Web site for what 
Google feels are relevant terms. This is a great tool to find keywords that 
naturally have a higher Quality Score (QS), which Google uses to set the bid 
price of a keyword based on the quality and relevance of the landing page, 
because the relevance is already determined by Google. You still have to be 
sure that the term is a marketable term with your audience, however.
When you click the Get Keyword Ideas button, Google displays a long list of 
related and synonymous keywords for your consideration, complete with 
statistics. As shown in Figure 1-3, the list shows you approximately how 
often each keyword is searched and some month-by-month data. Using the 
pull-down menu, you can choose to view other columns such as how much 
advertiser competition there is for each suggested keyword. Clicking on the 
descriptive phrases button brings up a box for you to enter all of your key-
words or new keyword ideas.
 
Don’t make the mistake of choosing the highest volume keywords just 
because you think they’ll bring in the most traffic. High volume keywords are 
broad and general and tend to attract visitors that are only researching and 
not ready to purchase. This means you are using your advertising budget on 
researchers instead of purchasers. These keywords may be hot for search-
ing, but advertising on them can burn you if you’re not careful, especially 
because you’re paying for every click. It’s better to select transaction-based 
keyword phrases that you know will convert at the start, even if they aren’t 
searched for very often.

to help 
you select

keywords.
 
Also be aware that the list of related and suggested keywords Google shows 
you (like the one in Figure 1-3) is the same list your competitors see for the 
same keywords. You might find that those keywords have a low ROI because 
the PPC price is steep and the clicks are already spread too thinly. Run 
searches to find out who’s already bidding on those keyword phrases and 
how many competing ads there are. Keep thinking outside the main keyword 
list, looking for creative ways to bring in more traffic with a high conversion 
rate. Try to find good, conversion-producing keywords that your competi-
tors haven’t thought of yet. This is also a good place to start building your 
negative keyword list. A negative keyword list is made up of the words that 
you do not want your ads to show up for. If you see terms on the generated 
list that make no sense to you or are definitely not terms you want associ-
ated with your product, add them to your negative keyword list.
After you’ve determined the keywords you want to bid on, you need to 
decide which type of keyword matching to use. For example, if your targeted 
keyword is {customize a car}, do you want your ad to appear only when that 
exact phrase is searched? Or do you want it to be a bit looser? You can fine-
tune your keyword matching to target your ad to the right users.
When you place your PPC ads, you can choose between the following match 
types. Most vendors offer similar match types to those offered by Google; 
we’ve noted differences in the following list where they exist:

650
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
 
✦ Broad match: Broad match allows your ad to show up for your keyword 
phrase along with plural or singular forms, synonyms, and other rel-
evant variations. So your ad may show up for all of the following queries: 
{customize a car}, {custom car}, {car customizing}, {auto customiza-
tion}, {customize a vehicle}, {customizing an old car}, and so on.
 
 Broad is Google’s default match type, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best 
choice. You could spend your entire PPC budget quickly with broad 
match turned on if you didn’t put filters in place because it causes your 
ad to display more often, but not necessarily to the right people. (Note: 
In Yahoo!, broad match is called Advanced Match Type.)
 
 To keep a broad match from bringing in unqualified traffic, you should also 
put filters in place that exclude inapplicable words from a user’s query. See 
the bullet labeled “Negative (or excluded) keywords” later in this list.
 
✦ Phrase match: In Google, a phrase match type causes the ad to appear 
whenever a user’s query includes your keyword phrase and possibly 
other terms that appear before or after your keywords (but not in 
between). For instance, if your keyword is {Ford Mustang}, Google could 
display your ad for {1984 Ford Mustang} as well. Microsoft adCenter 
offers the same Phrase Match ability. (Yahoo! does not offer an equiva-
lent to phrase match.)
 
✦ Exact match: Exact match is the most restrictive match type. Your ad 
can only appear to users who type in the exact keyword phrase, with no 
additions or changes. As we mentioned, in Google AdWords, you mark 
an exact match by putting the keywords in square brackets. (Yahoo! 
calls this Standard Match and it includes exact matches to your key-
words plus singular/plural variations and common misspellings.)
 
✦ Negative (or excluded) keywords: The search engines give you a way 
to narrow your search traffic by also excluding words that someone 
might type. Because you don’t want to pay for clicks from people who 
clearly aren’t interested in what you’re offering, use this feature for 
keywords with multiple meanings. In Google, you’d use negative key-
words to remove irrelevant words. In Yahoo!, you’d use their Excluded 
Words feature to accomplish the same thing. For example, if a keyword 
is {Mustang}, you could exclude searches that also contain the word 
{horses}. In this example, an advertiser must be careful in consider-
ing whether this may exclude persons searching on the term {Mustang 
horse power} if it is important to them. In this case, you would use 
{horses} as a negative term, but allow {horse}. Sometimes it can become 
Catch-22 situation. Be sure to think of all the possible queries that might 
contain your keywords plus all the other words that wouldn’t pertain to 
your site at all and block those extra words.
If you are just starting a PPC campaign, Broad match or Phrase match are 
probably better places to start as they allow you more visibility and allow 
you to capture more keyword phrases leading to possible new search terms. 

Book X
Chapter 1

Search Marketing
651
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
With Exact match, you get results only if your audience searches for exactly 
what you use, giving you no extra keyword data to work with. We recom-
mend starting with Phrase match. You can always A/B test against Broad 
and Exact matches to find what converts best. For more on A/B testing, see 
Book VIII, Chapter 3.
Another decision you need to make is what search engine to place your PPC 
ads on. Which search engine will provide the most effective market for you? 
Google is an obvious first choice because they command more than 60 per-
cent of all Internet searches. However, remember that you’re after qualified 
traffic — the searchers who want what your site offers enough to click your 
ad, arrive at your site, and then convert. Here is some information to help 
you select your PPC vendor of choice:
 
✦ Google AdWords (http://adwords.google.com/): Google AdWords 
gives your ad the biggest potential viewing audience because Google 
has the largest percentage of search traffic. Besides appearing on all 
searches powered by Google, your ad will also show up on searches 
run through AOL, Ask.com, EarthLink, and NYTimes.com. Beyond that, 
Google’s Content Network option enables your ad to go even further, 
including to searches run in other countries. Be warned, however, that 
the Content Network should be used for branding only and is usually not 
a good producer of conversions in most cases. Many users have devel-
oped “banner blindness” and aren’t likely to click on ads appearing on 
a Web site, so you should take advantage of that to instill name recogni-
tion through repetition instead.
 
✦ Yahoo! Search Marketing (http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com): 
With the second largest total search market share, Yahoo! is another 
good option for mass ad appeal, especially if you know that your audi-
ence fits the Yahoo! user demographic. (The typical Yahoo! user is older 
than the average Google user, as an example.)
 
✦ Microsoft adCenter (https://adcenter.microsoft.com/): 
Microsoft Live Search ranks third in total number of Internet searches. 
Although it has a smaller share of the market, Microsoft’s paid search 
product, adCenter, is worth checking out. adCenter is currently the only 
search engine to allow ad targeting by demographics (user data such as 
gender, age, and so on). Because of this capability, studies have shown 
that a well-targeted ad has a much higher ROI on Microsoft adCenter 
than on Google AdWords or Yahoo! Search Marketing.
 
✦ Others: If your industry has a specialized search engine, the traffic it 
attracts could provide a rich concentration of people interested in your 
Web site. You need to know who that search engine is reaching to make 
sure it’s worth your investment. But if the demographics fit your Web 
site, you could mine that traffic with a PPC ad and watch your conver-
sion rate grow.

Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
When you sign up for a PPC ad campaign, either in Google or other engines, 
you can control many variables. The primary items you’re asked to specify are
 
✦ Keywords: You select the keywords (search terms) that cause your ad 
to display. The engines also let you group your keywords to make them 
easier for you to manage. Organize your various PPC keywords in a way 
that makes the most sense for how you want to budget your advertising 
dollars.
 
✦ Daily budget: To help you control your ad campaign’s costs, you can 
set a maximum total amount you’re willing to spend per day. The search 
engine keeps track of how many times your ads are clicked and stops 
displaying your ads when the budget is reached.
 
✦ Delivery method: This is something that is specific to Google only. Make 
sure your campaign settings are set correctly. The defaults in Google 
AdWords are designed to be the most profitable for Google. Using the 
default delivery method means that Google shows the ads as quickly 
as possible. For example, say that out of 100,000 possible impressions, 
your budget only allows you 1,000 click-throughs a day. If you have a 
high click-through rate, you exhaust your budget early in the day and 
your ad doesn’t show in the evening. You can set the delivery method in 
Google AdWords to appear throughout the day based upon your budget. 
This means you can choose to run your ads later in the day and in the 
evening. Two of the advantages of running later in the day is that your 
competition may run out of click-throughs and not show up during those 
hours, and the cost-per-click is less expensive because of less competi-
tion. For more control over your spending, you can set your delivery 
method to Standard to spread your ads over the hours you are advertis-
ing. With Accelerated delivery, your budget is used earlier in the day, 
and you are left without ad presence for the rest of the day.
 
✦ Maximum cost per click (CPC): You set the maximum cost that can be 
charged per click for each keyword you bid on. Here’s where the com-
petition heats up because different people bidding on the same keyword 
can be awarded better placement or more impressions (times the ad 
appears in search results to users) partially based on who had the high-
est CPC bid. With highly competitive keywords, it’s not uncommon for 
advertisers to check and adjust their CPCs multiple times a day.
 
✦ The ad itself: You specify the ad title (the top line, which displays in a 
larger font), descriptive text (which shows in the middle two lines), and 
the URLs. When you create an ad, you have two URLs to consider: a dis-
play URL (which is what is displayed with the ad) and a destination URL 
(which is the actual URL used to link to the landing page). The display 
URL can be as simple as the home page to your ad (such as www.classic
carcustomization.com) or may include keywords even if it’s not a 
real URL (www.classiccarcustomization.com/Mustang). If you 
do use a fake URL, be sure to use a 301 redirect to transfer it to the real 
landing page. The display URL can be a great tool in increasing conver-
sion as it helps attract attention. A typical PPC ad is shown in Figure 1-4.

Figure 1-4: 
A typical 
PPC ad on 
Google.
 
You can give the search engine a single ad, but remember that PPC is 
your testing ground. You can provide two (or more) ad versions for each 
keyword. So you might have two versions of your PPC ad for the keyword 
phrase {customize a car}:
Customize your car
Restore your vehicle with our
classic car customization services.
www.classiccarcustomization.com
Customize a classic car
Restore your car to mint condition
with expert customization services.
www.classiccarcustomization.com
When you provide several versions of an ad, the search engine rotates them. 
If you use the Optimize setting, Google automatically compares the effective-
ness of each ad version by the number of click-throughs (people clicking the 
ad and going to your site) as well as the bounce rate (percentage of users 
who click the ad but then click right back to the results page, obviously not 
finding what they were after). Then they start automatically favoring the 
“most effective” (as defined by Google based on click-throughs) version, dis-
playing that ad more frequently to maximize your campaign. Although that 
sounds good, remember that the search engine’s definition of “most effec-
tive” and yours may not be the same.
 
Google is interested in click-throughs because that’s what makes them 
money. But you’re more interested in conversions because that’s what 
makes you money. For this reason, we suggest you use the Rotate setting 
instead of Optimize and run no more than two versions of an ad at a time. 
The Rotate setting forces Google to give your two ads equal time. This lets 
you do a true A/B test to get clear conversion data, and then control which 
ad is shown more, based on your own site results. (Book VIII covers testing 
in more detail, if you want to find out more.)
Writing and testing the ad
Your ad itself needs to contain a call to action, which is an instruction writ-
ten with an imperative (or command form) verb such as buy, sell, trade, 
grow, expand, or as in our sample ads shown previously, restore. Your call 
to action should lead the user to do something by including a brief benefit 
statement, if possible. So in the previous example, the phrase “Restore your 

654
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
car to mint condition” contains both an imperative phrase — “Restore your 
car” — that tells the user to do something, as well as a compelling reason 
why to do it — to bring your car “to mint condition.”
In writing and testing ads, sometimes a one-word change can make a signifi-
cant difference in clickthrough rate (CTR) and conversions. For instance, the 
phrases “bargain prices” and “discount prices” can actually have different 
effects on different consumers. Just because one phrase works for a specific 
group of keywords does not mean it will work for all your keyword groups. 
Test for each group and use the results for each group separately. You may 
end up using “bargain” for some keyword groups and “discount” for others.
 
Here’s another trick you can use to help your ad stand out — use your key-
words in your ad. You want to do this because the search engines automati-
cally bold the user’s keywords on the search results page. Hence, your ad is 
more eye-catching.
Preparing the landing page
When writing your PPC ads, never lose sight of the landing page where users 
end up when they click. Your ad sets up a particular expectation in the 
user’s mind — make sure that your landing page lives up to it by giving them 
what you advertised. If the ad is about restoring your car to mint condition, 
the landing page should focus on that in the title and text. Also include your 
keyword phrase on the page.
 
Every PPC landing page must be customized for the keyword and theme, so 
you generally need a different landing page for each keyword group. Finding 
out what needs customizing is all part of why you are running the A/B test. 
Even if you are promoting complementary products, do not use the same 
landing page for different groups of products. Instead, send prospects to 
individually designed landing pages.
 
Pictures can be worth a thousand words. Consider using engagement 
objects such as graphics or other engaging rich media (pictures, video, 
audio, and so on) to grab the user’s attention and help sell your product or 
service. For example, your landing page for “Restore your car to mint condi-
tion” could show before-and-after photos of an old jalopy transformed to a 
gleaming beauty.
Most importantly, you want your landing page to contain a clear call to 
action that instructs the prospective customer to do exactly what you want 
them to do. If you want them to call you for a quote, list your phone number 
and provide instructions several times (“Call us Monday–Friday from 8:00 to 
5:00 PST at 1 (800) 555-0100”). Repeat the phone number in bold text in your 
page content. The call to action and the action itself (like the button that 
must be clicked to proceed) should appear “above the fold” in the immedi-
ately viewable window (as opposed to below the fold, which would require 
scrolling the window to view) as well as other strategic places.

Book X
Chapter 1
Discovering Paid

655
Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
Test your landing pages until you find a clear winner. When testing, you can 
send an identical ad to each landing page and compare the conversion rates 
for each page. Limit testing to two or three pages at one time for a specific 
keyword group. Other A/B comparisons can include copy length, layout, 
image size, call to action, and pricing. Remember that PPC gives you an 
ideal testing ground, so don’t be afraid to tweak everything and track all the 
results until you find your winning combinations.
 
Again, just because a landing page is more successful for one group of key-
words does not mean that it is the right landing page for your entire PPC 
campaign. Each group of keywords needs to have its own testing and results 
for that group. You may end up with a different landing page that is most 
successful for each of your keyword groups.
Figuring out ad pricing
To help you determine what your maximum CPC bid should be, the search 
engines give you an estimator tool. Figure 1-5 shows Yahoo’s estimator 
tool, which can be found at http://sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/
searchenginemarketing/marketingcost.php. Enter the keyword in 
the first box and use the slider to set your proposed budget in the second 
box; click the Calculate button.

Figure 1-6 shows Google’s version of the same tool, which lets you com-
pare multiple keywords at once. You can access this tool even without 
an AdWords account at https://adwords.google.com/select/
TrafficEstimatorSandbox. (Once you have a Google AdWords account, 
you can run this report from inside your account.) Be aware: The estimated 
CPC is based on system-wide use of the keyword. The CPC might actually be 
much lower based on geographic targeting. In rare cases, it might actually be 
more. Google does not give figures based on specific geographic targeting.

When you set up a PPC ad, you don’t need to commit to the search engine’s 
recommended maximum bid amount. You might want to start with it to get 
a benchmark, but then change your bid on a regular basis to find out what 
amount brings you the best results in terms of traffic and conversions. The 
key behind PPC is to test, test, test.
Keep in mind that the search engine’s recommended bid spans a 24-hour 
day, which may be wrong for your ad. A feature called day parting allows 
you to specify when during the day your ad is shown. Google calls this fea-
ture Ad Scheduling. For example, if your target audience is preteens, you 
probably won’t get much activity (that is, searches on your keyword and 
click-throughs) on weekdays when students are in school, compared to the 
after-school hours each weekday.

Harnessing the Value of Paid Search
 
If you keep your ad displaying 24 hours a day, your ad might rank well in the 
off hours, but during the heavy search times when your competitors show 
their ads, yours may drop off the SERP altogether. In that case, you’re better 
off using day parting to restrict your ad to peak search times and possibly 
raising your maximum bid to be more competitive if this is a good convert-
ing time. Also, one factor that consistently affects how much you pay is the 
keyword’s competitiveness. The more people are competing for the same 
keyword, the higher the price is just to get in the game.
It’s important to remember to use analytics data to compute your return on 
investment (ROI) for each keyword. If a keyword makes you a certain amount 
of profit, your total cost including your PPC ad fee cannot be more than that 
profit or you’re going to end up losing money.
You can’t control precisely where your PPC ad shows up on a SERP. There’s 
a ranking system involved in PPC. In the old days, it was simple: The highest 
bidder got the top spot. Today, all the major search engines use a formula to 
determine which PPC ads to display and in what order, and maximum CPC is 
only one of the factors.
Google has developed a formula for assessing a PPC ad’s relevance to a 
user’s query, which they call the keyword’s Quality Score. According to 
Google AdWords Help (http://adwords.google.com/support), Quality 
Score is “a dynamic variable calculated for each of your keywords.” Each 
time a user searches for keywords that have PPC ads, Google calculates the 
Quality Scores afresh and uses those scores plus the ads’ maximum CPC 
bids to determine each ad’s SERP position. Quality Score is an algorithm that 
takes into account many factors, including
 
✦ CTR: Google tracks the ad’s historical click-through ratio (CTR) (per-
centage of clicks per ad impressions, or CTR) for that keyword and the 
matched ad. This is a big quality factor for Google because they make 
money on your ad only if people click it.
 
 To raise your CTR, make your ads as compelling as possible for your 
target audience. You should also consider using geotargeting (specifying 
the geographic area where your ad will display) or day parting to narrow 
your ad’s exposure, but only if doing so increases your CTR without 
negatively impacting your bottom line.
 
✦ Account history: The combined CTR of all the ads and keywords in your 
PPC campaign plays a role.
 
 You can improve this factor by watching your account and eliminating 
ads that historically have very few click-throughs. One exception to this 
rule is an ad with a low CTR but a really high conversion rate. You’d 
want to keep that ad in place because it translates into a very nice ROI 
(that is, low cost per conversion).

658
Making SEO and Pay Per Click Work Together
 
✦ Relevance: Google evaluates how relevant the ads it displays are to 
the searcher. They compare the search query to the keyword and the 
ad and look at how relevant the keyword is to the ad text, as well as to 
the rest of the ads in your ad group (one or more ads that target a set of 
keywords, which you group). Google also compares the relevance to the 
landing page (that is, does the keyword appear on the landing page text 
in a relevant manner?).
 
 To maximize the relevance of your ads, make sure that you choose 
keywords that are relevant to your site (actually used on your site) and 
also use them in your ads. Beyond that, you can boost your relevance 
quotient by creating ad groups of related terms, categorizing them by 
product type, brand, or some other method that helps you match ads 
and keywords with landing pages.
 
✦ Landing page and site quality: Google gives higher ranking to sites they 
decide are better quality in terms of original content, navigability, and 
so forth. Applying your best Webmaster practices and fleshing out your 
site with lots of good content helps you with this.
Your Quality Score affects where your ad is positioned in the Sponsored 
Links search results, as well as how much you pay for your PPC ads on 
Google. As Google says, “The higher a keyword’s Quality Score, the lower its 
cost-per-clicks (CPCs) and the better its ad position,” compared to competi-
tors with the same bid. Google wants to place the most useful links in front 
of their users, so it makes sense that they wouldn’t let advertisers simply 
buy their way to the top. The better your ad performs, the higher your 
Quality Score is.
Making SEO and Pay Per Click Work Together
Web site owners may work on SEO to rank organically or they may purchase 
ads, but they often don’t do both at the same time. The fact is, it’s not an 
either/or proposition. PPC ads can work in conjunction with SEO to comple-
ment and strengthen your search marketing plan.
Remember that with SEO, ranking is not the end goal — what you’re really 
after is traffic to your site that leads to conversions. And PPC provides 
another way to lay out a welcome mat that brings many new visitors to your 
site. At this point, it’s a good idea to evaluate your home front. You need to 
make sure your Web site is prepared to receive those visitors.
As we mentioned in the last section, pay careful attention to your landing 
pages. They provide the first impression of your site for everyone who clicks 
one of your ads. Each landing page needs to look appropriately clean and 
professional (for your subject and industry). Every industry is different, so 
make sure you adhere to your industry’s standards. What might look profes-
sional in one company might be inappropriate for another. More importantly, 

Book X
Chapter 1
Discovering Paid 
Search Marketing
659
Making SEO and Pay Per Click Work Together
your landing page needs to meet the visitor’s expectations because that 
person is going to decide in about two seconds whether your Web page has 
what they’re looking for. Put yourself in the user’s shoes, and make sure that 
the page delivers what the user is after, based on the search query and your 
ad text.
Your landing page must also get your user to convert with clearly marked 
instructions that make it easy to follow whatever action is desired on your 
site. Make sure that your call to action appears “above the fold.” You would 
be surprised how many people still do not understand the concept of scroll-
ing down a page or how to use a menu. People are much more likely to con-
vert if the page they land on gives them exactly what they hoped to find and 
lays out a simple way to accomplish what they want to do.
 
Of equal importance is your site navigability (link structure for moving 
around the site). Make it very easy for users to get around your site after 
they arrive at your landing page. Sometimes a site may look nice, but it 
doesn’t contain a clear path to guide users where they need to go. In particu-
lar, you want your visitors to be able to get to the conversion point easily, 
whether that’s your checkout process, sign-up form, or some other type of 
conversion page.
For searchers who are just in the information-gathering stage, it’s equally 
important for the landing page to provide links to related pages where they 
can read about your subjects in more detail. You can keep those searchers 
on your site by helping them gather the information they need at this stage 
and hopefully move them to the next step that could potentially lead to con-
version. The easier you make it for your users to cross the finish line from 
anywhere in your site, the better.
Complete market coverage with SEO and PPC
You can think of the search engine results pages (SERPs) as real estate. You 
want your Web page to be in the Page One neighborhood, where there are 
10 main “lots” for organic results. The organic results are not for sale, but in 
the margins above and to the side of those 10 lots, space is available that is 
for sale.
For your main keywords, you want your Web page to show up in the results. 
If you can claim one of the top 10 organic spots, great! If you can show up in 
the margins with a PPC ad, that’s good, too. If you can do both, you’re taking 
up lots of visible real estate on the page — and denying that much real 
estate to your competitors at the same time.
But there are other reasons to want to show up in both places. Studies show 
that when your ad appears with your organic listing on the same page, the 
click-through rate skyrockets. What’s surprising is that people are far more 
likely to click your organic listing if they see your ad on the page as well.

660
Making SEO and Pay Per Click Work Together
You can also target different types of users with the two different types of 
listings, based on their intent. You can classify these types of intent-based 
searches as follows:
 
✦ Information-based search: People looking for information are doing 
research. They may still be early in the purchase process and just 
educating themselves. Or they could be gathering information for an 
academic purpose or other types of research. These queries tend to be 
broad and more generic, like {muscle cars} or {classic Mustangs}.
 
✦ Transaction-based search: Searchers who are shopping or are ready to 
buy perform transactional searches. These searches tend to use more 
specific queries, such as {customizing a 1950 Ford Mustang} or {prices 
for classic Ford Mustangs}.
Ideally, you want your Web site — and your SERP listings — to appeal to 
both types of intent-based searchers. The most obvious reason is to bring 
in more traffic. But keep in mind that consumers move through these two 
stages in a cycle. Today’s informational searcher becomes tomorrow’s more 
educated buyer. You want to serve their needs at both points.
Information-based searchers tend to choose organic listings almost exclu-
sively. People doing a transactional search, however, are likely to click 
paid listings. So your PPC ad with its marketing-friendly copy can attract 
these ready-to-buy consumers, whereas your organic listing appeals to the 
researchers in the crowd. By having both types of listings on the SERP, 
you’re attracting both types of searchers.
 
Google AdWords tracks clicks that come through a clicked ad with a 30-day 
cookie so today’s informational searcher can still be tracked and identified 
by the original PPC query when they later convert with a PPC ad for up to 30 
days. A cookie is a flag saying the visitor was at that site before, searching on 
a specific keyword. The cookie remembers what that search term is.
SEO and PPC have many things in common. With your SEO campaign, you’re 
trying to optimize your pages around certain keywords so that when people 
search for those keywords, the search engines find your page among the 
most authoritative. With a PPC campaign, you’re advertising so that when 
people search for certain keywords, they think your ad is perfect for their 
needs. What’s the common theme? A need for good keywords.
Before you start optimizing a page around the keyword phrase, for example, 
{antique car restoration}, you could give the keyword a test run using a 
PPC ad. You need at least a month to gather benchmark data and up to two 
months if you don’t have any PPC history. After a benchmark has been set, 
you can usually make a decision on A/B testing within a few days if enough 
data or impressions are produced. Right off the bat, however, it’s very hard 
to make an assessment with just a few days of data because you just won’t 
have enough traffic. The only way you can make an assessment after a few

Search Marketing

Making SEO and Pay Per Click Work Together
days is if you have a high volume of traffic for that test. If you don’t have a 
lot of data, you’ll have to wait until you get more. Statistically valid sample 
sizes are commonly around 10,000 impressions, although you may see clear 
patterns of behavior with far fewer counts. Intuition and experience play 
large roles here. Running an A/B test on your PPC campaigns gives you lots 
of data, such as:
 
✦ Number of impressions: You find out how many times your ad showed 
up on a search results page. This gives some indication of how often the 
keyword is searched and how competitive it is.
 
✦ Number of click-throughs: You know how many people searching on 
that keyword were interested enough to come to your site.
 
✦ Bounce rate: You find out the percentage of visitors who arrived at your 
landing page and decided it wasn’t for them. A bounce rate of less than 
50 percent is good. If it’s as high as 70 percent or more, you probably 
need to change the landing page. It needs to be more focused on what 
those searchers want, more engaging, or both.
 
✦ Conversions: You find out what those visitors did once they got to your 
site. If many of them reached conversion (by making a purchase, and so 
on), your site is doing a good job. However, if your Web site takes users 
through a three-step conversion process from landing page to qualifying 
page and then to the check-out, and you find out that you’re losing 95 
percent of the people at the second step, you know you have to make 
some changes on your site to improve your conversion funnel (the pro-
cess users go through to make a purchase or other type of conversion).
 
✦ Cost per conversion: For a bottom-line analysis, you can find out what 
your total ad costs were per conversion you received. If you spent more 
money than you made, that’s not going to be a good ad for you to con-
tinue as is, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the keyword isn’t worth 
optimizing for.
If you didn’t get very much traffic at all, it may be because the keyword 
phrase is not a good one for your site. Here’s where you need to use some 
discernment, though. Just because a keyword doesn’t get click-throughs 
on a PPC ad doesn’t mean it wouldn’t generate traffic if you had an organic 
result. It could be that the keyword is geared for information-based search-
ing, for example. In that case, people would be more likely to click an organic 
listing than a PPC ad.
 
Always remember to look at your conversions. If you have a poor CTR but 
get conversions on the few visitors you do get with the ad, it’s a good PPC 
keyword. However, low or no PPC traffic could also mean the keyword or 
the ad is a dud. Do several A/B tests with alternate ads to see if the ad or the 
keyword is the problem. To maximize your time and energy, start by focus-
ing on those keywords that have proven successful in both PPC and organic 
SEO, and let them work synergistically to bring you more traffic.

662
Supplementing Traffic with PPC
Reinforcing your brand with PPC
Paid search ads can bring in traffic, but they can give you another benefit as 
well — reinforcing your brand.
Your brand is a name or trademark that identifies your company, product, or 
service. Local businesses pay for brand advertising all the time. The neigh-
borhood Little League field displays banners of local real estate agents or 
dry cleaners who’ve sponsored them. High school drama groups and bands 
hand out programs that contain scanned business cards and logos of local 
business people who’ve paid for the privilege. These are all examples of 
advertising for the purpose of brand lift. A parent watching a tee ball game 
or a choir concert isn’t likely to pick up the phone and make a call to that 
business right then, but the ad in the program or out on the field creates an 
impression that can lead to a future call.
Similarly, just showing up on a search results page can give your brand 
some needed visibility. This is especially true if you’re trying to break into 
a business with established competitors. You want your name to show up 
somewhere, anywhere, on the primary search engine results for your main 
keywords. PPC gives you a way to shortcut that process by paying to be 
there.
When people run a search, they quickly scan the first results page and usu-
ally decide what to click within the first five seconds. Eye-tracking studies 
have found that most people see the first few organic listings and the first 
few PPC ads during those brief seconds (for more about this, see Book I, 
Chapter 3). When your brand appears either in the title, description or URL 
of a PPC ad, it has the ability to create an impression in the user’s mind link-
ing your brand to their search topic.
 
As we discussed in the previous section, your organic listing gets clicked 
much more often when people see your PPC ad on the same page. This is 
due to increased brand recognition. People feel more comfortable trusting a 
vendor who seems to have a higher visibility. If you’re showing up twice, you 
must be better, or so the logic goes.
Consider buying PPC ads for your own brand name if it’s a keyword that’s 
searched for. Your site gains visibility and you gain relevant traffic.
Supplementing Traffic with PPC
Some Web sites simply must appear in the search engines in order to get 
their businesses off the ground. But for competitive keywords, moving up 
in the organic rankings can take months. If you must appear for a keyword, 
taking out PPC ads is your answer.

Making Smart Use of Geotargeting
But while your PPC ads are running, don’t stop optimizing your site for natu-
ral SEO, either. Let your search engine rankings continue to rise while your 
PPC ads are humming along bringing in business. While you’re working on 
SEO, your PPC ads can help your cash flow.
When you’ve made it to the top of the Google heap and your organic search 
listing can stand on its own, you still should keep doing PPC. As long as 
you’re making money, don’t give up your ads.
One reason for continuing with PPC has to do with search engine real estate. 
If you’ve earned two top positions on the SERP, one for your organic listing 
and one for your PPC ad, why give up a spot that could get taken over by 
a competitor? It makes more sense to keep both results in place and cover 
more real estate on the SERP. As we explained earlier in this chapter, the 
two different types of listings attract different types of searchers, so they 
work together well to bring in more total traffic to your site.
A study done in 2005 by eMarketer revealed that more than 60 percent of 
people didn’t really understand the difference between the organic and paid 
results on a SERP. Internet searchers are getting savvier as time goes on, 
but a lot of people still don’t understand why some links show up in the 
right column versus the left. What attracts people to click one or the other 
probably has more to do with how they’re worded. That explains why the 
marketing-driven wording of a PPC ad pulls more transactional searchers, 
whereas the informational searcher tends to click the organic listings.
Making Smart Use of Geotargeting
Geotargeting provides another way to use PPC ads to increase traffic. If you 
have a local business like a bakery or a dry cleaner, the idea of advertising 
on a nationwide search engine where you could get billed for clicks from 
anywhere could send you running for cover. But what if you could limit your 
ad to display only to people in your town? By using geotargeting, you can 
capture local search traffic and searches on mobile devices such as smart 
phones within your area. So if your business is local, geotargeting lets you 
run a PPC campaign that makes sense.
All of the major search engines let you specify a city and state where you’d 
like your PPC ad to display. Google also allows a PPC ad to be linked to their 
Google Maps and searches done within Google Maps. With Google, you can 
pinpoint a custom area by plotting points on a map or even specifying how 
far something is from your store location, like a two to three mile radius 
around a pizza shop for deliveries, as shown in Figure 1-7.

You may have other marketing reasons to use geotargeting, as well. For your 
classic car customization business, you could place PPC ads in a city that 
has a big car show, advertising a show-themed discount for new customers. 
Or if you discover that a particular part of the country has a high interest in 
1950s muscle cars, you can mine that market with some geotargeted PPC ads 
for those keywords. You can also geotarget using keywords alone: for exam-
ple, {Los Angeles muscle cars} allows you to hit people using that search 
term, as well as people in Los Angeles searching on {muscle cars}.
Starting Your Seasonal Campaigns
PPC’s flexibility makes it the perfect way to handle short-term or seasonal 
advertising on the Web. For example, if you want to offer an April spring-
cleaning sale on hubcap polishing through your classic car customization 
Web site, SEO wouldn’t be the way to drum up business for it. SEO is a 
relatively slow process that moves your Web pages up in the search engine 
rankings over time, usually taking several months. However, PPC is incred-
ibly flexible. You could put PPC ads up quickly and possibly drum up a lot of 
extra traffic during your sale.

Starting Your Seasonal Campaigns
If your Web site sells products that are seasonal, use PPC ads to supplement 
your traffic. Businesses typically spend more advertising money during peak 
times anyway, so why not use some for paid search ads? By applying a few 
principles we explain in the following sections, you can make sure that your 
PPC money is well spent.
Principle #1: Start your seasonal 
campaign in advance
Timing may not be everything in advertising, but it plays a huge part. With 
seasonal PPC campaigns, the best practice is to start early. If you run a sea-
sonal business, your true buying season doesn’t line up with the holidays on 
the calendar. For Halloween sales, you might need to be selling by the end 
of summer for retail sales, and early spring if you’re a wholesaler marketing 
spooky wares to stores. (Retail refers to selling to consumers. Wholesale 
involves selling in quantity to retail businesses, for resale.) Similarly, retail 
stores set up Christmas displays two or three months in advance, so the 
Christmas wholesale buying season begins well before that.
The bottom line is this: You want your ads to be there when the shopping 
season begins. Have your PPC ads show up early before the ads crowd in 
from competitors with less forethought than you. Be one of the first ads to 
appear for a seasonal item, and you increase your chances of click-throughs 
and conversions from those early shoppers. Starting early also gives you 
time to tailor your ad and to A/B test landing pages.
Principle #2: Adjust your spending levels 
as the buying season progresses
When you first start your seasonal campaign, you don’t need to spend a lot 
of money. Keep your maximum CPC bid on the low side and set a low daily 
budget amount. Remember, the competition hasn’t heated up yet, and nei-
ther has the search traffic for your keywords. However, searching has begun, 
so this is a great time to do some testing.
 
Test several versions of ads and different keywords to find those perfect 
matches that convert well, while it’s still early in the season. Then you can 
choose the best-performing ads and have those running during the peak 
sales time.
As the buying season heats up, watch your PPC analytics closely and adjust 
your spending levels as needed, making sure that there is sufficient budget 
to last for the entire season. Consider using day parting if necessary to have 
maximum exposure during peak conversion hours each day (which are dif-
ferent for each situation). You want to maintain your placements as much 

666
Starting Your Seasonal Campaigns
as possible as more and more competitors’ ads enter the scene. However, 
never outbid at the expense of your bottom line. You don’t want to pay $5 
per click for a keyword if it pushes your ROI into the red.
If your season is tied to a holiday like Christmas or Halloween, chances are 
that sales will continue to build steeply up until a few days before the holiday, 
or whenever your cutoff date is for shipping products in time for customers 
to receive them by the holiday. At that point, you should disable the PPC ads 
you’ve been running because you don’t want to attract frantic last-minute 
shoppers who would come to your Web site only to find that you can’t deliver 
their gift or costume in time. Don’t pay for clicks that can’t convert!
 
If you still have sufficient stock leftover for an after-holiday stock reduction 
sale, you can put up new PPC ads in the days after the holiday. For an after-
Christmas sale, for example, you might want to stay up late on December 
25th so you can log on to your PPC account and activate the after-Christmas 
sale ads at midnight. Currently, Google AdWords does not have the capabil-
ity of switching ads on a schedule, so it has to be done manually.
You want to monitor your PPC analytics closely over the days following the 
holiday, too. When you see conversions start to fall off, you can stop the ads.
Principle #3: Use some of the same keywords 
your site already ranks for
Keyword selection doesn’t need to be different for your seasonal campaign. 
It’s better to advertise using the same keywords you’ve already optimized 
your site for, and just let your ad wording draw in the seasonal business. For 
one thing, your Quality Score benefits if your ad text and keywords match 
keywords used in your Web page because that increases your relevance to 
the user’s search query. Plus, you can get the advantage of more coverage 
on the search results page.
You can use your usual keywords for PPC ads even if you already rank for 
them organically (through SEO). For keywords that you haven’t ranked for 
yet, taking out a PPC ad can bring in valuable traffic that you never get any 
other way. For your high-ranking keywords, you have just as much reason 
to use PPC. If the search results page shows both your organic listing talking 
about your product and another result advertising a sale on that product, 
imagine how effectively you can bring in the traffic. Figure 1-8 shows what 
it looks like to someone interested in classic Ford Mustangs if both your 
organic listing and your PPC ad show up in Google.
Note: This figure was mocked up to reflect a possible search result for our 
fictional car customization site.

Remember, you can use keywords in the display URL even though that par-
ticular URL may not really exist, as long as the base domain matches your 
“destination” domain. Placing the keyword in a display URL gives you an 
additional place to get bolded terms in your ad and shows relevance to the 
searcher as well.

T
raditional marketing just isn’t enough to build a brand name (company 
or product name) these days. You can’t just have a good product and 
decent service, take out a yellow pages ad, print some business cards, and 
set up shop. Your marketing plan now needs to be bigger, more engaged, 
and more interactive. To build a successful brand name, you need to be 
where people will see you, hear what others say about you, and join in the 
conversation — and that’s on the Web. A good marketing plan today needs 
to consider that “word of mouth” has gone digital, and somehow tap into 
that online buzz.
Search engine optimization (SEO) gives you the skills you need to make 
sure your Web site can be seen where people search. That’s crucial because 
the majority of people coming to any Web site get there through a search 
engine. But to really grow your brand, you have to stretch beyond pure 
SEO and do some broader Internet marketing, which means to delve deeper 
into understanding your target audience and interacting with them. In this 
chapter, we discuss how you can associate your brand with other things 
that your target audience is interested in. We also cover how you can give 
your audience a voice and form a “community” online that supports your 
business goals. These are the branding activities that help you thrive in the 
world of Internet marketing.
In this chapter, you discover how to do online brand building from A to 
Z. We begin with the meat-and-potatoes of SEO, keyword selection, but 
approach it from a brand-building perspective. Then we move into creating 

670
Selecting Keywords for Branding Purposes
press releases, videos, images, and other objects that help engage the audi-
ence members you need to attract. Last but not least, we take you into the 
brave new world of social media (Internet sites that enable people to share 
and discuss information and build relationships, like Facebook, Twitter, or 
Digg). You find out how you can use blogging and the many available social 
media outlets to monitor and manage your reputation and build a commu-
nity at the same time.
Selecting Keywords for Branding Purposes
If the goal of branding is to make your name known and respected, the first 
step in Internet branding is to make your name visible in the search engines. 
To get started, for each of your notable brand names (your company name, 
your product name, and possibly your own name, if you’re trying to become 
an authority in your industry), run some name searches and see whether 
your Web site ranks for your brand in the search engines.
If your company name is a unique brand, like Nike or Bruce Clay, Inc. or 
John Wiley & Sons, Inc., you definitely want your own Web site to come up in 
searches for your brand. However, you may have chosen a brand name con-
taining keywords (the terms people search for) instead. Examples are Classic 
Car Customization and RunningShoes.com. If you have a brand name like 
that, you’ll be competing against lots of other sites to rank for your brand 
because those are their keywords, too. It takes time and a lot of SEO know-
how to get your brand to the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs). 
However, moving your brand up in the search results should be a goal for 
any company that wants to build a long-term clientele. The payoff comes 
when past customers or people who’ve heard about you through word-of-
mouth go looking for you by name in a search engine and can find your site.
Using Keywords to Connect with People
There’s a lot more to branding than just showing up in search results for 
your name. You can also do branding by using the Internet to connect with 
prospects and then raising their awareness of your brand, as we discuss 
throughout this chapter.
Selecting the right keywords is the foundation of search engine optimiza-
tion. You need to know what keywords best describe what your Web site 
has to offer. Then you can optimize your Web site’s on-page factors (the 
HTML tags and the visible content on the Web page) to be about those 
keywords. In turn, search engines find your pages among the most relevant 
to users’ searches for those terms, and voilá — you rank well in search 
results, attract lots of people to your site, and get the conversions that 
you’re ultimately after.

Using Keywords to Connect with People
In addition, there’s another whole approach to keyword selection that’s 
geared to branding, not ecommerce. Rather than trying to find keywords 
that convert immediately, this approach concentrates on finding keywords 
that connect with the people you’re trying to target. This is how you start 
building brand awareness, a sense of who your company is before your 
potential customers even know that they’d be interested in you.
Say, for example, that you have a business customizing classic cars. For SEO, 
your Web site is optimized around keywords that correspond to the content, 
which is the actual meat of your site. You have pages and pages of articles, 
pictures, and more about customizing classic cars, and sprinkled strategi-
cally throughout this content are your keywords. Now focus on the people 
who’re reading your content. Looking at your current customer list, who is 
your target audience? What do you know about them besides the fact that 
they like classic cars?
Discover keywords that represent your visitors’ shared qualities or inter-
ests. Find out what else your target audience has in common, besides 
being interested in your product or service. Look at demographics like age, 
gender, lifestyle, location, education, beliefs, and occupation. Also think 
about attitudes they may have in common — for instance, if they all tend to 
be bargain hunters who won’t purchase something unless it’s a “good deal,” 
that affects the kinds of offers you make in ads and on your site. If you’ve 
created personas (imaginary models of typical customers) to help you evalu-
ate your Web site user experience, the same research will help you come up 
with things your target audience has in common. (For more on personas, see 
Book V, Chapter 1.)
For your classic car customization Web site, as you look at your current 
customer list, you may start to notice some patterns. For example, you 
might discover that nearly all of your visitors are between the ages of about 
40 and 60. This helps you identify keywords that represent what your audi-
ence has in common. After you have those keywords in mind, you can use 
them to research where those people might congregate on the Web. You 
could look for a forum or social media site that’s made up mostly of baby 
boomers. Or think about other hobbies baby boomers participate in: Are 
they wine tasters? Classic rock concertgoers? Motorcycle enthusiasts?
After you identify a list of your target audience’s other interests, start 
brainstorming how you can make your brand more visible to them. If it’s 
wine-tasting they’re into, you could send a letter or e-mail to a wine-tasting 
Web site suggesting that they link back to your site because many of your 
wine-tasting customers are also interested in customizing classic cars. 
Alternatively, you could offer an article for the other Web site to post on 
their site about customizing classic cars; it would give them free original 
content, and your only condition would be that they link back to you. Or you 
could suggest a joint project such as a wine-tasting booth at the next local 
car show, and then issue a joint press release to publicize it.

How to Build Your Brand Through Search
 
Your brand is boosted in people’s minds every time they see your brand 
mentioned somewhere else. Start looking for places where you can show up 
outside your own Web site, where your desired prospects will see you. The 
more exposure you get, the better your brand.
How to Build Your Brand Through Search
You have a great opportunity to increase your brand’s online presence 
through the many different search avenues available today. Once upon a 
time, there was only your Web site to represent your company online. Like a 
solitary island in a sea, you just had to hope searchers would know enough 
about your company to notice the blip of your Web site on their radar. 
Today, you can use search marketing to connect your Web site to the world. 
Through SEO, you can enable your site to show up when people search for 
your keywords. But there’s also much more you can do to make your brand 
visible.
The goal is to increase awareness of your company, to make your brand 
something people recognize and even talk about, and the big win is to have 
your brand searched for. Search marketing gives you lots of channels to 
accomplish this, from search engines to social networking to video sharing 
to press releases to blogs to news to wikis (information sites containing all 
user-generated content, such as Wikipedia, www.wikipedia.org) to bul-
letin boards . . . and the list goes on. When you make your brand name show 
up in many of these, it builds an online presence that raises your brand. You 
can think of it as halo media — a variety of media channels that surround 
your company like a halo, giving it presence and making your brand known, 
as shown in Figure 2-1.

How to Build Your Brand Through Search
The flip side of using search to build your brand has to do with managing 
your brand’s reputation. It’s all well and good to get your name out there, 
but what happens when someone misrepresents you or posts something 
awful about your company? And when the buzz about your company starts 
to turn negative, it can turn into a firestorm fast. Once again, search comes 
to your aid! You can monitor the online conversation and decide when to 
jump in and do some damage control.
In the remainder of this chapter, we cover the practical steps you can take 
to create halo media around your brand. We begin the discussion with press 
releases, and then move on to discuss videos and other engagement objects 
and tips for diving into the world of social media. Throughout the chapter, 
you build the skills you need to manage your brand and make it thrive in the 
online world.
Writing press releases
Distributing Internet press releases is an effective and not-too-costly way 
to increase public awareness of your company. To do this, write and send 
your press release to a third-party distribution company such as PRWeb 
(www.prweb.com) or one of the others we mention later in this section. 
That company publishes it on their site, and pushes it to other news sites 
that may pick it up and republish all or a part of it, so for a short time, your 
news continues to circulate on the Web and get exposure. For the long 
term, the distribution company archives the press release on their Web 
site, and you should also archive your press releases in a News or Press 
section of your site.
 
When writing press releases (as with any content), keep in mind your key-
words. Use your keywords throughout the text, and especially use them 
within the first 200 words on each page because that’s the part the search 
engines count more heavily when calculating a page’s relevance to a user’s 
search. Don’t repeat the keywords over and over again — that’s called key-
word stuffing and should be avoided — but use them within the natural flow 
of your writing.
Also include links to your site in your press release. This ensures that you 
not only acquire an inbound link (hyperlink on an external site that takes 
users to your site), but also that it is from a page with relevant content and 
optimized anchor text (the link text that can be clicked). The links would ide-
ally go to the home page and high-priority landing pages (the pages where 
users arrive at your site because they’re the ones most focused on particular 
keywords) for your most profitable and most searched services. Be sure to 
use a top keyword as the anchor text rather than using a URL.
 
To keep buzz circulating about your company, distribute press releases 
regularly — at least once every two to three months, but more frequently if 
possible. Our schedule is semi-monthly based on announcement-worthy 

674
How to Build Your Brand Through Search
content, so your mileage may vary. Your press release should announce 
some achievement or event about your company, so always be thinking of 
good topics that could be publicized. An effective press release should 
contain factual information that doesn’t sound too much like marketing 
copy. (It’s a good idea to put opinion-type statements like “Our super-
fantastic new buffing tool is going to revolutionize the car customization 
industry!” into quotes.)
Newsworthy ideas for press releases include
 
✦ New service or product being launched
 
✦ Special deal announcement
 
✦ News about the Web site or company in general
 
✦ Employee promotion or new hire (especially of a company executive or 
notable person)
 
✦ Contest being offered through your Web site
 
✦ Launch of a cool interactive feature on your Web site
 
✦ Award given to your company
 
✦ Other significant event or announcement
We recommend you check out the following press release distribution ser-
vices. Compare their coverage, options, and prices to find the one that suits 
you best. Also, different services feed different news outlets, so if there’s a 
particular news outlet that you definitely want your news appearing in, that 
could be a deciding factor:
 
✦ PRWeb (www.prweb.com): Besides being a very reliable distribution 
service, they offer helpful tips on how to write an effective press release 
(see www.prweb.com/pressreleasetips.php).
 
✦ Marketwire (www.marketwire.com): Marketwire news stories pop 
up nicely to the top of Google search results and elsewhere, so they’re 
another good one to consider.
 
✦ PR Newswire (www.prnewswire.com): This is one of the biggest press 
release operations in the U.S., so it’s another good choice.
Optimizing for blended search
All the major search engines can display a mix of different types of results in 
the SERPs, a technique known as blended search. (Google calls it Universal 
Search, but it’s the same concept.)
Before the advent of blended search, when you went to a search engine and 
looked for something, your search results only contained Web page links. 

Book X
Chapter 2
Using SEO to 
Build Your Brand
675
How to Build Your Brand Through Search
You had to choose Images in order to search for photos, News if you wanted 
to find news articles, Video if you were looking for videos, and so forth. With 
blended search, your results may contain these types of links in addition to 
Web site listings, all presented together in a single SERP.
You can run a search for a specific well-known person or thing to see 
blended search in action. For instance, if you search on Google for [1969 ford 
mustang], you get back a variety of different images, Web pages, and video 
results all blended together, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2:

What does blended search mean to you as a Web site owner? It means that 
you can’t afford to have a Web site full of text alone anymore. A Web site 
that includes videos, images, and other types of media has more chances 
to be shown in search results than a text-only site does. In fact, sites that 
include videos and other media elements now outrank those that do not, all 
other factors being equal.
You might wonder why a site with a video should outrank a site without one. 
We know that Google and the other search engines’ goal is to present the 
most relevant content based on a user’s search query. That in itself doesn’t 

676
Using Engagement Objects to Promote Your Brand
explain it. However, they also want people to like using their search engine 
and to be satisfied with the Web sites they go to. The search engines want 
the experience of searching to be as engaging as possible. A SERP with a mix 
of photos, videos, news articles, and book links increases user engagement. 
In addition, users are better satisfied with the results if the sites themselves 
are more engaging. By making the entire experience more satisfying, blended 
search is a win-win for the search engines and for searchers.
Using Engagement Objects to Promote Your Brand
The lesson of blended search is clear: enhance your Web site with engage-
ment objects, and you will be rewarded for it. Engagement objects(™) are 
non-text elements such as images, videos, audio, games, and applications 
that help engage your Web site visitors’ interest. When people first come to 
a Web site, they tend to decide whether to stay or leave within the first two 
to five seconds.
Say someone is searching for [classic Mustang colors] and finds your clas-
sic car customization Web site. If they see just a headline and several para-
graphs of information, they probably head for the Back button. To grab their 
interest, your page needs photos of Mustangs, hopefully showing the various 
paint colors. You might also have a video link showing how to prep a classic 
car for repainting. Or you could have an interactive wheel created in Flash 
that shows all the manufacturer’s color choices for the model year that’s 
selected. The more engaging you make the landing page, the more likely it 
is to satisfy your visitor. And, all other things being equal, the more likely 
Google and other search engines are to list your landing page among their 
top search results.
Engagement objects are expected to play more and more heavily in search 
ranking as time goes on. The search engines have been working hard to 
“read” non-text content and understand what it’s about. They’re getting 
better at converting the various types of non-text-based files into words that 
they can index (include in the search engine’s database of Web page content 
for search results). Google in particular made great strides in 2008, begin-
ning to convert the soundtracks from video and audio files into text. Search 
engines can now read non-moving text created in Adobe Flash, as well (Flash 
is a software program used to create animated and interactive objects for 
Web sites). As search engine technology advances, you can expect engage-
ment objects to continue to gain importance as a ranking factor.
You can consider including several different types of engagement objects to 
optimize your Web site for blended search. We’ve listed the most common 
ones below, with some notes:

Book X
Chapter 2
Using SEO to 
Build Your Brand
677
Building a Community
 
✦ Images: Search engines scan Web sites to find large photos, diagrams, 
illustrations, or other types of image files. To help the search engine 
understand what your image is about, include a brief description in the 
surrounding text, in the image’s alt attribute (HTML description), and in 
the file name.
 
✦ Video: Embed your video right in your Web page for maximum benefit 
(so people can visit and possibly link directly to your site).
 
✦ Audio: Include audio files embedded in your pages and be sure to 
explain what they’re about in the surrounding text. Also, don’t annoy 
your users — be sure to set the default audio file to “off.”
 
✦ Flash: It’s against SEO best practices to create your whole Web site in 
Flash because the search engines can’t index moving text or images. 
However, you can make your Web site more interactive by including 
Flash objects, and the search engines can now index non-moving text 
created in Flash. Consider using Flash to build useful or entertaining ani-
mated elements (or widgets) for your site that engage your visitors, and 
be sure to describe them well in the surrounding text.
 
✦ News articles: If your press release gets picked up by a news organiza-
tion, it could become a news result. Plus, archiving your press releases 
on your site gives you more content and possibly search traffic if people 
go looking for the information later.
 
✦ Blog posts: Search engines scan blogs that are updated regularly, espe-
cially if many people contribute to them. Recent posts to a blog some-
times come up in related search results, so an active blog on your Web 
site can increase traffic. (More on blogging in the section, “Blogging to 
build community,” later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Games: Games are a great way to build user loyalty and increase engage-
ment. High score tables, badges of achievement, and bragging rights are 
all ways to keep a user excited about your game and your brand.
 
✦ Interactive applications: This is sort of an “everything else” category. 
Financial calculators, AJAX apps that let someone design their own car, 
fun quizzes, and anything else that you could put on your page that a 
user can engage with and respond to all make great content for fixing 
the message of your brand in people’s minds.
Building a Community
We’ve already talked about the need to target your specific audience, and 
that comes into play when building a community, too. Who are the people 
your brand appeals to? What other products, services, sports, hobbies, 
and things interest them, besides your brand? When you can identify their 

678
Building a Community
other common interests, you can work to associate your brand with them. If 
your car-customizing enthusiasts also tend to be into wine-tasting, you can 
research to find where wine tasters hang out online. Wherever it is, you want 
to be there, too! As your target audience starts to see your brand and your 
voice popping up around in the Internet, not just when you’re selling to them 
but particularly when you’re just part of the conversation, they find out who 
you are and start to trust you. They begin to feel like you’re one of them. 
That’s community building.
To build a community online, you need to use blogs and the various types 
of social media sites. Think of these sites as channels for communication — 
channels that go in both directions. You can get your message out to your 
prospects and develop a voice in your industry, but you can also listen. 
Probably never before has there been more opportunity to hear what people 
think about your products, your services, your ideas, and your company. 
Social media provides that channel. So use social media first and foremost 
as a way to research what people like and don’t like about your brand and 
your industry. Approached with a willing ear and an open mind, these online 
conversations can give you an unlimited flow of ideas for improving your 
business.
Being who you are online
Before diving into the various places you can be social online, take a 
moment to think about who you want to be when you get there. Most impor-
tantly, you want to be genuine online. Don’t claim to be someone you’re not, 
or you’ll get burned. The Internet population at large doesn’t take kindly to 
imposters, and when the discovery is made, your brand could be damaged 
permanently.
An infamous example of a company getting 
caught misrepresenting themselves online 
is Wal-Mart. In mid-2006, a blog called Wal-
Marting Across America featured the travels 
of two “regular people” driving across the 
country, independently interviewing Wal-
Mart employees. When it was discovered 
that the two people were actually being sup-
ported by Wal-Mart and that the blog had been 
concocted by Wal-Mart’s PR firm, bloggers 
across the Internet retaliated with angry posts. 
Both Wal-Mart and its PR firm were seriously 
embarrassed by the flap.

You need to be transparent about your identity online. Many CEOs and 
other company executives now write blogs online, such as Tony Hsieh, 
CEO of Zappos, Bill Marriott, chairman and CEO of Marriott International, 
and Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Microsystems. Writing as themselves is 
the key, and allows them a platform where they can spread a message but 
also become a real person that customers can get to know. You don’t want 
to claim to be the CEO if you’re really writing the blog as a freelancer in 
another state.
Some companies choose to set up an alias to blog under, which is fine, as 
long as you make it clear that it’s an alias. The Chicago Tribune, for instance, 
has set up Colonel Tribune as their social media ambassador. “He” has a 
profile in lots of social media sites, where he posts interesting bits of news 
with links back to Tribune articles and blogs, as well as other sites. His pic-
ture is an illustration rather than a photo (see Figure 2-3), which helps to 
prevent any confusion.

Building a Community
 
Whoever you choose to be in the social media realm, make sure you do it 
authentically. After all, you’re trying to build customer and industry relation-
ships that will last. You’re trying to create trust. You have the opportunity to 
become a voice. You first need to know who you are and be true to that.
Blogging to build community
Blogging is arguably the oldest and most mature type of social media on the 
Web. It also can be important for your company Web site and SEO efforts. 
The search engines have a vertical engine (specialized search that finds 
one type of result only) devoted just to blogs, and blog posts are now being 
linked in blended search results when they closely match a search query.
Adding a blog to your company Web site has many benefits beyond pos-
sible search results. First of all, it’s a great way to add content to your site 
that’s fresh and original. It also invites visitors to have a conversation with 
you, which builds valuable relationships with your target audience. Through 
your blog posts, you can express your ideas and let your personality come 
through. You can start conversations, guide them, and establish yourself as 
a leader. When people post comments to your blog, you get user-generated 
content that other people trust and want to read. You get feedback that can 
help you see opportunities and put out fires. With an active blog on your 
site, you have a community in the making.
If you’re just starting a blog, you might check out the various blog software 
programs available either for free or for purchase/license. Blog software 
is a specialized type of content management system (software that auto-
mates Web page production) designed just for maintaining a blog, such as 
WordPress (http://wordpress.org/) and Movable Type (www.movable
type.com/). There are a wide variety of choices out there, though. We sug-
gest you consult with your Webmaster and research to find the best option 
for your site.
For a corporate blog, you should consider hosting your blog on your domain 
(for example, you can find our blog at www.bruceclay.com/blog/), but 
if you’re just blogging as yourself, a hosted blog at a site like Blogger (www.
blogger.com) could be just fine. (Alternatively, if you’re a really big com-
pany, you can buy the hosting company and put all of your official blogs 
there. That’s what Google did. Their official blog is http://googleblog.
blogspot.com/. However, most of us don’t have that option.)
You can use some tips and tricks to help you use blogging effectively to 
build an online community. Here are some blogging dos and don’ts:
 
✦ Do write in your blog regularly and often. Set a minimum goal of one new 
post per week, but write more frequently as ideas come to you.
 
✦ Do write in a conversational tone that’s informative and entertaining 
to read.

Book X
Chapter 2
Using SEO to 
Build Your Brand
681
Building a Community
 
✦ Don’t use much profanity or vulgarity in your writing. You’ll want to 
write appropriately for your target audience, but keep it a cut above to 
encourage readers to feel comfortable in your space.
 
✦ Do take the time to run your posts through a spelling checker (by put-
ting them in a word processor if your blog software doesn’t offer this 
feature) and proofread them before posting them. Keeping typos and 
mistakes to a minimum helps you look professional and makes people 
take your comments more seriously.
 
✦ Do include links to other people’s blog posts and articles, and let the 
anchor text be meaningful words, not just a URL. Things you read on 
other blogs within your industry can be great topic starters, so feel free 
to summarize in your own words, and then rebut or expand on their 
posts in your own blog (including a link to the original post). This is 
another way to form industry connections and build community.
 
✦ Don’t be afraid to raise controversial topics related to your industry. 
Stating a contrary opinion can generate lots of interest and comments. 
People are more likely to talk about what you wrote in other social 
media sites as well, and even if they disagree with you, they often link 
back to your site.
 
✦ Do use your blog to show you care about your industry. Talk about 
issues and develop a strong industry voice. This generates respect for 
you as a thought leader, but you also may find yourself helping to steer 
your industry.
 
✦ Do encourage conversation by approving people’s comments promptly 
(but not the ones that are obviously spam). Also, write your own com-
ments in reply when appropriate.
 
✦ Do comment on other people’s blogs, too, especially other thought lead-
ers in your industry. You can use your brand name with a link back to 
your blog or home page as your signature line, but other than that, be 
careful not to be overtly selling/pushing anything. Done with tact, post-
ing on other people’s blogs can help build community and a name for 
yourself within the industry.
 
Try to avoid responding to unfounded attacks. Many people try to engage 
others on the Internet for the wrong reasons. Lowering yourself to their level 
is seldom a good move: That way lies madness.
Here’s one more idea for you: be on the lookout for other people’s blogs that 
are popular with your target audience. When you find one that’s highly read, 
get in touch with the blogger and let him or her know about your company 
and product. If you can encourage the blogger to give your product a try, 
you can suggest that they review it in their blog and give an independent 
opinion. People are highly influenced by a trusted reviewer’s opinion, so this 
could generate a lot of traffic and help boost your brand.

Building a Community
Using other social media to build community
The good news is, you have lots of ways to talk to people online. The bad 
news is, there are lots of ways to talk to people online! Because your time is 
probably limited, it’s important to figure out which Web sites and methods 
most effectively help you connect with your target audience on the Web. We 
give you some tips throughout this section on how to go about making that 
decision.
The important thing is to be where people are talking about your company 
and products — or, if your business isn’t very well known yet, to be involved 
in related conversations where you can help to make it known. Social media 
sites give you a way to do that.
Being connected through social media can also help you deal with a public 
relations crisis. If a customer slams you online, it can become a PR night-
mare. Although it might be tempting to think of the offending customer as evil 
and clearly attacking you, try to think of it as an opportunity to demonstrate 
your care and interest, resolve the issue, and then thank them. Try to turn a 
problem into a positive statement that you are care about their comments.
There are a few ways social media can help you deal with bad publicity:
 
✦ You hear about the complaint quickly, while it’s still a small flare-up, 
because you’re monitoring conversations about your brand name.
 
✦ You can analyze the complaint and determine its validity (or lack 
thereof). Self-analysis before jumping into a crisis is always wise.
 
✦ You can contact the person directly to resolve the issue, if you choose. 
You might turn a disgruntled customer into a loyal one through your 
fast response and excellent customer service.
 
✦ You can publicly post an explanation and apology, if appropriate. But do 
not attack the attacker! They are your clients, or should be.
 
✦ You can monitor and “control” the conversation, as needed.
 
✦ You can enlist the help of your brand evangelists (people who’ve sup-
ported your brand online in the past) to stick up for you, if you decide a 
response would be better coming from an impartial source.
 
✦ You can use social media profile to help push down the offending sites 
in the search engine results pages so they do not get as many views 
from potential customers.
According to a September 2008 study conducted by Opinion Research 
Corporation for Cone, Inc., 60 percent of Americans use social media, and 
nearly 60 percent of those people interact with companies on social media 
Web sites. The survey (www.coneinc.com/content1182) found that 93 
percent of social media users believe that companies should have a pres-
ence in social media — and the majority said they “feel both a stronger

connection with and better served by companies that interact with them 
in a social media environment.” So there’s a real opportunity for business 
owners here. With so many people “talking” online, you can’t really afford to 
be out of the conversation. And the rewards of building a brand community 
and managing your reputation online make it worth the effort.
Connecting to your audience with social networking
Social networking involves “meeting” people online through a Web site 
designed for this. Popular social networking sites in the U.S. include MySpace 
(www.myspace.com), Facebook (www.facebook.com), LinkedIn (www.
linkedin.com), Xanga (www.xanga.com), and Twitter (www.twitter.
com), although the list is very long and constantly evolving.
To participate in a social networking site, people first set up their profile 
page, which contains a variety of basic or trivial information about them-
selves such as name, age, favorite books, favorite music, or whatever they 
choose to enter, as well as photos and links and a customizable background. 
Some sites (such as Facebook) have a way for a business to set up a busi-
ness profile instead of a personal one and assign more than one person to 
have access.
Before jumping into a social networking site for your brand, do a little 
homework first. Research the demographics of the various social network-
ing sites. About.com provides a short list of the top social networking 
sites (http://webtrends.about.com/od/socialnetworking/a/
social_network.htm). and provides a few facts about each, including the 
geographic region where it’s most popular, and some basic facts about each 
site’s focus and purpose. We also suggest the direct approach — talk to your 
current customers and ask them where they “hang out” on the Web. You’re 
looking for the social media sites that are the most popular with the people 
you’re trying to reach.
After your profile is set up, you can connect with other users by request. On 
MySpace or Facebook, you send a “friend request”; on Twitter, you choose to 
“follow” another user. Another good method is to invite people to “Join our 
community” by including links on the bottom of e-mails and e-newsletters 
you send out. You could include links to your profile pages on various social 
networking sites, giving the person a choice. If they also have a profile on that 
site, they can easily request you as a friend/follower.
After a request is made, the recipient can either approve or deny it, so you 
have some measure of control over who you network with. Facebook allows 
you to build your network even faster by suggesting friends-of-friends that 
you might know. So after you start to build your network, use the technol-
ogy to help it grow. You can also use search functions to find people talking 
about issues that matter to you (that is, your keywords). These let you dive 
right into the middle of conversations where you want to have a voice.

684
Building a Community
How you choose to interact with your network depends a lot on your strate-
gic goals. Maybe you’re trying to
 
✦ Build closer relationships with your best customers.
 
✦ Generate awareness about your brand and products.
 
✦ Build trust with potential customers.
 
✦ Find people for a long-term focus group.
 
✦ Gather ideas for new products and services.
 
✦ Locate disgruntled customers and put out fires.
 
✦ Assist with Customer Service inquiries or general information
You could have any number of different objectives for getting involved in 
social networking, so make sure you’re starting off with your goal clearly in 
mind so that your time and efforts are well spent.
As an example, the cable television company Comcast has successfully 
improved their customer service and company image through Twitter. They 
set up a profile named “ComcastCares” and assigned an employee to do 
nothing but monitor Twitter for any mention of their company. Figure 2-4 
shows its profile page on Twitter.

Building a Community
When someone types a complaint or other comment about Comcast in 
Twitter, the ComcastCares person responds immediately through Twitter 
and helps the user resolve the issue (putting the person in touch with a 
technician, if necessary). But he’s also a real person who enters unprompted 
comments, so that the other people on Twitter get to “know” him and 
build a sense of community with him. It must be working: At last count, the 
ComcastCares guy had 5,394 people following him.
Spreading the word with social bookmarking
Social media sites can help you generate interest in your brand and specifi-
cally in your Web site. Links from blog pages, social media sites, wikis, or 
forums only help your link equity for a short time and should not be relied 
on in the long term. However, many of those people who find your site 
through such a referral may end up liking what they see and bookmarking it 
or linking to it themselves. Plus, you’re bringing in more traffic and building 
more awareness of your brand.
You can harness the power of social bookmarking to help get your word out. 
Social bookmarking lets users recommend a Web page to others through a 
social bookmarking site. There, they can also write a review, comment on 
it, start a discussion about it, and so on. Say someone reads your article 
“Making a Chrome Bumper Shine without Elbow Grease” and loves it. The 
reader can recommend it by bookmarking it to a site such as Digg (www.
digg.com), Delicious (www.delicious.com), StumbleUpon (www.stumble
upon.com), reddit (www.reddit.com), Yahoo! Bookmarks (bookmarks.
yahoo.com), Google Bookmarks (www.google.com/bookmarks/), or any 
number of others. If it’s the first time someone has bookmarked this par-
ticular article, it gets linked there, and people searching for your topic on 
that social bookmarking site find it. If the article was already bookmarked by 
another user, the reader’s bookmark results in another vote for the article. 
Using the search function at search.
twitter.com, you can search for a spe-
cific keyword or phrase in Twitter to find all 
the recent entries. Then you can subscribe 
to a feed for that query to be proactive. Every 
time someone types that keyword into Twitter, 
you are automatically notified through an RSS 
feed (a type of automatic syndication of Web 
content, which you can read in any number of 
feed readers that are available for free, such 
as the Google Reader). A couple of services 
(TweetBeep at www.tweetbeep.com and 
Twilert at www.twilert.com) e-mail you 
when your keyword is mentioned on Twitter. 
This is how the ComcastCares guy knows 
instantly whenever someone gripes about 
Comcast, and it’s also how you can stay on 
top of your keywords and meet people talking 
about what’s important to you online.
How to stay on top of your keywords in Twitter

686
Building a Community
By counting the number of reader recommendations (both positive and 
negative), the social bookmarking sites can naturally rank articles based on 
how popular they are with their readers.
Your goal is to get others to see something on your site and then post about 
it elsewhere. Make it easy for your readers to share your articles with the 
rest of the world. Beneath each of your articles, you can offer chiclets, which 
are small icons or links that let the reader recommend it to a social book-
marking site. Figure 2-5 shows a typical set of chiclets on a Web page.
  
Chiclets
You can add chiclets to your Web pages rather easily via freeware available 
on the Internet. In the next section, we cover two options you can try, but 
there are probably many others. What’s nice is that they let you pick and 
choose which social networking sites’ chiclets you want to offer for those 
who want to channel the conversation (although we don’t see any problem 
with being all-inclusive and offering every chiclet available).

ShareThis
Many sites use this handy tool, which puts a single ShareThis icon under 
your article. If a user clicks it, a box opens up with lots of choices. Users can 
share the article on a social media site, post it to their own blog or profile, or 
send it by e-mail, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Here’s how to create a ShareThis interface for your Web site:
 
1. Go to the ShareThis site at http://sharethis.com/getbutton.
 
2. From the Pick Your Platform drop-down list, choose the blog soft-
ware that you use to build your site — either WordPress, Blogger, or 
TypePad. If you don’t use any of those platforms, choose ShareThis 
Button for Other Websites.
 
3. Under Customize Your Widget, you can do just that. Select the appro-
priate check boxes and radio buttons to make your ShareThis widget 
look the way you want it to.

 If you select “Custom,” for example, you can pick and choose exactly 
which social Web services you want to offer from a list of 39. You can 
even modify the colors of your widget to make it blend in better with 
your Web site.
 
4. Click the Get ShareThis Code button.
 
5. Complete the registration form that pops up, including your name, 
e-mail address, your blog or site domain, and a password, and then 
click Create Account. You are now a registered “publisher” with 
ShareThis, which means that whenever you want to modify your

and Reporting Spam
In This Chapter
✓ Knowing spam when you see it
✓ Avoiding spam on your own Web site
✓ Reporting spam violations to the search engines
✓ Recognizing paid links
✓ Reporting paid links for the search engines to investigate
✓ Understanding click fraud
W
hen you hear the word spam, it might make you think of the many 
unwanted e-mails littering your inbox. Or maybe the first thing that 
comes to mind is cans of processed meat. (Mmmmmm, processed meat . . .) 
But in the world of search engine optimization (SEO), spam is any deceptive 
tactic used on a Web site to fool the search engines about what that site is 
about.
In this chapter, we recap the different types of spam polluting the Internet. 
Although we describe the different forms of spam in-depth in Book I, 
Chapter 6, in this chapter, we explain what you can do to clean it up if you 
find it on your own site, and what choices you have if you find it on some-
one else’s. This chapter contains specific instructions for reporting spam 
to all the major search engines, which could be good reference for you in 
the future. You also find out about a type of fraud that affects paid search 
advertisers, and how you can guard against this in your pay-per-click (PPC) 
campaigns (search engine ads that display on search results pages, and that 
you pay for only when users click your ads).
How to Identify Spam and What to Do About It
You need to know spam when you see it for a few reasons:
 
✦ You can prevent your own Web site from inadvertently doing anything 
the search engines consider spam.

692
How to Identify Spam and What to Do About It
 
✦ When you’re looking for good candidates among third-party sites that 
you could ask to link to your Web site, you can stay away from those 
with shady practices so your site doesn’t get tainted by association.
 
✦ If you can recognize when someone else (such as your competitor) uses 
spam, you can distance yourself from them and even report them, if you 
choose. Knowledge is power, after all.
If you’ve ever done a search for car parts and clicked a result that took you 
to a page filled instead with a list of random hyperlinks (words or phrases a 
user can click to jump to another Web page) — or which sold something else 
entirely, like condominiums in the Bermuda Triangle — you’ve seen search 
engine spam. Chances are you blamed the search engine for this mistake. 
But the truth is that the search engine thought that the Web page it gave you 
really was about car parts. How did the search engine go so wrong? It was 
probably fooled by spam.
Spam takes many forms. We recap the most common kinds of spam briefly, 
and then get to what we really want to cover here — what you can do about 
each one.
Hidden text or links
When text or hyperlinks on a page are invisible to users but can be read by a 
search engine, that’s considered spam. Spammers hide text or links from site 
visitors by using the same font color as the background color (such as white 
text on a white background), by positioning the text outside the visible page, 
or by layering an image or other element on top of the content, thus hiding 
it from site visitors. Here’s what you should do when you run across hidden 
links:
 
✦ On your own site: Make sure you don’t have any hidden text or hyper-
links on your pages. Drag your cursor over your pages or press Ctrl+A 
to select all of the page content to make sure it doesn’t contain hidden 
white-on-white elements. You also should make sure your photos and 
other large elements aren’t covering vestiges of older versions of your 
page.
 
✦ On other sites: If you detect lots of hidden text or hyperlinks on another 
site that’s ranking decently in the search engines, it’s a sure bet the 
search engines haven’t discovered it yet. Search engines crack down 
hard on this type of deliberate spam, and may even ban offending sites 
from the search engine’s index (the database of Web page information 
that the search engine maintains).
 
 You could report a site using hidden text or links to the search engines 
as spam. (We give reporting instructions in the section titled “How to 
Report Spam to the Major Search Engines” later in this chapter.)

Book X
Chapter 3

693
How to Identify Spam and What to Do About It
Doorway pages
A doorway page is a Web page created solely for search engine spiders, usu-
ally filled with text content that makes it rank high for a certain keyword (a 
word or phrase that users may enter in a search). There is no intention of 
letting users see the doorway page, however. When someone clicks to go 
there from a search results page, the Web site automatically redirects the 
user to another page that may be about a totally different subject. Here’s 
what you should do when you suspect that you’ve found doorway pages:
 
✦ On your own site: You want your pages to focus clearly on their various 
subjects and keywords and not deceive the search engines or the users. 
If you have any doorway pages on your site, get rid of them. If the pages 
are landing pages for PPC, use a Meta robots tag to specify NOINDEX, or 
use a 301 redirect to redirect them elsewhere.
 
✦ On other sites: You can make a spam report to the search engines to 
report doorway pages, if you find them. The search engines hate giving 
their users misleading results, so they will gladly investigate. It’s your 
option.
Frames
Webmasters may use frames (an HTML technique for combining multiple 
documents within a single browser window) as a page layout tool, although 
today it’s thought of as an outdated technique. However, a spammer may 
use frames to hide content from the search engines because search engines 
read each frame as a separate HTML document. So users might see a page 
about car parts and other things that appear in additional frames, whereas 
the search engine thinks the whole page is about car parts. How do you go 
about solving the frames problem? Here’s how:
 
✦ On your own site: Because you want search engines to be able to digest 
all your Web content easily, be careful using frames. In fact, if your 
Web site is primarily constructed with frames, we suggest you ask your 
Webmaster to redesign it. Frames could hurt your SEO because not all of 
your content is indexed properly.
 
✦ On other sites: If you think a competing site is using frames for inten-
tional spam and you don’t want them to get away with it, you can submit 
a spam report.
Deceptive redirection
Deceptive redirection is a type of coded command (usually a Meta refresh, 
which instructs a user’s browser to automatically refresh the current Web 
page after a given time interval) that takes the user to a different location 
than what was intended via the link that was clicked. Spammers create a 

694
How to Identify Spam and What to Do About It
page with content that ranks for a certain keyword, yet when you access 
that URL (Web address), you get redirected to an entirely different site that 
has nothing to do with your search. This technique is often used by por-
nography and gambling sites to grab unwitting visitors. In order to combat 
deceptive redirects, take these actions:
 
✦ On your own site: Avoid using Meta refreshes on your site. The search 
engines may flag your site for a spam investigation if they find you using 
them because they’re highly suspicious. When you need to redirect an 
old page to a new page, the only safe way is to use a 301 permanent redi-
rect (a type of server command that automatically reroutes an incoming 
link to a different URL). (Note: Book VII, Chapter 3 is all about redirects, 
if you want to know more.)
 
✦ On other sites: When you find a search engine result taking you to a 
completely different site maliciously, you have the option to report it as 
spam to the search engine. Depending on the situation, you may be per-
forming a public service. The fewer sneaky sites out there, the better.
Cloaking
Through a process of IP delivery called cloaking, a Web site detects who’s 
requesting to see a page and may show a different version to a search engine 
spider than to all other users. So the spider sees and indexes content that 
isn’t what you would see if you went to that URL. If the purpose of cloaking 
is to deceive search engines (which is the very definition of spam), there is 
a severe penalty. It’s no wonder the search engines hate it. Although not all 
forms of IP delivery are evil, deceptive cloaking is always wrong. Cloaking can 
be handled in a couple of ways, depending on if it’s your site or another site:
 
✦ On your own site: Don’t do it without consulting an ethical professional, 
and even then be cautious. If you have pages that detect the search 
engine spiders and change the page content as a result, you’re operating 
in dangerous waters that could get your site banished from the search 
engines.
 
✦ On other sites: If you suspect that a competitor is using cloaking to gain 
an undeserved ranking in the search engines, you can compare their 
Web page to the version of the page that the search engine last cached 
(stored in their index). Do a search that you know will include that Web 
page in the results set, and click the Cached link under the URL. This 
shows you the Web page as it last looked to the search engine. If you see 
entirely different content when you go to their live site, you’re probably 
looking at cloaking.
 
 Cloaking can definitely be reported as spam.

How to Identify Spam and What to Do About It
Unrelated keywords
Spam also includes deliberately using keywords that are not related to 
the image, video, or other content that is supposed to be described, in the 
hopes of increasing traffic. Cleaning up a mess made by unrelated keywords 
is pretty simple — just follow these guidelines:
 
✦ On your own site: Make sure your page content is cohesive, with text, 
images, videos, and so on all focused on the same subject and keywords. 
An image’s Alt attribute (brief description of the image included in the 
HTML) should accurately describe the image; each page’s Meta data 
(HTML tags the spiders read that are supposed to describe the page) 
needs to contain keywords that are also used in the page text users see, 
and so forth. You rank better in the search engines with focused content 
anyway, so this is good advice all around.
 
 Including keywords that have high traffic (query) counts but are not 
part of that page’s content sometimes hurts your rankings, and never 
helps them. Avoid using keywords that do not relate to your content, 
and be sure that all words that are displayed on the page contribute to 
your SEO project.
 
✦ On other sites: You can view the page source code to see what’s going 
on in another site’s HTML. If you see Alt attributes or Meta data that’s 
full of unrelated keywords, they may just be remnants of older versions 
of the page that never got cleaned up. But if it looks like they’re doing 
it intentionally (there’s no hard and fast rule here, so just go with your 
gut), it can be reported to the search engines for their investigation.
Keyword stuffing
Here’s an example of keyword stuffing: “Customize your custom car custom-
ized with our car customization customizing cars service!” This text is so full 
of keywords that it no longer sounds like natural English. If you read some-
thing like that on a site, you know the Web site is trying to increase its rele-
vance to those keywords by repeating them, hoping that search engines will 
rank them higher in the search results. Keyword stuffing can also happen 
sneakily, away from the user’s view, by overusing words in the Meta data 
or in image alt attributes. How should you correct a keyword stuffed page? 
Here’s how?
 
✦ On your own site: There’s an art to using enough keywords, but not 
too many, so that search engines know what your pages are relevant for 
without thinking they’re spam. To get the proper keyword distribution 
(the way keywords are spread throughout a page) and keyword promi-
nence (the keywords are common to the content, more so than the other 

696
How to Report Spam to the Major Search Engines
words but not enough to be spam), you can do competitor research 
to figure out what’s “normal” for your keywords and follow our recom-
mended guidelines. (Read up on this important technique in Book V, 
Chapter 3.)
 
✦ On other sites: If you find another site keyword stuffing, you can report 
it as spam.
Link farms
A link farm is a group of unrelated Web sites that each have hyperlinks to all 
the other sites in the group. This is spam because it’s a fabricated collection 
of links connecting pages for the purpose of inflating rankings. Link farms 
are designed deliberately to increase their link equity, which is the combined 
value of all the links pointing to a page that is part of search engines’ ranking 
algorithms (formulas for determining which Web pages are the most relevant 
to a user’s search query). Search engines try to identify link farms and filter 
those links out of their calculations, and may even pull these sites from the 
index in order to keep them from affecting search results. 
 
There is no way for a site owner to verify that link equity is being passed. 
High PageRank pages that link to your page may actually not be passing link 
equity if the search engines consider it link spam or the site to be part of a 
link farm. To avoid link farms with your own site and deal with them in your 
industry, you can do the following:
 
✦ On your own site: You want to encourage links from quality testimonial 
grade Web sites and avoid links coming to your site from unethical sites, 
such as sites involved in link farms or other types of spam. They can 
seriously harm your search engine rankings by association. Now, you 
can’t actively stop someone from linking to you. However, you can avoid 
requesting links from these sites, and if you have been linked to by a link 
farm, you can send them a note asking them to please remove the link. 
The best links come from sites that strongly relate to your industry or to 
what your Web page is about and that operate ethically.
 
✦ On other sites: The search engines generally do a good job combating 
link farms, but if you find that another site participating in a link farm is 
still ranking, you can report the site(s) as spam. Never, ever link back to 
a link farm page. As a willing participant, you are subject to a penalty.
How to Report Spam to the Major Search Engines
Fighting spam is a top priority for the search engines. Google alone has a 
squadron of PhDs who do nothing but identify and combat spammers and 
their techniques. Fighting spam is important to Google because their busi-
ness depends on presenting reliable, relevant results when you search. This 
is why their spam filters are getting better all the time.

How to Report Spam to the Major Search Engines
The major search engines have posted “quality guidelines” to spell out what 
Webmasters should and shouldn’t do — stuff like avoiding hidden text or 
hidden links, not loading pages with irrelevant keywords, and so forth. The 
search engines also encourage people to submit a spam report about sites 
that violate their quality guidelines and cross the line into spam. You should 
report spam when you see it. Eliminating search engine spam makes the world 
of SEO a fairer place, and searchers around the world get better results.
Google
Google has two ways to submit a spam report:
 
✦ Registered Webmaster Tools users can submit an authenticated 
spam report form at www.google.com/webmasters/tools/
spamreport?pli=1. Google promises to investigate every spam report 
submitted by a registered Webmaster Tools user.
 
✦ Anyone can fill out an unauthenticated spam report form located at 
www.google.com/contact/spamreport.html. Google says they 
assess every unauthenticated report in terms of its potential impact, and 
investigate “a large fraction” of these reports, as well.
Figure 3-1 shows the easy-to-complete spam report form that’s available to 
Webmaster Tools users.

Yahoo!
If you detect search engine spam in Yahoo! search results, there’s a form 
you can use to report it to them (http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/
search/spam_abuse.html), as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2:

Microsoft Live Search
Microsoft Live Search doesn’t have a spam report form at a specific URL, but 
there is a way to report spam nonetheless. Figure 3-3 shows the form you 
use — we outline a few steps you need to take next.
Here’s the drill for reporting spam to Live Search:
 
1. On Live Search (www.msn.com), run a search that brings back the 
offending Web page in the results set.
 
2. Scroll down to the lower-right corner of the page and click Feedback.
 
 You can see the form in Figure 3-3.
 
3. Choose Found Spam from the Type of Feedback drop-down list box.
 
4. Type in any details you feel are needed in the Please Type Your 
Feedback Here text box.

Ask.com
If you want to report an inappropriate search result in Ask.com (www.ask.
com), you can use their generic form for reporting a site issue, which is 
shown in Figure 3-4.
To report spam to Ask:
 
1. Go to http://asksupport.custhelp.com/ and click the Report 
Site Issue tab.
 
2. Enter your e-mail address (required) and then select an option from 
the Topic drop-down list (we suggest Web Search Results if you’re 
reporting spam).
 
3. Enter details in the Message field. Because Ask.com’s form is rather 
generic, they give you a few guidelines for what you should include in 
the Message text box. Tell them the following:

Reporting Paid Links
Remember that the search engines pay a lot of attention to links when deter-
mining a Web page’s popularity and authority. They look at both the quan-
tity and quality of inbound links to the page and calculate the page’s link 
equity (the value of all inbound links to the page). Link equity plays a big part 
in the search engines’ ranking algorithms. Because a lot of inbound links 
show that a site has “authority” on its subject, it’s a pretty good measure of 
a page’s value to users. Link equity plays a particularly large role in Google’s 
algorithms.

Reporting Paid Links
When Webmasters try to cheat the system by buying and selling links, it vio-
lates Google’s quality guidelines. If sites can artificially raise their PageRank 
score by buying links, their site may get a higher ranking in search results 
than it deserves, which compromises the integrity of Google’s ranking algo-
rithm. Thus we have Google’s declared war against paid links. Google works 
hard to detect and devalue paid links and the pages where they’re found. In 
fact, if Google finds just one paid link on a Web page that appears deceptive, 
it’s likely to ignore all the links on that page. The bottom line is that buying 
links is not a smart way to increase your Google PageRank score.
What if you suspect that one of your competitors has purchased links and 
is ranking higher because of it? You can report them to Google for investiga-
tion. We explain how later in this section. First, however, you need to make 
sure that the competitor really is abusing the system.
 
Reporting paid links is different than reporting spam. It isn’t as clear-cut a 
decision, for one thing. Some people in the Internet marketing industry say 
you should not report paid links at all — they feel that buying and selling 
links are a natural part of Internet commerce, and there shouldn’t be any-
thing unethical about paid links. Others argue that because it violates search 
engine guidelines and manipulates the ranking algorithms, paid links are 
wrong.
The different search engines view paid links differently, too. Although none 
of the major search engines want Webmasters to buy links for the purpose 
of increasing their rankings, only Google has been adamant about it, even 
providing a form for reporting paid links. In interviews, reps for Yahoo! and 
Microsoft Live Search have explained that they’re much more interested 
in how valuable a link is to users than whether it was paid or unpaid. They 
don’t encourage paid links, but they call them a “gray area” and don’t share 
Google’s hard-line policy against them.
 
Keep in mind that your links could be reported to Google, as well. That’s not 
a deciding factor if you don’t have paid links, but if you have any question-
able ones, it might make you think twice about reporting someone else. You 
can see whether anyone’s reported your Web site to Google through your 
Webmaster Tools account. Google courteously notifies you about any viola-
tions that have been reported or found on your site. In fact, if you don’t 
already have a Webmaster Tools account, as soon as you do sign up, you see 
any previous reports or violations, as well.
Before you decide to report a link that you believe is paid, first confirm that 
the link is set up to pass link equity. In other words, you want to see whether 
the site is really trying to get away with something. Otherwise, you could be 
reporting someone who’s not breaking the rules.

702
Reporting Paid Links
You can look at the Web page’s source code by choosing Source or Page 
Source from your browser’s View menu. Find the hyperlink (an A tag) for the 
paid link and see if it includes a rel=”nofollow” attribute. If it does, every-
thing’s above-board — the Web site is not trying to pass link equity through 
that link.
 
To see nofollow links more easily, you can install a free plug-in for the 
Mozilla Firefox browser called Search Status (currently in version 1.27). (The 
Firefox browser itself is available free at http://www.mozilla.com/
en-US/firefox/.) As you look at any Web page, links with a nofollow 
attribute automatically show up highlighted in pink. This is only one of many 
useful SEO features that this plug-in offers, by the way. Here’s how you can 
get and use Search Status:
 
1. In Mozilla Firefox, go to www.quirk.biz/searchstatus/.
 
2. Click the big Download Search Status button, and then scroll down a 
bit and click the Firefox icon. Complete the installation procedure.
 
 After it’s installed, you see some new icons in the lower-right corner of 
your browser window.
 
3. Right-click on the Quirk icon to open the context menu for options 
and select Highlight Nofollow Links.
If the suspicious link doesn’t have a nofollow attribute, it may be report-
able as a paid link. However, the Web site might be blocking a search engine 
spider from following the link in a couple of other ways, and thereby comply-
ing with Google’s guidelines:
When they’re done for advertising purposes, 
rather than to manipulate the search engines, 
Google says paid links are no problem. For 
instance, lots of sites sell space for banner 
ads (graphic ads displayed usually above or in 
the side margins of a Web site that can be 
clicked), and that’s a normal part of commerce 
on the Web.
The important thing is that you’re not 
trying to deceive anyone. According to 
Google (www.google.com/support/
webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=
en&answer=66736), you just need to 
make sure that links purchased for advertising 
are designated as such. You can do this in two 
ways:
 ✓ Add a rel=”nofollow” attribute to the 
hyperlink. This is a bit of HTML code that 
you can insert to tell the search engine spi-
ders not to follow or count the link.
 ✓ Redirect the links to an intermediate page 
that is blocked from search engines within 
the site’s robots text (.txt) file. (A robots text 
file is a file located at the root of a Web site 
that contains instructions for search engine 
spiders. More information on robots.txt 
files can be found in Book VII, Chapter 1.)
Not all paid links are bad

Book X
Chapter 3
Identifying and 
Reporting Spam
703
Reporting Paid Links
 
✦ Robots text file exclusion: Look at the Web site’s robots text (.txt) file 
and see if that page or the page’s directory (the folder where the file is 
saved) has been blocked to search engine spiders. If it has, it’s in com-
pliance with Google guidelines.
 
✦ Meta robots exclusion: Another way the site might have blocked search 
engines is with a noindex or nofollow Meta robots tag on the spe-
cific page. (A Meta robots tag is an HTML command in the head section 
(top part) of a Web page’s HTML code that gives instructions to search 
engine spiders whether to index the page and whether to follow its 
links.) This tag is not needed if they’ve excluded the page in their robots 
text file. But if it’s used, you see it near the top of the page beginning 
with this code:
<META NAME=”ROBOTS” CONTENT=
After you’ve satisfied yourself that the paid link is indeed shady (in other 
words, that it’s trying to pass link equity), you can report it to Google, if you 
choose.
To report paid links to Google, go to www.google.com/webmasters/
tools/paidlinks. Be sure to sign in to your Google account. Then com-
plete the form and click Submit. You can see Google’s form in Figure 3-5.

Reducing the Impact of Click Fraud
Reducing the Impact of Click Fraud
Here’s a scenario you don’t want to be in: You’ve set up a PPC campaign 
with several ads for your classic car customization Web site that show up 
in Google when people search for your PPC keywords. Since the ads are pay 
per click, you’ve set a daily budget of, say, $200, which means that Google 
keeps track of how many times people click your ads and stops displaying 
them when your maximum $200 daily spending limit has been reached.
Now your competitor, Devilish Devin’s Custom Auto, wants your ad cam-
paign to fail and his ads to grab all the traffic. So Devilish Devin (who’s 
obviously unethical) hires some people to do nothing but search for your 
keywords over and over and click your ads each time they come up. None of 
these are converting customers, of course, but their clicks add up. Within a 
short time, your daily budget is reached, and now your ads won’t display for 
the rest of the day.
What we’ve just described is called click fraud. The search engines want to 
protect their advertisers from click fraud, so they examine clicks and credit 
back the invalid ones to the advertiser’s account. They have lots of filters to 
detect invalid activity — they look for patterns such as many clicks coming 
from the same IP address, repetitive or duplicate clicking, and the time of 
the clicks. Because they’ve been pretty successful monitoring and detect-
ing click fraud, it’s far less of a problem today than it was even two or three 
years ago. However, the problem now is that even though the search engines 
will credit back the money into your account, you’re still missing out on all 
of those people that would have seen your ad.
All of the major search engines give you reports and ways to track your PPC 
ads’ effectiveness. You tag your pages with code provided by the search 
engine, and track everyone who comes to your site through a PPC ad — from 
clicking the ad to landing on your site and all the way to exiting. This detail 
gives you a way to analyze clicks on your ads. You can watch for click fraud 
using these analytics, too.
Here are warning signs to look for that may indicate you’re the victim of 
click fraud:
 
✦ Unusual peaks in impressions (number of times your ad shows on a 
search results page)
 
✦ Unusual peaks in the number of clicks
 
✦ No increase in the number of conversions during peaks in impressions 
or clicks

Book X
Chapter 3
Identifying and 
Reporting Spam
705
Reducing the Impact of Click Fraud
 
✦ Drop in the number of page views (how many pages were visited per 
visitor) during peaks in impressions or clicks
 
✦ Higher bounce rate (number of people clicking your ad and then quickly 
going back to the search results page) during peaks in impressions or 
clicks
When you detect a pattern that may indicate click fraud, you should report 
your findings to Google AdWords, Yahoo! Search Marketing, or to whichever 
search engine is running your PPC ads. It’s possible that they’ve already 
identified the same behavior and credited your account for those clicks. 
However, if they haven’t, they can analyze their data to determine if it is 
indeed fraud, and will usually credit your account if they find that it is.
It’s worth the extra effort to watch for unusual patterns in your PPC ana-
lytics. Even if you’re only getting a few more clicks than your average at 
a certain regular time of day, you might notice that you’re not seeing any 
accompanying increase in conversions, which could be due to malicious 
intent. You might not think that there is any click fraud involved, but if each 
of those clicks costs more than $20, the cost can add up quickly. It can even 
deplete your daily ad campaign budget. A little diligence to protect yourself 
from click fraud pays off.

✓ Choosing a conference: small or big
✓ Getting the most out of conference networking
✓ Picking the right training courses
✓ Finding professional training
✓ Doing it yourself
T
hroughout this book, we walk you through the basics (and the not-so-
basics) of search engine optimization (SEO). However, there are plenty 
of opportunities out there for taking your SEO education even further. One 
of the best ways you can do this is through training.
You can go about achieving further training in one of several ways. You 
can attend Internet marketing industry conferences like Search Engine 
Strategies, Search Marketing Expo, PubCon, or ad:tech. You can sign up 
for individual training courses, attend a training session, or have someone 
come out to help train you and your staff. There are courses for those who 
are seriously invested in SEO, and options for people who are just beginning 
to dabble. If you’re wondering what to do in order to get further SEO train-
ing, not to worry; we’ve got you covered in this appendix.
Making the Most of Industry Conferences
In 1999, the first Search Engine Strategy (SES) show was launched to give 
search marketers a crash course in search engine optimization and getting 
listed in the search engines. It was a fairly small and intimate gathering. But 
as Internet marketing and search engine optimization became viable tactics, 
this conference began to grow, with other large search conferences spring-
ing up as well.
These conferences offered introductory sessions on a broad range of topics 
and let search marketers pick the sessions they thought were most impor-
tant. These days, search marketers have lots of choices when it comes to 
which search marketing conference to attend. No matter what, the first rule 
is bring a lot of business cards with you. You won’t be sorry!

708
Making the Most of Industry Conferences
First off, you have the mainstays such as
 
✦ Search Engine Strategies (SES): This one happens all over the place, 
including San Jose, New York, Chicago, London, and other cities. SES is 
purely about Internet marketing, and, of the larger conventions, it’s the 
one most specialized towards search marketing. Specialized content can 
be found at SES’s smaller shows like SES Latino. More information can 
be found at their Web site, www.searchenginestrategies.com/.
 
✦ Search Marketing Expo (SMX): SMX is similar to SES, but still fairly new, 
so it’s one of the smaller shows. This is a show geared towards search 
engine marketing and boasts a host of both major conferences (SMX East 
in New York and SMX West in Santa Clara, CA, among others) as well as 
smaller niche conferences targeted at specific topics (Local, Social Media, 
and so on). Their Web site is www.searchmarketingexpo.com/.
 
✦ WebmasterWorld PubCon: PubCon is a large conference designed to 
meet the needs of Webmasters. Topics tend to be in a wider range than 
SES or SMX, but it’s still a niche show. This is where you go to find more 
information on the running of a Web site. The real gold of PubCon is 
PubCon Classic, a networking event held on the last day where all the 
real value is found. More information on these guys can be found at 
www.pubcon.com/.
 
✦ ad:tech: This large show also has conferences worldwide, with shows 
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, London, Shanghai, Sydney, 
Hamburg, Paris, and Singapore. Their draw includes company execu-
tives from many major corporations. ad:tech is about Internet mar-
keting as a whole, so it goes beyond just search engines or social 
networks. They incorporate a little bit of everything and focus on 
branding, marketing, and promotion. Search engine–specific marketing 
is definitely in the minority here and that little bit usually focuses on 
the PPC side of things when it’s discussed at all. The conference often 
has no sessions discussing SEO specifically. More information can be 
found at www.ad-tech.com/.
Besides those stalwarts are some new, smaller niche shows. These shows 
allow search marketers to network with a targeted group of their peers and 
dive into topics on a much more advanced level. Some of the more popular 
niche shows and educational opportunities include
 
✦ SEMpdx: These Portland-based mini-conferences happen fairly often. 
These guys are also geared towards search engine marketing specifi-
cally. If you’re in the Pacific Northwest, they might be worth checking 
out (www.sempdx.org/).

709
Making the Most of Industry Conferences
 
✦ Small Business Marketing Unleashed: Unlike a lot of conferences, where 
a panel is four speakers that all go over the same topic, SBMU gives the 
stage to one expert who explains her topic to a small audience. This con-
ference covers online marketing (http://unleashed.smallbusiness
answers.com/2008/columbus/index.php).
 
✦ Elite Retreat: A very small convention of about 35, this event happens 
once a year. When they say “elite,” they mean it. They focus on one-
on-one techniques and on search engine marketing. More information, 
costs, and scheduling can be found at their Web site (www.elite
retreat.info/).
Smaller, focused events might be the way to go if you’re considering SEO 
as a career. They give you more opportunity for networking than the larger 
shows, but all of the shows strive to provide education and knowledge 
transfer.
Small versus large conferences
One advantage of a large conference is that there’s something for everyone. 
They offer so many panels and sessions and information tracks that the 
hardest part can be choosing which session to attend. If you are just starting 
out in SEO, attend a big conference so you can get exposure to a wide variety 
of disciplines. Internet marketing comes from discovering how to combine 
several disciplines for maximum efficiency. The more tools you have in your 
toolbox, the better: When all you have in your toolbox is a hammer, every 
problem looks like a nail. Search engine marketers can learn from Google, 
whereas the social media marketers can go hang out with the people from 
Digg. On-demand marketers can go to TiVo. Brand managers know which ad 
networks are going to pay off big. A marketer should be able to find a way 
to use all of these elements in order to make their whole media campaign a 
success. Large conferences afford you the opportunity to sample each of the 
disciplines and add more ammo to your search marketing arsenal.
 
Keep in mind that there’s more to Internet marketing than search engine 
optimization. At one conference, for example, attendees choose from panels 
on pay per click, Web analytics, and mobile marketing, in addition to search 
engine optimization. Even traditional media like television and print have 
panel discussions devoted to them, especially in terms of digital advertising.
At a large conference, instead of 15 speakers, you have the chance to 
hear 50. Speakers at big conferences are guaranteed to expose you to new 
thoughts and ideas that have probably never occurred to you before. These 
conferences afford you the opportunity to incorporate the best parts of their 
teachings into your new strategy.

710
Making the Most of Industry Conferences
But if you’re looking to establish real connections, you want to pay close 
attention to the small conference circuit. When you’re in a room with 1,000 
people, it’s hard to actually talk to anyone. You’re left looking up at the 
speakers on the stage, which, although informative, isn’t exactly an optimal 
environment for learning, sharing, or networking.
At the smaller shows, it’s different. The small group setting creates an envi-
ronment where attendees aren’t afraid to start up a conversation with the 
speaker. The benefit of smaller shows is that everyone is able to meet up at 
a central location after the sessions have ended and take part in the under-
standing that comes with sharing war stories with your peers and partaking 
in meaningful conversation. You can really find out what those around you 
do for a living, where they work, what their specialty is, what they hope to 
get out of the show, and more. Networking is about establishing relation-
ships, and that’s always best done in an intimate setting.
Another thing about smaller shows is that they give you a unique opportu-
nity to get up close and personal with the speakers. In smaller shows, you 
get direct access to panelists during the sessions, lots of time to ask ques-
tions, and ample opportunity to hunt someone down during lunch or after 
hours for a quick chat. This is a key advantage for search marketers, espe-
cially those looking to expand their repertoire of SEO knowledge. What’s 
also great about one-on-one time with the speakers is that they remember 
you later, so they might be willing to lend you a hand down the road. At a 
large conference, getting face time with your favorite speaker can be nearly 
impossible.
These smaller shows are also very topic-centric, focusing on smaller, niche 
aspects of search engine optimization and search engine marketing. Topic-
centric shows help to spice up the speaker pool and ensure that attendees 
are always seeing something they have never seen before. For that reason, 
you want to carefully read a show’s description before deciding to attend to 
make sure it lines up with what you’re hoping to learn.
 
But although you might see the rising new voices at a niche conference, for 
the big names in SEO, you might want to lean toward the big conferences. 
Big conferences can afford to bring in the big-name panelists. Not only do 
you recognize the names of the speakers, but all the big companies know 
that they’ll find an audience there. They know that at a big conference, they 
have the opportunity to reach thousands of people, which makes it worth 
their while to participate.
In the final balance, big or small, going to conferences can be a valuable 
investment of time and money for you and your company. Whether you’re 
just starting out in SEO, needing help with your Web site, or looking for new 
ideas as an SEO veteran, you’re bound to get something out of your confer-
ence experience.

Making the Most of Industry Conferences
Networking effectively at conferences
SEO industry conferences are generally considered a must if you want to get 
anywhere with your brand and your site, mostly for conference networking. 
Networking is how you get clients, make contacts, and expand your sphere 
of influence. However, if you’re a first-timer or somewhat introverted, it 
could be a little like your first day at a new school when you were a kid. The 
only difference is that, unlike back in grade school, you just spent a consid-
erable amount of money to feel horribly uncomfortable.
At a conference, you have lots of opportunities to make new connections. 
In your day-to-day existence, chances are you won’t run into anything like 
the variety of people that show up for a large conference. Marketers, C-level 
execs, reporters, and programmers — they all come to the big conferences 
to meet and greet.
 
You can’t just hang around on the edges of things during conference time. 
That kind of thing hurts not only your personal brand, but the brand of your 
company as well. So when you’re attending a conference, you have to put on 
your game face and master the tricks of making connections with ease.
Strategy 1: Show up prepared
One of the most effective ways to calm pre-show nerves is to show up pre-
pared. Optimize your schedule by taking a look at the conference agenda 
a few days prior to the show and marking down everything you want to 
attend. Take care to check who’s speaking at which sessions, and consider 
whether you can benefit from a meet-and-greet. Create a list of everything 
you want to do and everyone you want to meet while you’re at the confer-
ence. This helps keep you on track in the midst of all the craziness and 
serves as motivation to get everything on your list covered.
 
Conferences are something of an endurance test, especially if you’ve never 
been to one before. Be prepared for the inevitable head explosion that hits 
near the end of the first day. This is why keeping a conference “scorecard” 
listing the names of all of the people you want to meet goes a long way in 
making sure you leave that conference feeling like you’ve accomplished 
something.
If there are certain people you want to meet, research them so you have 
something to talk to them about. Knowing your industry experts and what 
they specialize in (and what buttons to push) is always a good plan. Striking 
up a conversation is often as easy as knowing what to talk about.
Strategy 2: Start branding yourself before you get there
It’s a lot easier to introduce yourself face-to-face when you have an estab-
lished brand you can lean on. A few weeks before conference time, start 
reaching out on the social networks and let people know you’ll be there. Use 

712
Making the Most of Industry Conferences
Twitter. Join that conference’s Event page on Facebook. If there is no official 
Event page on Facebook, create one. Make plans to meet up with people 
beforehand. Who can help you promote your company and your goals the 
most? Find out who they are before you go. These are the folks you want to 
score some face time with.
Use the lead-up time to start talking about the projects you’re working on 
and generate some buzz. If you’re going to be releasing a new blogging 
widget, plan the release date around the conference. Have something you 
can plug or a lead-in to a conversation. It’s always best to have something to 
say before you start a cold conversation.
Strategy 3: Use the buddy system
One of the best ways to network and work a room is to attach yourself to 
someone who is an extrovert. Extroverts love meeting new people and love 
to walk you around and introduce you to everyone they know. It’s perfect: 
You get to meet everyone in the room without ever having to actually intro-
duce yourself. And if you’ve already established a brand for yourself before-
hand, folks are excited to meet you and immediately bring you into the 
conversation.
 
Do beware when using the buddy system, though. Sticking with an extrovert 
is different than simply huddling in a corner with another nervous soul. 
Unless you have been surgically attached to the friend that dared come with 
you, you do not have to stand by their side the entire night. As comforting 
and warm and fuzzy as it feels, you want to avoid this at all costs. Doing so is 
a great way to ensure that you only speak to each other or to those you both 
know without ever meeting anyone new. The whole idea of networking is to 
get yourself out there and meet people who you think can help you out, and 
vice versa. Step outside the box and take a chance on someone new.
Strategy 4: Have a gimmick
Regulars in the search engine optimization community have seen all kinds of 
unique attention-grabbing attempts on the conference grounds including dis-
tinctive clothing — bright yellow shoes for one marketer, bright orange suits 
for another — and various forms of pretexts for getting photos (here, try on 
my silly hat so I can take a picture of you). These are all attention-getting 
gimmicks at conferences. Think of it as in-person link bait. It’s all about grab-
bing people and striking up a conversation. Having a gimmick makes it easier 
for you to approach people and harder for them to ignore you.
If you were attending a networking event and a smiling face approached you 
and asked you to pose for a photo holding a potato, you’d do it, right? And 
after you agree, you open up the door for that person to hold a conversation 

713
Picking the Right Training Courses
with you and explain why you need to randomly have your photograph taken 
with a tuber. You’ll also definitely remember them when you spot them walk-
ing around the conference hall. That’s the power of having a gimmick.
However, do be careful when using the gimmick technique: There’s a fine 
line between being funny and being annoying. Opt for something quirky and 
unobtrusive like a T-shirt for something that promotes a cause benefitting 
someone other than yourself, like a charity. Above all, keep in mind that if 
you think it might be offensive and obnoxious, it probably is, so don’t do it.
Strategy 5: Don’t use a gimmick
As effective as the gimmicks above can be, people sometimes grow tired of 
them. Your best bet is to be genuine and yourself. Sometimes a firm hand 
shake and a warm smile is all you need to forge a real connection with 
someone.
 
The worst thing you can do is leave a conference with regrets. Meeting 
people and sharing work and life war stories are too valuable to pass up. 
When you meet someone at a conference, it’s safe to say you have similar 
interests and are involved in the same industry. Strike up a conversation 
with that as your jumping-off point. When it comes to conference network-
ing, there’s no room for shyness. Be confident and willing to bust out of 
your shell.
Picking the Right Training Courses
A wide variety of training options are available for search engine optimiza-
tion. But in picking the right courses for you, what should you be looking 
for? Ask yourself what you think you and your company need from the 
training. Is it enough to just learn the basics or should there be more to it 
than that? Should these classes convey search engine philosophy as well as 
techniques for optimization? Should these classes be setting standards and 
testing the knowledge you gain during them?
Well, yes. These are some of the things you should be able to take away from 
a good training course:
 
✦ Fundamentals: Any course that you take should give you a good ground-
ing in the history and understanding of search engine optimization. It 
should discuss terminology, ranking factors, and all the components 
that make up a search engine-friendly Web page. You should leave the 
class with a clear understanding of the basic methods of SEO.
 
✦ Philosophy: Any course you take should be upfront about its approach 
to search engine optimization. The reasoning behind the course’s meth-
ods should be clearly defined.

714
Picking the Right Training Courses
 
✦ Ethics: Any course should have a stated commitment to ethical (white 
hat) SEO. Both the industry and individuals benefit the most from ethics 
and good conduct, and these courses should require the same from 
their students.
 
✦ Something to hang on your wall: This might seem frivolous, but having 
something physical to take away from any course is about more than just 
a pretty piece of paper. Certification from a respected authority serves as 
a reinforcement of the values and techniques reported in the class.
Beyond just making you better at SEO, better training courses raise the bar 
for all players. If you learn (and pass on) good solid techniques that adhere 
to ethical standards, everyone benefits. Where once few courses were avail-
able, a wide variety of choices is now available, and the hard part is finding 
the best one.
So which is the right training course for you? There are three basic options 
out there. Remote training, in-person destination training, and on-site train-
ing. We cover all three in the upcoming sections.
Training remotely
Remote training is usually done over the phone, online, by e-mail, or through 
video lessons. Remote training is the most convenient of your training 
options, allowing you to do it from your home or office. It’s also one of the 
cheapest methods. The price on this kind of training varies wildly and runs 
from $250 to $3,000 per package, depending on the method, difficulty level, 
and length of the program. A few high-quality advanced search engine opti-
mization courses are offered through remote training. But most of the pro-
grams available remotely are best for beginners who need to learn the most 
basic SEO methodology and techniques.
Remote training works via video and online programs. These have the added 
benefit of allowing students to move at their own pace. Be aware that stu-
dents can’t receive lessons faster than the program schedule dictates, so 
those trainees that are a little more advanced than their peers might get a 
little impatient with the pace of the courses. Attendees also have limited 
opportunities to ask questions of instructors. To alleviate this problem, 
some of these remote programs host private discussion groups. With remote 
training, you also have less chance to personalize the training to your own 
Web site’s needs as compared to in-person and on-site SEO training courses.
One remote location training service is the SEMPO Institute, located at www.
sempoinstitute.com/:
 
✦ Subject matter: Several basic and advanced search engine marketing 
training courses includes Insider’s Guide to SEM, Advanced SEO, and 
Advanced Search Advertising.

Advertising teaches search advertising and auction media models, writ-
ing effective ad copy, bidding strategy, tracking ROI metrics, differences 
among PPC programs of major search engines, click fraud and proper 
use, and integrating PPC into advertising and branding campaigns.
Another remote training course is through Internet Marketing Ninjas at www.
Internetmarketingninjas.com/:

ditional media and online marketing for maximum rewards, effective site

lyze your site against your competitors’ sites. Lessons cover advanced 
topics.
Training around the country
For those who want face-to-face basic and advanced search engine mar-
keting (SEM) and SEO training courses, several are available across the 
U.S. These courses usually cost anywhere from $750 to $2,000 per person, 
depending on their length and comprehensiveness. These courses are rela-
tively cost-efficient, after you factor in travel expenses.
Location-based training provides opportunities to ask questions specific 
to your Web site, making it an opportunity for practical learning. In-person 
training addresses those who learn by visual and audio aids, as well as by 
application, as opposed to those who learn purely through visual means. 
Many courses include lab time for attendees to use SEO tools, sometimes 
included with the training package, on their own domain with the instructor 
available for help or suggestions.

Training on-site
On-site SEO training is the most expensive of all training methods, but it’s 
also the most personalized method. On-site SEO training can be specifically 
tailored to your site and your company’s SEO and search engine market-
ing needs. On-site training can usually run you $150 to $500 an hour, with 
minimum time or minimum participant requirements. In order to get the 
most out of on-site training, come up with a list of expectations for your SEO 
campaign before consulting with several of these training companies to see 
what type of topics they cover. On-site training is the most useful for com-
panies planning on training many employees and performing all of their SEO 

717

From basic to advanced lessons offered at your desk or at your door, SEO 
training comes in all shapes, sizes, and price tags. It’s important to realize 
how training can be helpful and then to choose the training method that 
best fits your needs.
Training for Professionals
When we talk about professionals, we mean people who already know more 
than a beginner’s course of SEO and want to expand their general knowledge 
and expertise. This section is for people who take SEO very seriously and 
want to be on par with the experts in the field. In general, these are people 
making a living at providing SEO as a service.
Attending conventions
If you’re a business person just getting your arms around search, in the 
big spender category, or are looking for a way to immerse yourself into the 
search engine optimization field, the bigger, more general trade shows may 
work for you. These are the giant conventions like ad:tech or PubCon. But 
at some point, you will want more than just the broad topics these conven-
tions cover. You eventually reach a point where you need to become a true 
expert in your craft. At that point, you must start networking with those who 
can help you meet your goals. When you get to that level, you find that the 
smaller, niche shows provide far more value. They’re more approachable 
and provide a far better networking and educational environment.
Broad Internet marketing training may have had value when the industry 
was less competitive, but in order to compete today as an SEO, you have to 
know your stuff inside and out. In other words, you have to go beyond the 
introductory courses offered at the large shows. This is another area where 
small, topic-focused shows thrive because they strip away that introductory-
level material and get into the meat of the issues. Larger shows like ad:tech 
and SES simply can’t do this because they’re forced to cater to a beginner 
audience.

719
Training for Professionals
 
If you’re looking to build your industry knowledge and expertise, seek out 
the small shows that emphasize the aspects that you want to dive into. 
Maybe you want to advance your branding techniques, or dive further into 
networking via social media. The smaller shows are the ones that are going 
to really benefit you.
The sessions at the smaller, niche conferences are taught by the field 
experts. They are there to teach you real-life tactics, strategies, and meth-
odologies so that you can go back and use what you have learned. Not only 
does this help you build your own set of SEO tools, but it also sets you up on 
your way to becoming experts in a specialized field. This makes you invalu-
able in your home office and in the industry as well. You can gain fame by 
making yourself a noted expert in a singular field. As the industry matures, 
it’s less about knowing a little bit about everything and more about becom-
ing a specialist.
At these shows, you get speakers who can deliver success stories and anec-
dotes of failure, who can test a theory because they weren’t constrained by 
budgets, and who are willing to tell you what happened because they’re not 
afraid that it’ll be revealing something. Learning from those who have gone 
before is a time-honored way to increase your knowledge and gain inspiration.
Getting advanced training
Another way to further your advanced SEO knowledge is to attend advanced 
training courses. Both SEMPO and we here at Bruce Clay, Inc. offer 
advanced training courses. With advanced training, you go beyond the 
basics of search engine optimization (like finding out what a Meta tag is, for 
example) and really delve deep into the ins and outs of doing search engine 
optimization for you and your company. With advanced training, you find 
out more about how to read your competition and analyze your site, which 
means you can tell whether or not the changes you made to your site are 
actually working. This involves knowing what converts, and what ranks, and 
what draws in traffic. Seeing the complete picture is a must if you want to 
continue to work in search engine optimization.

Training for Professionals
Following trusted authorities
If you are looking to specialize in SEO, start following trusted authorities 
in the SEO field. Authorities can be individuals, companies, or Web sites, 
but what they have in common is that they’re respected and they typically 
deliver solid, reliable information.
Several news stream sites out there are geared towards search engine optimi-
zation. These Web sites keep up with the latest SEO news and statistics, and 
are always a bastion of good helpful information. (And sometimes some not-
so-helpful information, so be discerning.) Some good sites to start with are
 
✦ Search Engine Land (http://searchengineland.com/): A great 
resource, Search Engine Land is a search marketing industry news site. 
Here you can learn the latest news out of Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft 
Live Search, among others. It’s run by the same company that runs SMX, 
which is one of the larger SEO conferences, and therefore it’s a pretty 
trustworthy site.
 
✦ Sphinn (www.sphinn.com): This is the Internet marketing social news 
site — the Internet marketing version of Digg. If you see an SEO story 
that you feel is newsworthy, you can click on the Sphinn chiclet and vote 
it up.
 
✦ Google Reader (www.google.com/reader): This is an important tool 
that helps you keep up with all the latest SEO news (and all your other 
subscription feeds). This allows you to read RSS feeds you’ve sub-
scribed to, including those related to Internet marketing, all in one con-
venient place. 
 
✦ Search Engine Roundtable (www.seroundtable.com/): This is a 
forum-based news site. This site will bring you all the latest news from 
the forums, so they catch stuff that other news sites might miss.
Performing experiments
By “performing experiments,” we don’t mean you get to play Mr. Mad 
Scientist with your company’s Web site. For one thing, randomly changing 
things here and there on the site can lead to a decrease in the site’s rank-
ings, a drop in conversions, and the loss of your job. But it is important to 
learn how to test the changes you make to the site in order for you to gain 
rankings, traffic, and your ultimate goal, more conversions.
Learning SEO requires doing SEO because it’s often a matter of trial and 
error. It’s challenging because the environment constantly changes (both 
competitors and search engine algorithms alike). Proper SEO takes time, 
diligence, and patience. Getting accurate test results is a matter of months, 
not hours or days. You have to be willing to work and have the patience 
to watch your experiments to make sure that things are going the way you 
want them to.

721
Getting Things Done for Do-It-Yourselfers
On the flip side, you also can’t be afraid to continue to tweak things if your 
tests aren’t getting you the results that you want. Run several tests instead 
of just one or two. Change one thing at a time. And if you get bad results, 
don’t be afraid to change it back!
 
If you can’t experiment on your own site, consider building another site up 
just for the purposes of testing. Tinkering, playing, and all-around messing 
with your site is the only way of really being sure you know that what you’re 
doing works. Take chances and see if they pay off. Like gambling, don’t bet 
what you can’t afford to lose, but make sure that you’re investing enough to 
make it all pay off in the end.
Getting Things Done for Do-It-Yourselfers
We’ve covered what to do if you want to wade into the professional world of 
search engine optimization. But what do you do if you’re a do-it-yourselfer 
just trying to make your Web site succeed? Say you have your own classic 
car customization Web site and you and your brother are the company. 
Because your brother can’t use a computer to save his life, the burden of 
running and maintaining your company’s Web site falls on you. So what can 
you do in terms of optimizing your own Web site? A few things, actually.
Training
Most training courses out there are aimed at the beginners. Take some time 
out or make an investment in some basic training for search engine optimiza-
tion. They’re worth the time and effort, so go do some research into what’s 
right for you. We listed plenty of beginner training options earlier in this 
appendix. Focus on the ones that offer face time with a real expert and offer 
some kind of tangible metric for success.
Testing, testing, testing!
Like we said in the section about professional SEO, testing is one of the 
most important things you should do. Test your site to make sure anything 
you’ve done to it, from tweaking your keywords to adding more Engagement 
Objects, is actually working the way you want it to.
This might seem like common sense, but some people think that they can 
just make changes across the board and see returns immediately. Your site 
is one of a million sites, and being a top ranked site takes time and effort, nei-
ther of which allow immediate results. Unfortunately, SEO is a process that 
requires time and fine-tuning, so if you’ve added new keywords to your site, 
watch them! Study your rankings and your server logs to see if traffic has gone 
up since you made the changes. Check and see if this increased traffic has 
equaled conversions for you, or if the extra site visitors simply arrived at your 
front page and then immediately clicked the Back button to navigate away.

722
Getting Things Done for Do-It-Yourselfers
 
Drawing traffic to your site is just one part of the process. You have to make 
money. If no one is coming to your site and asking you to customize a classic 
car for them, you need to do further tweaking to your site.
Networking
Another important thing you can do is network. Start engaging other people 
who know and work in SEO. Hang around the forums that discuss SEO and 
start checking these people out on Twitter. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or 
guidance if you’re not quite sure what you’re doing. But be aware that some 
advice should be taken with a grain of salt. Always be sure to test out the 
advice you get before accepting it as the gospel truth.
Go to conferences. Budget and take some time off to attend one of the larger 
SEO trade shows like SES, SMX, PubCon, or ad:tech. These are good places 
to get your feet wet and get a little bit of networking in. Make a list of things 
you feel you need help on and then reorder your schedule so that you can 
attend. Don’t be afraid to talk to people; no one was born an expert in search 
engine optimization. They all once started out where you are. Ask questions 
if you’re lost and take plenty of notes! You can always learn stuff, and you 
should do your best sponge impersonation and soak up as much information 
as you can.
 
Be discerning about the information that you gather. SEO is not an exact sci-
ence, so you get conflicting reports on what to do and what not to do.
Also, start looking at newsletters from reputable sources. Ask around and do 
your research to find these sources. You can start with free newsletters from 
these places:

Knowing when to call in the experts
Unfortunately, almost inevitably in the course of your SEM campaign, you 
will run into problems with your SEO that are beyond your scope of train-
ing and expertise. Find a mentor: someone who can help you out and guide 
you through the tricky world of search engine optimization. Make sure that 
they’re someone you can trust, and that they’re a respected authority in 
their own right. Meeting someone like this is why it’s important for you to 
start checking out search marketing forums and Twitter feeds and attending 
conferences.
Don’t be afraid to ask for assistance. Call in a professional consultant if you 
need help. But remember: You must at least be familiar with the technical 
side of your Web site and your SEO; that way, you can tell if your consultant 
is taking you for a ride or giving you good advice.
